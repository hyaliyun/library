Recognized as a talented and versatile artist during a career that spanned the first three decades of the twentieth century, she studied with several noted artists, such as William Merritt Chase, John Henry Twachtman, Kenyon Cox, William Forsyth, Otto Stark, Charles Webster Hawthorne, Cecilia Beaux, and Harriet Whitney Frishmuth. Taggart, who was especially known for her portraiture, received the John Herron Art Institute's J. Irving Holcomb Prize in 1922, the Hoosier Salon's Merit Award for figure composition in 1925, and the Hoosier Salon's Merit Award in 1926 for best picture painted by a woman. Her work is represented in the collections of the Indianapolis Museum of Art. Taggart sold her art and exhibited at a number of prestigious shows in the Midwest and eastern United States that included the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, the Society of Western Artists exhibitions, the Grand Central Art Galleries, the National Association of Women Painters and Sculptors, Hoosier Salon exhibitions, and at the John Herron Art Institute. Taggart abandoned her life as a practicing East Coast artist in 1929 and returned to Indianapolis, where she taught painting and portraiture at the Herron Art Institute (1931–34) and served on its board of directors (1915–58). Taggart had a wide circle of friends and acquaintances that included leading artists, authors, and politicians of her era. She was also active in numerous art, civic, and cultural organizations in Indiana and the eastern United States. Early life and family Lucy Martha Taggart, born on March 7, 1880, in Indianapolis, Indiana, was the second of Thomas and Eva Dora (Bryant) Taggart's six children. She was named after her mother's aunt, Lucy Viola Inscho Bryant, and her father's mother, Martha Kingsbury Taggart.Fadely, p. 16. Lucy grew up in Indianapolis as a member of a socially and politically prominent family.Newton and Weiss, p. 244. Her father, Thomas Taggart, is considered the \\"undisputed boss of the Democratic machine for the first quarter of the twentieth century.\\"Fadely, \\"Subtle Grace, Radiant Color,\\" pp. 16–18. He served three terms as the mayor of Indianapolis (1895–1901), as chairman of the Democratic National Committee (1904–1908), and was appointed as a U.S. Senator in 1916, but lost the seat that autumn in a special election.Taggart's father, a Democrat, was elected as Marion County auditor in 1886 and 1890, became county chairman of his party, and served three terms as the mayor of Indianapolis (1895–1901). After serving as chairman of the Democratic National Committee (1904–08), he was appointed to fill Indiana's vacant seat in the U.S. Senate in 1916, after the death of Senator Benjamin F. Shively, but lost a special election in the fall to Republican James E. Watson. Taggart also lost his challenge to regain the U.S. Senate seat from Watson in 1920. His business interests included hotels in Indianapolis and the French Lick Springs Hotel, a spa resort in Orange County, Indiana. See Fadely, \\"Subtle Grace, Radiant Color,\\" pp. 16, 18. At the time of Lucy's birth, her father was working as a clerk for the N. and G. Ohmer Company's dining hall at Indianapolis's Union Depot. He had immigrated to the United States from Ireland with his parents in 1861 at the age of five and grew up in Xenia, Ohio. Thomas moved to Garrett, Indiana, in 1875 to manage DeKalb House, a depot hotel, and relocated to Indianapolis in 1877. He married Eva Bryant, whom he met at Garrett, in 1878. While living in Indianapolis, Thomas became a successful Indiana politician and hotelier, whose business interests included hotels in Indianapolis and the French Lick Springs Hotel, a renowned mineral spa resort in Orange County, Indiana. Lucy's siblings included four sisters: Florence Eva (born 1878), Nora (born 1881), Irene Mary (born 1883), and Emily Letitia (born 1888); and one brother, Thomas Douglas (born 1886). Lucy never married and remained close to her family throughout her life.Fadely, \\"Subtle Grace, Radiant Color,\\" pp. 16, 19. Education Taggart developed her artistic talent from childhood and also learned to play the violin. She graduated from May Wright Sewall's Girls' Classical School in Indianapolis. In 1898, when her father was beginning his third term as mayor of Indianapolis, she began her first year at Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts.Fadely, \\"Subtle Grace, Radiant Color,\\" p. 18.Newton and Weiss, p. 332. After the death of her older sister, Florence, from a yachting accident in the Gulf of Mexico in 1899, Lucy returned to Indianapolis and became First Daughter of the Indianapolis mayor. In the autumn of 1899 Taggart did not return to college. Instead, the nineteen-year-old moved to New York City to study art. Taggart lived in an apartment on Upper West Side and studied at the Chase Art School with William Merritt Chase, a fellow Hoosier who had been living and working in the city since 1878. She also studied at the Art Students League of New York from 1899 to 1900, where her instructors included John Henry Twachtman, Kenyon Cox, and Walter Appleton Clark.Newton and Weiss, pp. 244–45, 332. In addition, Taggart studied with \\"some of the nation's most able artists.\\"Newton and Weiss, p. 245. She was among the early students enrolled at the John Herron Art Institute in Indianapolis, where her instructors were William Forsyth and Otto Stark, two of the noted Hoosier Group of painters. At Herron, Taggart attended Forsyth's daytime class in 1906–07, a summer class in 1907, and in the 1908–09 academic year. She also studied with East Coast artists Charles Webster Hawthorne, Cecilia Beaux, and sculptor Harriet Whitney Frishmuth, who became her mentors. Career Taggart launched her art career in New York City, where she maintained a studio apartment. She also had a third-floor apartment and art studio at her parents' home at 1331 North Delaware Street in IndianapolisTaggart helped with the design of her family's Indianapolis home, built in 1913. The home included a Georgian Colonial exterior and an Italian-style interior. It was selected as one of House Beautiful's three best homes in Indianapolis in 1920. See Fadely, \\"Subtle Grace, Radiant Color,\\" p. 19. and an art studio at Amyvale, the summer home her parents built in 1915–16 at Hyannis Port, Massachusetts.In 1928 Joseph P. and Rose Kennedy acquired property adjacent to the Taggarts' Hyannis Port home to establish the Kennedy compound of summer homes. The Taggarts' Hyannis Port home was sold after Lucy's mother died in 1937. See Fadely, \\"Subtle Grace, Radiant Color,\\" pp. 19, 23. Taggart also kept a studio at her brother's home, called Mount Airie, near French Lick, Indiana, about two miles from the family's French Lick Springs Hotel.Taggart inherited her brother's home in French Lick, Indiana, following his death in 1949. See Fadely, \\"Subtle Grace, Radiant Color,\\" pp. 19, 23. In 1919 Taggart's father distributed \\"the bulk of his fortune\\" to his wife, Eva, and their five children. His generosity provided Lucy with the financial resources to build a substantial summer home of her own. In 1922 and 1924 Taggart leased the estate home of Cecilia Beaux in Gloucester, Massachusetts, before deciding to build a home and studio on harbor-front property in Eastern Point, Massachusetts.Newton and Weiss, pp. 245, 247. Taggart's new home, named Tower of the Four Winds, was completed in 1929. It was designed by Boston architect Ralph Adams Cram in the French farmhouse style; Henry Davis Sleeper designed its interior.Fadely, \\"Subtle Grace, Radiant Color,\\" pp. 19–20. Taggart sold her art and exhibited at a number of prestigious shows in the midwestern and eastern United States throughout the first three decades of the twentieth century. Venues included the Indiana Building at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition in Saint Louis (1904), the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts in Philadelphia (1910 and 1912), at annual exhibitions of the Society of Western Artists in Chicago, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Detroit, Indianapolis, and Saint Louis, the Grand Central Art Galleries in New York (1923), the National Association of Women Painters and Sculptors in New York (1922 and 1936) and in Indianapolis (1923 and 1926), Hoosier Salon exhibitions in Chicago (1925–27, 1929, and 1931), and several exhibitions at the John Herron Art Institute in Indianapolis. In addition, a September landscape by Taggart appeared on the cover of McClure's magazine in 1905. She also arranged exhibitions, including one held in 1929 at her father's French Lick Springs Hotel that included thirty-eight American sculptors. (About a dozen sculptures created by sculptor Harriett Frishmuth, her friend and mentor, were included in the exhibition.)Fadely, \\"Subtle Grace, Radiant Color,\\" pp. 19, 21. Between 1925 and 1931 Taggart was a five-time exhibitor in the Hoosier Salon, a juried show that featured the work of Indiana artists. The annual exhibition was held during this period at the Marshall Field and Company's Picture Galleries in Chicago. Taggart's exhibited works included Still Life and Eleanor (1925), Carnival (1926), Summer (1927), Young Girl in Green (1929), and Janet (1931). Eleanor won the Hoosier Salon's Merit Award for figure composition in 1925; Carnival won a Merit Award in 1926 for best picture painted by a woman.Fadely, \\"Subtle Grace, Radiant Color,\\" pp. 18–19. In 1929, the year that her father and sister-in-law died, Taggart abandoned her life as a practicing artist on the East Coast, returned to Indianapolis to care for her mother and the Taggart family home, and became an art teacher. Taggart taught painting and portraiture at the John Herron Art Institute from 1931 to 1934, although her involvement with the Institute began in 1915, when she was elected to the first of several terms as a member of its board of directors. She continued to serve on the board until 1958.Fadely, \\"Subtle Grace, Radiant Color,\\" p. 24.Newton and Weiss, p. 247. Taggart donated her time as a faculty member at the school without compensation. She also served on the school's arts committee, helped raise funds, attracted publicity to the school, and donated artwork. As the daughter of an influential Indiana politician and a practicing artist in Indiana and the East Coast, Taggart had a wide circle of friends and acquaintances. Because of her family's political connections, Taggart was acquainted with many Hoosier politicians, including U.S. Vice President Thomas R. Marshall, Indiana governors and U.S. Senators such as Samuel M. Ralston, John W. Kern, and Paul V. McNutt, as well as McNutt's wife, Kathleen. Taggart was also a friend of A. Piatt Andrew, a U.S. Congressman from Massachusetts. At the dedication ceremony for the George Rogers Clark Memorial in Vincennes, Indiana, in 1936, she met Franklin D. Roosevelt and Eleanor Roosevelt. Vice President Harry S. Truman visited French Lick just prior to becoming president. Taggart's artist friends and associates included Cecilia Beaux, Charles Hawthorne, Paul Manship, Walker Hancock, Gifford Beal and his brother, Reynolds Beal, Harry Sleeper, and numerous artists in Indiana. She was also a close friend of author and fellow Hoosier Booth Tarkington, as well as his first and second wives, and was godmother to his only child, Laurel.Fadely, \\"Subtle Grace, Radiant Color,\\" pp. 20–21. Throughout her adult life Taggart was active in numerous art associations in Indiana and in the eastern United States, most notably the Art Association of Indianapolis, National Arts Club (New York), American Federation of Arts, North Shore Art Association (East Gloucester, Massachusetts), Grand Central Art Galleries (New York), National Association of Women Painters and Sculptors, Provincetown Art Association, and the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. In addition to arts organizations, Taggart was a member of the Women's Committee of the Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra. She played an \\"influential\\" role in bringing Fabien Sevitzky, the orchestra's second conductor to Indianapolis. Other memberships included the Indianapolis Dramatic Club, Contemporary Club of Indianapolis, Colonial Dames of America, National Society of Magna Carta Dames, and the Cosmopolitan Club of New York. She was also a member of Saint Paul's Episcopal Church in Indianapolis. Later years Taggart became a surrogate mother to her brother's young daughter, Eva, after his wife's death in 1929, and brought the child to Indianapolis to live with her at the Taggart family home. Eva's father remained at French Lick to manage the family's business interests. On November 7, 1931, at the request of Indianapolis mayor Reginald H. Sullivan, a family friend, Taggart christened the USS Indianapolis at Camden, New Jersey. Commissioned by the U.S. Navy on November 15, 1932, it later transported components for the atomic bomb, code- named Little Boy, through the Pacific Ocean. The ship was destroyed by the Imperial Japanese Navy in one of the worst U.S. naval disasters in history; 880 Americans lost their lives.Fadely, \\"Subtle Grace, Radiant Color,\\" pp. 21, 23. After her mother's death in 1937, Taggart became the family matriarch. In the last decade of Taggart's life, declining health caused her to sell the family home in Indianapolis and move into a nearby apartment, but she retained her home at Eastern Point, Massachusetts, and Mount Airie, her brother's home in French Lick, Indiana. Death and legacy Taggart died in Indianapolis on October 9, 1960. Her remains are interred near her parents and other members of the family at Crown Hill Cemetery in Indianapolis., Her substantial estate was distributed among her family members. Taggart lived much of her life in the public spotlight as the daughter of a successful hotelier, Indiana's Democratic political boss, mayor of Indianapolis, and U.S. Senator. Remembered for her \\"style, grace, wit, and talent,\\" Taggart's many friends and associates included leading artists, authors, and politicians. She was also recognized as a talented and versatile artist in oils, pastels, and watercolors during an artistic career that spanned the first three decades of the twentieth century. A colleague described Taggart as \\"much to modest about her own work.\\" She was especially known for her portraiture, but Taggart also painted landscapes and still life scenes and created sculptures. As historian Mary Burnet explained, Taggart's portraits depicted her subjects \\"with a subtle grace, and a wealth of radiant color peculiarly rich in quality.\\" Taggart's artwork is included in private collections and represented in the collections of the Indianapolis Museum of Art. Honors and tributes Taggart was the recipient of the J. Irving Holcomb Prize for General Excellence at the John Herron Art Institute's Annual Exhibition of Work by Indiana Artists in 1922. She was awarded second honorable mention in 1922 and first honorable mention in 1926 for work she exhibited at the Annual Exhibition of Work by Indiana Artists in Richmond, Indiana. Taggart's painting, Eleanor, won the Hoosier Salon's Merit Award for figure composition in 1925; Carnival won its Merit Award in 1926 for best picture painted by a woman.

Today, the fortification is mostly in ruined state, however there are some well preserved parts.  History  The area between Raška and Ibar, where the Rogozna mountain forms a natural border towards the Pannonian Basin, was the heart of the Serbian medieval state during the early reign of the Nemanjić dynasty, the Grand Principality of Serbia. Among many other obsolete medieval fortifications in Serbia, Jeleč stands out with its unusual position. It's built on one of the highest peaks of Rogozna mountain, at 1 262 m altitude, as an important strategic fort on the unstable frontier. A look at the fortification from the nearby peak The first certain mention of this town was in the second half of 13th century, but it was without a doubt built much earlier. Its position indicates that it had the most importance in pre-Nemanjić era of Serbia. The area which Jeleč dominates, was on the frontier towards Bulgarian and Byzantine lands during the early power struggles involving Serbia in early medieval period. During the reign of Stefan Nemanja it was a center of župa, a term for a district in medieval Serbia. It is believed that some rulers used Jeleč as their estate. In 1282 it was Jeleč where Stefan Dragutin broke his leg while hunting and became ill; he passed the throne to his younger brother Stefan Milutin at the council at Deževo in 1282. When the aspirations of the Nemanjić to expand south came to fruition, starting with the reign of Milutin, the fortification saw its military value decrease due to being deep in inner Serbia and isolated on a mountain peak. During the fracturing of the Serbian Empire, it was first under the realm of Vojislav Vojinović, then his nephew Nikola Altomanović, and finally the house of Branković. With the Ottoman expansion into Serbia, many of the local population were converted to Islam and the nearby settlements were abandoned or reduced to very small villages with single houses. Under the Ottomans, the fortification's status once again grew, being the center of the local Wilayah of Jeleč. In 1455, the Jeleč wilayah had around one hundred settlements or colonies. Although wilayah is primarily an administrative center, Jeleč again had somewhat more of a military significance. At this time, the garrison in Jeleč was armed with cannons, and there are some documents that point that there was possibly a foundry in the town. The industry in the town was short-lived however.  Characteristics  Jeleč is a trapezoid-shaped fortification, with meandering and curved walls 10 meters tall, built in the Serbo-Byzantine style. The fort is relatively small in size, being 45 meters in length and 35 in width. Inside the town walls there is a remain of a cistern, and the remains of windows point out to the fact that it also had living quarters. The defensiveness of Jeleč was increased by the polygonal-shaped towers in the three corners; one was most likely added by the Ottomans. The approach to the fort is barely traversable, and the trail that leads to the gates is nearly vertical. At the bottom of the main fortification, there are remains of a small town. Between the fort and the town, there were three water wells. The fortification had its own water source and is thought of being nearly impossible to take by military means. Today, Jeleč is in a declining state, not being yet protected as an object of importance, nor being investigated enough, although there are talks for this to happen.

Moore was the shopping center king of Texas. He’d like to be again, and he has a plan.\\" by Claire Poole October 1998People Magazine: \\"For $6.5 Million Jerry Moore Drives Home a Wheel Gem\\" By Ron Arias July 21, 1986 Biography Moore was born in Houston to Polish-Jewish immigrants in 1927, the son of a plumber. He attended San Jacinto High School in Houston but dropped out after sophomore year to sell vacuum cleaners door-to-door (he would later earn a high school equivalency diploma in 1987). In 1958, he founded Jerry J. Moore Investments, and after borrowing money from banker Irvin Shlenker (father of Sidney Shlenker), he purchased a small house in North Houston which he fixed up and sold. Using the proceeds he repeated the same pattern, purchasing houses, small apartment buildings, and strip malls primarily in working-class neighborhoods in Houston. In the mid 1960s, he focused on finding run-down strip malls in high-traffic areas and after sprucing them up, he would increase the rent anywhere from 20 to 40 percent. He was able to undercut his competitors who focused on new construction as he used his own workers for renovation and maintenance. The strategy was very successful and he soon stopped renovating houses and apartments to focus on strip malls and then began purchasing full-fledged shopping malls. By 1989, he was the largest shopping-center developer in the United States with more than 160 properties and 19 million square feet of space in Texas of which 70 percent was in greater Houston. In 1991, Texas Monthly ranked him the third richest Texan. In 1993, he planned to take his company public as a real estate investment trust and hired Kidder Peabody but the appetite for new REITs had soured. In 1994, he again contemplated going public in partnership with Morgan Stanley who was interested in buying his portfolio. In January 1995, Morgan Stanley agreed to purchase a controlling interest in 50 percent of Moore's properties for $400 million (although $300 million was in assumed debt).Chicago Tribune: \\"Mega- deal For Moore\\" February 12, 1995 In 1997, after his two-year non-competition agreement with Morgan Stanley ended, Moore returned to purchasing shopping malls.

Following a riot in the Summer of 1872 that served as a precursor to the 1886 Belfast Riots, he put forth a proclamation that closed public houses for a week, authorized government forces to disperse any public gatherings, and authorized government forces to enter any buildings where shots had been fired.

The British seized her in 1795 and new owners renamed her Malabar. She made two complete voyages under charter to the British East India Company before she burnt at Madras in 1801 in an accident. Origins The Dutch East India Company built Nieuwland at Amsterdam. On 16 December 1795 Nieuwland put into Plymouth on her way home from the Dutch East Indies. Her captain did not know that England and the Batavian Republic were now at war. The British seized Nieuwland and sold her. EIC voyages William Hamilton purchased Nieuwland and renamed her Malabar. The EIC engaged Malabar as an \\"extra ship\\", that is, it chartered her. Before taking her up, it had Perry measure and repair her. On 4 April 1796, Captain Robert Torin received a letter of marque for Malabar. However, apparently he did not sail her for long, if at all. =Voyage #1 (1796-1797)= On 27 June 1796, Captain William Edmeades sailed from Portsmouth, bound for Bombay. By 19 September Malabar was at the Cape, and she arrived at Bombay on - 20 January 1797. Homeward bound, she reached Tellicherry on 20 March and Cochin on 18 April. She was at the Cape again on 7 July and at St Helena on 2 August. She arrived at the Downs on 25 October. =Voyage #2 (1798-1800)= Captain Edmeades received a letter of marque on 20 April 1798. Malabars logbook commences at Deptford on 8 February 1798. From Deptford she moved to Gravesend, and eventually sailed to the convoy rendezvous at Portsmouth. At Portsmouth the Navy took off two of her crew, who it had identified as deserters.Bonham's catalog description for the log offered at auction. Accessed 11 May 2017. On 29 April Malabar sailed from Portsmouth in the company of nine other Indiamen: Fort William, Melville Castle, Lord Duncan, Airly Castle, Bridgewater, Walpole, Dublin, Contractor, and Caledonian. , which was being sent out to China, provided the convoy's escort. Malabar was bound for China, Bengal, and Madras. The convoy reached Rio de Janeiro on 6 July. The convoy reached Lombock and Bali in late September, and arrived at Whampoa on 2 December. There Malabar discharged her cargo, which included lead. On 8 January 1799 Malabar crossed the Second Bar, bound for Bengal. She transited via the Straits of Dryon (by Pulau Durian in the Riau Archipelago). She reached Malacca on 30 January and Penang on 9 February, before arriving at Kedgeree, an anchorage on the Hooghly River, on 1 March. Malabar left there in late April in company with two other vessels, the American vessel Indian Chief, and the Danish vessel Norje. Malabar arrived at Madras on 12 May, and there discharged a cargo of rice. Malabar then sailed back to Bengal with a cargo of salt, 75 \\"Chests of Treasure\\", and troops from either the 10th or 19th Regiment of Foot. She arrived at Diamond Harbour on 17 August. On 29 December she was at Calcutta, where she underwent extensive repairs in dock. She then took on a cargo of sugar and a number of passengers, including 37 military invalids, and ten French prisoners. Homeward bound, she passed Saugor on 5 December. Malabar was at the Cape on 10 March 1800 for a short respite. She reached St Helena on 16 April, and arrived at the Down on 24 June. Loss Captain Thomas Kent received a letter of marque on 9 December 1800. Messrs Princip & Saunders had tendered her to the EIC to bring back rice from Bengal. She was one of 28 vessels that sailed on that mission between December 1800 and February 1801.Hardy (1800), p.217. Kent sailed for Madras and Bengal on 20 January 1801. Malabar was in Madras Roads on 3 August 1801 having come from Calcutta while homeward bound. Supposedly, a cask of spirits that was being either loaded or unloaded slipped from the slings and hit the vessel aft, where the spirits caught fire from a light. The burning alcohol spread the fire and despite the efforts of her crew, the \\"beach department\\", and nearby vessels the fire reached Malabars magazine, which exploded. She sank immediately in six fathoms — — of water, leaving only her mizzen-top-mast visible above water. Fortunately, no lives were lost. Boats in the water around Malabar rescued those people who jumped overboard. However, Malabars entire cargo, comprising some 12-13,000 bags of rice, as well as coffee and pepper, \\"and many articles of still greater value\\" was lost.Asiatic Annual Register (1802, Vol. 4, p.10. Postscript On 11 December 1807 a major hurricane hit Madras. It was so strong that it threw up on the beach the entire bottom of a ship of about 800 tons burthen.

Similar in appearance to the Combat Action Badge, the ESB would be awarded to soldiers who are neither infantry, Special Forces, nor combat medics. The badge was approved on June 14, 2019 and entered service in October 2019, as a way for soldiers in other military occupational specialties to certify competencies within their specific occupation, as well as general combat readiness. History The concept of the Expert Soldier Badge (initially referred to as the Expert Action Badge) was initially proposed in 2015 as part of the United States Army Training and Doctrine Command's NCO 2020 Strategy, as one way to improve combat readiness in the Army. The ESB was first openly discussed on March 30, 2017, at an NCO Development Town Hall hosted by CSM David Davenport. Discussion mainly focused on the intent of the badge, as well as the possible criteria for award. The feasibility of the ESB was tested at Joint Base Lewis- McChord in April of the same year, with 53 soldiers taking part in the event. The results of the test at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, as well as future testing, will be used to determine if the criteria for the badge appropriately conveys the badge's intent. The NCO 2020 Strategy, including the ESB, was further discussed in 2018 at a conference held at Fort Knox. Criteria The current proposed criteria for award of the ESB is that a soldier must perform in 30 Warrior Tasks (Skill Level 1) and battle drills, and five METL tasks, chosen by a commander, from their unit's list of mission-essential tasks, in addition to completion of a 12-mile foot march, a land navigation test and the Army Physical Fitness Test. Testing will be conducted at the brigade-level, with units being given a week to set up the test course, a few days of training, and then a few days of testing. Design The current proposed design for the ESB is similar to that of the Combat Action Badge (CAB). It would feature the same M9 bayonet and M67 fragmentation grenade, superimposed on a rectangular base, as found on the CAB. The ESB will not, however, feature a wreath.

Dar Ashraf, Tunis, 2001, p. 168 Nicknamed jellizi in reference to the craft of zellige manufacturing that he exerted with great skill, he was known for his great piety, benevolence and generosity: the place served as a refuge for travelers and traders, as well as Andalusian refugees after the capture of Granada in 1492, which increased his consideration with the Hafsid leaders and the veneration of the population. After his death in 1496, he was buried in the building, which was decorated by himself or his spiritual and artistic followers. Subsequently, the zaouia was enlarged twice: first in the 17th century with the addition of a courtyard surrounded by rooms and then in the 18th century with the addition of the prayer room under the reign of Al-Husayn I ibn Ali.  Architecture  The monument has a pyramidal dome covered with green tiles, with a carved wooden ceiling inside. Access to the building is through a double-leafed door topped by a lintel with finely worked keys.Mausolée Sidi Kacem El Jellizi (Musée sans frontières) The interior is divided into two parts, of which one houses the burial of the saint and the other houses those of Hafsid sultans. The main façade is partially covered by faience, part of which is typical of Andalusia and Morocco. The patio is distinguished by a paving in white marble encrusted with black marble; it is framed by porticos which each have five broken oversized arches made of stone paired with ocher shellstone. The arches rest on columns of white marble whose capitals are Hafsid or Hispano- Moorish.Présentation du mausolée Sidi Kacem El Jellizi (Municipalité de Tunis) The hypostyle-type prayer room is divided into three naves parallel to the wall of the qibla.

He is the elected Member of Parliament for Budadiri County East, Sironko District and a representative for NRM, the ruling political party in Uganda. Woboya is the NRM whip for Bugisu sub-region and is a member of both the Committee on Commissions, State Authorities & State Enterprises and the Committee On Presidential Affairs in the 10th Parliament of Uganda. In 2006, while working in the Office of the Prime Minister (OPM), Woboya with the assistance of UNDP and the Danish demining group (DDG) spearheaded the implementation of a humanitarian demining program, the National Mine Action Programme (NMAP), in parts of Northern Uganda that were heavily affected by the 20-year LRA insurgency. This combined effort led to official declaration of Uganda as a landmine free country on 10 December 2012. Early life and education Woboya was born in Bumasifwa, a village in Sironko District, on 1 July 1974 in an Anglican family of five boys and a girl. A member of the Dunga Clan of the Bamasaba, his father Francis Namugowa was a primary school teacher and his mother Zita Wolayo Namugowa, a subsistence farmer. He attended Bumasifwa Primary School and Bumasaga Primary School in Mbale for his primary school education as well as Mbale Senior Secondary School for his O-level and A-Level academic qualifications. As a day scholar, he trekked 6 kilometers to get to his secondary school. He had his first taste at leadership in Senior 3 when he was democratically elected Health Prefect and then as Chairman of the History Club in Senior 5. Woboya further advanced to Makerere University for his University education where he graduated in 1997 with a Bachelor of Social Science in Political Science and Public Administration. While at the Ivory Tower, Woboya served as a member of the Guild Representative Council (GRC). He also served as the chairperson for Budadiri Students Association and was an executive for the Mbale Students Association (MUMBASA). Still in the same institution of higher education, Woboya acquired a Master of Public Administration in 2010. Woboya also holds an administrative law certificate (2003) from the Law Development Centre and a post graduate diploma (2005) in public administration and management from Islamic University in Uganda (IUIU). Career Woboya started his post academic career as a research assistant in early 1997 at the Planning and Development Department of Makerere University where he partook in a two-month research opportunity. Later on that year, he joined Mbale District Local Government as a Sub-county/Gombolola Chief at the time when Uganda was transitioning from a centralized system of government to a decentralized one and served in that capacity for two years. He was then promoted to Assistant CAO in 1999 there by cementing his role as a permanent civil servant. In 2000, when Sironko became a district, Woboya was transferred to the newly founded district where he served in the same capacity until 2004 when he joined the Ministry of Public Service as Senior Assistant Secretary to the Minister of State for Public service. In 2005, Woboya joined the Office of the Prime Minister (OPM) and served as a Senior Assistant Secretary to the First Deputy Prime Minister. By 2010, he had served in that capacity as the P.A. to General Moses Ali and Professor Kabwegyere. In 2011, Woboya was appointed Principal Disaster Management Officer in the Office of the Prime Minister, a position he held until 2015 when he resigned to join elective politics. In 2016, after winning the NRM chairmanship for Budadiri County East, Woboya won his maiden election on the NRM party ticket and became a member of the 10th Parliament for the Pearl of Africa.

He was educated at Tilton School (no family connection) and received a bachelor's degree in business from Babson College in 1974. Next, after taking some graduate courses in business at the University of New Hampshire with a direction towards banking, he withdrew from his studies. He then set forth to New York City where a family friend, Betty Parsons, who was known for her early championing of the Abstract Expressionists, including Jackson Pollock and Mark Rothko, had her renowned gallery on 57th Street in Manhattan. He started there as an assistant and worked at the gallery from 1976 to 1982. After Parsons' death in 1982 he took over the space, converting it into his own establishment, the Jack Tilton Gallery. In the early 1990s he moved the gallery to Greene Street, in the SoHo neighborhood of Manhattan. Then in 1999 he partnered with Bennett and Julie Roberts to open the gallery Roberts & Tilton in Los Angeles, California.

She was affectionately known as Mai Malwain (Malwa Mother) after her marriage. She is also referred to as Sardarni Raj Kaur and was daughter of Raja Gajpat Singh Sidhu of Jind. Family and marriage Raj Kaur was the daughter of Raja Gajpat Singh Sidhu, a scion of the Phulkian Misl of Jind. She was married in 1774 (at the age of fifteen) to the 17-year-old Maha Singh, the heir of Charat Singh, the founder and leader of the Sukerchakia Misl. The marriage was beneficial for Maha Singh as it strengthened his position amongst the Sikhs. Six years after their marriage, Raj Kaur gave birth to Maha Singh's only son on 2 November 1780. He was named Buddh Singh at birth, but was later renamed Ranjit Singh. The birth of a son was celebrated with alms-giving, feeding of the poor, and giving rich offerings to temples and shrines. Maha Singh did not have time to devote to his son's upbringing, nor did the conventions of the time give opportunity to Raj Kaur, confined as she was to the seclusion of the zenana (a practice which the Sikh ruling classes had taken from the Muslims) to see much of her son after he was old enough to be on his own. Regent to Ranjit Singh During the siege of Sodhra, which was being occupied by the Bhangi Misl, Maha Singh contracted dysentery and died in April 1790. Ranjit Singh was 9-years-old at the time of his father's death in 1790. Raj Kaur became Ranjit's regent during his minority and managed the affairs of the Sukerchakia Misl. She was assisted by Dewan Lakhpat Rai (the Dewan of her late husband) who is reputed to have acted with ability and enthusiasm. The teenage Ranjit Singh took hardly any interest in the affairs of the state, making Raj Kaur anxious for his future. She felt that marriage might bring him around to the responsibilities of life. Ranjit had been betrothed (in Maha Singh's lifetime) to Mehtab Kaur, the only daughter of Sada Kaur and granddaughter of Jai Singh Kanhaiya, the chief of the powerful Kanhaiya Misl. Raj Kaur approached Sada Kaur to fix the nuptial date. Ranjit was fifteen years old when he left Gujranwala for Batala, the chief town of the Kanhaiyas, to wed Mehtab Kaur in 1796. This alliance between the two important Sikh families was a major event for Punjab. All the leading Sikh chiefs were present at the wedding.

History Pollock was born in Newport, Wales, and at age 18 voyaged to Melbourne where he had an uncle. He moved to New Zealand, where he took acting lessons from Clarance Holt, father of Bland Holt and who was in Dunedin for some years, then joined a company touring India and other Eastern countries. He was working as manager of the Corinthian Theatre, Calcutta when he first met the great actors George Titheradge and Boothroyd Fairclough. While in Singapore in 1875 he married the Perth actress Mary Myers and together toured the East. He brought a troupe of Japanese jugglers to Perth around this time. In 1879 they took the P. & O. steamer Siam in company with Titheradge to Melbourne, where both men appeared in the Australian debut of the Kotzebue play False Shame at the Academy of Music (later the \\"Bijou Theatre\\"). From 1881–1882 he was successful as agent and manager for the celebrated comedian Fred Marshall, then briefly acting manager of the Princess Theatre. He was appointed treasurer of Adelaide's Theatre Royal, which he relinquished in 1884 to take over management of that city's refurbished Academy of Music, dubbed the \\"New Academy\\", on Rundle Street. The building was destroyed by fire the following year, incurring a great financial loss to Pollock. He then joined James Allison and George Rignold in managing the Adelaide company of Joseph Derrick's play Confusion which toured through Victoria and New South Wales. In 1886 Pollock managed a tour of Western Australia and the Near East by the Webb Marionette Company, then the 1887–88 Australian tour of veteran ventriloquist Fred MacCabe (c.1831–1904). He next managed Harry Rickards's 1888 Australian tour. In 1889 he turned publican of Her Majesty's Hotel (previously Garton's) in Swanston Street, Melbourne, but did not lose touch with the theatre, acting as a Melbourne agent for Wybert Reeve in Adelaide. Ten years later, after attending the Oakbank races, he left Her Majesty's to manage the bar associated with the Adelaide Theatre Royal. When Reeve retired from stage management in 1900, Pollock purchased the lease from him, and ran the Theatre Royal with considerable tact and ability until forced by illness to step down. He appointed Herbert Myers, a nephew of his wife, as manager. She inherited the theatre, with Myers as her manager until the lease ran out seven years later. Pollock's chief interests outside the theatre were the turf, his pony \\"Dandy\\", his little dogs \\"Topsy\\" and \\"Queenie\\", and his membership of the Commissionaire Corps of the Volunteer Militia, into which he had been introduced by Reeve. They had a home \\"Azara\\" at the corner of Pollock Avenue and Battams Road, Payneham. His remains were buried in the Jewish section of the West Terrace Cemetery. Family Pollock married Mary Myers (4 September 1844 – 5 September 1925), of St. George's terrace, Perth, W.A., in Singapore on 5 July 1875 after an engagement of eight years. After his death she married again, to Henry Hele, chief accountant at The Register, in 1908.

The Old Jail is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Old Jail consists of two different structures that are attached: (1) the actual jail and (2) the former Vanderburgh County sheriff's residence.  Architecture  The Old Vanderburgh County Jail is modeled after Lichtenstein Castle. The Old Jail is rich in exquisite examples of 19th century American architecture. The stone building itself is designed to invoke fear in the observer. Its exterior consists of step-gables, projecting turrets, crenelated roof lines, simulated portcullis, and a central keep, or rounded tower. The entrance presents pointed arches to lengthen the appearance of this part of the building. All of these elements add to the castle-like appearance of the structure. The Old Jail is modeled after Lichtenstein Castle. It was designed by architect Henry Wolters, who was also the architect responsible for designing the Old Vanderburgh County Courthouse. Both structures were built at the same time and still have a tunnel that connects them. The tunnel can still be accessed from Woods & Woods law office.  History  The Old Vanderburgh County Jail was completed in 1890 and housed inmates until 1967. It sat empty and dilapidated until renovations started in the 1990s. It was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1970. The Old Jail was the site of a race-riot in 1903 after an African-American male shot a white police officer. The violence raged throughout the night and by morning on July 5, 1903, 12 people were dead. One of the deceased was a 12-year-old-girl who was accidentally shot in her parent's carriage. 300 state militia members were sent to Evansville after the governor declared martial law.  Notable Inmates  Leslie Irvin, a.k.a. \\"Mad Dog,\\" was a serial killer that terrorized southwestern Indiana from December 2, 1954 to March 28, 1955. His case went to the U.S. Supreme Court and set legal precedence for pre-trial publicity.  Current Use  Following several years of renovations in the late 1990s, the Old Jail was brought back to her former glory. The Old Jail is now the headquarters of Woods & Woods veterans disability benefits attorneys.

He died in Coonoor on 9 May 1960 at the age of 81. Tirukkural translation At the suggestion of the then general editor of the Heritage of India Series, Calcutta, J. N. Farquhar, Popley started translating selections of the Tirukkural into English and published the work in 1931 with the Y. M. C. A. Publishing House. Translated in verse, the work was titled The Sacred Kural or The Tamil Veda of Tiruvalluvar. The work contained translations of 346 couplets of the Kural text, including 194 from Book I (virtue), 135 from Book II (wealth), and 17 from Book III (love). In 1958, the second edition with revised translations was published, which contained translations of 511 couplets, including 299 from Book I, 190 from Book II, and 22 from Book III. The work includes a detailed introduction and explanatory notes quoting translators such as W. H. Drew, G. U. Pope, V. V. S. Aiyar, and A.

Designed by noted local architect George J. Hardway for Dr. James Bell (a local dentist), it was completed in 1901. The home is a prime example of the Cleveland-area reaction at the end of the 19th century against high Victorian architecture, utilizing elements of Richardsonian Romanesque architecture to create a highly individualized, severe style. The home was added to the National Register of Historic Places on October 16, 1986. The home is part of the East 89th Street Historic District, which was added to the National Register of Historic Places on May 26, 1988. About the house James Richard Bell was a prominent dentist in Cleveland in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. In 1900, he commissioned noted local architect George J. Hardway to design a large residence on E. 89th Street in the southeast quadrant of the Hough neighborhood, one of the city's oldest settled areas and which at that time was inhabited largely by white, middle-class and upper-middle-class residents. The block on which Bell chose to build was built up with a number of large residences over the past 30 years, ranging in style from Italianate to extremely elaborate Queen Anne style. The increasingly elaborate embellishments of Victorian architecture had fallen out of favor with homeowners and architects in northeast Ohio by the late 1890s, and Bell and Hardway agreed on a home that was simple to the point of being severe. The Bell House is largely Richardsonian Romanesque in style. However, it deviates from this style by featuring a contemporary massing and relying on plain exterior walls. The three-story structure is constructed of stone and brick. The front of the house is roughly square, with an east-facing gable, a single dormer on the south side, and steep roof pitch. The third-floor windows are topped by round stone arches, with stone slabs constituting the lintel and sill of the first and second story windows. A rusticated stone porch with canopy provided the entrance to the house. The narrow-depth center section of the house features projecting polygonal bay windows on all three floors on the south side. This projection is topped by a hip-end roof. The north side of the center section is essentially a triple-wide dormer or gable facing north, with a gable roof. The rear of the building, which is about as large as the front section, returns to the square plan, although it features two dormers on the north side and none on the south. The home originally had 12 rooms, four baths, and a third-floor ballroom. By the 1970s, the ballroom had been divided and the house now had a total of 21 rooms. Bell occupied the home until his death in 1912. The home was bequeathed to his wife, Anna Roeder Bell. She died in 1940, and bequeathed the home to her daughter, Frieda Meriam. Mrs. Meriam died in 1942, and the home was sold to John A. Smith in 1943. By 1947, the home belonged to the Sabo family, and by 1948 the Jaskell family. By 1956, it was owned by Enoch Spence, who sold it by 1961 to Harold C. Scheunemann, who in turn sold it to Raymond Beedlow by 1966. The Hough neighborhood became an overwhelmingly poor African American area by 1960. In May 1968, the mansion was purchased by the Berry Foundation. It became the home of the Martin Luther King Residential Youth House, a residential home for troubled black youth. The ballroom was probably turned into bedrooms about this time. In the early or mid 1970s, the youth house closed, and the Lee Heights Community Church rented the structure for use by The Straight-up Half-Way House, a transitional residence for alcoholics, criminals, and drug addicts. The Berry Foundation sold the house in 1979 to a private owner, Margaret J. Williams. Because it exemplifies the local architectural reaction to the excesses of Victorian architecture, the house was added to the National Register of Historic Places on October 16, 1986. It was also named a Cleveland Landmark by the Cleveland Landmarks Commission, under the name Bell-Williams House.

Life The original picture was sent by Anthony Anderson and the cat was red Bowker was born in Leicestershire (probably Market Harborough) to a local family in about 1541. She came to prominence when her midwife, Elizabeth Harrison, reported that she had given birth to a cat on 16 January 1569. The story caused interest as it was feared that some may see this as a portent. The idea was not dismissed even after the cat that was said to have been born was found to have food in its stomach. A pamphlet was circulated. Bowker was not married and she had tried to drown and hanging herself during her pregnancy. The rest of her life is unclear but she came from a local family and she worked in the Leicestershire area. She had visited London and seen Elizabeth I in 1566. The report was made to the church authorities and Anthony Anderson who worked for the Archdeacon of Leicester. He created a life-size drawing of a cat which he annotated and sent it to nobleman Henry Hastings, 3rd Earl of Huntingdon.Agnes Bowker, 9 December 2006, The Scotsman, Retrieved 11 May 2017 Hastings had local connections but he was also close to the Queen during the Rising of the North.Claire Cross, ‘Hastings, Henry, third earl of Huntingdon (1536?–1595)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Jan 2008 accessed 11 May 2017 He sent the report to Queen Elizabeth's advisor Sir William Cecil. Cecil sent it on to Edmund Grindal who was then the Bishop of London but who would in time be the Archbishop of Canterbury. Grindal concluded the affair in August of that year when ruled that it was a hoax, but he conceded that there was no evidence to prove that Bowker was not telling the truth.David Cressy, ‘Bowker, Agnes (b. 1541/2)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, Oct 2006 accessed 11 May 2017 Legacy It isn't known what happened to Agnes Bowker but the picture of the cat is now in the British Library.

Life  Polyansky was born on 20 January 1890 in modern-day Ashgabat, Turkmenistan, which at the time was part of the Russian Empire. He relocated to Voronezh, Russia in his early youth.Prokhorov, A. M. (Aleksandr Mikhaĭlovich). Great Soviet Encyclopedia. New York: Macmillan, 1973. He graduated from Moscow University in 1914 at the age of 24, before returning to Voronezh where he worked as an assistant at Voronezh Agricultural University until 1918. In 1920 he then became a professor at Voronezh State University where he taught for the remainder of his life and served as a Dean, Chair of Botany and Vice President of the University. He is buried in Voronezh at the Comintern Cemetery.  Work on botany  Boris Kozo-Polyansky became a professor of botany at the University of Voronezh in 1920. His research and contribution to the field mostly focused on the phylogenetic taxonomy and morphology of higher plants. His research expounded upon and supported the euanthial origin of flowers (flowers coming from a shoot with modified leaves) and from this theory, he constructed an original phylogenetic system for angiosperms, and later for all terrestrial plant life. Additionally, He devised a new classification of umbellifers based on the anatomy of their fruit. Furthermore, during studies he conducted in the Timskaia Highland in Kursk Oblast, Kozo-Polyansky discovered an accumulation of relict plants. Kozo-Polyansky published \\"Introduction to the phylogenetic systematics of higher plants\\",Kozo-Poli︠a︡nskiĭ, B. Mikhailovich. (1922). Vvedenie v filogenicheskui︠u︡ sistematiku vysshikh rasteniĭ-, po lek︠t︡si︠ia︡m, chitannym v Voronezhskom universitete. [Voronezh]: Voronezhskoe ota-nie gos. izd-va. \\"Tea plants of Kazakhstan\\", and \\"The main biogenetic law from the botanical point of view\\" during his lifetime, and a fourth book on botany, \\"Course in the Systematics of Higher Plants\\", was published posthumously. Kozo-Polyansky became the director of the Voronezh Botanical Gardens in 1937, which today are named in his honor.  Evolutionary theory of symbiogenesis Symbiogenesis, the theory which describes the endosymbiotic origin of Eukaryotic cells, which endocytosed smaller prokaryotes that later became DNA containing organelles such as mitochondria and plastids, was first suggested by Andreas Franz Wilhelm Schimper (1856 –1901) in his 1883 seminal paper: “On the development of chlorophyll grains and color bodies.”Schimper, A. F. W. (1883). \\"Über die Entwicklung der Chlorophyllkörner und Farbkörper\\". Bot. Zeitung. 41: 105–14, 121–31, 137–46, 153–62 However, the theory wasn't detailed in a substantial manner until Konstantin Mereschcowsky (1855-1921) published his 1905 paper, \\"The nature and origins of chromatophores in the plant kingdom,\\" where the term Symbiogenesis was first coined.Mereschkowski C (1905). \\"Über Natur und Ursprung der Chromatophoren im Pflanzenreiche\\". Biol Centralbl. 25: 593–604 It was in this academic landscape that Kozo-Polyansky pioneered the idea that symbiogenesis could be explained through the classical Darwinian notion of evolution, something his two predecessors failed to do. He first publicly related this theory in 1921 at the All Russian Congress of Russian Botanists in Petrograd. center Yet, it wasn't until 1924, through the publication of Kozo-Polyansky's seminal work \\"The New Principle of Biology: An Essay on the Theory of Symbiogenesis,\\" that the evolutionary context and importance of symbiogenesis was fully detailed for the first time. In \\"The New Principle of Biology: An Essay on the Theory of Symbiogenesis\\" Kozo-Polyansky posited many novels theories and observations that had yet been developed by other biologists. The novel views that he proposed in the text, are the following: # Life arose before Eukaryotic Cells; from bioblasts, cytodes, and Cyanophyceae or simpler cells. These life forms (generally classified as prokaryotes today) were the closest descendants of the earliest life forms. Cytodes and bioblasts, are simpler than cells with nuclei yet still have all the properties of life. He noted the environmental impacts of bacteria with complex and unique metabolic pathways. # Cells are made up of sub-units called \\"organoids\\" (known as organelles today). The green photosynthetic sub-units originated as a Cyanophyceae, that were engulfed by larger cells and were able to form a symbiotic relationship with its host. This symbiogenesis led to the evolution of chloroplasts, and mitochondria . # Symbiogenesis and evolution together have led to rapid changes in organisms, such as the acquisition of plastids over a few generations through endosymbiosis, rather than over many generations as suggested by many evolutionists. This conception of rapid evolution followed by long periods of stasis, first supported in this work, was the precursor to the idea of punctuated equilibrium. # There is a greater force for an evolutionary drive when two species engaged in a symbiotic relationship are very distinct. Kozo-Polyansky ultimately posited that symbiogenesis was a source of evolutionary novelty and that Darwinian mechanisms, such as natural selection, were responsible for maintaining the heritable changes brought about by symbiotic interactions.  Legacy and impact  A Young Boris Kozo-Polaynsky (1915)At the time of the publication of Kozo-Polyansky's theory and work on evolution and symbiogenesis, was ridiculed and rejected, and was never recognized for its merit during his lifetime. And due to the language barrier of Russian, was never read in the West, where English and German evolutionary works dominated the academic landscape. However, the works of other symbiogeneticists and Kozo-Polyansky were brought back into academic consciousness in 1967 by the work of Lynn Margulis who independently proposed a near identical theory to Kozo-Polyansky's. With the revival of evolutionary symbiogenesis, Margulis was made aware of Kozo- Polyansky's work by a former student of his, Dr. Takhtajan at the 1975 International Conference of Botany. Kozo-Polyansky's theories were first published to the West in 1979 by Khakhina's book on the history of the theory of symbiogenesis. However, the entirety of his original book wasn't translated into English until 2010 by Victor Fet, and Lynn Margulis. Today, his views are held to be correct by nearly the entire biological sciences community, and is regarded as one of the first thinkers to detail the endosymbiotic evolution of eukaryotic cells, the theory of punctuated equilibrium and the distinction between prokaryotic and eukaryotic life forms.Fet, Victor. \\"Symbiogenesis in Russia.\\" In Chimeras and Consciousness: Evolution of the Sensory Self, edited by Margulis Lynn, Asikainen Celeste A., and Krumbein Wolfgang E., 153-58.

It may have been built as an emergency refuge for those families. The last member of the Lichtenstein family, Ulrich died in 1275 and passed his lands to Haldenstein family. A relative Rudolph, was a canon in Chur until 1282, but did not inherit. The male line of the Haldenstein family ended when Ulrich IV died at the Battle of Näfels in 1388. His lands were inherited by a number of relatives, but by 1424 the Herrschaft of Haldenstein was owned by Ursula von Hohenems and her husband Peter von Grifensee. The castle was first mentioned in 1672 as Crottenstein (from or toad). In 1742 Nicolin Sererhard mentioned the castle as Krottenstein. From there, it eventually became Grottenstein.

It was created by VympelCom founder Dmitry Zimin in 2002. After the Russian Ministry of Justice added Dynasty to its list of foreign agents in 2015 due to Zimin's own contributions coming from his foreign bank account, the Foundation decided to shut down.  History  Dynasty Foundation was founded in 2002 by telecommunications businessman and philanthropist Dmitry Zimin. Dynasty has supported the research of young biologists, physicists, and mathematicians; science programs for high-school students in academic institutions; and training for science teachers, among other programs. Dynasty also funded the translation of popular science literature, founded a book award for these writers, and supported lectures and festivals that promoted scientific knowledge. In 2007, for the first time in Russian history, the foundation was turned over to a board of trustees appointed from members of the public. In 2013, Dmitry Zimin was awarded the Andrew Carnegie Medal of Philanthropy, becoming the first Russian philanthropist to receive it. In 2015, Zimin was awarded a national prize \\"For Faithfulness to Science\\" in the category \\"For Patronage of Science\\" for significant contribution in popularizing science and supporting the scientific community. Dynasty Foundation was designated a \\"foreign agent\\" in 2015. The cause given was Dynasty's support for the organization Liberal Mission, which held lectures on modern politics in 2014, and founder Zimin's contributions to the fund coming from his foreign bank account. Rather than carry the label, the board decided to liquidate the Foundation. The registration of Dynasty sparked protests from Russia's Presidential Human Rights Council, which called upon the Plenum of the Supreme Court to examine the practice of the courts in the application of the law.

Over its first six years of operation, PMR has earned a reputation as one of the most prominent new British recording labels, having achieved multiple chart-topping albums and a number of prestigious award nominations, including the Mercury Prize and Grammy Awards. Notable artists on the PMR roster include Disclosure, Jessie Ware and Jamie Woon. History =2011-2012: Formation= PMR was formed in early 2011 after Ben Parmer quit his A&R; job at Polydor Records. Following Ben's departure from Polydor, Ben had convinced his brother to join him in the creation of PMR. Daniel Parmar did exactly that, leaving behind an administration role with the NHS, following a departure from the British TV industry. Ben and Daniel began working from their mothers living room in Acton. They promptly built up the PMR roster with DJ's L-Vis 1990 and T Williams, as well as a then-unknown singer named Jessie Ware, and sibling production duo Guy and Howard Lawrence, now known as Grammy award nominated duo Disclosure, aged just 19 and 16 at the time. The acts kicked off their careers by releasing 12\\" singles. =2012-2015: Early Success= PMR's first major success arrived in the form of a South London singer named Jessie Ware. Around the time of Ware's signing to PMR, she had no songs ready to put on her debut album. As Ware went into production for her debut album, she decided to work with Dave Okumu, who is a multi-instrumentalist and former frontman of The Invisible, to contribute production. Meanwhile, Ben and Daniel decided to introduce her to Julio Bashmore. Through this introduction, Ware and Bashmore wrote the track \\"110%\\". Within the first twelve months of the album's release in August 2012, Ware's debut album, \\"Devotion\\" charted within the top 5 of the UK album charts and gained a Mercury Prize nomination. Her second album, 2014's \\"Tough Love\\", also charted within the top 10 of the UK album charts, earning yet more widespread critical acclaim. Due to PMR's belief in Ware, the label decided to sign Disclosure. In a similar situation to Jessie Ware, Disclosure had no songs ready to place on their debut album when they signed to PMR. The first full records Disclosure sent to PMR's Ben and Daniel after signing was a song named \\"Latch,\\" featuring a then-unknown singer called Sam Smith. Following its release in October 2012, Latch brought more mainstream success to the PMR label, which lead to the song being streamed more than 215 million times on the Spotify streaming service. The track introduced a group of talent onto the world stage, including Disclosure, Sam Smith and songwriter Jimmy Napes. \\"Latch\\" went on to chart at number 7 on the US Billboard chart, and has sold more than 3 million copies to date. The track lent itself as the launchpad for Disclosure's debut album, \\"Settle\\". The album, another Mercury nominee for PMR, became a UK Number 1 album and achieved platinum selling status in the UK. Disclosure's second album, \\"Caracal\\", also became UK Number 1 album, alongside charting within the Top 10 on the Billboard album chart, and charity at number 1 on the US Electronic Charts. =2015-Present: Recent Ventures= More recently, PMR has also established a management company alongside the label operations. Alongside Julio Bashmore and Jai Paul, PMR also manages Two-Inch Punch, as well as co-managing artist Dornik. Ben Parmar also provides management services for another PMR act, Jessie Ware, whom he looks after alongside Mark Gillespie at Three Six Zero Group. Distribution Since 2011, all PMR Records releases have been issued through a worldwide partnership with Universal Music Group (UMG) firstly through Island, and more recently through a wide range of label options within the Universal system, that also includes Virgin EMI and UMG's services division, Caroline. Roster As of 2017, PMR Records is home to a range of artists the most notable of which are Disclosure, Jessie Ware, Jai Paul and Jamie Woon.

History Lichtenstein Castle around 1870 The Lichtenstein family first appears in a document in Chur in 1180. The castle was probably already built at this time, though it first appears in a record in 1396. In the late 12th or early 13th century another branch, the Haldenstein family, built nearby Haldenstein Castle. Through the 13th century the Lichtenstein family was often mentioned in records. In 1271, the Bishop of Chur and the Abbot of Pfäfers Abbey stayed at Ulrich von Lichtenstein's home in Chur. On 22 March 1275 Ulrich died as the last male heir of the family. A relative, Canon Rudolph von Lichtenstein, outlived Ulrich but was last mentioned in 1282. The Lichtenstein lands were inherited by the Haldenstein family. The youngest of four Haldenstein brothers was named Lichtenstein von Haldenstein in the late 14th century. The male line of the Haldenstein family ended when Ulrich IV died at the Battle of Näfels in 1388. His lands were inherited by a number of relatives, but by 1424 the Herrschaft of Haldenstein was owned by Ursula von Hohenems and her husband Peter von Grifensee. The castle was probably abandoned in the 15th century, though there was a Lichtenstein village that was mentioned in 1479. By the middle of the 16th century the castle had fallen into ruin. During the Bündner Wirren, in May 1662, the castle was occupied by 200 men under the command of a Colonel Baldrion. However, after three days their provisions and drinking water were exhausted and they abandoned the castle ruins. In the 20th century, the ruins were cleaned and repaired. Castle site Castle site The castle is built on the top of a narrow hill near Haldenstein with steep cliffs on two sides. North-east of the castle was a ditch that protected the outer wall. The outer wall encloses a rough square courtyard. The original gate in the outer wall was sealed up at some point and the location of the new gate is unknown. A three story living quarters building was built on the highest point of the hilltop. It is an elongated rectangle with a door on the south-east side. As that door opens out onto a cliff, a wooden platform probably connected the door to the courtyard. A vertical joint in the walls of the residence indicates that it was expanded at least once. A large cistern in the living quarters held water for the castle.

Of significance during the conference was the end result of the Forward-looking Strategies for the Advancement of Women being adopted by consensus, unlike the previous two conferences. The conference marked the first time that lesbian rights were introduced in a UN official meeting and the turning-point for violence against women to emerge from being a hidden topic into one which needed to be addressed. Recognizing that the goals of the Decade for Women had not been met, the conference recommended and the General Assembly approved on- going evaluation of women's achievements and failures through the year 2000. History In 1975, the United Nations approved the celebration of International Women's Year. As part of the celebrations they held the First World Conference on Women in 1975 in Mexico City. At that meeting, it was proposed that the following decade be proclaimed UN Decade for Women and follow-up meetings to assess progress be held in 1980 and 1985. The General Assembly adopted a World Plan of Action with recommended targets for governments to integrate women's equality, development and participation in peace initiatives. The mid-point meeting was held in Copenhagen, adding sections to the revised Programme of Action devoted to ensuring women equal access to education, employment opportunities, and adequate health care. Both of the previous conferences had struggled with the divide caused by Cold War politics and the needs of the developing world. The geopolitical backdrop entering into the third conference was still contentious with a worldwide debt crisis soaring in Africa and Latin America, protectionist policies under Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan causing widespread uncertainty, stagnation of the USSR, the arms race build up, and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. The question would be whether the conference could remain focused on women's issues in the face of Soviet accusations that the United States imperialistic and war mongering tactics were undermining the goals of the Decade for Women and the US concerns that the Eastern Bloc attempts at politicization would derail any real improvement in the unique problems faced by women. Official conference The 1985 Conference held from 15 and 26 July in Nairobi, Kenya was the final review of the decade and was led by conference president Margaret Kenyatta. Leticia Shahani, widowed mother of three children and a Philippine diplomat served as the Secretary-General and made the crucial suggestion that off-the-record discussion by delegates would decrease the polarity which had plagued the previous conferences and would allow a more open discussion and lead to compromise. There were 157 countries represented with around 1,400 official delegates, including such prominent delegates as: Phoebe Asiyo of Kenya; Ylva Ericsson of Sweden; Saida Hassan of Djibouti; Elena Lagadinova of Bulgaria; Carolyn McAskie an official at the Canadian International Development Agency; Maureen O'Neill head of the Canadian delegation, who was the coordinator for the Minister of Status of Women; Maureen Reagan, daughter of the US president; Yvette Roudy, the French Minister of Women's Rights; Jean Spautz of Luxembourg; Tom Vraalsen of Norway; among others. After opening remarks by Javier Pérez de Cuéllar, Secretary- General of the United Nations, Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi welcomed participants, expressing his hope that the conference would prove successful and that the objectives for women would not be obscured by distractions. Opening remarks by Margaret Kenyatta on the history of the conference were followed by the general discussion. The general session discussed that women ought to be able to live securely under conditions which granted them equality and justice, but there was a recognition that time is required to change traditional views and make people aware of needed change. It was noted that though legal equality had significantly improved, the disparity between the legal reality and practice was still broad. It was discussed that political tension and instability, as well as conflict added to curtailment of advancement, as did colonialism, racism, and economic stagnation. The conference noted gains in developed nations for parity of education, but significant gaps in girls education versus boys education in developing nations, which impacted future employment options as well. Though some progress had been made on women's employment, it was noted that wage gaps, higher unemployment for women than men, and child care services all contributed to women's instability. As for health, it was acknowledged that as women were typically the health care providers for their families, that more effort must be made to ensure that women were healthy to allow them to continue to serve their families. Inadequate education and health facilities, combined with high birth rates and customs or laws that allowed women to control their own fertility were continuing issues. Projects throughout the decade had drawn awareness to the need to advance women's opportunities and statistic gathering had improved to measure their progress or lack of advancement. Violence against women was a prevalent problem as was the insecurity of indigenous women, elderly women, migrant and refugee women and their children, and rural women. Water and food uncertainty needed to be addressed as women in many areas devoted the majority of their time into unpaid labors to maintain their families. Many UN programs had been expanded over the Decade for Women to incorporate women into their development programs, though it was noted that in general women's participation, and even employment in UN agencies though improved was still below targets. Programs directed at agriculture, economics, children, development, housing, health, technology and many others were examined and overall, improvement had been made in the inclusion of women's access. However, it was noted that making provisions for equality was not the same as attaining real equal opportunity. It was agreed that the cultural role in maintaining sexism and sex stereotypes was a complex issue which would involve dedicated effort to change school curricula and transform media messaging to enable women real access to socio- economic, cultural, legal and political parity. It was noted that for the first time, lesbian rights were introduced at an official UN conference by the Dutch delegate, Annelien Kappeyne van de Coppello. The first committee, under the chair Cecilia López of Colombia, with vice-chairs, Kulsum Saifullah of Pakistan, Olimpia Solomonescu of Romania, and Laetitia van den Assum of the Netherlands, with Rapporteur Diaroumeye Gany of Niger, discussed the first three chapters of the draft Forward-looking Strategies for the Advancement of Women. The second committee, under the chair Rosario Manalo of the Philippines, with vice-chairs, Dame Billie Miller of Barbados, Konjit SineGiorgis of Ethiopia, and Eva Szilagyi of Hungary, with Rapporteur Helen Ware of Australia, discussed the remaining chapters of the Strategies. Both committees recommended approving the draft and a discussion with the general session followed with a line by line review of the document. Though both committees evaluated a number of draft resolutions, there was inadequate time for the general session to review the resolutions and no formal action was taken upon them. Forum Dame Nita Barrow of Barbados chaired and organized the Forum, with the assistance of Edith Ballantyne, president of the United Nations' Conference of Non-governmental Organizations (CONGO). It was attended by more than 15,000 people, of which 60% were representatives from non- industrialized nations, and was held at the University of Nairobi. Unlike the facilities in Copenhagen, in Kenya, a kindergarten was set up for delegates' children. A Peace Tent was set up on the lawn of the university and hosted sessions about conflict and its impact of war on women. Among prominent attendees were: Charlotte Bunch, a US lesbian activist ; Betty Friedan, founder of the National Organization for Women (NOW); Eddah Gachukia head of the Kenyan NGO committee; and others. In addition to the basic themes of the official session, the Forum was asked to address issues concerning women who were poor, elderly, migrant or refugees, youth and address women in media. Round table discussions, workshops and two plenary sessions were established. The array of topics discussed in formal and impromptu meetings was vast, including such topics as childcare; consumer education; credit; family planning; female genital mutilation; the growth of women's studies; legal rights; literacy; media portrayals of women; motherhood and development programs for families; political prisoners; prostitution; systemic discrimination against women; violence; women and development; women and religion; women and technology; as well as lesbian workshops and many other topics in some 1200 workshops scheduled throughout the duration of the conference. The lesbian workshops were the \\"first public discussion of lesbianism in Kenya\\" and resulted in a lesbian press conference in which it was acknowledged that lesbianism wasn't a Westernized concept, but instead effected women's rights throughout the globe. It also resulted in a proposal from one of the Dutch representatives for lesbian rights to be addressed in the official conference documents. In a workshop on development, Helen Safa brought forward the idea that \\"Gender and Development\\" (GAD) should replace the former strategy \\"Women in Development\\" (WID) used by the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women (CSW). This mirrored the NGO, Development Alternatives with Women for a New Era (DAWN)'s belief that WID simply tried to insert women into existing systems without reducing or changing their paternal nature. They recommended that GAD, a strategic long-term planning method, become the new standard, which focused on designing systems specifically related to women and their growth. In addition to the workshops, women were invited to participate in a number of cultural events like the Nairobi Film Forum which showed films and videos by and about women and gave workshops; exhibitions of art and photography; folklore workshops; concerts; martial arts classes; field trips to local villages. Because of the favorable climate conditions, women were able to gather in the open-air for a variety of both scheduled and unscheduled functions to build networks with other participants. The Forum after 1985 shifted in a way that reflected the divide between progressivism versus conservatism, as opposed to the polarized capitalist- socialist divide which had split prior conferences. It was recognized by the participants that global problems were women's issues, but that within their governmental systems, there was either a desire to promote or curtail change. A fundamental shift occurred which recognized that no matter the system, women were subordinate and that promoting a world view from women's perspectives allowed them to transcend their differences and focus on the commonalities they shared. For example, aboriginal women recognized that where ever they were from, they battled for indigenous land rights; Arab and Israeli women discussed the need for peace; women lawyers whether from Islamic countries in South Asia or Catholic countries in Latin America recognized the struggle for women's rights under patriarchal religious systems. Outcomes Forward- looking Strategies for the Advancement of Women was adopted by consensus because of a strategy developed which allowed delegates to express reservations on the basis of individual paragraphs, rather than of the document as a whole. Because of stronger transnational relationships had been forged by the previous two conferences increased understanding by governments of the needs of their women constituents, a willingness of donors to help women integrate into development and increased effectiveness of NGOs in their activism, the list of topics covered in the Strategies was more extensive, including topics such as: agriculture, communications, constitutional and legal issues, education, employment, energy needs, environmental and water concerns, food security, health, housing, science and technology, social services, social and political equality as well as increased participation. The major themes development, equality, and peace were retained as were focuses on racism and refugees. The document endorsed new strategies moving to the year 2000 and replaced the words Apartheid and Zionism with the more general term racism, to maintain the focus on women rather than polarizing issues. Out of the conference forum, several women's groups emerged that would become influential: Asian-Pacific Forum on Women, Law and Development (APWLD), Comité de América Latina y El Caribe para la Defensa de los Derechos de la Mujer (CLADEM), Women in Law and Development in Africa (WILDAF), and the Tanzania Media Women's Association. These were indicative of the types of exponential growth in NGOs dealing with women and their issues which were founded after the conference ended. Many of the organizations were information-sharing groups which pooled their resources and strategies to create innovative solutions. These networks, shifted the flow of activism and scholarship from the global North toward the Southern hemispheres and from top-down social structures to those which forge coalitions across cultural, racial and social boundaries. The conference also marked a turning point in the silence regarding violence against women, which would ultimately lead to the passage of the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women in 1993. Since the objectives of the Decade for Women had not achieved the goals set out in 1975, the United Nations General Assembly made a decision after Nairobi to conduct world surveys on women every five years in a continuing effort to follow-up on the implementation of the Strategies for women. One of the most important outcomes was moving women out of obscurity and establishing specific mechanisms for measuring women's progress.

In a racing career which lasted for a little over six months from April to October 1989 she won three of her six races. After finishing third on her debut she won a maiden race and then defeated top-class fields to take the Ribblesdale Stakes and Irish Oaks. In her two subsequent races she finished second in the Yorkshire Oaks and the Gran Premio del Jockey Club. She was retired from racing at the end of the year and had some success as a broodmare. Background Alidaress was a grey mare bred in Kentucky by Kinderhill Corporation and Sheikh Mohammed's Darley Stud. As a yearling in July 1987 she was auctioned at the Keeneland select sale and bought for $650,000 by the Curragh Bloodstock Agency. She entered the sole ownership of Sheikh Mohammed and was sent to Europe where she was trained throughout her racing career by Henry Cecil at his Warren Place stable in Newmarket, Suffolk. She was sired by the American stallion Alydar who was best known as a racehorse for his rivalry with the Triple Crown winner Affirmed. He later became a very successful breeding stallion whose other offspring included Easy Goer, Alysheba, Turkoman, Strike the Gold, Criminal Type and Miss Oceana. Alydaress's dam Balidaress (from whom she inherited her grey colour) was a moderate racehorse, winning three minor races, but proved a very successful broodmare: her other foals included Desirable (who won the Cheveley Park Stakes and was the dam of Shadayid), Park Appeal, and Balistroika, the dam of Russian Rhythm. Racing career =1989: three-year-old season= Alydaress made her racecourse debut in a seven furlong maiden race at Newmarket Racecourse on 19 April. Ridden by Steve Cauthen she started at odds of 9/1 ina fifteen runner field and finished third behind Pilot and Kerita, beaten four lengths by the winner. On 11 May the filly was stepped up in distance for a maiden over ten furlongs at Sandown Racecourse and started 6/4 favourite against sixteen opponents. After turning into the straight in fourth place she took the lead inside the final furlong and won by a length from Tafila. In June Alydaress was moved up sharply in class to contest the Group 2 Ribblesdale Stakes over one and a half miles at Royal Ascot and started the 4/1 fourth choice in a six-runner field. The undefeated Nearctic Flame started favourite ahead of Roseate Tern (third behind Aliysa and Snow Bride in The Oaks) and Shayraz, while the other two runners were Braiswick (Cheshire Oaks) and the Irish outsider Boldabsa. With Cauthen in the saddle, Alydaress was settled towards the rear of the field as Boldabsa set the pace from Nearctic Flame, but made a forward move early in the straight. She took the lead a furlong out and quickly went clear of her rivals to win by two and a half lengths from Roseate Tern, with the favourite a further length and a half back in third. Alydaress was then matched against the Epsom Oaks winner Aliysa in the Irish Oaks at the Curragh on 15 July. Aliysa was made the 4/7 favourite while Alydaress, ridden for the first and only time by Mick Kinane started at odds of 7/4. The other three runners were Petite Ile, the winner of the Listed Oaks Trial at Phoenix Park Racecourse and the long-priced outsiders Royal Climber and Caerless Writing. The pace was set by Caerless Writing from Aliysa with Kinane tracking the favourite in third. The favourite went to the front entering the straight but Alydaress took the lead approaching the final furlong and held off a rally from Aliysa to win by three quarters of a length with Petite Ile a head away in third. Aliysa was later disqualified from the Epsom Oaks after testing positive for a banned substance (camphor): her second place at the Curragh was not affected. In August Alydaress started odds-on favourite for the Yorkshire Oaks but was beaten one and a half lengths by Roseate Tern with Petite Ile in third place. After a break of over two months the filly returned to the track when she was sent to Italy and matched against older horses and male opposition in the Group 1 Gran Premio del Jockey Club over 2400 metres at San Siro Racecourse in Milan. She finished second, beaten half a length by the four-year-old colt Assatis, with Yellow King (Gran Premio d'Italia) in third. Breeding record At the end of her racing career, Alydaress became a broodmare for her owner's stud. She produced at least six foals and four winners between 1992 and 2000: *Bakers Gate, a dark bay or brown colt, foaled in 1992, sired by Danzig. Failed to win in five races. *Allurement, bay filly, 1994, by Sadler's Wells. Won two races including Prix Cléopâtre. *Laiyl, grey filly, 1996, by Nureyev. Won one race: dam of Layman (Prix de Cabourg, Sovereign Stakes). *Amellnaa, bay filly, 1997, by Sadler's Wells. Won one race. *Appreciation, brown filly, 1998, by Caerleon.

Around 2009, expansion started and was competed on 12 October 2010, after the municipality split into two and its field became artificial as the grass was dry and in bad shape due to the climate that is not favorable for natural grass. Before, some clubs from the parish and later also the municipality sometimes trained at the field before its matches. A row of seats would also dominate the north side.

Among other contributions, he is the developer of pseudo amino acid composition (PseAAC), used in computational biology for proteomics analysis and pseudo K-tuple nucleotide composition (PseKNC) for genome analysis. He is the father of James Chou. In 2020, it was revealed that Chou had been removed from the editorial board of the Journal of Theoretical Biology and banned as a reviewer for the journal Bioinformatics for repeatedly manipulating the peer-review process to gain citations to his own papers. The editors of the Journal of Theoretical Biology referred to it as \\"scientific misconduct of the highest order\\".  Research  In 1972, he and his co- workers, by taking into account the spatial factor and force field factor between the enzyme and its substrate, reported that the upper limit of diffusion-controlled reaction of enzyme or diffusion limited enzyme is one order of magnitude higher than the conventional estimation, and can be used to elucidate some surprisingly high reaction rates in molecular biology. In 1977, he predicted the existence of low-frequency phonons in proteins, followed by developing the theory of low-frequency collective motion in proteins and DNA after it had been confirmed by Raman spectroscopy.; In 1995, he proposed and proved a theorem on invariance for addressing some problems often encountered in bioinformatics and cheminformatics. In 1996, he proposed the distorted key theory for guiding how to design peptide drugs. In 2011, he proposed the 5-steps rule, that has been used for proteome and genome analyses as well as predicting posttranslational modification sites in protein, RNA, and DNA sequences. As of December 2019, Chou has published over 720 scientific papers in enzyme kinetics, graphical methods in biology, protein structure prediction and function, low-frequency collective motion in macromolecules, proteome and genome analyses, and identification of posttranslational modification sites in biological sequences.  Editorial roles  Chou has served multiple editorial roles, including Editor-in-Chief (2008–2019) of The Open Bioinformatics Journal, and he has been on the Editorial Board of the Journal of Theoretical Biology (2005–2019), the Journal of Biomedicine and Biotechnology (2008–2014), and The Open Biochemistry Journal (2007–2019) among others. He is currently an Honorary Editor for The Open Bioinformatics Journal (2020–present) and Associate Editor for Medicinal Chemistry (2004–present).  Recognition  Chou's papers have been widely cited. According to Web of Science, his h-index is 135. He has been continuously for five years (2014, 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018) selected by Thomson Reuters and Clarivate Analytics as ISI Highly Cited Researcher. However, it is notable that many of Chou's citations may be from manipulation of the editorial and refereeing process, per below controversy.  Editorial misconduct and citation abuse  In 2019, the journal Bioinformatics published an editorial detailing the actions of a reviewer who engaged in coercive citations. In 2020, the Journal of Theoretical Biology published a further editorial claiming that the same reviewer was on their editorial board and had also engaged in coercive citation malpractice, and had engaged in further breaches of scientific conduct. The journal Nature later revealed that the unnamed individual is Kuo-Chen Chou.

The local quarry features tough stones used for fortress walls. The only well preserved object from the time of the despot Stefan, is the Saint Archangel Mihailo orthodox church just under the hill.

His early research involving the Immunoglobulin E (IgE) pathway and antibody-based therapeutics lead to the development of omalizumab (also known as Xolair), a medication that has been approved for the treatment of severe allergic asthma and severe chronic spontaneous urticaria. Chang is a cofounder of Tanox, a biopharmaceutical company specialized in anti-IgE therapies for the treatment of allergic diseases. After Tanox's tripartite partnership with Genentech and Novartis was forged in 1996, Chang returned to his alma mater, the National Tsing Hua University in Taiwan and served as the Dean (1996–1999) of the College of Life Sciences. Chang was appointed by the Taiwanese government as President of the Development Center for Biotechnology (DCB) in 2000, and served as a Science and Technology Advisor of the Executive Yuan from 2002 to 2006. From 2006 to 2016, he was tenured as Distinguished Research Fellow at the Genomics Research Center, Academia Sinica. He founded Immunwork, Inc. in 2014. Education Chang was born and raised in Zhongli District, Taoyuan County, Taiwan in 1947. His ancestry traces back to Mei County, Guangdong Province, China. His father Chang Chun-an (張均安) spent his entire career working for the Taiwan Railroad Bureau. Chang's mother, Yeh Ting-mei (葉丁妹), was an elementary school teacher, who worked as a housewife after marriage to raise five children. Chang obtained a bachelor's degree (1970) and master's degree (1972) in chemistry at the National Tsing Hua University. Afterwards, Chang received a four-year fellowship at Harvard University, where he did thesis research on protein degradation in the muscle during fasting with Alfred L. Goldberg. Chang received his Ph.D. in 1977, and did postdoctoral research on T cell immune mechanisms with Herman Eisen at the Center for Cancer Research at MIT from 1977 to 1980.  Career  = Contributions to biomedicine = Chang invented anti-IgE therapeutics in 1987. Alt URL IgE plays a central role in the initiation of hypersensitivity reactions in the human body, and is responsible for allergic diseases that affect 20-40% of the population in developed countries. Originating from Chang's research, antibodies that target the IgE- mediated allergic pathway have proven effective in the treatment of various allergic diseases. Among these anti-IgE drugs are: Omalizumab (Xolair), approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of allergic asthma and chronic spontaneous urticaria (primarily an autoimmune disease); Talizumab (TNX-901), shown to be effective in treating allergic rhinitis (hay fever) and peanut allergy; and Ligelizumab, a high-affinity TNX-901 under active clinical development at Novartis. In 1993, Chang's patent was granted for his discovery of CεmX, a unique region on human membrane-bound IgE (mIgE), leading to another therapeutic approach to treating IgE-mediated diseases. Apart from anti-IgE therapeutics, Chang also first proposed the concept and methodology of the antibody matrix in 1983. By aligning antibodies of distinct specificities in a matrix-like manner, scientists are able to detect and quantify multiple antigens in one simultaneous attempt. Thereafter, many other types of microarrays emerged, including DNA microarrays and protein microarrays, among others. = Work in biotechnology = In March 1986, Tse Wen and Nancy T. Chang founded Tanox, Inc., where he served as Vice President of Research & Development (1986–1996) and director of the board from 1986 until Tanox was acquired by Genentech in 2007. In order to secure funding for a start-up company based on family funds, the Changs sought collaboration with Genentech in 1989, sending data and samples of early anti-IgE antibody, but talks with Genentech were unsuccessful. In 1990, Tanox partnered with Ciba- Geigy (which later merged with Sandoz to form Novartis) and started developing Talizumab (TNX-901). A few years later, legal disputes arose as the Changs discovered that Genentech launched its own anti-IgE program, developing what now became known as Omalizumab (Xolair). The Changs took it to the court in 1993 and accused Genentech of misappropriating its work, but the legal battle dragged on. Chang was granted patents in 1995. In 1996, Tanox and Genentech settled out of court, with Genentech paying Tanox a compensation. The two companies and Novartis agreed to jointly develop Xolair, under the reasoning that Genentech had better manufacturing processes to produce antibodies in large quantities. Chang not only proposed the theory behind anti-IgE therapeutics, but also actively participated in the phase I and II clinical trials of Talizumab from 1990 to 1996. Meanwhile, after the settlement in 1996, Tanox continued to develop Talizumab, not for allergic asthma but for peanut allergy. In 2001–2003, Talizumab entered phase II clinical trials for peanut allergy, and obtained very positive results. Genentech, however, sued Tanox, arguing that their contract in 1996 should prevent Tanox from developing any potential competitor drugs to Xolair. Again, the dispute rose to the court. Although Tanox won the consent in a federal district court, it lost the arbitration that followed, and the development of Talizumab for peanut allergy was suspended. = Post-Tanox = In 2014, Chang started the company Immunwork in Taiwan. = Investing attempts = Chang tried his hand at investing, purchasing large quantities of derivatives under Deutsche Bank's advice. Unfortunately, his scientific expertise did not translate into financial acumen, and as a result he lost $50 million in total. Chang initiated a counter-claim for the amount lost in response to the bank's claim for a sum of $1.7 million. While successful in his claim at the High Court, the decision was reversed on appeal, where the Singapore Court of Appeal stated that he had the requisite knowledge of shares to not rely on the advice of the bank. He also had to repay a $1.7 million debt incurred from investment losses. This case has since become a point of authority in contract law. http://www.singaporelaw.sg/sglaw/laws-of-singapore/case-law/free-law/court-of- appeal-judgments/15349-deutsche-bank-ag-v-chang-tse-wen-and-another- appeal-2013-sgca-49  Awards and honors  * Honorary Fellow Award from the American College of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology (ACAAI), 2004. * Nature Biotechnology's shortlist of personalities who made the most significant contribution to biotech in the past 10 years. * Honorary Fellow Award from American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology (AAAAI), 2007. * The World Academy of Sciences (TWAS) Prize in Medical Sciences, 2014.

It is the oldest known baleen whale, and was probably a suction feeder of small prey on the seafloor.  Taxonomy  Mystacodon is the oldest known baleen whale, the holotype specimen dating to 36.4 million year ago to the Priabonian of the latest Eocene. The holotype, MUSM 1917, comprises the braincase, teeth, the spinal cord excluding the sacral vertebrae, some fin bones, and the left hip bone. It was originally classified into its own family, Mystacodontidae, but it was moved to the family Llanocetidae in 2018 alongside Llanocetus–the second- oldest baleen whale–and an undescribed New Zealand specimen OU GS10897. The genus name, Mystacodon is said to be derived from ancient Greek mystacos \\"moustache\\" and odontos \\"tooth\\". The proper words in ancient Greek for \\"moustache\\" and \\"tooth\\" are however μύσταξ (') and ὀδούς (').Liddell, H.G. & Scott, R. (1940). A Greek-English Lexicon. revised and augmented throughout by Sir Henry Stuart Jones. with the assistance of. Roderick McKenzie. Oxford: Clarendon Press. The use of the ancient Greek word for \\"moustache\\" is a reference to the taxon Mysticeti, the baleen whales, The species name, selenensis comes from Selene, the Greek goddess of the moon, in reference to the locality of the Yumaque Formation it was found in, Playa Media Luna–\\"Half Moon Beach\\".  Description  Mystacodon probably measured around in length, which is larger than nearly all contemporaneous baleen whales. Compared to the more ancient archaeocete whales, the snout is much more flattened, and the nostrils are much further up the snout. This flattening shows reduced function of the incisor teeth and grasping capabilities, and the increased length of the head allowed a greater mouth volume. It is uncertain if the whale had any baleen in its mouth, and, unlike archaeocetes, it lacks a sagittal crest, indicating a reduction of the temporalis muscle which is used in biting. The eye sockets are proportionally larger, are oriented farther forward, and are slightly more elevated. The premolars and molars have two roots. The humerus in the arm is about as long as the shoulder blade and much longer than the radius and ulna in the forearm, a condition seen in modern slow-moving whales. The muscles were probably constantly flexed, a condition not seen in any other whale species, perhaps to aid in moving along the seafloor or maintaining a position in the water. The hip is more similar to basilosaurid archaeocetes, with a short ilium and a defined hip joint.  Paleobiology  Mystacodon was likely a suction feeder, a transitional stage of baleen whale evolution between the predatory hunting of archaeocetes and the filter feeding of more modern baleen whales. The whale may have been a bottom feeder and targeted small prey. A Myliobatis eagle ray stinger and clupeiform forage fish scales–a group that includes herring, sardines, and anchovies–were found around the holotype. Myliobatis may have been a potential prey item.

It was the childhood home of Irish rebel leader, and later President of Dáil Éireann, President of the Executive Council of the Irish Free State, Taoiseach and President of Ireland, Éamon de Valera (1882–1975). Location De Valera's Cottage is located 1 km (0.6 mi) north of Bruree, on the road to Athlacca. History The house is a labourer's cottage, built in 1885 by Kilmallock Poor Law Union. Born in New York City in 1882, de Valera (then known as George, and later Edward or Eddie) was brought to Ireland by his uncle Ned in 1885, following the death of his father Juan Vivion de Valera, and lived at this cottage. Even after his mother remarried, de Valera remained in Ireland, living at this cottage outside Bruree with his grandmother Elizabeth Coll, her son Patrick and her daughter Hannie. De Valera worked hard on the family farm, a mere half acre;The 25-inch OS map gives its area as 0.567 acre (0.23 ha) they also used \\"the long farm\\", grazing cattle on the roadside grass. This was illegal, so de Valera kept watch for Royal Irish Constabulary policemen and had to pretend to be moving the cattle across the road if the police saw him. As a teenager he walked from there to C.B.S. Charleville every day, a distance of 11 km (7 miles) each morning and evening (the family could not afford a bicycle). De Valera regularly visited the cottage in later life. It is today a museum containing de Valera memorabilia, including the trunk he brought back from New York.

He was a leader of Venezuela’s Partido Comunista de Venezuela, PCV (Communist Party of Venezuela) and a founding member of the Movimiento al Socialismo (MAS), but withdrew from the MAS in 1998 after the party’s leadership backed the candidacy of Hugo Chávez, for the presidency. Since 1999 he has been outspoken in his opposition to the governments of Chávez and Nicolás Maduro and has served as president and vice president of the Association of Retired Members of Parliament and the Social Welfare Institute for Members of Parliament. Biography Rafael Guerra Ramos is the son of rural farmers, Marcos Guerra Rondon and Carmen Trinidad Ramos. Was born in the rural town of El Alacrán, in Guárico, which lies in the plains region of Venezuela. After his mother’s passing in 1938, he moved with his father and sister, Carmen Martina Guerra Ramos, to the small town of Pariaguan in the southern part of the Anzoátegui. After completing elementary school, in 1946 his father sent him to Caracas to continue his secondary education, first at the Fermin Toro School and then at the Alcazar school. Later, he also graduated in accounting from the Accounting Institute of Caracas. In 1959, Guerra married Ana Orista Daza Pereira, the niece of Maria Pereira de Daza, a prestigious political leader and founder of the Democratic Action party in Lara. They divorced in 1985. His second marriage was to Flor America Brandt, in 1986. Rafael Guerra Ramos has three children: Boishe Rafael Balza, Rafael Guerra Daza and Olga Teresa Guerra Daza. =Political career= Rafael Guerra Ramos in 1952. Upon moving to Caracas and entering the Fermin Toro school, Rafael Guerra Ramos became involved in civic, cultural and political activities, which resulted in his election by his classmates as an independent delegate to the so-called Republica Fermintorina, which the school founded to develop the cultural life of the institution. He began his political activity in 1949 when he joined the Communist party’s youth group. During the dictatorship of Marcos Pérez Jiménez, Guerra suffered persecution, torture, imprisonment and had to go underground for his militancy in the PCV. He was first imprisoned in 1952 in the National Security police headquarters and the Carcel Modelo de Propatria prison. The following year, he was again imprisoned in La Modelo for a year and half. After being released from jail, he was exiled to Mexico in 1954. At the end of that same year, under orders from the polit-bureau of the PCV he was sent on a top secret and highly dangerous mission to an undisclosed location on the Colombian- Venezuelan border and lived clandestinely in the Colombian city of Cucuta until 1956. During this time he constructed a security protocol that was used to aid the safe exit of numerous Venezuelan communists to Colombia and other countries. In December 1955 this clandestine protocol was used to safeguard Pompeyo Márquez (aka Santos Yorme), who was the acting Secretary General of the PCV, in his journey to the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the USSR. It was at this congress that the Soviet Secretary General Nikita Khrushchev presented his denunciation of the crimes committed by Joseph Stalin. By 1957 Guerra Ramos was back in Caracas and the PCV leadership gave him the mission to reorganize the party in Lara. Under his direction the Regional Organizational Committee was established and worked very closely with the Patriotic Union, which played a major role in overthrowing the Pérez Jiménez dictatorship. With the return of democracy and until he withdrew from the PCV, Guerra continued in the party leadership in Lara as either Secretary General or Secretary of Organization. When in 1961 the party decided to engage in armed struggle against the government, Rafael Guerra went along and helped to organize the guerillas in Lara. Because of these activities, he was incarcerated again in 1966, first in a cell of the Palacio Blanco (in front of the Miraflores Presidential Palace) in Caracas, later at the El Tocuyo Military Base, and finally in the National Prison in Maracaibo, but was released that same year after presenting his own defense before the Permanent Martial Court. The 1968 Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia led many to question orthodox Marxism and the Soviet model within the PCV. Guerra himself took a very critical position on the guerrilla strategy as well as the party’s present and future. =Parliamentary career= Along with party leaders as Pompeyo Márquez and Teodoro Petkoff, Guerra resigned from the PCV in 1970, and in 1971 became a member of the Constituent Congress of the Movimiento Al Socialismo (MAS). He was a principal member of the first National Directorate and continued his political leadership in Lara. As a candidate for the MAS, he participated for the first time in presidential and parliamentary elections in 1973 and won the seat as a deputy for Lara. The party unanimously elected him as Director of the Parliamentary Caucus, a position which he held again in 1978, 1990 and 1991. During his many years as a member of Parliament, he presided the Sub-Committees for Human Rights, Penitentiary Affairs, Defense and Tourism. He also represented Venezuela in numerous parliamentary delegations abroad. To this day Guerra Ramos continues to defend the rights of the retired members of Parliament, acting as the president of their association and currently serves as Vice President of the Instituto de Prevision Social del Parlamento (Institute of Social Provision of Parliament).

Forests located near the coast or estuaries may also be at risk of dying through saltwater poisoning, if invading seawater reduces the amount of freshwater that deciduous trees receive for sustenance. Looking at the stratigraphic record, it is possible to reconstruct a series of events that lead to the creation of a ghost forest. Where, in a convergent plate boundary, there has been orogenic uplift, followed by earthquakes resulting in subsidence and tsunamis, altering the coast and creating a ghost forest. Formations =Sea level changes= Forest immersed in water at Inks Lake State Park, Texas, USA When there is a change in sea level, coastal regions may become inundated with sea water. This can alter coastal areas and kill large areas of trees, leaving behind what is called a “ghost forest.” This type of ghost forest may develop in a variety of environments and in many different places. In the southern US coastal marshes are expanding into dry wooded areas, killing trees and leaving behind areas of dead trees called snags. Regions of the US at or below sea level are more susceptible to tides. Coastal features affected by changing sea levels are indirectly affected by climate change. With global sea level rise, the coastlines in the southern US are being altered and leave behind salt marshes filled with dead and dying trees in some areas. =Tectonic activity= Ghost forest in winter, at the former site of Portage, Alaska, which was destroyed by the 1964 Alaska earthquake. Ghost forests can also result from tectonic activity. In the Pacific northwest, there is a large, active subduction zone called the Cascadia Subduction Zone. Here, there is a convergent plate boundary where the Gorda plate, the Juan de Fuca plate, and the Explorer plate are being subducted underneath the North American plate. As these plates attempt to slide past one another, they often become stuck. For several hundred years the plates will be locked in place and the tension builds. As a result of this tension there is orogenic uplift. This is where the tension building between two converging plates gets translated into vertical uplift of the mountains on the coast. Orogenic uplift is usually associated with earthquakes and mountain building. But then, every 500+ years, there is large earthquake in the Cascadia Subduction Zone and all that built up tension is released. The release of this tension results in what is called subsidence. And with subsidence the once elevated coastline drops down several meters to below sea level. Here, sea level has not changed, but the coastline has been deformed, making it susceptible to tides. Areas of the coastline can be inundated with sea water, creating marshes and leaving behind ghost forests. =Tsunamis= Neskowin Ghost Forest In addition to subsidence, large earthquakes can also cause tsunamis. It is possible to determine that ghost forests in the Pacific northwest were created by earthquakes and subsidence by looking at the stratigraphic record. Digging down into the earth, adjacent to a ghost forest, different layers of sediment can reveal the stratigraphy in a ghost forest. Layers of material filled with organic material can indicate where the old forest floor was located prior to subsidence. On top of the layer there will often be a large sandy deposit. This layer represents the tsunami event, where the coast was flooded with sea water that is filled with sandy sediment. Superimposed on top of the tsunami deposit will be a muddy deposit, representative of an area subjected to ocean tides. =Global warming= The mountain pine beetle, Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins, is a significant ecological force at the landscape level. The majority of the life cycle is spent as larvae feeding in the phloem tissue (inner bark) of host pine trees. This feeding activity eventually girdles and kills successfully attacked trees. Global warming has result in increased mountain pine beetle activity. These direct and indirect effects potentially have devastating consequences for whitebark and other high-elevation pines.

The Club was the first black women's club in Boston. The organization was especially well-known for the conflict caused when Ruffin attempted to desegregate the General Federation of Women's Clubs (GFWC) in 1900.  History  The Woman's Era Club was the first African-American women's club in Boston and was founded by Josephine St. Pierre Ruffin. The club, depending on the source, was founded anytime between 1892 and 1894. The name of the club came from the paper, The Woman's Era, though it had also earlier been called \\"The New Era Club.\\" There were 113 founding members and Ruffin served as the president. Ruffin remained president of the Woman's Era Club until 1903. In addition to black women, the club also admitted white women. The purpose of the club was to do charity work, personal improvement and philanthropy. At the time, it was one of the largest women's clubs for African Americans at the time. Topics that the club discussed included lynching and women's suffrage. Ruffin wanted the club to help with \\"racial uplift\\" and also \\"urban progressivism and the crusade for the rights of women.\\" It was also important to the club to publicize progress that black people made. The club's motto was \\"make the world better,\\" which were also the last words of Lucy Stone. In 1895, the Woman's Era Club proposed a national conference for African-American women. This led to the National Conference of the Colored Women of America, the first conference of black women in the United States which took place in July 1895. In 1901, the club moved its headquarters to Tremont Temple in Boston. Some sources state that Ruffin was president of the club until 1903, however, The New York Age reported that Ruffin was still president of the club in 1910. In addition, they were now meeting at the Robert Gould Shaw House. The Woman's Era Club eventually merged with the National Association of Colored Women's Clubs (NACW). = Conflict with GFWC = The Woman's Era Club joined the Massachusetts State Federation of Women's Clubs in 1895. Later, the club was admitted to the General Federation of Women's Clubs (GFWC) because the president, Rebecca Douglas Lowe, did not realize that she had admitted a black women's club. By April 1900, Lowe had mailed the certificate of GFWC membership to Ruffin and the Woman's Era Club had paid their dues. In June 1900, Ruffin attended the fifth biennial convention of the GFWC in Milwaukee as a delegate for the Woman's Era Club. Ruffin was offered a delegate seat as a representative from the two other mostly white women's clubs instead, but she demanded that Woman's Era Club be recognized. The Massachusetts state federation of clubs then introduced a resolution that the GFWC formally admit the Woman's Era Club. However, this resolution was defeated by women in several southern state delegations led by the Georgia state federation. Ruffin attempted to sue GFWC and hoped that Booker T. Washington would help, but the suit never happened and Washington did not help. The attempt of the Woman's Era Club to join the GFWC became a contested issue among the clubwomen. Ruffin was sent to be a delegate of the next GFWC convention in 1902. Publicity about the controversy, known as the \\"Ruffin incident,\\" was generally complimentary to Ruffin and to black women in general. The Decatur Herald wrote that Ruffin's request for membership helped bring a positive light to the question of progress for black women in the United States. However, The Evening Transcript on the other hand, wrote that black women's clubs in the South did not approve of Ruffin's move because they did not want to create discord or lose the support of white women's clubs who were helping in their own communities.

He was a pioneer in the emerging specialty of paediatrics and neonatal medicine; and he developed one of the first neonatal intensive care units in London. In 1959 he was appointed as a senior registrar, then five years later as a senior lecturer, at St Thomas’ Hospital in London. It was here that he developed a profound interest in the care of premature infants. This was a time of rapid medical advances, particularly in respiratory support, that were at last making the survival of premature newborn babies a reality. Barrie pioneered advances in resuscitation of the newborn, publishing his seminal paper on the subject in The Lancet in 1963. One of the concerns at this time was the worry that using high pressures of oxygen could be damaging to newborn lungs. Barrie developed an underwater safety valve in the oxygen circuit. The tubes were originally made of rubber, but these had the potential to cause irritation to sensitive newborn tracheas: Barrie switched to plastic, which was fashioned from a pre-cut roll and so had an inherent curvature. This plastic tube, based on his design, was known as the ‘St Thomas’s tube’. In 1966 Barrie was appointed consultant paediatrician to Charing Cross Hospital in Fulham. At Charing Cross, Barrie continued his ground-breaking and pioneering work in the care of the preterm infant. He ran a renowned department and built his special care baby unit (SCBU): this neonatal unit became a hot bed of innovation and expertise. At Charing Cross Hospital, Barrie was in charge of the paediatric research laboratory – here he conducted research into neonatal respiratory physiology and intensive care. He raised funds for an ambulance that could collect babies requiring intensive care from other hospitals and bring them back to Charing Cross; this was the first - and at the time the only - dedicated neonatal ambulance in the country. He was made head of the department of child health in 1983. Barrie was an early member of the British Paediatric Association, which was to become the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health. He was a founder member of the Neonatal Society and the British Association of Perinatal Medicine.

In 1896, Shishmanova published a book in France as part of series entitled A collection of folk songs and tales. The series collected folk tales, songs and myths less studied or researched nations and ethnicities. She wrote for other Bulgarian publications such as Bulgarian review, Freedom of opinion, Bulgarian collection, Peace, Journal of Women, and Women's Voice. She wrote in Ukrainian for Ukraine, Rada, Dilo and New Ukraine. These pieces were reviews of theatre and music scene in Bulgaria and abroad. Shishmanova wrote for the French newspaper La Bulgarie for many years, promoting Bulgarian culture, literature and arts. She wrote numerous articles on the politics in Bulgaria, Ukraine, the Balkans and Western Europe, as well on the scientific achievements of the time, and on women's rights in Bulgaria. Shishmanova was a member of the Association of Women with Higher Education, was a founder of the Club of the Bulgarian writers in 1930, and the League of English speakers, Society for Peace and Freedom where she served as the vice-president of the Bulgarian section of the International League for Peace and Freedom. She was also a member of the Bulgarian Women's Union and the Society of Esperanto in Bulgaria. Shishmanova was a member of the board of St Patrick’s Orphanage in Sofia, which was founded by Pierce O'Mahony for Bulgarian orphans and the victims of the Ilinden–Preobrazhenie Uprising from Macedonia and Edirne. She was the vice-president of the first music company based in Sofia. Shishmanova died in Sofia on 6 January 1937. Legacy Much of the advancement of women's rights in Bulgaria has been attributed to Shishmanova. In response to the then Higher School in Sofia (now Sofia University) not accepting women, she wrote the article The Woman and the university, which advocated for the rights of women to be educated for their own good, and that of wider society. In 1922, she campaigned against the unpopular Labour Service Act which required girls aged 16 to perform community service for a period of six months. She advocated strongly with others for the development of Bulgarian theatre, aiding in the construction of a special building for the needs of the theatre in Sofia, and organising lectures by specialists before performances to prepare the public with information about the author, themes, or central ideas. Some of the reforms Shishmanova put forward in her articles were then picked up by Ivan Shishmanov during his tenure as Minister of Education in the Office of General Racho Petrov. Bulgarian poet Dobri Nemirov dedicated a poem to Shishmanova and her legacy.

Reception  Holden made an impression on a number of American captains of industry, and politicians. One of them was David Packard, who in a 1952 interview recalled Holden's views on management. He told the reporter: :\\"Somehow, we got into a discussion of the responsibility of management... Holden made the point that management’s responsibility is to the shareholders -- that’s the end of it. And I objected. I said, ‘I think you’re absolutely wrong. Management has a responsibility to its employees, it has a responsibility to its customers, it has a responsibility to the community at large.’ And they almost laughed me out of the room.\\"Ward Winslow (1994).

One of Holden's more notable students was the Republican politician. Victor Veysey, who did his PhD work at Stanford and became Holden's assistant. In a 1993-94 interview he shared the following memory of that time: :\\"I got a teaching assistantship with Professor Paul Holden, who was the outstanding teacher in industrial management at Stanford Business School. That went along pretty well. I was taking a mixture of courses to round out what I didn’t have, which would give me a minor in engineering and a major in industrial management. Then, also, I took quite a few industrial-relations courses at that time with Paul Eliel of their Industrial Relations Center. Paul Holden called two or three of us in one day and said, “Well, I’ve got news for you; I’m going to Washington.” He had been appointed to head up the Materials Allocation Program for the government. And he said, “Now, here’s the textbook, and here’s the class, and here’s the roll book, and you’re on.” [Laughter] That was quite a surprise.

The final play written by Bernhard, it premiered on November 4, 1988 and sparked one of the biggest theater scandals in the history of post-war Austria. History Heldenplatz was commissioned by Claus Peymann, director of the Viennese Burgtheater, to be performed for the hundredth anniversary of the theater's opening. The year also coincided with the 50th anniversary of the Anschluss when Nazi Germany annexed Austria. Heldenplatz is the square where Adolf Hitler was greeted on March 15, 1938 and he addressed thousands of jubilant Austrians. Bernhard wrote his play as a tragic reflection on the obsessive politics of nationalism, the denial of the past and the continued anti-Semitism within modern Austria. Although the play was to be published only after the premiere, selected extracts were leaked to the press in the days prior to the first performance. The quotations, taken out of context, caused a public uproar and Bernhard was vilified. Heldenplatz was also understood as a veiled attack on the election of Austria's president Kurt Waldheim who called the play \\"an insult to the Austrian people.\\" Demonstrations were held and Bernhard, in one instance, was physically assaulted. Bernhard's sudden death by a heart attack only a few months after the premiere only increased media attention on the play's subject. Summary It is the day of the funeral of Josef Schuster, a Jewish university professor. Through the three-act play, his wife Hedwig Schuster, their children, Olga, Anna and Luka, his brother, Robert Schuster, Mrs. Zittel, the housekeeper and Herta, the maid, discuss Josef. it is revealed that fifty years after March 15, 1938, Josef could no longer bear the clamor that always resonated in his head. The couple had decided to return to Oxford where they had lived for ten years in exile before returning to Vienna \\"for the love of music\\". A few days before their departure, considering that \\"now everything is worse than fifty years ago\\" and that \\"there are now more Nazis in Vienna than in 1938\\", Joseph Schuster commits suicide by throwing himself out the window from their apartment overlooking Heldenplatz. Thomas Bernhard, through his characters, criticizes the continued anti-semitism in Austria: where he could not \\"listen to Beethoven without thinking of Nuremberg\\" and where \\"he did not foresee that the Austrians after the war would be much more hateful and anti-Semitic than before the war.\\" English Publication Heldenplatz was first translated by Gita Honegger and published in issue 33 of Conjunctions in 1999.

Founded in 1975, the FMF was established to further human rights and democracy through the principles of an open society, the rule of law, personal liberty, and economic liberalism and press freedom. According to The Mercury editor Fikile-Ntsikelelo Moya, the FMF is a \\"libertarian think tank\\" wanting \\"unfettered capitalism\\" which \\"eschews all forms of state intervention in the life of the individual citizen\\". In 1987, Leon Louw, the FMF's Executive Director, described the work of the FMF as follows: :\\"We mobilise public opinion, we lobby, we fight government, any government, and make representations and submissions. Our objective is to create a climate of public opinion among politicians, radical groups and unions in favour of free markets.\\" In 2017 the Think Tanks and Civil Societies Program of the University of Pennsylvania ranked the FMF as the 123rd best think tank in the category \\"Top Think Tanks Worldwide – (U.S. and non-U.S.),\\" the 21st best think tank in Sub-Saharan Africa, and the 109th best \\"independent think tank\\" in the world, for the year 2016. From 2012 until May 2014, businessman Herman Mashaba, who is currently the Executive Mayor of Johannesburg, served as chairman of the foundation's board. He stepped down from his position when he joined the Democratic Alliance as an \\"ordinary card- carrying member,\\" citing the need for the foundation to remain politically impartial. Leon Louw is a co-founder of and is the Executive Director of the FMF. The other directors of the FMF are economist Jasson Urbach, accountant Eustace Davie, and Temba Nolutshungu, a pioneer of black consciousness and a participant in the struggle against apartheid. The FMF is an Atlas Network partner.  History  = Apartheid era = The \\"South African Free Market Foundation\\" was founded in August 1975 \\"to promote free enterprise\\" in South Africa. The initiative was spearheaded by the Association of Chambers of Commerce of South Africa (Assocom), which sought a way \\"to promote the free market economy in South Africa\\". According to the Sunday Express, the FMF was founded by \\"a group of five young professional men\\", because \\"Government [was] progressing inexorably toward a greater degree of control over traditional free market forces\\". Louw led the steering committee responsible for the establishment of the foundation. The steering committee consisted of FE Emary, M Lillard, Leon Louw, Fred Macaskill, André Spies and Marc Swanepoel\\". When asked about its view of South Africa's apartheid policies, the first chairman of the FMF, Lu Sher (who was President of Assocom), said that the FMF \\"would like to see restrictions on the movement and use of labour, capital, and goods, phased out wherever possible\\". Sher continued, saying the FMF was generally \\"limiting [itself] to the economic field, but there we believe that the fewer restrictions the better, and that all races should be able to compete freely in all sectors\\". The foundation published a monthly classical liberal magazine, The Individualist, from its founding in 1975 until October 1976, when the FMF was officially registered as a non-profit organisation in South Africa. The magazine was from then on published independently. The Individualist is currently defunct. The FMF would later publish its own journal, Free Market,FMF press statement. \\"New magazine on S.A. market\\". 24 March 1980. which was released six times a year. Senator Owen Horwood (Minister of Finance) and Gerhard de Kock (Governor of the Reserve Bank) were among its contributors. Free Market is also currently defunct. In May 1976, the FMF moved offices to 401 City Centre, 36 Joubert Street, Johannesburg. In November 1976, after the FMF's registration as an NPO, it was reformed into the \\"Free Market Foundation (Southern Africa)\\". Dirk Hertzog, Chairman of the Oude Meester Group and President of the South African Society of Marketers, was chosen as chairman of FMF's interim executive committee. By this time, the FMF \\"had the backing\\" of Assocom, SASOM, the South African Federated Chamber of Industries (SAFCI), the National African Federation Chamber of Commerce (NAFCOC), and the Afrikaanse Handelsinstituut (AHI). The Clarion magazine also \\"[pledged] its full support to the whole concept\\" of the FMF. At its inaugural congress in 1977, Professor Stephan du Toit Viljoen, Chairman of the Bantu Investment Corporation and the Bank of Lisbon (today Mercantile Bank), was elected as the FMF's first president. In his inaugural address, Du Toit Viljoen claimed that the cause for the unrest throughout South Africa was because black South Africans could not identify with the political and economic system in which they lived. According to Du Toit Viljoen, it was necessary to involve all of South Africa's races in the development of the free enterprise system, to avoid this unrest. To this end, Du Toit Viljoen called for the progressive removal of discriminatory laws, improving education facilities, and improving the quality of life by providing home ownership; and that \\"the gradually increasing involvement of all races in the administration of the country would be an essential corresponding development in the political field\\". At the time, André Spies was the secretary of the FMF. In March and April 1978, the FMF and the School of Business Leadership at the University of South Africa hosted Friedrich A. Hayek, the Nobel Prize-winning economist, on a visit to South Africa. Hayek addressed a public meeting at the Carlton Hotel on Wednesday, 22 March, on social justice and economics.FMF press release. \\"Extracts from an address: Professor FA von Hayek, Nobel Prize- winner for Economic Science 1974, to a group of Johannesburg business people on 'Social Justice and Economics' given on Wednesday 22 March at 17h30 in the Carlton Hotel Ballroom\\". ?? March 1978. The Johannesburg Chamber of Commerce held a lunch for Hayek on Thursday, 6 April, at the hotel. At a banquet on Friday, 7 April, at the same hotel, Senator Horwood was the main speaker. The FMF criticized the South African government's 1980 budget, especially the \\"increased welfare spending including subsidies and housing\\". Howard Preece, an editor of the Rand Daily Mail, responded to this criticism, sarcastically remarking that \\"there will be all those black pensioners whooping it up on their R33 a month while the oppressed whites slave to provide cheap bread for the blacks generally\\". The editor concluded that \\"[c]ommunists never had better friends than these ultra-marketeers and their Standard Nine [eleventh grade] economics\\". Eustace Davie became a director of the FMF in 1981. Professor Jan A. Lombard, Head of the Department of Economics at the University of Pretoria and Deputy Governor of the SA Reserve Bank, was President of the FMF between 1981 and at least 1991. Louw and Frances Kendall, his wife, wrote the bestselling book South Africa: The Solution in 1986, which put forward a vision for direct democracy broadly based on the Swiss canton system. The book sold over 25,000 copies and was translated into Afrikaans. By 1987, much of the FMF's funding came \\"from large corporations, with lesser contributions coming from individuals and smaller companies\\". The FMF also earned an income from consulting work for companies seeking to overcome government interventions that inhibit their enterprises, and advising government institutions and homeland governments, especially on deregulation and privatization. Its With Justice For All training program, aimed at teaching \\"economic principles and also covers politics\\", which ended in 1988, accounted for 60% of the FMF's total income. The Rand Mines Group sent 100,000 of its staff to participate in With Justice For All. Don King, the group's personnel director, said the program would \\"tell workers of the benefits of the free market system as the viable and more welcome alternative to the marxist-socialist system\\". At the time, the FMF argued that privatization was the only way to bring about racial equality between black and white South Africans. Louw said that, in addition to producing enough wealth to raise the welfare of blacks, privatizing South Africa's state-owned enterprises and industries would depoliticize various economic sectors, like buses and trains, which had been racialized whilst in state hands. Resistance from civil servants and the possibility of generating private monopolies were two issues Louw identified, but this could be overcome by guaranteeing job security and ensuring privatized enterprises are not given to one firm. In 1988, the FMF awarded Lawrence Mavundla with its \\"Free Market Award\\" for his contribution to the cause of economic freedom in South Africa. Mavundla had co-founded the Co- Operative for Hawkers and Informal Business in 1986 to fight for the right to enterprise of black South Africans during the time of the apartheid regime's discriminatory legislation. = Post-apartheid = The FMF was an active participant in both the negotiations to end apartheid in South Africa (notably, the Dakar Conference of 1987) as well as the negotiations surrounding what the provisions of the Constitution of South Africa, 1996 would be. The FMF opposed the inclusion of section 8(2) of the Constitution, which provides that the rights in the Bill of Rights do not only bind government, but also citizens (so-called \\"horizontality\\"). The FMF further protested the inclusion of \\"public interest\\" as a justification for the expropriation of private property, currently found in section 25(2)(a) of the Constitution. Public interest, it argued, is wide and leads to uncertainty, making it \\"not only open to abuse, but deprives the courts of clear principles on which to adjudicate property rights disputes\\". The FMF also opposed including socio-economic rights, such as the right to access to housing (section 26) and the right to access healthcare, food, water, and social security (section 27), because, firstly, it argued the South African government did not have the resources to give effect to these rights, secondly, that 'right to have access' is \\"jurisprudentially vague\\", and thirdly, socio-economic rights were \\"unprecedented\\" in South African law, meaning the courts of South Africa would need \\"to decide whether measures that confer 'access' to targeted benefits are sufficiently 'reasonable' and 'progressive' and what the state's 'available resources' are, which means judges may have to determine levels of taxation; budget deficits and allocations; housing, health et al policies...\\"The \\"Free Market Award\\" 2000 ceremony. From left to right: Ketumile Masire, Leon Louw and Nelson Mandela. Professor Themba Sono, who was the President of the South African Students' Organisation between 1971 and 1972 and a co-founder of the Black People's Convention, was President of the FMF from 1997 to 2000. In 2000, the FMF awarded its \\"Free Market Award\\" to Sir Ketumile Masire, the former President of Botswana (1980-1998), with FMF chairman, Michael O'Dowd, saying \\"Botswana maintained all the institutions and practices which constitute a free market economy.\\" The award ceremony was attended by the former South African president, Nelson Mandela. The FMF came out in opposition to the South African government's decision to expand South Africa's nuclear energy capacity in 2014, with executive director, Leon Louw, saying, \\"The government has shown conclusively that it is unable to manage electricity. It is entirely in the wrong hands.\\" Louw, however, expressed approval of nuclear power in principle. Between 2013 and 2016 the FMF attempted to have section 23 of South Africa's Labour Relations Act, 1995 changed. The section \\"allows the minister of labour to extend a collective agreement concluded in the bargaining council to any non-parties to the collective agreement that are within its registered scope\\". The FMF's argument was that this section was detrimental to small businesses \\"which could not afford wage agreements reached in councils they are not affiliated with\\". In Free Market Foundation v Minister of Labour and Others 2016 (4) SA 496 (GP), Murphy J of the Pretoria High Court found against the FMF, holding that the section need not be changed and that the Promotion of Administrative Justice Act, 2000 provided sufficient protection for small businesses wishing to review the labour minister's extension of agreements. In 2017, the FMF opposed the South African Department of Justice and Constitutional Development's Prevention and Combating of Hate Crimes and Hate Speech Bill, 2016, arguing that the \\"right to free, uncensored communication was the foundation of a truly democratic society.\\" The FMF also argued that the Bill falls foul of the section 16 protection of freedom of expression found in the Constitution. When the Bill was updated in April 2018, the FMF welcomed the changes but continued to argue that the Bill was unnecessary. Frans Rautenbach (left) and Daniel J. Mitchell (right) speaking at the FMF on the Rule of Law on 14 November 2018. The FMF has opposed the South African government's plan to amend section 25 of the Constitution to enable the expropriation of private property without compensation. Nolutshungu warned that expropriation without compensation would betray the victory of constitutional democracy over such legislation as the Natives Land Act, 1913, and said that even though the current government might not wish to use the power to expropriate without compensation maliciously, the nature of constitutional change means any future government will have the same power. Professor Robert Vivian, who sits on the FMF's Rule of Law Board of Advisors, said in September 2018 that, contrary to the conventional belief that only two-thirds of the members of the National Assembly would need to support the amendment for it to pass into law, 75% of the assembly's votes would instead be necessary. This is because according to Vivian, amending the requirement to pay compensation for expropriated property does not simply affect section 25 of the Constitution (in the Bill of Rights), but also affects section 1's (in the Founding Provisions) commitment to the advancement of human rights and freedoms. Provisions in the Bill of Rights require two-thirds of the assembly, and provisions in section 1 require 75%. The FMF has also voiced its concern over the public participation process surrounding the adoption of the expropriation without compensation policy. It pointed out that the government had allocated more time for written submissions on a tobacco regulation bill than it did for the constitutional amendment. Later, the FMF condemned Parliament for not inviting the foundation to participate in the oral hearings before the National Assembly's constitutional review committee.  Activities  Khaya Lam title deed giveaway ceremony in Grabouw, Western Cape on 25 July 2017. Seated in the front, left to right: Attie van Wyk (CEO of Two-a-Day), Isaac Sileku (Deputy Mayor of the Theewaterskloof Municipality), Christelle Vosloo (Mayor), Temba Nolutshungu (FMF director), Derek Corder (Trustee of the Elgin Foundation), and Perry Feldman (Khaya Lam project manager). = Khaya Lam Land Reform Project = Since 2013, the FMF have led a land reform initiative with First National Bank (FNB) originally called the Ngwathe Land Reform Project. FNB executive Simphiwe Madikizela explained: “When you release title deeds wealth is created for the community. Once people have the title deed, they can extend property and make a living off the property by renting the rooms. They can use their home as collateral to get loans for other personal purposes.” The project is now called the Khaya Lam Land Reform Project. Its stated mission is assist communities in the conversion of their apartheid-era leasehold title (tenancy) to freehold title (ownership). Khaya Lam is Xhosa for \\"My Home.\\" The project makes use of the Upgrading of Land Tenure Rights Act (112 of 1991), or 'ULTRA', which \\"places an obligation on councils to transfer municipal land to tenants\\". On 25 July 2017, the FMF handed over 58 title deeds in Grabouw in the Theewaterskloof Local Municipality of the Western Cape, which were sponsored by the Two-a-Day Group (Pty) Ltd and the Elgin Foundation. FMF director Temba Nolutshungu acted as master of ceremonies, and was accompanied by the Project Manager of the Khaya Lam Land Reform Project, Perry Feldman. On 16 January 2018, the FMF handed over 117 title deeds to beneficiaries from Kylemore‚ Le Roux‚ Cloetesville‚ Khayamandi and Franschhoek, at the Stellenbosch Town Hall. Businessman Johann Rupert sponsored the deeds, which are intended to be the first of 1,000. In thanking Rupert for the sponsorship, FMF executive director Leon Louw criticized government for failing to systematically convert \\"‘council owned’ and ‘traditional community’ properties to full‚ unrestricted ownership\\". The FMF has expanded the title deeds initiative to large parts of the Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal. = Civil aviation and South African Airways = The FMF has favored deregulation of civil aviation in South Africa since at least 1980. One of its chief aims was to have South African Airways (SAA) denied the power to prohibit potential competitors in the airline industry entry, a power granted to SAA by the Air Services Act (51 of 1949). Terry J. Markman argued that the Act should be repealed and domestic civil aviation \\"should be deregulated immediately\\" and that SAA should be denationalised and required to make a profit. The Air Services Act was repealedSection 47 of the International Air Services Act. Available here: https://www.golegal.co.za/wp- content/uploads/2016/12/International-Air-Services-Act-60-of-1993.pdf by the International Air Services Act (60 of 1993) during a time of liberalization in South Africa. Markman, a transportation consultant, often represented the FMF in public on this topic. Markman blamed the government's intervention in the finances of Union Airways (subsequently becoming SAA) in 1933 as the cause of South Africa's heavily-regulated civil aviation industry. As of 2017, the FMF has been involved in a campaign to have SAA either privatized or liquidated in the wake of billions of rands in bailouts and guarantees being granted to the airline by government, arguing that the continued financing of the airline is a subsidy by the poor in favor of the rich. The FMF however believes that it may be too late for privatization given the state of SAA's finances. In early June 2018, Louw publicly challenged SAA chief executive officer, Vuyani Jarana, to a wager of R100,000 ($7,440) that SAA would not be profitable within the period Jarana claimed it would. In terms of the wager, if SAA is not profitable by 31 March 2021, Jarana would have to pay R100,000 to a charity of Louw's choice, and if SAA is profitable, Louw would have to pay the money to a charity of Jarana's choice. Jarana agreed to the wager. By 22 June, however, Peter Davies, the airline's chief restructuring officer, told the Financial Mail, \\"It will take us five years until 2022 to break even\\", a timeline apparnetly approved by SAA's board and by the National Treasury; casting doubts on whether the terms of the wager would be adhered to. = Economic Freedom of the World report = The Free Market Foundation publishes the South African edition of the Fraser Institute's annual Economic Freedom of the World report. The FMF is listed as a \\"full member\\" in this partnership with the Fraser Institute. FMF director Temba Nolutshungu said for the 2016 edition that it \\"is tragic that a country ranked 42nd in the world in 2000, just outside the top 25% of countries in the world, should have fallen 63 places in the rankings in 15 years to a point where it now ranks in the bottom 35%.\\" According to Nolutshungu, research shows that \\"there is a significant though not immediate correlation between economic freedom, economic growth and human welfare so a steady and dramatic decline in economic freedom in the country should not be taken lightly\\". = Enterprise Africa! = Between 2006 and 2010, the FMF, the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, Virginia, and the Institute of Economic Affairs, London, ran the Enterprise Africa! initiative. Supported by a grant from the John Templeton Foundation, the project investigated, analyzed, and reported on enterprise-based solutions to poverty in Africa. Most of the studies and analyses were all written primarily by Mercatus Senior Fellow Karol Boudreaux. = Health policy = The FMF's health policy unit has opposed the South African government's attempts at introducing single-payer national health insurance, arguing that with South Africa's narrow tax base and low economic growth, such a scheme would be unaffordable. Economist and FMF director, Jasson Urbach, has argued that South Africa spends as much on healthcare as is \\"equal to many developed economies' health expenditure as a proportion of GDP,\\" and said that spending more will not solve the problem of a \\"dysfunctional\\" system. = Minimum wage = The FMF has long opposed the introduction of a national minimum wage, claiming that it would be harmful for South Africa's large number of unemployed people. According to former FMF board chairman Herman Mashaba, \\"a minimum wage makes it illegal to employ anyone for a lower wage. The result is that many people are denied the right to decide for themselves about job opportunities\\". FMF director Jasson Urbach has claimed that large businesses tend to support minimum wage laws because \\"it protects them from competition from small businesses\\". In February 2017 the South African government resolved to adopt a national minimum wage by 1 May 2018, at R20 ($1,50) per hour, or roughly R3,500 ($261,52) per month. A commission will be set up to review the wage level annually. Louw has argued that if a minimum wage is implemented, government must create \\"job seekers' exemption certificates\\" (JSEC) which would allow individuals who have been unemployed for an extended period of time to exempt themselves from the application of the minimum wage, in order to find employment below the minimum wage. FMF director Eustace Davie authored Jobs for the Jobless in 2003, which set out the comprehensive JSEC proposal. The Atlas Network awarded the FMF the \\"Templeton Freedom Award\\" in 2009 for the book.  Criticism  The trade union SAMWU has accused the FMF of being against South Africa's collective bargaining system, likely referring to the FMF's 2013-16 attempt to have a provision of the Labour Relations Act changed. Irwin Jim, general secretary of NUMSA, has similarly accused the FMF, writing, \\"The FMF’s attack on collective bargaining is based on its devotion to the neoliberal capitalist perspective and is part of a broader campaign to defend the neoliberal orientation of the ANC government\\". In March 2018, journalist Eusebius McKaiser referred to the FMF as \\"libertarians who care little for group identities, structural analysis and protection of workers at the mercy of amoral labour markets\\". Kate Wilkinson, senior researcher at Africa Check (an organization founded \\"to promote accuracy in public debate and the media in Africa\\") criticized and debunked some of the FMF's claims about transformation in South Africa in 2015. Louw wrote two columns in Business Day, the first on 26 August 2015, \\"SA's bizarre transformation denialism\\", and the second on 4 November 2015, \\"Transformation denialism is an extreme form of racism\\". Of Louw's five claims in the first column, two were \\"unproven\\" and three were \\"incorrect\\". Of Louw's fourteen claims in the second column, five were \\"incorrect\\", three were \\"unproven\\", two were \\"unable to verify\\", three were \\"mostly correct\\" and one was \\"correct\\". Wilkinson criticized the FMF for the long delay in providing her with sources for the claims, and when provided, for the quality of the sources. She accused the FMF of providing no primary sources and doing \\"horse-before-the-cart research\\", by making claims first and looking for evidence after. In January 2018, researchers from the Institute for African Alternatives criticized the FMF for its response to Oxfam's 2018 report. Among other things, the FMF claimed that the poor were empowered by free enterprise, a claim the researchers said \\"is made repeatedly by the foundation and conservative economic commentators in South Africa\\". In contrast, the researchers say that liberalization in Africa has failed where it has been tried. Where the FMF claimed that wealth generation is legitimate if coercion was not used to accrue that wealth, the researchers argue that in a market economy, \\"one is compelled to sell one’s labour in order to survive\\". The researchers conclude that the FMF's rejection of the Oxfam report is on \\"flimsy grounds\\" and that \\"Oxfam should be praised for continuously alerting the global public to the threat that rising inequality poses to social and political stability\\".

Early life  Alma Florence Soller was born in Narrowsburg, New York, the daughter of George David Soller (1879-1928) and Margaret Slater Soller (1892-1990). She was raised on her parents' chicken farm with three older siblings, William, George, and Beulah. She trained as a secretary before World War II.  Nuremberg trials  Soller began to work for the United States Department of Defense in 1941. At the end of World War II she met then U.S. Supreme Court Justice Robert H.

Jackson, United States Representative to the International Conference on Military Trials. Washington, DC: US GPO, 1949. Jackson's biographer, John Q. Barrett, said that McLay \\"probably never got the full credit she deserved for her work transcribing the testimony, often in various languages and in shorthand, and collating the evidence.\\" The nature of the recording technology used in the trials made audio records fragile, and the stenographers' work more critical in documenting the historic process.

Interest in droplet-based microfluidics systems has been growing substantially in past decades. Microdroplets offer the feasibility of handling miniature volumes (μl to fl) of fluids conveniently, provide better mixing, encapsulation, sorting, sensing and are suitable for high throughput experiments. Two immiscible phases used for the droplet based systems are referred to as the continuous phase (medium in which droplets flow) and dispersed phase (the droplet phase).  Droplet formation methods  In order for droplet formation to occur, two immiscible phases, referred to as the continuous phase (medium in which droplets are generated) and dispersed phase (the droplet phase), must be used. The size of the generated droplets is mainly controlled by the flow rate ratio of the continuous phase and dispersed phase, interfacial tension between two phases, and the geometry of the channels used for droplet generation. Droplets can be formed both passively and actively. Active droplet formation (electric, magnetic, centrifugal) often uses similar devices to passive formation but requires an external energy input for droplet manipulation. Passive droplet formation tends to be more common than active as it produces similar results with simpler device designs. Generally, three types of microfluidic geometries are utilized for passive droplet generation: (i) Cross-Flowing, (ii) Flow focusing, and (iii) Co-Flowing. Droplet based microfluidics often operate under low Reynold’s numbers to ensure laminar flow within the system. Droplet size is often quantified with coefficient of variation (CV) as a description of the standard deviation from the mean droplet size. Each of the listed methods provide a way to generate microfluidic droplets in a controllable and tunable manner with proper variable manipulation. = Cross-flowing droplet formation = Droplet formation using a T-junction. Formation of droplets with a T junction microfluidic device. The break off of a droplet comes from a drop in pressure as a drop emerges. Cross-flowing is a passive formation method that involves the continuous and aqueous phases running at an angle to each other. Most commonly, the channels are perpendicular in a T-shaped junction with the dispersed phase intersecting the continuous phase; other configurations such as a Y-junction are also possible. The dispersed phase extends into the continuous and is stretched until shear forces break off a droplet. In a T-junction, droplet size and formation rate are determined by the flow rate ratio and capillary number. The capillary number relates the viscosity of the continuous phase, the superficial velocity of the continuous phase, and the interfacial tension. Typically, the dispersed phase flow rate is slower than the continuous flow rate. T-junction formation can be further applied by adding additional channels, creating two T-junctions at one location. By adding channels, different dispersed phases can be added at the same point to create alternating droplets of different compositions. Droplet size, usually above 10 μm, is limited by the channel dimensions and often produces droplets with a CV of less than 2% with a rate of up to 7 kHz[4]. = Flow focusing droplet formation = Droplet formation using a flow focusing device. Diagram of flow focusing droplet formation device commonly used in microfluidic devices. Liquid flowing in from the left is pinched off into droplets by an oil flowing in from the top and bottom. Two stream reagent addition using a flow focusing approach with a planar chip format. Flow focusing is a usually passive formation method that involves the dispersed phase flowing to meet the continuous phase typically at an angle (nonparallel streams) then undergoing a constraint that creates a droplet. This constraint is generally a narrowing in the channel to create the droplet though symmetric shearing, followed by a channel of equal or greater width. As with cross- flowing, the continuous phase flow rate is typically higher than the dispersed phase flow rate. Decreasing the flow of the continuous phase can increase the size of the droplets. Flow focusing can also be an active method with the constraint point being adjustable using pneumatic side chambers controlled by compressed air. The movable chambers act to pinch the flow, deforming the stream and creating a droplet with a changeable driving frequency. Droplet size is usually around several hundred nanometers with a CV of less than 3% and a rate of up to several hundred Hz to tens of kHz. = Co-flowing droplet formation = Co-flowing is a passive droplet formation method where the dispersed phase channel is enclosed inside a continuous phase channel. At the end of the dispersed phase channel, the fluid is stretched until it breaks from shear forces and forms droplets either by dripping or jetting. Dripping occurs when capillary forces dominate the system and droplets are created at the channel endpoint. Jetting occurs, by widening or stretching, when the continuous phase is moving slower, creating a stream from the dispersed phase channel opening. Under the widening regime, the dispersed phase is moving faster than the continuous phase causing a deceleration of the dispersed phase, widening the droplet and increasing the diameter. Under the stretching regime, viscous drag dominates causing the stream to narrow creating a smaller droplet. The effect of the continuous phase flow rate on the droplet size depends on whether the system is in a stretching or widening regime thus different equations must be used to predict droplet size. Droplet size is usually around several hundred nanometers with a CV of less than 5% and a rate of up to tens of kHz.  Droplet manipulation  The benefits of microfluidics can be scaled up to higher throughput using larger channels to allow more droplets to pass or by increasing droplet size. Droplet size can be tuned by adjusting the rate of flow of the continuous and disperse phases, but droplet size is limited by the need to maintain the concentration, inter-analyte distances, and stability of microdroplets. Thus, increased channel size becomes attractive due to the ability to create and transport a large number of droplets, though dispersion and stability of droplets become a concern. Finally, thorough mixing of droplets to expose the greatest possible number of reagents is necessary to ensure the maximum amount of starting materials react. This can be accomplished by using a windy channel to facilitate unsteady laminar flow within the droplets. = Surfactants in Droplet-based Microfluidics = The surfactant stabilizes the interface between the continuous oil phase and the aqueous droplet. Also, the surfactants can reduce the adhesion of aqueous droplets to the channel wall, by decreasing the surface tension at the aqueous-oil interface. Surfactants play an important role in droplet-based microfluidics. The main purpose of using a surfactant is to reduce the interfacial tension between the dispersed phase (droplet phase, typically aqueous) and continuous phase (carrier liquid, typically oil) by adsorbing at interfaces and preventing droplets from coalescing with each other, therefore stabilizing the droplets in a stable emulsion state, which allows for longer storage times in delay-lines, reservoirs, or vials. Without using surfactants, the unstable emulsions will eventually evolve into separate phases to reduce the overall energy of the system. Surface chemistry cannot be ignored in microfluidics as the interfacial tension becomes a major consideration among microscale droplets. Linas Mazutis and Andrew D. Griffiths presented a method that used surfactants to achieve a selective and highly controllable coalescence without external manipulation. They manipulate the contact time and the interfacial surfactant coverage of a drop pair to control droplet fusion. The larger the difference percentage of the interfacial surfactant coverage between two droplets, the less likely coalescence will occur. This method allowed researchers to add reagents to droplets in a different way and further study the emulsification. The hydrophobic tails on the surfactant keep the emulsion stable and prevent droplet coalescence together during the incubation time. The larger/longer the hydrophobic tails are, the better the biocompatibility and the better the solubility in oil phase, also the better the insolubility in aqueous phase.< Microfluidics is widely used for biochemical experiments, so it is important that surfactants are biocompatible when working with living cells and high-throughput analysis. Surfactants used in living cell research devices should not interfere with biochemical reactions or cellular functions. Hydrocarbon oil is typically not used in cell microfluidic research because it is not compatible with cells and damages cell viability. Hydrocarbon oil also extracts organic molecules from the aqueous phase. However, fluorosurfactants with fluorinated tails, for example, are used as a compatible droplet emulsifier that stabilizes droplets containing cells inside without harming or altering the cells. Fluorosurfactants are soluble in a fluorinated oil (continuous phase) but insoluble in the aqueous phase, which results in decreasing the aqueous- fluorous interfacial tension. For example, a triblock copolymer surfactant containing two perfluoropolyether (PFPE) tails and a polyethylene glycol (PEG) block head group is a fluorosurfactant with great biocompatibility and excellent droplet stability against coalescence. Another example are the fluorinated linear polyglycerols, which can be further functionalized on their tailored side-chains and are more customizable compared to the PEG-based copolymer. Surfactants can be purchased from many chemical companies, such as RainDance Technologies (now through BioRad) and Miller-Stephenson. = Reagent addition = Microscale reactions performed in droplet-based applications conserve reagents and reduce reaction time all at kilohertz rates. Reagent addition to droplet microreactors has been a focus of research due to the difficulty of achieving reproducible additions at kilohertz rates without droplet-to-droplet contamination. Reagent coflow prior to droplet formation Reagents can be added at the time of droplet formation through a “co-flow” geometry. Reagent streams are pumped in separate channels and join at the interface with a channel containing the continuous phase, which shears and creates droplets containing both reagents. By changing the flow rates in reagent channels, reagent ratios within a droplet can be controlled. Droplet fusion Controlled electrocoalesence of two droplets. A smaller droplet flows faster than a larger one, catching up to the larger droplet. Upon application of an electric field, as the droplet pair flows through the electrodes, the droplets fuse. The fusion of droplets with different contents can also be exploited for reagent addition. Electro-coalescence merges pairs of droplets by applying an electric field to temporarily destabilize the droplet-droplet interface to achieve reproducible droplet fusion in surfactant-stabilized emulsions. Electro-coalescence requires droplets (which are normally separated by the continuous phase) to come into contact. By manipulating droplet size in separate streams, differential flow of droplet sizes can bring droplets into contact before merging. Another method for facilitating droplet fusion is acoustic tweezing. While droplets are flowing in microfluidic channels, they can be immobilised using an acoustic tweezer based on surface acoustic waves. Once a droplet is held with the acoustic tweezer, consecutive droplets collide into it and fusion takes place. Two droplets come together in this device. The pillars divide the flow into three channels: two side branches on the top and bottom, and a middle branch, through which the entire merged droplet flows to. The continuous phase between adjacent droplets is effectively filtered out by being allowed to flow through the top and bottom branches. The removal of the continuous phase between droplets facilitates droplet fusion. Injection of reagents into existing droplets Picoinjection reagent addition method, showing the addition of aqueous fluid (Aq2 – dark blue), into previously formed droplets (Aq1 – light blue) flowing through a channel. Reagent co-flow and droplet fusion methods are tied to droplet formation events which lack downstream flexibility. To decouple reagent addition from droplet creation, a setup where reagent stream flows through a channel perpendicular to the droplet stream is utilized. An injection droplet is then merged with the plug as it passes the channel. Reagent volume is controlled by the flow rate of the perpendicular reagent channel. An early challenge for such systems is that reagent droplet merging was not reproducible for stable emulsions. By adapting the use of an actuated electric field into this geometry, Abate et al. achieved sub-picoliter control of reagent injection. This approach, termed picoinjection, controls injection volume through reagent stream pressure and droplet velocity. Further work on this method has aimed to reduce pressure fluctuations that impede reproducible injections. Injection of the pressurized aqueous fluid occurs when the electrodes are activated creating an electric field that destabilizes the aqueous fluid/oil interface, triggering the injection. Key advantages of picoinjection include low inadvertent material transfer between droplets and maintenance of droplet compartmentalization through the injection, however, electrodes are often fabricated using metal-solder which can complicate construction of the microfluidic device through increased fabrication time as a result of a more intricate design. An alternative picoinjection method involves utilizing the injection reagent as the conductor of an electric field where a voltage applied to the fluid stimulates injection. Such a method also allows for greater control of injection as the voltage applied corresponds to the volume of reagent fluid injected. Droplet-to-droplet contamination is a challenge of many injection methods. To combat this, Doonan et al. developed a multifunctional K-channel, which flows reagent streams opposite the path of the droplet stream. Utilizing an interface between the two channels, injection is achieved similarly to picoinjection, but any bilateral contamination washed away through continuous reagent flow. Contamination is avoided at the expense of potentially wasting precious reagent. = Droplet incubation = In order to make droplet-based microfluidics a viable technique for carrying out chemical reactions or working with living cells on the microscale, it is necessary to implement methods allowing for droplet incubation. Chemical reactions often need time to occur, and living cells similarly require time to grow, multiply, and carry out metabolic processes. Droplet incubation can be accomplished either within the device itself (on-chip) or externally (off- chip), depending on the parameters of the system. Off-chip incubation is useful for incubation times of a day or more or for incubation of millions of droplets at a time. On-chip incubation allows for integration of droplet manipulation and detection steps in a single device.  Off-chip incubation  Droplets containing cells can be stored off-chip in PTFE tubing for up to several days while maintaining cell viability and allowing for reinjection onto another device for analysis. Evaporation of aqueous and oil-based fluids has been reported with droplet storage in PTFE tubing, so for storage longer than several days, glass capillaries are also used. Finally, following formation in a microfluidic device, droplets may also be guided through a system of capillaries and tubing leading to a syringe. Droplets can be incubated in the syringe and then directly injected onto another chip for further manipulation or detection and analysis.  On-chip incubation  On-chip reservoir designed to house droplets for longer term storage. Delay lines are used to incubate droplets on-chip. After formation, droplets can be introduced into a serpentine channel with length of up to a meter or more. Increasing the depth and width of the delay line channel (as compared to channels used to form and transport droplets) enables longer incubation times while minimizing channel back pressure. Because of the larger channel size, droplets fill up the delay line channel and incubate in the time it takes the droplets to traverse this channel. Delay lines were originally designed for incubating droplets containing chemical reaction mixtures and were capable of achieving delay times of up to one hour. These devices make use of delay line channels tens of centimeters in length. Increasing the total length of the delay line channels to one or more meters made incubation times of 12 or more hours possible. Delay lines have been shown to maintain droplet stability for up to 3 days, and cell viability has been demonstrated using on-chip delay lines for up to 12 hours. Prior to the development of delay lines, on-chip incubation was performed by directing droplets into large reservoirs (several millimeters in both length and width), which offers high storage capacity and lower complexity of device construction and operation if precise time control of droplets is not required. Mixing by chaotic advection in a winding channel. As the droplets proceed in the winding channel, unsteady fluid flow is caused by co- and counter-rotating vortices (see inset). If it is important to have a uniform distribution of incubation times for the droplets, the delay line channel may contain regularly-spaced constrictions. Droplets flowing through a channel of uniform diameter travel at different speeds based on their radial position; droplets closer to the center of the channel move faster than those near the edges. By narrowing the channel width to a fraction of its original size, droplets with higher velocities are forced to equilibrate with slower- moving droplets because the constriction allows fewer droplets to pass through at a time. Another manipulation to the geometry of the delay line channel involves introducing turns to the droplets' trajectory. This increases the extent to which any reagents contained within the droplets are mixed via chaotic advection. For systems requiring the incubation of 100 to 1000 droplets, traps can be fabricated in the delay line channel that store droplets separately from one another. This provides for finer control and monitoring of individual droplets. = Magnetic droplets = The micro- magnetofluidic method is the control of magnetic fluids by an applied magnetic field on a microfluidic platform, offering wireless and programmable control of the magnetic droplets. Hence, the magnetic force can also be used to perform various logical operations, in addition to the hydrodynamic force and the surface tension force. The magnetic field strength, type of the magnetic field (gradient, uniform or rotating), magnetic susceptibility, interfacial tension, flow rates, and flow rate ratios determine the control of the droplets on a micro-magnetofluidic platform.  Droplet sorting  Droplet sorting in microfluidics is an important technique, allowing for discrimination based on factors ranging from droplet size to chemicals labeled with fluorescent tags within the droplet, stemming off of the work done to sort cells in Flow Cytometry. Within the realm of droplet sorting there are two main types, bulk sorting, which uses either active or passive methods, and precise sorting, which relies mainly on active methods. Bulk sorting is applied to samples with a large number of droplets (> 2000 s−1) that can be sorted based on intrinsic properties of the droplets (such as viscosity, density, etc.) without checking each droplet. Precise sorting, on the other hand, aims to separate droplets that meet certain criteria that is checked on each droplet. Passive sorting is done through control of the microfluidic channel design, allowing for discrimination based on droplet size. Size sorting relies on the bifurcating junctions in the channel to divert the flow, which causes droplets to sort based on how they interact with the cross section of that flow, the shear rate, which relates directly to their size. Other passive methods include inertia and microfiltration, each having to do with the physical properties, such as inertia, and density, of the droplet. Active sorting uses additional devices attached to the microfluidic device to alter the path of a droplet during flow by controlling some aspect, including thermal, magnetic, pneumatic, acoustic, hydrodynamic and electric control. These controls are utilized to sort the droplets in response to some signal detection from the droplets such as fluorescence intensity. Precise sorting methods utilize these active sorting methods by first making a decision (e.g., fluorescence signal) about the droplets then altering their flow with one of the aforementioned methods. A technique called Fluorescent Activated Droplet Sorting (FADS) has been developed which utilizes electric field-induced active sorting with fluorescent detection to sort up to 2000 droplets per second. The method relies on, but is not limited to, enzymatic activity of compartmentalized target cells to activate a fluorogenic substrate within the droplet. When a fluorescing droplet is detected, two electrodes are switched on applying a field to the droplet, which shifts its course into the selection channel, while non-fluorescing droplets flow through the main channel to waste. Other methods utilize different selection criteria, such as absorbance of droplet, number of encapsulated particles, or image recognition of cell shapes. Sorting can be done to improve encapsulation purity, an important factor for collecting sample for further experiments.  Key applications  = Cell culture = One of the key advantages of droplet-based microfluidics is the ability to use droplets as incubators for single cells. Devices capable of generating thousands of droplets per second opens new ways characterize cell population, not only based on a specific marker measured at a specific time point but also based on cells' kinetic behavior such as protein secretion, enzyme activity or proliferation. Recently, a method was found to generate a stationary array of microscopic droplets for single-cell incubation that does not require the use of a surfactant. Cell culture using droplet- based microfluidics Droplet-based microfluidic systems provide an analytic platform that enables the isolation of single cells or groups of cells in droplets. This tool offers high-throughput for cell experiments since droplet- based microfluidic systems can generate thousands of samples (droplets) per second. Compared with cell culture in conventional microtiter plates, microdroplets from μL to pL volumes reduce the use of reagents and cells. Additionally, automated handling and continuous processing allow assays to be carried out more efficiently. The isolated environment in an encapsulated droplet helps analyze each individual cell population. High-throughput cell culture experiments, for example, testing the behavior of bacteria, finding rare cell types, directed evolution, and cell screening are suitable for using the droplet-based microfluidic techniques. Materials, incubation and viability Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) is the most common material to fabricate microfluidic devices due to low cost, ease of prototyping, and good gas permeability. Along with perfluorocarbon carrier oils, which also allow good gas permeability, used as a continuous phase in the droplet-based microfluidic system for cell culture, some studies have found that cell viability is comparable to culture in flasks, for example mammalian cells. To reach the required culture time, a reservoir or a delay line can be used. Using a reservoir allows long-term culture from several hours to several days while the delay line is suitable for short-term culture with several minutes. Incubation is feasible both on-chip (reservoir connected with a microfluidic system or delay lines) and off-chip (PTFE tubing isolated with a microfluidic system) after the droplets formed. After incubation, droplets can be reinjected into the microfluidic device for analysis. There are also specially designed on-chip droplet storage systems for direct analysis, such as the “dropspot” device, which stores droplets in several array chambers and uses microarray scanner for direct analysis. Challenges Cell culture using droplet- based microfluidics has created many opportunities for research that is inaccessible in conventional platforms, but also has many challenges. Some of the challenges of cell culture in droplet-based microfluidics are common to other microfluidic culture system. First, nutrient consumption should be re- evaluated for a specific microfluid system. For example, glucose consumption is sometimes increased in microfluidic systems (depending on the cell type). The medium turnover is sometimes faster than in macroscopic culture due to reduced culture volumes, thus the volumes of the medium used must be adjusted in each cell line and device. Secondly, the cellular proliferation and behavior may differ depending on the microfluidic systems, a determining factor is the culture surface area to media volume, which vary from one device to another. One report found that proliferation was impaired in the microchannels; increased glucose or serum supplementation did not address the problem for his specific case. Thirdly, the pH regulation must be controlled. PDMS is more permeable to CO2 than to O2 or N2, thus, the dissolved gas level during incubation should be adjusted to reach the expected pH condition. = Biological macromolecule characterization =  Protein crystallization  Droplet-based devices have also been used to investigate the conditions necessary for protein crystallization.  Droplet-based PCR  Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has been a vital tool in genomics and biological endeavors since its inception as it has greatly sped up production and analysis of DNA samples for a wide range of applications. The technological advancement of microdroplet scale PCR has enabled the construction of single- molecule PCR-on-a-chip device. Early single molecule DNA replication, including what occurs in microdroplet or emulsion PCR, was more difficult than larger scale PCR so much higher concentrations of components were usually used. However, fully optimized conditions have minimized this overload by insuring single molecules have an appropriate concentration of replication components distributed throughout the reaction cell. Non-droplet based microfluidic PCR also faces challenges with reagent absorption into the device channels, but droplet-based systems lessen this problem with decreased channel contact. Using water-in-oil systems, droplet PCR operates by assembling ingredients, forming droplets, combining droplets, thermocycling, and then processing results much like normal PCR. This technique is capable of running in excess of 2 million PCR reactions in addition to a 100,000-fold increase in the detection of wild-type alleles over mutant alleles. Droplet-based PCR greatly increases the multiplexing capabilities of normal PCR – allowing for fast production of mutation libraries. Without proofreading, DNA replication is inherently somewhat error-prone, but by introducing error-prone polymerases, droplet-based PCR utilizes higher than normal mutation output to build a mutation library more quickly and efficiently than normal. This makes droplet-based PCR more attractive than slower, traditional PCR. In a similar application, highly multiplexed, microdroplet PCR has been developed that allows for the screening of large numbers of target sequences enabling applications such as bacterial identification. On-chip PCR allows for an excess of 15 x 15 multiplexing, which means that multiple target DNA sequences could be run on the same device at the same time. This multiplexing was made possible with immobilized DNA primer fragments placed in the base of the individual wells of the chips. Combining droplet-based PCR with polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) devices has allowed for novel enhancements of droplet PCR as well as remedying some preexisting problems with droplet PCR including high liquid loss due to evaporation. Droplet-based PCR is highly sensitive to air bubbles as they create temperature differentials hindering DNA replication while also dislodging reagents from the replication chamber. Now, droplet-based PCR has been carried out in PDMS devices to transfer reagents into droplets through a PDMS layer in a more controlled manner that better maintains replication progress and stability than traditional valves. A recent droplet-PCR PDMS device allowed for higher accuracy and amplification of small copy numbers in comparison to traditional quantitative PCR experiments. This higher accuracy was due to surfactant-doped PDMS as well as a sandwiched glass-PDMS-glass device design. These device properties have allowed for more streamlined priming of DNA and less water evaporation during PCR cycling.  DNA sequencing  Multiple microfluidic systems, including droplet-based systems, have been used for DNA sequencing. = Directed Evolution = Droplet microfluidics has been used for directed evolution. Directed evolution is a method used to develop novel proteins, pathways and genomes through a series repetitions of library generation and subsequent screening to obtain a desired phenotype; this allows scientists to engineer proteins without advanced knowledge of the structure and functions of proteins (i.e., rational design). Due to the iterative nature of directed evolution and the necessity for large libraries, directed evolution at the macroscale can be a costly endeavor. As such, performing experiments at the microscale through droplet-based microfluidics provides a significantly cheaper alternative to macroscopic equivalents. Various approaches price the directed evolution through droplet microfluidics under $40 for a screen of a 106-107 sized gene library, while the corresponding macroscale experiment is priced at approximately $15 million. Additionally, with screening times that range from 300 to 2000 droplets sorted per second, droplet-based microfluidics provides a platform for significantly accelerated library screening such that gene libraries of 107 can be sorted well within a day. Droplet-based microfluidic devices make directed evolution accessible and cost effective. Many different approaches to device construction of droplet-based microfluidic devices have been developed for directed evolution in order to have the capacity to screen a vast variety of different proteins, pathways, and genomes. One method of feeding libraries into the microfluidic device uses single cell encapsulation, in which droplets contain a maximum of one cell each. This avoids confounding results that could be generated by having multiple cells, and consequently multiple genotypes, in a single droplet, while maximizing the efficiency of resource consumption. This method enables the detection of secreted proteins and proteins on the cell membrane. The addition of a cell lysate to the droplets, which breaks down the cellular membrane such that the intracellular species are freely available within the droplet, expands the capabilities of the single cell encapsulation method to analyze intracellular proteins. The library can also be made entirely in vitro (i.e., not in its biological/cellular context) such that the content of the droplet is exclusively a mutated DNA strand. The in vitro system requires PCR and the use of in vitro transcription and translation (IVTT) systems to generate the desired protein in the droplet for analysis. Sorting of droplets for directed evolution is primarily done by fluorescence detection (e.g., fluorescence- activated droplet sorting (FADS)), however recent developments in a absorbance-based sorting methods, known as absorbance-activated droplet sorting (AADS), have expanded the diversity of substrates that can undergo directed evolution through a droplet-based microfluidic device. Recently, sorting capability has even expanded to the detection of NADPH levels and has been used to create higher activity NADP-dependent oxidoreductases. Ultimately, the potential for different methods of droplet creation and analysis in directed evolution droplet-based microfluidic devices allows for a variability that facilitates a large population of potential candidates for directed evolution. As a method for protein engineering, directed evolution has many applications in fields from development of drugs and vaccines to the synthesis of food and chemicals. A microfluidic device was developed to identify improved enzyme production hosts (i.e., cell factories) that can be employed industrially in various fields. An artificial aldolase was further enhanced by 30-fold using droplet-based microfluidics so that its activity resembled that of naturally occurring proteins. More recently, the creation of functional oxidases has been enabled by a novel microfluidic device created by Debon et al. The droplet-based microfluidic approach to the directed evolution has a great potential for the development of a myriad of novel proteins. = Chemical synthesis = Droplet-based microfluidics has become an important tool in chemical synthesis due to several attractive features. Microscale reactions allow for cost reduction through the usage of small reagent volumes, rapid reactions in the order of milliseconds, and efficient heat transfer that leads to environmental benefits when the amount of energy consumed per unit temperature rise can be extremely small. The degree of control over local conditions within the devices often makes it possible to select one product over another with high precision. With high product selectivity and small sizes of reagents and reaction environments come less stringent reaction clean-up and smaller footprint. Microdispersed droplets created by droplet- based chemistry are capable of acting as environments in which chemical reactions occur, as reagent carriers in the process of generating complex nanostructures. Droplets are also capable of being transformed into cell-like structures which can be used to mimic humans' biological components and processes. As a method of chemical synthesis, Droplets in microfluidics devices act as individual reaction chambers protected from contamination through device fouling by the continuous phase. Benefits of synthesis using this regime (compared to batch processes) include high throughput, continuous experiments, low waste, portability, and a high degree of synthetic control. Some examples of possible syntheses are the creation of semiconductor microspheres and nanoparticles. Chemical detection is integrated into the device to ensure careful monitoring of reactions, NMR spectroscopy, microscopy, electrochemical detection, and chemiluminescent detection are used. Often, measurements are taken at different points along the microfluidic device to monitor the progress of the reaction. Increased rate of reactions using microdroplets is seen in the aldol reaction of silyl enol ethers and aldehydes. Using a droplet-based microfluidic device, reaction times were shortened to twenty minutes versus the twenty-four hours required for a batch process. Other experimenters were able to show a high selectivity of cis- stilbene to the thermodynamically favored trans-stilbene compared to the batch reaction, showing the high degree of control afforded by microreactor droplets. This stereocontrol is beneficial to the pharmaceutical industry. For instance, L-Methotrexate, a drug used in chemotherapy, is more readily absorbed than the D isomer.  Microparticle and Nanoparticle synthesis  Advanced particles and particle-based materials, such as polymer particles, microcapsules, nanocrystals, and photonic crystal clusters or beads can be synthesized with the assistance of droplet-based microfluidics. Nanoparticles, such as colloidal CdS and CdS/CdSe core-shell nanoparticles, can also be synthesized through multiple steps on a millisecond time scale in a microfluidic droplet-based system. Nanoparticles, microparticles and colloidal clusters in microfluidic devices are useful for functions such as drug delivery. The first particles incorporated in droplet-based systems were silica gels in the micrometer size range in order to test their applications in the manufacturing of displays and optical coatings. Mixing solid particles with aqueous microdroplets requires changes to microfluidic channels such as additional reagent mixes and choice of specific materials such as silica or polymers that do not interfere with the channels and any bioactive substances the droplets contain. The synthesis of copolymers requires milling macroscopic molecules to microparticles with porous, irregular surfaces using organic solvents and emulsification techniques. These droplets preloaded with microparticles can also be quickly processed using UV irradiation. Characterization of these microparticles and nanoparticles involves microimaging for analyzing the structure and the identification of the macroscopic material being milled. Techniques such as the controlled encapsulation of individual gas bubbles to create hollow nanoparticles for synthesizing microbubbles with specific contents are vital for drug delivery systems. Both silica and titanium-based microparticles are used as durable shells after using gas to increase the flow velocity of the aqueous phase. A higher flow velocity allows greater control over the thickness of the aqueous shells. The emerging versatility of nanoparticles can be seen in the delivery of particle-loaded microdroplets being utilized in depot injections for drug delivery rather than the typical approach of injecting drugs intravenously. This is possible due to the low thickness of the shells which typically are in the range of 1 to 50 µm. More recent advancements in microfluidic particles allowed the synthesis of nanometer sized particles from biologically derived polymers. Using specific flow-focusing multiphase designs that control flow rate and temperature, the size of nanoparticle formation can be controlled along with the concentration and configuration of the droplets. Another technique for creating particle-loaded microdroplets is the use of lipid- hydrogel nanoparticles that can be manipulated into more narrowly-shaped droplets, which is useful when soft or brittle materials must be used. These soft materials are especially important in the production of powders. Recent advancements on the nanoscale such as devices that fabricate both spherical and non-spherical droplets that are ultrafast and homogeneous mixed are being produced for large scale production of powdered particles in industrial applications.  Gel Particle Synthesis  The synthesis of gel particles also known as hydrogels, microgels, and nanogels, has been an area of interest for researchers and industries alike for the last several decades. A microfluidic based approach to synthesizing these hydrogel particles is a useful tool, due to high throughput, mono-dispersity of particles, and cost reduction through the use of small reagent volumes. One of the key challenges early on in the field of gels was forming monodisperse particles. Initially polymerization-based techniques were used to form bulk microparticles that were polydisperse in size. These techniques generally were centered around using an aqueous solution that was mixed vigorously to create emulsions. Eventually a technique was developed to create monodisperse biodegradable microgels by making O/W emulsions in an in-line droplet generating channel geometry. This junction geometry accompanied with a surfactant laden continuous phase was responsible for creating microgels made from poly-dex- HEMA. Other device geometries including T-junction style formation are also viable and have been used to make silica-based gels. Once these methods were established, efforts focused on applying functionality to these particles. Examples include bacteria encapsulated particles, drug or protein encapsulated particles, and magnetic gel particles. To insert these functional components into the gel structure, can be as simple as integrating the component into the dispersed phase. In some cases, certain device geometries are preferred, for example a flow focusing junction was used to encapsulate bacteria in agarose microparticles. Multiple emulsions are of interest for pharmaceutical and cosmetic applications and are formed using two consecutive flow focusing junctions. More complicated particles can also be synthesized such as Janus particles, which have surfaces with two or more distinct physical properties. Some examples of the increasing application of gel particles include drug delivery, biomedical applications, and tissue engineering, and many of these applications require monodisperse particles where a microfluidics-based approach is preferred. Bulk emulsification methods are still relevant, though, since not all applications require uniform microparticles. The future of microfluidic synthesis of gels may lie in developing techniques to create bulk amounts of these uniform particles in order to make them more commercially/industrially available. = Extraction and phase transfer using droplet microfluidics = Liquid-liquid extraction is a method used to separate an analyte from a complex mixture; with this method compounds separate based on their relative solubility in different immiscible liquid phases. To overcome some of the disadvantages associated with common bench top methods such as the shake-flask method, Microfluidic liquid-liquid extraction methods have been employed. Microfluidic droplet-based systems have demonstrated the capability to manipulate discrete volumes of fluids in immiscible phases with low Reynolds numbers. and laminar flow regimes. Microscale methods reduce time required, reduce sample and reagent volume, and allow for automation and integration. In some studies, the performance of droplet-based microfluidic extraction compares closely with the shake-flask method. A study which compared the shake-flask and microfluidic liquid-Liquid extrication methods for 26 compounds and found a close correlation between the values obtained (R2= 0.994). It has also been demonstrated that microfluidic liquid-liquid extraction devices can be integrated with other instruments for detection of the extracted analytes. For example, microfluidic extraction could be used to extract an analyte initially in an aqueous phase such as cocaine in saliva then interfaced with on-chip IR spectroscopy for detection. Microfluidic liquid-liquid extraction has shown to be advantageous in numerous applications such as pharmacokinetic drug studies where only small cell numbers are needed, and in additional studies where smaller reagent volumes are required.  Droplet detection  = Separation methods = Droplet-based microfluidic systems can be coupled to separation methods for specific tasks. Common separation techniques coupled to droplet-based microfluidic systems include High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) and electrophoresis.  High performance liquid chromatography  Many forms of chromatography, including high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), nanoflow ultra- performance liquid chromatography (nano-UPLC or nano-LC), and 2-dimensional capillary flow chromatography (capillary LC), have been integrated into the field of droplet-based microfluidics. On the microscale, chemical separation techniques like HPLC can be used in both biological and chemical analysis. Within the field of microfluidics, these techniques have been applied to microfluidic systems at three different stages in the microfluidic process. Off-chip HPLC columns are used to separate analytes before feeding them into a microfluidic device for fractionation and analysis. HPLC columns can also be built directly into microfluidic lab-chips creating monolithic hybrid devices capable of chemical separation as well as droplet formation and manipulation. Additionally, HPLC is used at the tail end of droplet-based microfluidic chemistry as a way to purify, analyze, and/or quantify the products of an experiment. Droplet-based microfluidic devices coupled to HPLC have high detection sensitivity, use low volumes of reagents, have short analysis times, and minimal cross-contamination of analytes, which make them efficient in many aspects. However, there are still problems associated with microscale chromatography such as dispersion of separated bands, diffusion, and “dead volume” in channels after separation. One way to bypass these issues is the use of droplets to compartmentalize separation bands, which combats diffusion and the loss of separated analytes. In early attempts to integrate chromatography with droplet microfluidics, the lower flow rates and pressures required for 2-D capillary LC provided less of an obstacle to overcome in combining these technologies and made it possible to couple multiple 2-D separation techniques into one device (i.e. HPLC x LC, LC x LC, and HPLC x HPLC). HPLC autosamplers feeding into microfluidic devices have taken advantage of the dispersion occurring between separation and droplet formation to feed gradient pulses of analytes into microfluidic devices where the production of thousands of pico-liter droplets captures unique analyte concentrations. Similar approaches have used the withdrawal capabilities of a syringe pump to align the relatively high flow rates necessary for HPLC with the lower flow rates of the continuous medium common in microfluidic devices. The development of nano-LC, or nano-UPLC, has provided another opportunity for coupling with microfluidic devices such that large droplet libraries can be formed with multiple dimensions of information being stored in each droplet. Instead of identifying peaks and storing them as a single sample, as seen in standard LC, these droplet libraries allow for the specific concentration of the analyte to be retained along with its identity. Moreover, the ability to perform high frequency fractionation immediately from the eluent of a nano-LC column has greatly increases peak resolution and improved the overall separation quality when compared to continuous flow nano-LC devices. An HPLC column was first built directly into a microfluidic device by using TPE instead of PDMS for the device fabrication. The additional strength of TPE made it capable of supporting the higher pressures needed for HPLC such that a single, microfluidic lab-chip could perform chemical separation, fractionation, and further droplet manipulation. In order to increase the quality of chromatographic output, sturdier devices made of glass have shown the ability to withstand far greater pressure than TPE. Achieving these higher pressures to increase the degree of separation and eliminating all dead volumes through immediate droplet formation has shown the potential for droplet microfluidics to expand and improve the capabilities of HPLC separations.  Electrophoresis  Capillary electrophoresis (CE) and microcapillary gel electrophoresis (μCGE) are well-recognized microchip electrophoresis (MCE) methods that can provide numerous analytical advantages including high resolution, high sensitivity, and effective coupling to mass spectrometry (MS). Microchip electrophoresis can be applied generally as a method for high-throughput screening processes that help discover and evaluate drugs. Using MCE, specifically CE, microcapillary gel electrophoresis (μCGE) devices are created to perform high-number DNA sample processing, which makes it a good candidate for DNA analysis. μCGE devices are also practical for separation purposes because they use online separation, characterization, encapsulation, and selection of differing analytes originating from a composite sample. All of these advantages of MCE methods translate to microfluidic devices. The reason MCE methods are coupled to droplet-based microfluidic devices is because of the ability to analyze samples on the nanoliter scale. Using MCE methods on a small scale reduces cost and reagent use. Similarly to HPLC, fluorescence based detection techniques are used for capillary electrophoresis, which make these methods practical and can be applied to fields such as biotechnology, analytical chemistry, and drug development. These MCE and other electrophoresis based methods began to develop once capillary electrophoresis gained popularity in the 1980s and gained even more attention in the early 1990s, as it was reviewed nearly 80 times by the year 1992. Mass spectrometry (MS) is a near universal detection technique that is recognized throughout the world as the gold standard for identification of manycompounds. MS is an analytical technique in which chemical species are ionized and sorted before detection, and the resulting mass spectrum is used to identify the ions' parent molecules. This makes MS, unlike other detection techniques (such as fluorescence), label-free; i.e. there is no need to bind additional ligands or groups to the molecule of interest in order to receive a signal and identify the compound. = Mass spectrometry = Mass spectrometry (MS) is a near universal detection technique that is recognized throughout the world as the gold standard for identification of manycompounds.

This makes MS, unlike other detection techniques (such as fluorescence), label-free; i.e. there is no need to bind additional ligands or groups to the molecule of interest in order to receive a signal and identify the compound. There are many cases in which other spectroscopic methods, such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), fluorescence, infrared, or Raman, are not viable as standalone methods due to the particular chemical composition of the droplets. Often, these droplets are sensitive to fluorescent labels, or contain species that are otherwise indeterminately similar, where MS may be employed along with other methods to characterize a specific analyte of interest.[56] [57]However, MS has only recently (in the past decade) gained popularity as a detection method for droplet-based microfluidics (and microfluidics as a whole) due to challenges associated with coupling mass spectrometers with these miniaturized devices. Difficulty of separation/purification make entirely microfluidic scale systems coupled to mass spectrometry ideal in the fields of proteomics, [58] [59] enzyme kinetics,[60] drug discovery,[37] and newborn disease screening.[61] The two primary methods of ionization for mass analysis used in droplet-based microfluidics today are matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI)[62] [63] and electrospray ionization (ESI). Additional methods for coupling, such as (but not limited to) surface acoustic wave nebulization (SAWN), and paper-spray ionization onto miniaturized MS, are being developed as well.[64]  Electrospray ionization  One complication offered by the coupling of MS to droplet-based microfluidics is that the dispersed samples are produced at comparatively low flow rates compared to traditional MS-injection techniques. ESI is able to easily accept these low flow rates and is now commonly exploited for on-line microfluidic analysis. ESI and MALDI offer a high throughput answer to the problem of label-free droplet detection, but ESI requires less intensive sample preparation and fabrication elements that are scalable to microfluidic device scale.[68] ESI involves the application of a high voltage to a carrier stream of analyte-containing droplets, which aerosolizes the stream, followed by detection at a potential-differentiated analyser region. The carrier fluid within a droplet-based microfluidic device, typically an oil, is often an obstacle within ESI. The oil, when part of the flow of droplets going into an ESI-MS instrument, can cause a constant background voltage interfering with the detection of sample droplets. This background interference can be rectified by changing the oil used as a carrier fluid and by adjusting the voltage used for the electrospray. Droplet size, Taylor cone shape, and flow rate can be controlled by varying the potential differential and the temperature of a drying (to evaporate analyte-surrounding solvent) stream of gas (usually nitrogen).[69] Because ESI allows for online droplet detection, other problems posed by segmented or off-chip detection based systems can be solved, such as the minimizing of sample (droplet) dilution, which is especially critical to microfluidic droplet detection where analyte samples are already diluted to the lowest experimentally relevant concentration.[70]  Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization  MALDI is typified by the use of an ultraviolet (UV) laser to trigger ablation of analyte species that are mixed with a matrix of crystallized molecules with high optical absorption. The ions within the resulting ablated gasses are then protonated or deprotonated before acceleration into a mass spectrometer. The primary advantages of MALDI detection over ESI in microfluidic devices are that MALDI allows for much easier multiplexing,[65] which even further increases the device's overall throughput,[63] as well as less reliance on moving parts, and the absence of Taylor cone stability problems posed by microfluidic-scale flow rates.[66] The speed of MALDI detection, along with the scale of microfluidic droplets, allows for improvements upon macro-scale techniques in both throughput and time-of-flight (TOF) resolution.[60] [63] Where typical MS detection setups often utilize separation techniques such as chromatography, MALDI setups require a sufficiently purified sample to be mixed with pre- determined organic matrices, suited for the specific sample, prior to detection.[58] MALDI matrix composition must be tuned to produce appropriate fragmentation and ablation of analytes. One method to obtain a purified sample from droplet-based microfluidics is to end the microfluidic channel onto a MALDI plate, with aqueous droplets forming on hydrophilic regions on the plate. Solvent and carrier fluid are then allowed to evaporate, leaving behind only the dried droplets of the sample of interest, after which the MALDI matrix is applied to the dried droplets. This sample preparation has notable limitations and complications, which are not currently overcome for all types of samples. Additionally, MALDI matrices are preferentially in much higher concentrations than the analyte sample, which allows for microfluidic droplet transportation to be incorporated into online MALDI matrix production. Due to the low number of known matrices and trial and error nature of finding appropriate new matrix compositions,[67] this can be the determining factor in the use of other forms of spectroscopy over MALDI. = Raman spectroscopy = Raman spectroscopy is a spectroscopic technique that provides non-destructive analysis capable of identifying components within mixtures with chemical specificity without complex sample preparation. Raman spectroscopy relies on photon scattering following visible light radiation, where the shift in photon energies corresponds to information about the system’s vibrational modes and their frequencies. Upon obtaining vibrational mode frequencies, qualitative classifications about the system can be both made and reinforced. Raman spectroscopy works well in parallel with microfluidic devices for many qualitative biological applications. For some applications, Raman spectroscopy is preferred over other detection methods such as Infrared (IR) spectroscopy as water has a strong interference signal with IR but not with Raman. Likewise, methods such as high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), mass spectrometry (MS), or gas chromatography (GC) are also not ideal as these methods require larger sample sizes. Since microfluidics enables experiments with small volumes (including analysis of single cells or few cells), Raman is a leading microfluidic detection method. Specifically, Raman integration with microfluidic devices has strong applications in systems where lipid identification is necessary, common in biofuel research. For example, a lipid fluorescent assay is not selective enough and thus cannot identify molecular differences the way Raman can through molecular vibrations. Raman, when coupled with microfluidic devices, can also monitor fluid mixing and trapping of liquids and can also detect solid and gas phases within microfluidic platforms, an ability that is applicable to the study of gas-liquid solubility. Raman spectroscopy in microfluidic devices is applied and detected using either integrated fiberoptics within a microfluidic chip or by placing the device on a Raman microscope. Furthermore, some microfluidic systems utilize metallic colloid or nanoparticles within solution to capitalize on surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). SERS can improve Raman scattering by up to a factor of 1011 by forming charge-transfer complexes on the surfaces. It follows that these devices are commonly fabricated out of nanoporous polycarbonate membranes allowing for easy coating of nanoparticle. However, if fabricated out of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), signal interference with the Raman spectrum can occur. PDMS generates a strong Raman signal which can easily overpower and interfere with the desired signal. A common solution for this is fabricating the microfluidic device such that a confocal pinhole can be used for the Raman laser. Typical confocal Raman microscopy allows for spectroscopic information from small focal volumes less than 1 micron cubed, and thus smaller than the microfluidic channel dimensions. Raman signal is inherently weak; therefore, for short detection times at small sample volumes in microfluidic devices, signal amplification is utilized. Multi-photon Raman spectroscopy, such as stimulated Raman spectroscopy (SRS) or coherent anti- Stokes Raman spectroscopy (CARS) help enhance signals from substances in microfluidic devices. For droplet-based microfluidics, Raman detection provides online analysis of multiple analytes within droplets or continuous phase. Raman signal is sensitive to concentration changes, therefore solubility and mixing kinetics of a droplet-based microfluidic system can be detected using Raman. Considerations include the refractive index difference at the interface of the droplet and continuous phase, as well as between fluid and channel connections. = Fluorescent detection = Fluorescence spectroscopy is one of the most common droplet detection techniques. It provides a rapid response, and, for applicable analytes, it has a strong signal. The use of fluorescence spectroscopy in microfluidics follows a similar format to most other fluorescent analytical techniques. A light source is used to excite analyte molecules in the sample, after which the analyte fluoresces, and the fluorescence response is the measured output. Cameras can be used to capture the fluorescence signal of the droplets, and filters are often used to filter out scattered excitation light. In microfluidic droplet detection, the experimental setup of a fluorescence instrument can vary greatly. A common setup in fluorescent droplet detection is with the use of an epifluorescence microscope. This sometimes utilizes a confocal geometry, which can vary depending on experimental needs. For example, Jeffries et al. reported success with exploring an orthogonal confocal geometry, as opposed to a standard epi geometry. However, other setups for fluorescence detection have been explored, as epifluorescence microscopes can be expensive and difficult to upkeep. Cole et al. have proposed and tested an experimental setup with fiber optics to conduct fluorescence analysis of microfluidic droplets. Fluorescence detection of droplets has a number of advantages. First, it can accommodate a large and fast throughput. Analysis of thousands of samples can be conducted in a short period of time, which is advantageous for the analysis of a large number of samples. Another advantage is the accuracy of the method. In an analysis performed by Li et al., it was found that use of fluorescence detection techniques yielded 100% detection accuracy in 13 of 15 collected images. The remaining two had relative errors around 6%. Another advantage of fluorescence detection is that it allows for quantitative analysis of droplet spacing in a sample. This is done by use of temporal measurements and the flow velocity of the analyte. The time spacing between signals allows for calculation of droplet spacing. Further fluorescence analysis of microfluidic droplet samples can be used to measure the fluorescent lifetime of samples, providing additional information that is not obtainable for fluorescence intensity measurements alone. The applications of fluorescence detection are varied, with many of its uses centered in biological applications. Frenz et al. utilized fluorescence detection of droplets to examine enzyme kinetics. For this experiment, b-lactamase interacted with fluorocillin, a fluorogenic substrate. Fluorescence of the droplets was measured at multiple time intervals to examine the change with time. This detection method goes beyond biological applications, though, and allows for the physical study of droplet formation and evolution. For example, Sakai et al. used fluorescence detection to monitor droplet size. This was done by collecting fluorescence data to calculate the concentration of a fluorescent dye within a single droplet, thus allowing size growth to be monitored. The use of fluorescence detection techniques can be expanded into applications beyond data collection; a widely used method of cell and droplet sorting in microfluidics is fluorescence- activated sorting, where droplets are sorted into different channels or collection outlets based on their fluorescence intensity. Fluorescent quantum dots have been used to develop biosensing platforms and drug delivery in microfluidic devices. Quantum dots are useful due to their small size, precise excitation wavelength, and high quantum yield. These are advantages over traditional dyes which may interfere with the activity of the studied compound. However, the bulk creation and conjugation of quantum dots to molecules of interest remains a challenge. Microfluidic devices that conjugate nucleotides with quantum dots have been designed to solve this issue by significantly reducing the conjugation time from two days to minutes. DNA- quantum dot conjugates are of importance to detect complementary DNA and miRNA in biological systems. = Electrochemical detection = Electrochemical detection serves as an inexpensive alternative to not only measure chemical composition in certain cases, but also droplet length, frequency, conductivity, and velocity at high speeds and usually with very little space compensation on the chip. The method was first discussed in Luo et al. wherein the team was able to successfully measure the size and ion concentration in pico-liter droplets containing dissolved NaCl ions. It is usually performed with a set or series of microelectrodes which measure the perturbations of current, smaller drops giving smaller perturbations while larger drops giving longer curves. The number of perturbations in the current can also indicate the frequency of the droplets passing the electrode as a way to determine the rate of droplets as well. Several different compounds have been suggested for use within the electrodes, as accurate, precise, and significant readings can be difficult within the microscale. These compounds range from carbon paste electrodes that are applied directly to the chip, to platinum black electrodeposited on platinum wire in tandem with a silver chloride on silver microelectrode to increase activity and surface area. As for chemical composition, readings are achieved through chronoamperometric analysis of electro-active compounds within the droplets as stated above. The potential varies dependent on the electrically viable ions, dissolved sodium and chlorine ions in this experiment, and their concentrations within each droplet. Another group displayed, with a series of controls, that mixed droplet composition involving potassium iodide was detected accurately on the time scale of seconds with optimal voltage, velocity, and pH ranges. In addition to this, a more unique approach is developing within chronoamperometric readings, where magneto-fluidic systems have been created and the potential readings are measured in otherwise electro-inactive fluids by the dissolution of magnetic microparticles into the reagent. This method is enhanced into a digital microfluidic (DMF) setting, where gold and silver electrodes in junction with dissolved magnetic microparticles in the fluids replaced the typical fluorescence-based detection of droplets in the immunoassay of biomarker analytes. The above experiment by Shamsi et al, alludes to the main use for electrochemical detection in microfluidics; biosensing for various measurements such as enzyme kinetics and biological assays of many other types of cells. Increased control on the system is needed for these processes as with increasing flow rate, enzyme detection decreases. Though as an enzymatic reaction progresses, the amperometric reading will evolve as well, allowing for rapid monitoring of the kinetics. Also, specific surfactants can lack biocompatibility with the system, affecting the enzyme and skewing detection. The reaches of this application have even had effects in aquaculture and economics, as electrochemical sensing has been used to test the freshness of fish rapidly. Use of this detection method is primarily found in the electrowetting of dielectric DMFs, where the sensing electrode apparatus can be reconfigurable and has a longer lifetime while still producing accurate results.

The dual graviton was first hypothesized in 1980. It was theoretically modeled in 2000s, which was then predicted in eleven-dimensional mathematics of SO(8) supergravity in the framework of electric-magnetic duality. It again emerged in the E11 generalized geometry in eleven dimensions, and the E7 generalized vielbein-geometry in eleven dimensions. While there is no local coupling between graviton and dual graviton, the field introduced by dual graviton may be coupled to a BF model as non-local gravitational fields in extra dimensions. A massive dual gravity of Ogievetsky-Polubarinov model can be obtained by coupling the dual graviton field to the curl of its own energy-momentum tensor. The previously mentioned theories of dual graviton are in flat space. In de Sitter and anti-de Sitter spaces (A)dS, the massless dual graviton exhibits less gauge symmetries dynamics compared with those of Curtright field in flat space, hence the mixed-symmetry field propagates in more degrees of freedom. However, the dual graviton in (A)dS transforms under GL(D) representation, which is identical to that of massive dual graviton in flat space. This apparent paradox can be resolved using the unfolding technique in Brink, Metsaev, and Vasiliev conjecture. For the massive dual graviton in (A)dS, the flat limit is clarified after expressing dual field in terms of the Stueckelberg coupling of a massless spin-2 field with a Proca field. Dual linearized gravity The dual formulations of linearized gravity are described by a mixed Young symmetry tensor T_{\\\\lambda_1 \\\\lambda_2 \\\\cdots \\\\lambda_{D-3} \\\\mu}, the so- called dual graviton, in any spacetime dimension D > 4 with the following characters: :T_{\\\\lambda_1 \\\\lambda_2 \\\\cdots \\\\lambda_{D-3} \\\\mu} = T_{[\\\\lambda_1 \\\\lambda_2 \\\\cdots \\\\lambda_{D-3}] \\\\mu}, :T_{[\\\\lambda_1 \\\\lambda_2 \\\\cdots \\\\lambda_{D-3} \\\\mu]} = 0. where square brackets show antisymmetrization. For 5-D spacetime, the spin-2 dual graviton is described by the Curtright field T_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta\\\\gamma}. The symmetry properties imply that :T_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta\\\\gamma} = T_{[\\\\alpha\\\\beta]\\\\gamma}, :T_{[\\\\alpha\\\\beta]\\\\gamma}+T_{[\\\\beta\\\\gamma]\\\\alpha}+T_{[\\\\gamma\\\\alpha ]\\\\beta} = 0. The Lagrangian action for the spin-2 dual graviton T_{\\\\lambda_1 \\\\lambda_2\\\\mu} in 5-D spacetime, the Curtright field, becomes :{\\\\cal L}_{\\\\rm dual}=-\\\\frac{1}{12}\\\\left(F_{[\\\\alpha\\\\beta\\\\gamma]\\\\delta}F^{[\\\\alpha\\\\beta\\\\gamma]\\\\delta}-3F_{[\\\\alpha\\\\beta\\\\xi]}{}^{\\\\xi}F^{[\\\\alpha\\\\beta\\\\lambda]}{}_{\\\\lambda}\\\\right), where F_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta\\\\gamma\\\\delta} is defined as :F_{[\\\\alpha\\\\beta\\\\gamma]\\\\delta}=\\\\partial_{\\\\alpha} T_{[\\\\beta\\\\gamma ]\\\\delta}+\\\\partial_{\\\\beta}T_{[\\\\gamma\\\\alpha]\\\\delta} +\\\\partial_{\\\\gamma}T_{[\\\\alpha\\\\beta]\\\\delta}, and the gauge symmetry of the Curtright field is :\\\\delta_{\\\\sigma,\\\\alpha} T_{[\\\\alpha\\\\beta]\\\\gamma}=2(\\\\partial_{[\\\\alpha} \\\\sigma_{\\\\beta]\\\\gamma} +\\\\partial_{[\\\\alpha}\\\\alpha_{\\\\beta]\\\\gamma}-\\\\partial_{\\\\gamma}\\\\alpha_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta}). The dual Riemann curvature tensor of the dual graviton is defined as follows: :E_{[\\\\alpha\\\\beta\\\\delta][\\\\varepsilon\\\\gamma]}\\\\equiv\\\\frac{1}{2} (\\\\partial_{\\\\varepsilon}F_{[\\\\alpha\\\\beta\\\\delta]\\\\gamma}-\\\\partial_{\\\\gamma}F_{[\\\\alpha\\\\beta\\\\delta]\\\\varepsilon}), and the dual Ricci curvature tensor and scalar curvature of the dual graviton become, respectively :E_{[\\\\alpha\\\\beta]\\\\gamma}= g^{\\\\varepsilon\\\\delta} E_{[\\\\alpha\\\\beta\\\\delta][\\\\varepsilon\\\\gamma]}, :E_{\\\\alpha}=g^{\\\\beta\\\\gamma}E_{[\\\\alpha\\\\beta]\\\\gamma}. They fulfill the following Bianchi identities :\\\\partial_{\\\\alpha}(E^{[\\\\alpha\\\\beta]\\\\gamma}+g^{\\\\gamma[\\\\alpha}E^{\\\\beta]})= 0, where g^{\\\\alpha\\\\beta} is the 5-D spacetime metric.  Massive dual gravity  In 4-D, the Lagrangian of the spinless massive version of the dual gravity is \\\\mathcal{L^{\\\\rm spinless}_{\\\\rm dual, massive}} = -\\\\frac{1}{2}u+\\\\frac{1}{2}(v-gu)^2+\\\\frac{1}{3}g(v-gu)^3 \\\\sideset{_3}{_2}F(1,\\\\frac{1}{2},\\\\frac{3}{2};2,\\\\frac{5}{2};-4g^2(v-gu)^2), where V^{\\\\mu}=\\\\frac{1}{6}\\\\epsilon^{\\\\mu\\\\alpha\\\\beta\\\\gamma}V_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta\\\\gamma}~, v=V_{\\\\mu}V^{\\\\mu} \\\\text{and} ~u=\\\\partial_{\\\\mu}V^{\\\\mu}. The coupling constant g/m appears in the equation of motion to couple the trace of the conformally improved energy momentum tensor \\\\theta to the field as in the following equation \\\\left(\\\\Box+m^2\\\\right)V_{\\\\mu}=\\\\frac{g}{m}\\\\partial_{\\\\mu}\\\\theta. And for the spin-2 massive dual gravity in 4-D, the Lagrangian is formulated in terms of the Hessian matrix that also constitutes Horndeski theory (Galileons/massive gravity) through\\\\text{det} (\\\\delta^\\\\mu_ u+\\\\frac{g}{m}K^\\\\mu_ u)=1-\\\\frac{1}{2}(g/m)^2K_\\\\alpha^\\\\beta K_\\\\beta^\\\\alpha+\\\\frac{1}{3}(g/m)^3K_\\\\alpha^\\\\beta K_\\\\beta^\\\\gamma K_\\\\gamma^\\\\alpha+\\\\frac{1}{8}(g/m)^4\\\\left[(K_\\\\alpha^\\\\beta K_\\\\beta^\\\\alpha)^2-2K_\\\\alpha^\\\\beta K_\\\\beta^\\\\gamma K_\\\\gamma^\\\\delta K_\\\\delta^\\\\alpha\\\\right], where K_\\\\mu^ u=3 \\\\partial_\\\\alpha T_{[\\\\beta\\\\gamma]\\\\mu}\\\\epsilon^{\\\\alpha\\\\beta\\\\gamma u}. So the zeroth interaction part, i.e., the third term in the Lagrangian, can be read as K_\\\\alpha^\\\\beta \\\\theta_\\\\beta^\\\\alpha so the equation of motion becomes \\\\left(\\\\Box+m^2\\\\right)T_{[\\\\alpha\\\\beta]\\\\gamma}=\\\\frac{g}{m}P_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta\\\\gamma,\\\\lambda\\\\mu u}\\\\partial^{\\\\lambda}\\\\theta^{\\\\mu u}, where the P_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta\\\\gamma,\\\\lambda\\\\mu u}=2\\\\epsilon_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta\\\\lambda\\\\mu}\\\\eta_{\\\\gamma u}+\\\\epsilon_{\\\\alpha\\\\gamma\\\\lambda\\\\mu}\\\\eta_{\\\\beta u}-\\\\epsilon_{\\\\beta\\\\gamma\\\\lambda\\\\mu}\\\\eta_{\\\\alpha u} is Young symmetrizer of such SO(2) theory. For solutions of the massive theory in arbitrary N-D, i.e., Curtright field T_{[\\\\lambda_1\\\\lambda_2...\\\\lambda_{N-3}]\\\\mu}, the symmetrizer becomes that of SO(N-2). Dual graviton coupling with BF theory Dual gravitons have interaction with topological BF model in D = 5 through the following Lagrangian action :S_{\\\\rm L} = \\\\int d^{5}x( {\\\\cal L}_{\\\\rm dual} + {\\\\cal L}_{\\\\rm BF}). where :{\\\\cal L}_{\\\\rm BF}=Tr[\\\\mathbf{B}\\\\wedge \\\\mathbf{F}] Here, \\\\mathbf{F}\\\\equiv d\\\\mathbf{A} \\\\sim R_{ab} is the curvature form, and \\\\mathbf{B} \\\\equiv e^{a} \\\\wedge e^{b} is the background field. In principle, it should similarly be coupled to a BF model of gravity as the linearized Einstein–Hilbert action in D > 4: :S_{\\\\rm BF} = \\\\int d^{5}x {\\\\cal L}_{\\\\rm BF} \\\\sim S_{\\\\rm EH} = {1 \\\\over 2} \\\\int \\\\mathrm{d}^5x R \\\\sqrt{-g}. where g=\\\\det(g_{\\\\mu u}) is the determinant of the metric tensor matrix, and R is the Ricci scalar. Dual gravitoelectromagnetism In similar manner while we define gravitomagnetic and gravitoelectic for the graviton, we can define electric and magnetic fields for the dual graviton. There are the following relation between the gravitoelectic field E_{ab}[h_{ab}] and gravitomagnetic field B_{ab}[h_{ab}] of the graviton h_{ab} and the gravitoelectic field E_{ab}[T_{abc}] and gravitomagnetic field B_{ab}[T_{abc}] of the dual graviton T_{abc}:Henneaux, M., \\"E10 and gravitational duality\\" https://www.theorie.physik.uni- muenchen.de/activities/workshops/archive_workshops_conferences/jointerc_2014/henneaux.pdf :B_{ab}[T_{abc}]=E_{ab}[h_{ab}] :E_{ab}[T_{abc}]=-B_{ab}[h_{ab}] and scalar curvature R with dual scalar curvature E: :E=\\\\star R :R=-\\\\star E where \\\\star denotes the Hodge dual. Dual graviton in conformal gravity The free (4,0) conformal gravity in D = 6 is defined as :\\\\mathcal{S}=\\\\int \\\\mathrm{d}^6x \\\\sqrt{-g} C_{ABCD}C^{ABCD}, where C_{ABCD} is the Weyl tensor in D = 6. The free (4,0) conformal gravity can be reduced to the graviton in the ordinary space, and the dual graviton in the dual space in D = 4. It is easy to notice the similarity between the Lanczos tensor, that generates the Weyl tensor in geometric theories of gravity, and Curtright tensor, particularly their shared symmetry properties of the linearized spin connection in Einstein's theory. However, Lanczos tensor is a tensor of geometry in D=4, meanwhile Curtright tensor is a field tensor in arbitrary dimensions.

History  The newspaper published its first issue as The Town Crier on Friday, November 1, 1946. The paper was founded by married couple Ernie and Betty Maxwell, a visual artist and a former Broadway dancer, who moved to the town in 1944 during a post-war boom in logging and tourism. The paper was published from their house until at least 1949. Ernie Maxwell continued as editor/publisher until 1957, when he hired an editor and renamed it to the Idyllwild Town Crier, though from 1969 to 1971 the paper used its original name. In 1972, Maxwell sold the paper to Luther and Marilyn Weare. Ernie Maxwell died in 1994. May 1989, the Weares sold the paper to Chronicle Publishing Company (publisher of the San Francisco Chronicle). The Idyllwild Town Crier changed corporate hands in 1994 when it sold to England- based Tindle Newspaper Group.

Lautenberg Deep-Sea Coral Protection Area is an offshore marine protected area for deep-sea corals off the coast of the Mid-Atlantic states of the United States. On September 26, 2016, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Fisheries and the Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council proposed a final rule to designate a large offshore protected area for deep-sea corals in the Mid-Atlantic. The rule took effect on January 13, 2017. The final rule was named in honor of Senator Frank Lautenberg, a U.S. Senator from New Jersey responsible for many ocean conservation policies.  Location  457x457pxTargeted areas include areas of known or highly likely coral presence in underwater canyons or slope areas along the edge of the continental shelf of the United States. The deep-sea coral protection area includes the continental shelf/slope break off the Mid-Atlantic states (New York to North Carolina) to the border of the U.S.'s Exclusive Economic Zone. It starts at a depth of approximately 450 m, and encompasses 15 discrete zones. The area covers 38,000 square miles of federal waters, approximately the same size of Virginia. According to the Natural Resources Defense Council, the environmental advocacy group, it is the \\"largest area in the U.S. Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico protected from a range of destructive fishing gear.\\"  Regulation  Prohibited gear includes bottom tending otter trawls, beam trawls, hydraulic dredges, non-hydraulic dredges, seines, longlines, pots and traps, and sink or gill nets. The rule does not apply to recreational fishing, commercial gear types that do not contact the seafloor, or the American lobster trap fishery and the deep sea red crab commercial trap fishery. Vessels may transit through the area if fishing gear is stowed and not available for immediate use. Requires that vessels issued an Illex squid moratorium permit have a vessel monitoring system (VMS) installed, and operators of these vessels have to declare Illex squid trips on which 10,000 lb or more of Illex squid would be harvested.  History  This act is in accordance with NOAA’s National Marine Fisheries Service approval of Amendment 16 to the Atlantic Mackerel, Squid, and Butterfish Fishery Management Plan (FMP) to protect deep-sea corals from the potential harm of commercial fishing gear. It also follows the central dogma of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act to promote optimal exploitation of U.S. coastal fisheries in line with sustainability policies. The Regional Fishery Management Councils has the authority to: :(A) Designate zones where, and periods when, fishing shall be limited, or shall not be permitted, or shall be permitted only by specified types of fishing vessels or with specified types and quantities of fishing gear; :(B) Designate such zones in areas where deep- sea corals are identified under section 408 (this section describes the deep- sea coral research and technology program), to protect deep-sea corals from physical damage from fishing gear or to prevent loss or damage to such fishing gear from interactions with deep-sea corals, after considering long-term sustainable uses of fishery resources in such areas; and :(C) With respect to any closure of an area under the Magnuson-Stevens Act that prohibits all fishing, ensure that such closure: ::(i) Is based on the best scientific information available; ::(ii) Includes criteria to assess the conservation benefit of the closed area; ::(iii) Establishes a timetable for review of the closed area's performance that is consistent with the purposes of the closed area; and ::(iv) Is based on an assessment of the benefits and impacts of the closure, including its size, in relation to other management measures (either alone or in combination with such measures), including the benefits and impacts of limiting access to: Users of the area, overall fishing activity, fishery science, and fishery and marine conservation.

It is a professional network of water experts which facilitates global knowledge sharing of water resources information across disciplines and geographies. IWRA accomplishes its goal of education and knowledge sharing through events, publications and networking opportunities. The IWRA executive office is located in Paris. History The IWRA was incorporated in the U.S. state of Wisconsin in 1971 as a global forum for interdisciplinary knowledge and experience exchange, to supplement the activities of existing organisations and to fill interdisciplinary voids that existed in the professional field of water resources. The association began operation in 1972 with Ven Te Chow as the first president. In 1988, the Ven Te Chow Memorial Lecture and Award were initiated to honour the founding president. World Water Congress The flagship event organized by the IWRA is the World Water Congress. It has occurred 16 times since 1973, in various locations around the world, having previously occurred in the USA, India, Mexico, Argentina, Belgium, Canada, Morocco, Egypt, Australia, Spain, France, Brazil, and Scotland. These congresses are a meeting space for stakeholders from multiple disciplines to connect, identify global water themes and present new knowledge, research and developments in the industry. Its themes work towards achieving elements of the Sustainable Development Goals and the COP 21 Paris Agreement. During the VIIIth World Water Congress held in Cairo, Egypt in November 1994, a special session led to the development of the World Water Council. The XVIth World Water Congress took place in Cancun, Mexico in May 2017, and focused on the theme of Bridging Science and Policy. Cancun Declaration A major outcome of the XVI World Water Congress was IWRA's Cancun Declaration - A Call for Action to Bridge Science and Water Policy- Making for Sustainable Developmenthttp://www.iwra.org/wp- content/uploads/2017/03/IWRA_CANCUN-DECLARATION_Final.pdf. This Declaration calls for urgent mobilisation of knowledge generators, governments, donors, professionals and civil society to join their efforts to achieve the 2030 Agenda and Sustainable Development Goals. At a time where science is often pressured from both policy and funding perspectives, this declaration stresses that business as usual in science, policy and implementation is not an option, and that stronger efforts for new interdisciplinary knowledge and better knowledge sharing are crucial. This means that scientific evidence-based policy making is essential, and the dissemination of good practices is key for fostering the implementation of adaptive solutions. The Declaration calls for action from policy makers, scientists and professionals as well as civil society. IWRA Cancun Declaration Publications The official peer-reviewed journal of IWRA is Water International (WI), published through Taylor and Francis. It contains original articles and technical notes. In addition, IWRA publishes Policy Briefs alongside WI articles, published with support from Routledge.

Early life and education Morgan Hebard was born on February 23, 1887 in Cleveland, Ohio to Hannah Jeanette (née Morgan) and Charles Samuel Hebard, in the lumber manufacturing business in Pequaming, Michigan at Charles Hebard and Sons, where his father had co-developed a saw-mill and associated company town and later the Hebard Cypress Company, where the family business constructed the Waycross and Southern Railroad specifically to harvest the cypress trees in the Okefenokee Swamp. The family also had houses in Thomasville, Georgia and Chestnut Hill, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Hebard attended Asheville School in North Carolina, educated by a private tutor, before graduating from Yale University in 1910. At Yale, Hebard won prizes as a member of the gun team. At the time of his graduation, he intended to enter the lumber business. Career He worked for brokers and bankers, Henry & West from 1910 to 1912 in Philadelphia. From 1910 to 1928, he was a research associate at the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia. For ten years after that he was the curate of entomology. Between 1938 and 1940, he was a research fellow. In 1945 and 1946, he was a benefactor of the Academy. During field trips to Western Europe, Panama, Cuba, Jamaica, Columbia and the Bahamas, Hebard built a collection of 250,000 specimens, which he presented to the Academy in 1945. He wrote 197 journal articles and monographs on entomological topics, either individually or jointly with his fellow entomologist, James A. G. Rehn, comprising over 5,000 pages. He described over 800 new species of orthopteroids; this included 44 new species and ten new genera of Phasmids (six new genera on his own and four as co-author with Rehn). Forty orthopteroid species and nine genera have been named after him, including: one Phasmid species, Ilocano hebardi Rehn & Rehn, 1938; three species of Mantids, and two genera: Hebardia Werner, 1921 and Hebardiella Werner, 1924; eight species of Cockroaches, and four genera: Hebardina Bei-Bienko, 1938, Hebardula Uvarov, 1939, Euhebardula Princis, 1953 (a replacement name for Hebardula Princis, 1950); and 28 species of Orthoptera, three genera: Hebardiniella Chopard, 1932, (emendation of Hebardinella Chopard, 1932), Hebarditettix Günther, 1938 and Hebardacris Rehn, 1952. He was a member of American Entomological Society, and for a time it's Treasurer, and was elected a Fellow of the Entomological Society of America. He was an honorary member of the Entomological Society of France, and also of the Columbian Natural Science Society. World War I During World War I, Hebard was a Second Lieutenant for the Signal Officers Reserve Corps. He was a post supply officer and at Columbia University was acting adjutant at the Signal Corps School. He also served in Washington, D.C. at the Military Intelligence Division.

The formation consists mainly of shales with at the edges of the Bogotá savanna lignites and sandstones. The Sabana Formation dates to the Quaternary period; Middle to Late Pleistocene epoch, and has a maximum thickness of , varying greatly across the savanna. It is the uppermost formation of the lacustrine and fluvio-glacial sediments of paleolake Humboldt, that existed at the edge of the Eastern Hills until the latest Pleistocene. The uppermost sediments of the Sabana Formation were deposited during the Last Glacial Maximum, a time when the first humans populated the Bogotá savanna. These hunter-gatherers used the bones of the still extant Pleistocene megafauna as Haplomastodon waringi, Cuvieronius hyodon and Equus amerhippus lasallei, of which fossils have been found in the Sabana Formation. Knowledge about the formation has been provided by geologists Alberto Guerrero, Thomas van der Hammen and others.  Etymology  The formation was first defined and named after the Bogotá savanna (Sabana de Bogotá) by Hubach in 1957, further described by Van der Hammen in 1973,Acosta & Garay, 2002, p.65 Guerrero (1992, 1993, 1996) and by Helmens and Van der Hammen in 1995.Montoya & Reyes, 2005, p.72Guerrero, 1992, p.6Guerrero, 1996, p.3  Regional setting  The Bogotá savanna is a slightly undulated montane savanna in the southwestern part of the Altiplano Cundiboyacense, a high plateau in the Eastern Ranges of the Colombian Andes. The Altiplano was formed during the latest stage of Andean uplift in the Plio- Pleistocene, exposing rocks of mainly Cretaceous to Paleogene ages at surface. A small massif of Paleozoic age is present in the northern part of the Altiplano; the Floresta Massif around Floresta comprising the fossiliferous formations Floresta and Cuche. During the Mesozoic, the central part of Colombia was a rift basin to the west of the Guyana Shield, where series of marine platform deposits were deposited. The proto-Caribbean, the result of the break-up of Pangea, formed a long seaway into the South American Plate, up to Bolivia. During the Late Cretaceous, the Western and Central Ranges of the Colombian Andes began rising, while the Eastern Ranges was still absent. The main phase of tectonic uplift of the Eastern Ranges commenced in the Middle Miocene, marked by a change in paleocurrents of the fluvial deposits of the Honda Group, the most fossiliferous stratigraphic unit of Colombia. Subduction of the Nazca Plate underneath western South America and the resulting compression in the continent created reversal of former extensional faults of the Mesozoic rift basin in the Eastern Ranges. A series of fold and thrust belts, oriented in a north–south to northeast–southwest sense, were formed in the Eastern Andes, uplifting the former marine strata and creating a high plateau between the western and eastern fronts; the Altiplano Cundiboyacense. The tectonic movements of this Andean orogenic phase are reflected in Upper Miocene units as the Marichuela Formation, underlying the Pliocene and Pleistocene sediments of which the Sabana Formation represents the final chapter.  Description  The Sabana Formation overlies the Tilatá Formation with type locality the Sisga Reservoir in Chocontá = Lithologies = The Sabana Formation consists mainly of horizontally bedded little consolidated grey and greenish shales with lignite and diatomites, and fine to coarse sandstones at the edges of the Bogotá savanna.Guerrero, 1996, p.4 Numerous volcanic ash deposits are noted in the Sabana Formation. Organic material is preserved in black soils and silts form the terraces of the central part of the savanna. The volcanic ash had as provenance area the Central Ranges of the Colombian Andes, with probably minor influences from the volcanic areas of Boyacá (Paipa–Iza volcanic complex). The diatomites are associated with the ash layers, a common feature in the geological record.Guerrero, 1996, p.5 = Stratigraphy = The Sabana Formation in some areas conformably overlies the Subachoque Formation, in other parts unconformably the Tilatá Formation, and is overlain by the alluvium of the Holocene, with the southeasternmost area of the savanna covered and intercalated by the fluvio-glacial deposits of the Tunjuelo Formation. The formation is subdivided into six units of alternating shales and fine sandstones. The age has been estimated to be Middle to Late Pleistocene, based on fission track analysis and radiocarbon dating. The Sabana Formation is time equivalent with the Soatá (upper Sabana),Villarroel et al., 2001, p.84 and Sogamoso Formations of the northern Altiplano,Guerrero, 1993, p.7 and the upper part of the Guayabo Formation of the Llanos Basin.Guerrero, 1993, p.9 = Depositional environment = The Sabana Formation was deposited in a fluvio-glacial environment, extensive in the central part of the Bogotá savanna and narrow in the northern region The depositional environment has been interpreted as lacustrine (Lake Humboldt) and fluvio-deltaic, with a near-continuous deposition since the Late Pliocene. The Sabana Formation represents the uppermost unit of the lacustrine deposition of Lake Humboldt. At the edges of the lake, numerous deltas of fluvio-glacial origin were present, reflected in the coarser sediments. During periods of stormy climate around the lake, coarser sediments were transported to the interior of the lake. The depositional cycles were geologically speaking fast and the water level of the lake fluctuated greatly during its history. Furthermore, the local tectonic activity of the Bogotá savanna, related to movements of the Bogotá Fault, influenced the depositional cycles. The middle unit of the formation shows a drying out of the lake and subaerial erosional surfaces.Guerrero, 1996, p.10 The upper part of the Sabana sequence is characterised by fluvial deposits around a retreating Lake Humboldt, estimated at an age of around 30,000 years BP. The glacial origin was predominantly the Sumapaz Páramo to the south of the Bogotá savanna, with minor snow-capped peaks in the Eastern Hills of Bogotá.Hoyos et al., 2015, p.265 Present-day, the lakes of Fúquene, Herrera and Suesca are remnants of Lake Humboldt, as well as the many wetlands of Bogotá. = Paleoecology = The Sabana Formation was deposited during the Pleistocene glaciations and interglacials (\\"ice ages\\"). The fluctuations in climate in the Eastern Colombian Andes have been studied around Lake Fúquene at an altitude of , to the north of the Bogotá savanna. During the Last Glacial Maximum of the Pleistocene, the paleoecology of the region varied drastically, marking movements of the upper tree line and the types of vegetation. Pollen analysis shows that páramo vegetation was abundant from 30 ka to 17,500 years ago, with an increase in Andean forest frequency dated at 15.6 ka. Between 13,000 and 11,000 years BP, a decrease in Andean forest percentage is observed, indicative of a colder climate than before. This period has been named the Fúquene stadial. The stadial is followed by an interstadial (Guantivá), with an increase in lake levels of Lake Fúquene.Urrego et al., 2016, p.703 The wetter periods of the interstadial covered earlier paleotopography with humic sediments.Scott & Meyers, 1994, p.390 During the last phase of deposition of the Sabana Formation, the Bogotá savanna was surrounded by populations of Pleistocene megafauna. Fossils of the ground sloths Megatherium and Eremotherium have been uncovered from Quipile,De Porta, 1961, p.52Bürgl, 1956 and Fusagasugá and Tocaima respectively, Haplomastodon waringii from Tocaima and Pubenza, accompanied by shells of Neocylotus cf. cingulatus, to the west of the savanna, and Cuvieronius hyodon and Equus amerhippus lasallei from the Sabana Formation at Tibitó.Correal Urrego, 1990, p.77De Porta, 1960 The migration of fauna was favoured by the existence of a dry corridor from the Magdalena River to the Eastern Ranges.Correal Urrego, 1993, p.4 Analysis of the fluorine in a fossil molar of a gomphothere, found in the Sabana Formation at Mosquera, provided an age between the last interglacial and the first stage of the last glacial of the Last Glacial Maximum.Hammen, 1986, p.29 The fossils of Pubenza and Tibitó were dated at 16,300 ± 150 and 11,740 ± 110 years BP respectively.Hammen, 1986, p.30 Researchers at the Universidade Federal do Estado do Rio de Janeiro, UNIRIO propose that all gomphotheres found in Colombia should be reassigned to a single species; Notiomastodon platensis.Mothé et al., 2016aMothé et al., 2016bMothé & Avilla, 2015Mothé et al., 2012 At the latest age of Tibitó, a páramo ecosystem was dominant.Cooke, 1988, p.180 File:Megatherium_NT_small.jpgMegatherium File:Cuvieronius.jpgCuvieronius File:Caballo_sudamericano_(Parque_chuyaca_- _Osorno).jpgEquus amerhippus lasallei  Human settlement  The latest sedimentation phase of the Sabana Formation, evidenced by the sites El Abra, Tibitó and Tequendama, was accompanied by the first confirmed human settlement in Colombia. Around 12,500 years BP, groups of hunter-gatherers populated the rock shelters surrounding the retreating Lake Humboldt. The people of the area hunted the still extant Pleistocene species, and used their remains for the construction of primitive settlements, as bone tools and the skins as clothing. At this stage, the timber line was lower than today.Zonneveld, 1968, p.205 During the Holocene, the inhabitants of the Bogotá savanna gradually moved away from the rock shelters as permanent settlements in favour of more open area locations, as Checua and Aguazuque. Around 5000 years BP, agriculture became a more dominant phenomenon and the fertile clays mixed with volcanic ash of the Sabana Formation, combined with the bimodal pattern of seasonal precipitation made the Bogotá savanna an ideal area for growing crops. Pottery was used in the Herrera Period, from around 2800 years BP onwards, and the sediments of the Sabana Formation were used for various styles of ceramics, grouped by researchers based on the colour of the original clays. The northern settlement of Suesca was an important ceramic producing centre for the people. An advanced civilisation developed in the first and second millennia CE, leading to the Muisca Confederation, a loose collection of caciques. The southern Muisca area was centered around the Bogotá savanna with as main settlement Bacatá in the middle of the savanna, the namesake of the current capital of Colombia, Bogotá.Gómez Londoño, 2005, p.281 With the expansion in the late colonial and early republican era of the Colombian capital to the west and north of the city, the unconsolidated finer sediments of the Sabana Formation became more and more the foundation for construction, leading to problems due to the differential compaction of the sandy and more clay-rich strata. Por qué se hunde la Sabana de Bogotá - El Tiempo  Outcrops  The Sabana Formation is found at its type locality in the Funza II well, and covering most of the Bogotá savanna. The newer parts of Bogotá, especially the neighbourhoods north of the Avenida Chile (Calle 72) in Chapinero and west of the Autopista Norte (Avenida 30), rest upon the Sabana Formation, where the unconsolidated shales cause frequent fissures in the roads constructed in the Colombian capital. The southeastern part of Bogotá, including the historic centre, rests upon the more competent Tunjuelo Formation.

On December 3 that same year Carnegie granted a donation of $10,000 to be used to library construction on the terms the city pay an annual maintenance fee of $1,000 towards keeping the building in good condition. A lot on the corner of West Broad and Crawford streets was purchased by library trustees and designated at the site for the library. The blueprints for the building called for a mixture of different architectural designs based primarily off Colonial Revival. In addition to space for the library's collection an auditorium was included on the second floor to \\"provide for meetings of a social and literary character in connection with a library association.\\" The building was used at a library until it was sold in 1973 to be renovated into law offices.

Sarah Pugh (6 October 1800 – 1 August 1884) was an American abolitionist, activist, and teacher. Life Pugh was born in Alexandria, Virginia in 1800 to Jesse and Catherine (Jackson) Pugh. Her parents were Quakers, and her grandfather was an active abolitionist. When her father died when she was three, her family moved to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where Pugh's mother and aunt established a dressmaking business. Pugh attended Westtown Boarding School for two years, starting at age 12. In 1821, she began teaching at the Friends School of the 12th Street Meeting. She remained there until 1828, when the Quakers split into factions. Pugh resigned her position, ultimately adopting a Unitarian belief. With her friend, Rachel Peirce, she started her own school in 1829. Activism In 1855, Pugh became involved in the abolitionist movement after hearing a speech given by George Thompson. After the New American Anti-Slavery Society was founded in December 1833, some female members in attendance, including Lucretia Mott, sought to create a female organization for abolition. Thus, they created the Philadelphia Female Anti-Slavery Society three days later, on December 9, 1833. Mott and Pugh, along with 20 other women, were in attendance. They finalized their constitution on December 14, 1833. Pugh was involved in the organization as its presiding officer from 1833 until 1870. Pugh was also active in other anti-slavery organizations. She was a delegate to the first meeting of the American Women's Anti-slavery Convention and a member of the American Anti-slavery Society, which had been formed in Philadelphia in 1833. She also served as treasurer of the Pennsylvania Anti-Slavery Society from 1843 to 1860. In May 1838, Pugh attended the second Anti-Slavery Convention of American Women. The convention was held in Pennsylvania Hall, the newly built abolitionist headquarters in Philadelphia. On May 17, a mob of people who supported slavery burned down the building. The women who were inside, including Sarah Pugh, escaped the building in pairs—one black woman and one white woman, arm-in-arm. This baffled the onlookers, who were distracted by the show of solidarity long enough for all the women to escape the burning building. The next day, the mob returned and burned down the building. The abolitionist convention continued, however, at Sarah Pugh's school. In June 1840, Pugh was chosen as a delegate to attend the World Anti-Slavery Convention in London, along with Mott, Mary Grew, Elizabeth Neall, and Abby Kimber. The committee declined to recognize the American women as delegates, admitting them only as spectators, and Pugh authored a protest statement, on behalf of the delegates. In the 1850s, she traveled around with Lucretia Mott to attend women's rights conventions. In 1851, Pugh returned to England and spoke about the American abolitionist movement. After the Civil War, Pugh created schools for now-freed slaves and their children. She also became a suffragette. She became involved with the Moral Education Society, an organization that worked to decriminalize prostitution. In 1876, she signed the Declaration of Rights for Women, which was presented to the Centennial Exposition of 1876, the first World's Fair in the United States. She continued her activism until her death in 1884.

Its range includes China, Japan, and the Korean Peninsula. Taxonomy It was described as a new species in 1862 by English zoologist Edward Blyth. The holotype had been collected by Robert Swinhoe. Blyth placed it in the now-defunct genus Nyctinomus with a binomial of N. insignis. In 1873, George Edward Dobson published that he considered it a synonym of Nyctinomus cestonii, which itself was deemed a synonym of the European free-tailed bat (N. teniotis, now Tadarida teniotis) by Oldfield Thomas. Description It has a forearm length of . Biology and ecology It is known to roost in caves. It has long, narrow wings. Range and habitat It is known from several countries in Asia including China, North and South Korea, Taiwan, and Japan. Conservation As of 2019, it is evaluated as a data deficient species by the IUCN. It meets the criteria for this classification because it is a poorly-studied species; little is known about its biology, ecology, population size and trend, nor threats that it is facing. It is presumably threatened by the destruction of its roosts. Cave roosting habitat is lost due to cave tourism and stone quarrying.

It has been designated as a National Historic Site since 1977.Agency for Cultural Affairs - Cultural Heritage Online Overview The Kabayama site is located approximately seven kilometers south of the center of the modern city of Kitakami, on the Kitakami River near the foot of the Kitakami Mountains at an altitude of 80-10 meters. The site was discovered in 1945 and has been excavated numerous times. The site is located on two levels of a low hill. The lower tier consists of 32 circular arrangements of elongated river stones in a radial pattern, each with a diameter of 1.2 meters, some with a central dolmen. Dating from the middle Jōmon period, others may have been destroyed or relocated. As the soil underneath these stones is undisturbed, these are not burial markers, and the formations are too small to serve as a defensive perimeter. It is thought that these stones had a ceremonial meaning, similar to stone circles found at other Jōmon period sites, such as at the Ōyu Stone Circles discovered in Akita Prefecture. The upper level is located 20 meters higher, and consists of the remains of over 30 pit dwellings. Pottery shards and fragments of earthenware jar coffins were found in the upper level, and have been dated to 5000 years ago for the eastern side of the hill, and 4000 years ago on the western side, indicating a long period of settlement. Other artifacts included clay figurines, earrings, and earthenware with stamped decorations, and stone products such as stone axes, weights, and jewelry.

He served as the Keeper of Armour at the Royal Armouries for eighteen years, from 1978 to 1996. Also starting in 1978, and continuing until 1983, he served as the editor of the Journal of the Arms & Armour Society; he was appointed the society's president in 1995, and currently serves as a vice- president emeritus. He has written and translated several articles for journals, including the society's. As of 2019, Eaves works as a consultant on arms and armour, and has been commissioned to create several catalogues of large collections. In 2002 he published Catalogue of European Armour at the Fitzwilliam Museum, and in 2016 he coauthored the long-awaited Arms & Armour in the Collection of Her Majesty The Queen, a 528-page work which Eaves had been working on for more than a decade. He has also coauthored a volume of an illustrated miniature series, The Art of the Gun: European Firearms Masterpieces from the 17th to the 19th Centuries. Eaves's work as a consultant has also included duties for auction houses, including Sotheby's and Thomas Del Mar Limited. Eaves has also collected armour himself; one of his former pieces is now owned by the Metropolitan Museum of Art.  Career  Defense from a left arm, formerly in Eaves's collection and now owned by the Metropolitan Museum of Art Eaves was interested in arms and armour from a young age, writing his first school project on the subject at the age of ten. In 1978 the Royal Armouries, located in the Tower of London, appointed him Keeper of Armour; he held the position for eighteen years. While there he helped secure the long-term loan of the Barendyne helmet, which Eaves later termed \\"the greatest piece I have been instrumental in acquiring in my period at the Armouries\\". Also in 1978 Eaves was made honorary editor of the Journal of the Arms & Armour Society, serving in that role until 1983. Eaves has also collected pieces of armour himself; one piece, an Italian defense from a left arm, dating to around 1510–1520, is now in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. In 1981 Eaves was awarded the Frances E. Markoe Fellowship in Memory of Stephen A. Caldwell and Frances C. F. Caldwell by the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. The scholarship enabled him to research the museum's collection of European armour, specifically the use and development of the brigandine. Eaves's time at the museum coincided with the ninth triennial congress of the International Association of Museums of Arms and Military History, held across September and October. The congress included a medieval banquet planned and funded by Ronald S. Lauder, and held in the hall housing the museum's arms and armour collection. The New York Times covered the event. \\"Many of the guests last night cast covetous eyes at the museum's collection, which is among the best in the world\\", the Times wrote, quoting \\"a smiling Ian D.D. Eaves, curator of The Armories at Her Majesty's Tower of London\\" as saying There's a number of things I'd like to make off with if I could be sure I would be undetected. The article went on to note that Eaves would be continuing at the Metropolitan Museum for an additional two months, in order to undertake \\"a detailed examination\\" of some of the museum's British items. The following year, in 1982, Eaves became a consultant curator for the Higgins Armory Museum in Worcester, Massachusetts. Among other duties during this time, he lectured on the armours of King Henry VIII of England. In 1996 Eaves left the Royal Armouries and became a consultant on arms and armour, work he still does as of 2019. The work includes research, along with cataloging and editing, for museums and institutions across Europe and North America. Institutions Eaves has worked for include the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Art Institute of Chicago, the Fitzwilliam Museum of the University of Cambridge, and the Worshipful Company of Armourers and Brasiers in London. Eaves has also provided consulting services for auction houses. He worked at Sotheby's until 2005, when Thomas Del Mar, the head of the company's arms and armour business, left to form Thomas Del Mar Limited, and took Eaves and Franciska Ekman with him. The new company continued to work on a contractual basis with Sotheby's, \\"effectively allow[ing] Sotheby's to buy in the expertise for their sales programme as and when they require it,\\" as one trade publication put it, \\"while allowing the specialists to develop their own businesses and client services.\\"  Awards  In 1983 Eaves was awarded the Research Medal of the Arms & Armour Society, for services to the study of arms and armour. The following year, on 12 January 1984, he was elected a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London. Since 1995, Eaves has served as the honorary president of the Arms & Armour Society. As part of the 2017 New Year Honours, announced on 31 December 2016, Eaves was appointed a Member of the Royal Victorian Order, \\"[f]or services to the Royal Collection.\\"  Publications  Eaves has been commissioned to create catalogues for multiple large collections of arms and armour, including the Royal Collection and the Fitzwilliam collection. He has also published a number of scholarly articles and books, and is a coauthor of a volume from a five-volume miniature book series, The Art of the Gun. = Royal Collection = In 2000, Eaves was approached to continue the work of producing a comprehensive catalogue of armour held in the Royal Collection. The project was intended to fill a gap in scholarship and supersede the somewhat cursory efforts of Guy Laking that had been published in 1904. The Laking work had included only the works he considered to be highlights of the collection, despite his assertion that \\"each item ... can stand the most severe scrutiny\\", and at 283 pages it was just over half the length of Eaves's later catalogue. Efforts at a successor work to Laking's catalogue had begun in the 1980s as part of a wider cataloguing collaboration between Claude Blair, the keeper of metalwork at the Victoria and Albert Museum, who acted as general editor, and two senior figures at the Royal Armouries, A. V. B. Norman (armour, edged weapons) and Howard Blackmore (firearms). Although a draft was prepared in eight years, \\"an amazing achievement\\" in the words of Geoffrey de Bellaigue, Surveyor of the Queen's Works of Art from 1972 to 1996, the deaths of Norman in 1998 and Blackmore in 1999 threatened completion of the project. In 2000 Eaves, then Keeper of Armour at the Royal Armouries, was asked to take on the task, both updating and extending Norman's work and also adding completely new entries. Tobias Capwell, a curator at the Wallace Collection, said in his review of the resulting book - Arms & Armour in the Collection of Her Majesty The Queen (2016) - that = Fitzwilliam collection = Eaves's 2002 work Catalogue of European Armour at the Fitzwilliam Museum was the result of a private commission, through a grant by the museum. The work, approaching a collection largely comprising sixteenth-century German and North Italian field armour, categorised the pieces by whole armours, half armours, helmets, parts armour, and horse armour. Described as an \\"excellent\\" if rather expensive book with \\"[e]very rivet, hinge, plate, crack, pitting, internal washer, decoration, internal lining, lames, etc. ... carefully noted to provide an accurate assessment of the piece\\", it was nonetheless found to contain flaws when reviewed by David M. Oster. Eaves, according to Oster, was himself dissatisfied with some elements of the book's structure, which were imposed upon him by the Fitzwilliam Museum. Oster also noted that Eaves had no hand in the selection of illustrations or writing their associated captions, some of which contain errors. = The Art of the Gun = In 2003 Eaves coauthored the second volume of a five-volume miniature book series, The Art of the Gun. The heavily illustrated series displayed highlights of the collection of Robert M. Lee, a philanthropist and collector, whose interest in cars led to two best in shows at the Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance. The books covered guns from the Renaissance through the twenty-first century; the volume coauthored by Eaves, European Firearms Masterpieces from the 17th to the 19th Centuries, displayed highly decorated examples from the era. As described by the publisher, it served as a \\"celebrat[ion of] the art, craftsmanship, romance and performance of fine firearms, throughout the ages.\\" = Papers = Eaves has written a number of scholarly articles, many of which were published in the Journal of the Arms & Armour Society; Eaves also translated a work by the German scholar Ortwin Gamber for the journal. Eaves has also written for other journals, including on the tournament armours worn by King Henry VIII of England.

As with similar greenhoods, the flowering plants differ from those which are not flowering. The non-flowering plants have a rosette of leaves but the flowering plants have a single flower with leaves on the flowering spike. This greenhood usually flowers in summer and has a white flower with green stripes and a brownish tinge. It is similar to P. aestiva but has paler green flowers. Description Pterostylis decurva is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and when not flowering, a rosette of two to five leaves often held above the ground on a stalk up to 100 mm long. Each leaf is oblong to egg-shaped, 10–30 mm long and 10–20 mm wide. Flowering plants have a single flower 18–25 mm long and 7–9 mm wide borne on a spike 150–300 mm high with four or five stem leaves. The flowers are white with green stripes and a brown tinge in the galea. The dorsal sepal and petals are fused, forming a hood or \\"galea\\" over the column. The dorsal sepal curves forward, often downwards, with a thread- like tip 15–20 mm long. The lateral sepals are held closely against the galea, have an erect, thread-like tip 30–40 mm long and a broad, slightly protruding, U-shaped sinus between their bases. The labellum is 12–15 mm long, 2.5 mm wide, brown, blunt, and curved and protrudes above the sinus. Flowering occurs from October to March. Taxonomy and naming Pterostylis decurva was first formally described in 1923 by Richard Sanders Rogers and the description was published in Transactions and Proceedings of the Royal Society of South Australia. The specific epithet (decurva) is a Latin word meaning \\"curved or bent downwards\\". Distribution and habitat The summer greenhood grows on the higher parts of the ranges and tablelands of Victoria, New South Wales south from Werrikimbe National Park and Tasmania where it sometimes also grows at lower altitudes.

He was executed alongside Lumumba in Katanga in 1961.  Biography  Joseph Okito was born on 5 February 1910 in the village of Koyapongo, Lusambo Territory, Belgian Congo. He worked for the colonial administration for many years, serving as the chief of the Batetela sector of the Lusambo Territory. He was cited by the évolués of Luluabourg in a March 1944 memorandum as an example of a dedicated civil servant. He was later admitted into the Union des Interets Sociaux Congolais, an elite cultural society for évolués. Okito enjoyed an elevated social status due to his entrepreneurship and significant ownership of property. He was co-opted into the Kasai Provincial Council in 1957, serving until 1959. During the same time he regularly contributed to the monthly Communauté de Luluabourg in Otetela, Tshiluba, and French. The colonial administration selected him as one of two Congolese to be trained to take over the role of commissioner of the Sankuru district. Okito thought the training would assist him in a future political career. He was sent to Lusambo to shadow the district commissioner and was educated on the principles of administration for one hour each day. In 1959 he founded and became president of the Union rurale du Congo. The union later merged into the moderate Parti National du Progrès, but Okito was convinced by Patrice Lumumba to join the nationalist the Mouvement National Congolais (MNC). The following year he became president of the Sankuru chapter of the party. In March 1960 Okito participated in the Akutshu-Anamongo Congress of Lodja, serving as one of the conference's vice presidents. Later he was made a senator from Kasai Province of the independent Republic of the Congo. On 22 June 1960 he was elected First Vice-President of the Senate. In early September Prime Minister Lumumba was fired by President Joseph Kasa-Vubu. Lumumba challenged the action and a political impasse ensued. On 14 September Joseph-Désiré Mobutu launched a coup that removed Lumumba from power and adjourned Parliament. In late November Lumumba fled political hostility in the capital to organise a new government in Stanleyville. He was captured before he could complete his escape and imprisoned at the army camp in Thysville. Okito was preemptively arrested near Kikwit and was later transferred to the camp, along with Minister of Youth and Sports Maurice Mpolo. On 17 January 1961, discipline in the base faltered and all three men were flown to Élisabethville, capital of the secessionist State of Katanga. Once there, they were brutally tortured at the hands of Moïse Tshombe and Godefroid Munongo, Lumumba's chief political rivals and the leaders of the secessionist state. That night, one by one they were lined up against a tree to be executed via firing squad. Okito was the first to be shot. As he was led to the tree, he said, \\"I want my wife and children in Léopoldville to be taken care of,\\" to which someone replied, \\"We're in Katanga, not in Léo!\\" Following the execution his body was immediately placed in a nearby grave. On 17 January 2011, a mass of thanksgiving was held in memory of Mpolo and Okito at the Notre-Dame Cathedral in Kinshasa.

On June 27, 2017 the festival's official website and social media went dark signaling the festival had been cancelled. Compounded with the festival's reported financial struggles, an overarching factor in the closing of the festival was a result of the May 22nd terrorist attack of an Ariana Grande concert in London. Many consumers feared the possibility of a similar attack taking place at the venue in Penn's Cave, forcing ticket sales to plummet, and subsequently, contributing to the cancellation of the festival.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2006. A library for the community of Burwell was a goal of the Burwell Woman's Literary Club, which was organized with 11 charter members in 1907. Correspondence with Andrew Carnegie and/or the Carnegie Foundation began by 1911; a condition was set that Burwell must create a tax for maintenance of the library, and the Village Board passed such an ordinance in January 1912. The project was supported enthsiasticly by the Burwell Tribune. After delay from lost correspondence or miscommunication, the library plans were approved and a $5,000 grant for construction was authorized. The building is a one-story brick building with a raised basement, designed simply in accordance with preferences of James Bertram, Carnegie's secretary, who set design standards for the grant program after earlier projects seemed to waste funds on ornamentation. Decoration is achieved by use of cherry red brick being used for corbelling and pseudo-cornices and pseudo- pilasters, contrasting with yellow buff brick which is the main element. It is about in plan and has 22 windows. The building was built by contractor T.J. Pryor in 1914. With .

The company was founded in 1976 as Eastern Marine by Brian R. D’Isernia as a builder of fishing vessels, and began diversifying into constructing custom ships in the 1980s, beginning with the delivery of its first platform supply vessel (PSV) for the offshore oil and gas industry in 1981. In 1988, the company shut down, but was re-founded at the Panama City shipyard in 1997 as Eastern Shipbuilding Group, and purchased the former- Halter Marine shipyard facility in Allanton in 2000. As of 2009, Eastern employed about 900 people at its two shipyards, covering about 151 acres. Eastern primarily built tugboats and oil industry support vessels through the 2000s and into the 2010s, delivering 93 tugboats and 33 PSVs and similar vessels between 2006 and 2016. In 2012, it began leasing a site in Port St. Joe for post-launch outfitting. By 2016, the company had annual sales of about $300 million, with 1,700 employees and facilities that covered 326 acres. While its primary market remains offshore supply vessels, Eastern received two major orders for other ship types in the mid 2010s--the United States Coast Guard's Offshore Patrol Cutter in 2016, and the Staten Island Ferry's Ollis- class ferry in 2017.

It is free and open- source software released under the Modified BSD license. Although the Python interface is more polished and the primary focus of development, PyTorch also has a C++ interface. A number of pieces of Deep Learning software are built on top of PyTorch, including Tesla Autopilot, Uber's Pyro, HuggingFace's Transformers, PyTorch Lightning, and Catalyst. PyTorch provides two high-level features: * Tensor computing (like NumPy) with strong acceleration via graphics processing units (GPU) * Deep neural networks built on a tape-based automatic differentiation system History Facebook operates both PyTorch and Convolutional Architecture for Fast Feature Embedding (Caffe2), but models defined by the two frameworks were mutually incompatible. The Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX) project was created by Facebook and Microsoft in September 2017 for converting models between frameworks. Caffe2 was merged into PyTorch at the end of March 2018. PyTorch tensors PyTorch defines a class called Tensor (\`torch.Tensor\`) to store and operate on homogeneous multidimensional rectangular arrays of numbers. PyTorch Tensors are similar to NumPy Arrays, but can also be operated on a CUDA-capable Nvidia GPU. PyTorch supports various sub-types of Tensors. Modules =Autograd module= PyTorch uses a method called automatic differentiation. A recorder records what operations have performed, and then it replays it backward to compute the gradients. This method is especially powerful when building neural networks to save time on one epoch by calculating differentiation of the parameters at the forward pass. =\`Optim\` module= \`torch.optim\` is a module that implements various optimization algorithms used for building neural networks. Most of the commonly used methods are already supported, so there is no need to build them from scratch. =\`nn\` module= PyTorch autograd makes it easy to define computational graphs and take gradients, but raw autograd can be a bit too low-level for defining complex neural networks. This is where the \`nn\` module can help.

It has been protected by the central government as a National Historic Site since 1978. Overview The Hatten ruins are located on a tongue-shaped river terrace on the eastern fringe of the Kitakami Basin overlooking the Kitakami River. The site has been excavated on five occasions, with remnants from the Japanese Paleolithic era found in the southeastern corner of the site, and the foundations of four pit dwellings from the Heian period found in the central area, indicating continuous habitation for several thousand years. Most of the remains date from the middle to late Jōmon era. The village contained a central hall with a dimensions of approximately 17 meters in length and 8 meters in width, which had been reconstructed on at least eight occasions, indicating that it was a building for public or ceremonial use. On the slopes to the east and west sides of the village were middens containing a large number of earthenware fragments. Of especial note were fragments of clay ears, noses and mouths, with holes indicating that they were connected by strings. These are thought be part of grave masks as they were found in a stone-lined pit tomb on the site. These artifacts were given the status of Important Cultural Properties by the national government in 1992.

All of kofun are dome-shaped, with a diameter of 4.5 to 16 meters and an average height of 0.4 to 0.7 meters. Archaeological excavations were conducted in 1954 by Waseda University on a portion of the site, and identified the kofun as being from the late 7th through early 8th centuries. Further investigation was performed by Tōhoku University in 1965. The kofun contained stone burial chambers made from piled rounded river stones, the largest of which was 5 meters in length, with a central trench to hold the sarcophagus. In the Gojōmaru district, one tomb was found to contain four chambers. Grave goods included remnants of bladed instruments (swords, daggers, agricultural implements), jewelry (magatama beads, cylindrical beads, glass beads, etc.), horse fittings, and shards earthenware pottery.

The island received its name from Alexander Creighton, a businessman from Savannah, Georgia, who owned the island in 1778.  History  In 1756, Daniel Demetre had acquired the island that was then known as John Smith's Island. During the 1770s, William DeBrahm, a Surveyor General to King George III, noted the existence of entrenchments and ruins on the Island that could not be explained. The mysteries have lingered to this day. The island in its earliest days of Colonial America was used for timbering and farming such as cotton, sugar cane and corn. In the 1800s Thomas Spaulding worked with William Cooke, who owned the island around 1838. They built Tabby buildings on the northern part of the island, which remains to this day. There were timber- loading facilities for large ships at what was known as \\"Sapelo port\\" on the north-end from 1880–98, there was even a post office and telegraph lines that connected the island to Darien. When a hurricane hit in 1898 most of the facilities were destroyed, but were rebuilt by 1910, but at this time the timber boom era in McIntosh County can to an end. The current owners bought the island in 1947. Today visitors can reserve a visit to hike, hunt, or go fishing. There is even a small grass airstrip located on the southern part of the island for aircraft to land.

Tourism  Brisbane River Tourism centred around South East Queensland waterways generates $6 billion each year. About $2–3 billion is generated through recreation. The South East Queensland region is made up of 14 major river catchments and covers an area of around 23,000 km2. stretching from Noosa in the north to the Gold Coast in the south and west to the Great Dividing Range.  History  In 2005, The South East Queensland Council of Mayors created the SEQ Catchments Members Association to collaborate and involve the community in managing natural resources, resulting in the organisation then known as SEQ Catchments whose role was to secure funding from government and business for projects to improve grazing, reduce erosion, repair waterways, manage pests and weeds, restore degraded habitats and look after coastal areas. In 2008 the International Water Centre was the managing agent for Southeast Queensland Healthy Waterways working with the Healthy Waterways Board providing of IT, financial, legal, human resource and office support services and the sharing of knowledge and management tools with other river basin managers in the world. Healthy Land and Water developed the South East Queensland Natural Resource Management Plan 2009-2031. Healthy Waterways' income was halved in 2015, falling to $488,659. SEQ Catchments experienced an $835,142 loss over the same period. Healthy Waterways merged with SEQ Catchments in 2016 to form Healthy Land & Water. In 2016 the report found about 15,000 dump trucks' worth of sediment enters south-east Queensland's waterways every year, with sediment pollution the number one pressure on catchments.  Monitoring ecosystem health  The main product of the organisation is an annual report card which measures the health of individual catchments from year to year. The report measures how much mud and rubbish (sediment and pollution) is entering waterways. This has highlighted the need to reduce sediment runoff in South East Queensland's rural and urban areas. The Ecosystem Health Report Card is released in October each year. The report analyses data from 135 freshwater and 254 estuarine and marine sites across south-east Queensland. Grades ranging from 'A for excellent' to 'F for fail' are assigned to 19 catchments and 18 estuaries, as well as nine zones within Moreton Bay. Approaches taken by South-East Queensland stakeholders to ensure healthier waterways and increased investment in water infrastructure have involved researchers from across University of Queensland working together to guide Queensland’s water future through scientific discovery, technological innovation and policy development.  Awards  Annual Healthy Land and Water (Healthy Waterways) Awards recognise achievements of groups and individuals including schools, community groups, students, government, industry, researchers, planners and designers, whose work contributes to achieving the Healthy Land and Water vision. The Grand Prize, worth $10,000, is awarded to the most innovative winner of the other award categories.

He played college football for Georgia Southern. As a senior, he earned all-conference honors in the Sun Belt Conference. Koo became a starter for the Los Angeles Chargers as an undrafted free agent in 2017 before being released four weeks into the season. In 2019, he played for the Atlanta Legends of the Alliance of American Football (AAF) before joining the Falcons. Since signing with the Falcons, Koo has become known for his ability to successfully execute onside kicks. Early life Koo was born in Seoul, to Seungmae Choi and Hyunseo Koo. He played soccer growing up, and won a regional kicking competition. He attended sixth grade in the United States after moving to New Jersey to live with his mother, who had gone to the country two years earlier to become a nurse while Koo's father remained in Seoul as a university professor. Koo played on the football team for Ridgewood High School in Ridgewood, New Jersey. He was named team MVP his senior season, contributing on both special teams and defense, where he tallied six interceptions.Sulivan, Tara. \\"Sullivan: Former Ridgewood kicker Younghoe Koo pursuing NFL dream\\", The Record (Bergen County), May 11, 2017. Accessed May 12, 2017.  College career  Koo was a four-year contributor for the Georgia Southern Eagles, earning first-team all-conference honors in the Sun Belt in his final season, during which he converted 19 of 20 field goal attempts. Koo was also named a finalist for the Lou Groza Award, given annually to the best college kicker in the nation. At the conclusion of his college career, Koo ultimately converted 88.6% of his field goal attempts, a Georgia Southern team record. Professional career =Los Angeles Chargers= Koo signed with the Los Angeles Chargers as an undrafted free agent following the 2017 NFL Draft. He won the starting job over incumbent kicker Josh Lambo following the conclusion of the preseason. Koo became the fourth player in NFL history to be born in South Korea. In the 2017 season opener on the road against the Denver Broncos, Koo's game-tying 44-yard field goal attempt in the final seconds of the game was blocked by the Broncos' Shelby Harris, and the Chargers lost 24–21. The kick had little chance of succeeding after Denver overwhelmed the Chargers' line on the play. An earlier attempt by Koo was successful, but it was called off after the Broncos had called a timeout right before the snap. The following week, Koo missed a game- winning 44-yard attempt in a 19–17 loss to the Miami Dolphins. The following two weeks, Koo converted both of his field goal attempts and all four of his extra points. However, the 0–4 Chargers waived him after Week 4, replacing him with 10-year veteran Nick Novak. Chargers head coach Anthony Lynn stated that he wanted \\"someone with a little more consistency and experience\\" than Koo. Lynn added that \\"I think Koo is going to have a long NFL career ... A lot of rookies get cut early in their career, and they come back and play for a lot of years.\\" \\"Koo's a very talented kicker,\\" Novak said. \\"He's got a live leg and a lot of talent.\\" Overall with the Chargers, Koo was 3-of-6 on field goals and recorded 8 touchbacks on 14 kickoffs. Frank Schwab of Yahoo Sports wrote that the winless Chargers were \\"using [Koo] as a scapegoat.\\" =Atlanta Legends= On January 14, 2019, Koo signed with the Atlanta Legends of the AAF. On February 9, he scored the first points in AAF regular season history, making a 38-yard field goal against the Orlando Apollos. After the Legends started the 2019 AAF season 0–3, on March 3, Koo kicked two field goals, including the 33-yard game winner against the Arizona Hotshots to seal the 14–11 Atlanta win. The following week against the Memphis Express, he made all three of his attempts, including the game-winning 35-yard field goal with nine seconds remaining to secure a 23–20 victory, and was eventually named AAF Special Teams Player of the Week. The league ceased operations during midseason in April 2019. For the year, Koo had been a perfect 14-of-14 on his field goals. =New England Patriots= Following the suspension of the AAF, Koo worked out with the Chicago Bears, who were in need of a kicker after releasing Cody Parkey, but did not end up signing with the team. After longtime kicker Stephen Gostkowski was placed on injured reserve, the New England Patriots signed Koo to their practice squad on October 4, 2019. On October 15, 2019, Koo was released. =Atlanta Falcons= On October 29, 2019, Koo was signed by the Atlanta Falcons after they cut their longtime kicker and franchise leading scorer, Matt Bryant. In his Falcons debut, Koo made all four of his field goals (including a 48-yarder) and both of his extra points in a 26–9 upset win over the New Orleans Saints. He was named the NFC Special Teams Player of the Week for his performance. In Week 13 against the New Orleans Saints on Thanksgiving Day, Koo delivered three successful onside kicks, one of which was undone by a penalty, in the 26–18 loss. In Week 14 against the Carolina Panthers, Koo made four field goals (including a career-long 50-yarder), four extra points, and recovered a fumble forced by teammate Damontae Kazee on wide receiver Greg Dortch during a kickoff return in the 40–20 win. For this performance, he was named the NFC Special Teams Player of the Week for the second time. On February 18, 2020, Koo signed a one-year contract extension with the Falcons.

It is connected to the Åland Mainland by the Bomarsund Bridge crossing the narrow Bomarsund Strait. Prästö is located next to the ruins of the Bomarsund Fortress, the place of the 1856 Crimean War Battle of Bomarsund. The island is known of its rich military history, especially of the six Russian military cemeteries established in the 19th Century. Because of the graveyards, Prästö was once known as the ″Island of the Dead″. The island hosts a campsite and two museums showing the history of Prästö and the Bomarsund Fortress.  History  = Cemeteries = As the Bomarsund Fortress was operating, all the deceased military and civil personnel, as well as the prisoners of war, were buried on Prästö island. The first Greek-Catholic graveyard was opened in the 1810s, as the Russian military had settled Bomarsund. It was used until 1846 and then replaced by a new cemetery which had separate sections for the Greek-Catholics, Lutherians and Roman-Catholics. As the Russian military incorporated several ethnic groups and religions, Jewish and Muslim cemeteries were established on the other side of the island. The Russians also used Turkish prisoners of war for forced labor. All but the Lutherian graveyard were closed when the Bomarsund Fortress was demolished after the Crimean War in 1856. The graves were usually marked with simple wooden signs which today are mostly decomposed, but some 50 gravestones still exist. Most of them are for Catholics; the six gravestones remain in the Jewish cemetery, but the Muslim cemetery has none. = Prästötornet = The Prastötornet Tower was a roundel built to the northernmost tip of the Cape Barsnöudden as a part of the fortifications of the Bomarsund Fortress. The tower was 12 meters high and 42 meters in width. During the Battle of Bomarsund it was occupied by 140 men, under the command of the French-born lieutenant Chatelain who served in the Russian Imperial Army. On 16 August 1856, the Prastötornet surrendered to the British and French troops and was demolished with 6 tons of powder. = Military hospital = As the Åland Islands became a part of the Russian Empire in 1809, the islands were soon occupied by Russian military. A military hospital was established in Prästö in the early 1810s. As the construction of the Bomarsund Fortress started in 1829, the hospital was soon surrounded by several other buildings, forming a small village. The hospital operated until the fall of the Bomarsund Fortress in 1854, and was then burned down together with the nearby houses. = Telegraph station = In 1906, a unit of 750 Russian soldiers was sent to Prästö, although the Åland Islands had been demilitarized since the 1856 Treaty of Paris. The islands were used for smuggling weapons and illegal publications to the Socialist revolutionaries in Russia. The smuggling route ran from Stockholm to Åland and then via Southern Finland to Saint Petersburg. In order to chase the smugglers, the Russians built a telegraph line from Åland to the Finnish mainland. One of the telegraph stations was built in Prästö. During the 1918 Finnish Civil War Invasion of Åland, the Prästö telegraph station was occupied by Whites who had landed the island from Finland. Today the 1913 built telegraph station works as museum which is open during the tourist season.

Iran experienced a short Third World Socialism period at the zenith of the Tudeh Party after the abdication of Reza Shah and his replacement by his son, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi (though the party never rose to power). After failing to reach power, this form of third world socialism was replaced by Mosaddegh's populist, non-aligned Iranian nationalism of the National Front party as the main anti-monarchy force in Iran, reaching power (1949–1953), and it remained with that strength even in opposition (after the overthrowning of Mossadegh) until the rise of Islamism and the Iranian Revolution. The Tudehs have moved towards basic socialist communism since then. Iranian Socialist organizations during 1900–1979 = Social Democratic Party = In 1904 or 1905, the Social Democratic Party was formed by Persian emigrants in Transcaucasia with the help of local revolutionaries, maintaining close ties to the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party and Hemmat Party. It was the first Iranian socialist organization. The party created its own mélange of European socialism and indigenous ideas and upheld liberalism and nationalism. It maintained some religious beliefs while being critical of the conservative ulama and embracing separation of church and state. It was founded by Haydar Khan Amo-oghli and led by Nariman Narimanov. = Unified Socialist Party and Social Reformers Party = During the constitutional period, the Unified Socialist and Social Reformers Party were both socialist political parties in Persia. The Social Reformers Party was considered to follow a moderate line in comparison to the Democrat Party and the Social Democratic Party's economic platform, but opposed the landlords likewise. = Union and Progress Party = = Democrat Party = Founded in 1909 in Qajari Persia during the constitutional period, the Democrat Party was one of two major parliamentary parties at the time alongside its rival, the Moderate Socialists Party. The party had a social democrat ideology, initially was an offshoot of the Transcaucasia-based Social Democratic Party. It severed direct ties with Baku and dropped \\"Socialist\\" from the name in deference to the conservative public. Its ideology, however, remained heavily borrowed from the old party. It was largely composed of middle-class intellectuals and stood for the separation of church and state. In 1918, the party had split definitively into the Pro-Reorganization Democrats led by Bahar; and the Anti- Reorganization Democrats. Notable member were Hassan Taqizadeh and Haydar Khan Amo-oghli. = Socialist Revolutionary Party = Founded in the 1900s, the Socialist Revolutionary Party, also known as Social-Revolutionaries, was a Persian revolutionary socialist party based in Baku, Caucasus Viceroyalty. It was one of the most important parties established by the Persian emigrants in Transcaucasia during Qajar dynasty. The party published an Azerbaijani language newspaper twice a week, named Ekinçi ve Fe'le and edited by Hosayn Israfilbekov. = Communist Party of Persia = Originally established as the Justice Party in 1917, the Communist Party of Iran was an Iranian communist party founded by former Social Democratic Party's members who supported Baku- based Bolsheviks, the party participated in Third International in 1919 and was renamed to the Communist Party of Iran in 1920. = Socialist Party = During the 1920s, the Socialist Party was a leading left-wing political party that was close to the Tudeh Party of Iran and it joined the Tudeh-led United Front of Progressive Parties in 1946, effectively absorbed by the larger group.Abrahamian, Iran, p. 301 The roots of the Socialist Party lay in the Democrat Party, a reformist group active in the first two decades of the twentieth century. Following the disintegration of this movement those members who retained faith in the masses and hoped to mobilise the lower and middle classes grouped together under the Socialist Party banner in 1921.Ervand Abrahamian, Iran: Between Two Revolutions, Princeton University Press, 1982, p. 126 The party was led by Sulayman Eskandari, Muhammad Musavat and Qasim Khan Sur as well as Muhammad Sadiq Tabatabai, a member of a leading clerical family recruited largely to hold off the inevitable attacks from conservative clerics.Abrahamian, Iran, p. 127 Their main newspaper, Toufan (Storm), was edited by the outspoken and controversial poet Mohammad Farrokhi Yazdi. Branches were set up in Rasht, Qazvin, Bandar Anzali, Tabriz, Mashhad, Kerman and Kermanshah although Tehran was the main base of operations and it was in the capital that the party founded four newspapers and established affiliated groups such as the Union of Employees in the Ministry of Post and Telegraph, a Tenants Association and Patriotic Women's Society. The latter group campaigned for a wider role for women in Iranian society, promoting such initiatives as education for girls and wider provisions for women's health. It had been established in 1922 by Mohtaram Eskandari and quickly affiliated to her husband's party.Parvin Paidar, Women and The Political Process in Twentieth- Century Iran, Cambridge University Press, 1997, pp. 95-96 The party's programme called for the eventual establishment of equality in society, nationalisation of the means of production, irrigation schemes, a new level of regional government, a free and equal judiciary, the rights of free speech, free assembly and trade union rights, free elections, wider access to education, improved working conditions including an end to child labour and government intervention against unemployment.Abrahamian, Iran, p. 128 The party gained some support, attracting 2500 members in Tehran alone soon after its formation. Along with the Reformist Party, the Revival Party and the Communist Party the Socialist Party was one of the four groups courted by Rezā Shāh as he made his play for the throne of Persia.Abrahamian, Iran, p. 120 Along with the Revival Party it formed a working majority in the Iranian parliament that allowed Reza Khan, as he was still known, he form his own reformist government.Abrahamian, Iran, p. 132 Khan soon broke from the Socialists and threw in his lot with more conservative elements when he decided to abandon plans for a republic and instead establish himself as king. 134 The part was one of the few in parliament not to actively support Reza's rise to the throne, arguing that despite their support for many of his reforms their republican principles prevented them from endorsing him as a monarch.Abrahamian, Iran, p. 135 Following Rezā Shāh's ascension to the throne the Socialist Party disappeared as part of a wider crackdown on anti- monarchist dissent. Iskandari was forced to retire from public life and mobs were organised to harass the party and attack their properties. A Socialist Theatre in Enzeli was razed to the ground by a police-led mob on the pretext that during a performance of Tartuffe a female actor had been on stage whilst in Tehran the Patriotic Women's Society was stoned and their library burnt down.Abrahamian, Iran, p. 139 A minor group of the same name emerged in 1944 when radical members of the Comrades Party broke from that group over its failure to support striking workers in Isfahan.Abrahamian, Iran, pp. 207-208 = Young Communist League of Persia = Founded in the midst of the Gilan Revolution, the Young Communist League of Persia was a communist youth organization in Persia set up following the July 31, 1920 split between the communist and non-communist Jangali elements. The YCL of Persia conducted agitation and propaganda activities and organized armed actions against the followers of Kuchik Khan. The organization was crushed after the defeat of the Gilan soviet. In 1927 different communist youth groups merged, recreating the YCL of Persia. It was a section of the Young Communist International. In the fall of 1928, the organization was suppressed along with other left groups. = Revolutionary Republican Party of Iran = Founded in late 1924 by Iranian diaspora in Germany, the Revolutionary Republican Party of Iran was a moderate leftwing political party in Persia with socialist reformist tendencies that published its platform in 1926. = Jungle Party = Active in northern Iran during the 1940s, the Jungle Party was a secessionist, nationalist and socialist party founded by armed rebels who tried to revive the Persian Socialist Soviet Republic created in 1921 and used its red flag as a symbol. and some of Mirza Kuchik Khan's old associates It allied with the Iran Party, Tudeh Party of Iran, Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan and Azerbaijani Democratic Party in 1946. = Iran Party = Established in 1941, the Iran Party is described as the \\"backbone of the National Front\\", the leading umbrella organization of Iranian nationalists. Founded by mostly of European- educated technocrats, it advocated \\"a diluted form of French socialism\\" (i.e. it \\"modeled itself on\\" the moderate Socialist Party of France) and promoted social democracy, liberal nationalism and secularism. The socialist tent of the party was more akin to that of the Fabian Society than to the scientific socialism of Karl Marx. Its focus on liberal socialist and democratic socialist principles, made it quite different from pure left-wing parties and it did not show much involvement in labour rights discussions. The Iran Party's basic nucleus were members of the Iranian Engineers’ Association. In the Iranian legislative election of 1944, five of the party's leaders including Rezazadeh Shafaq, Ghulam'Ali Farivar, AhdulHamid Zanganeh, Hussein Mu'aven, and Abdallah Mu'azemi won seats, as well as Mohammad Mossadegh who was not a member but the party effectively supported. The party helped Mossadegh establish the National Front, nationalize the oil industry and rise to power. Some members held office during Mosaddegh government. In the 1950s, the party was led by Karim Sanjabi and Allah-Yar Saleh. It was suppressed following the British–American backed coup d'état in 1953 and was outlawed in 1957, on the grounds that it had an alliance with the Tudeh Party of Iran ten years earlier. It was revived in 1960 and actively contributed to the National Front (II), which was disintegrated in 1963 and forced to survive secretly. Iran Party held a congress in 1964. Not much is known about the activities of the party between 1964 and the mid-1970s except of some irregular meetings and exchanging views. In 1977, alongside League of Socialists and Nation Party it revived the National Front (IV) and demanded Ruhollah Khomeini's return to Iran. In early 1979, then secretary-general of the party, Shapour Bakhtiar was appointed as the last Prime Minister by the Shah and included two Iran Party members in his cabinet. The party however denounced his acceptance of the post, expelled him and called him a \\"traitor\\". The party did not play an important role in Iranian political arena after 1979 and was soon declared banned. = Comrades Party = During the 1940s, the Comrades Party was part of a wave of political groupings established in the early 1940s following the removal of Rezā Shāh.E. Burke Inlow, Shahansha, Motilal Banarsidass Publ., 1979, p. 214 The party was formed in November 1942 by Mustafa Fateh, a British-educated economist who was close to the Tudeh Party of Iran but who disliked the close relationship which that party had with the Soviet Union.Ervand Abrahamian, Iran: Between Two Revolutions, Princeton University Press, 1982, p. 188 Fateh, who had been an important figure in the Anglo- Iranian Oil Company edited the Tudeh paper Mardom for a time before establishing his own journal, Emruz va Farda. Abbas Narraqi, another founding member had been one of 53 men imprisoned in 1937 on charges of conspiring to lead a communist revolution. The Comrades Party called for two main aims i.e. political equality to all Iranians and nationalisation of the means of production. It put forward ten candidates in the 1944 election, all of whom came from professional backgrounds. Two members of the Comrades Party were elected to the Majlis of Iran where they sat with the Individuals' Caucus, a group they made up along with the Iran Party and various independents, all of whom largely followed the lead of Mohammad Mosaddegh.Abrahamian, p. 202 The party split in 1944, following a dispute in Isfahan where clashes between striking workers and local tribes loyal to the Shah had broken out amid accusations that the workers were attempting to lead a communist revolution.Abrahamian, p. 207 The Majlis-based wing of the Comrades Party condemned the workers and affirmed their loyalty to the Shah but another external group joined Tudeh in supporting the strikers and this group, which maintained control of Emruz va Farda, broke away to form the Socialist Party.Abrahamian, pp. 207-208 = Movement of God-Worshipping Socialists = Founded in 1943, Movement of God-Worshipping Socialists was one of six original member organizations of the National Front. The party was led by Muhammed Nakhshab. The organization was founded through the merger of two groupings, Nakhshab's circle of high school students at Dar al-Fanoun and Jalaleddin Ashtiyani's circle of about 25 students at the Faculty of Engineering at Tehran University. The organization was initially known as League of Patriotic Muslims. It combined religious sentiments, nationalism and socialist thoughts.Rāhnamā, ʻAlī. An Islamic Utopian: A Political Biography of Ali Shari'ati. London: I.B. Tauris, 1998. p. 25 Nakhshab is credited with the first synthesis between Shi'ism and European socialism.Abrahamian, Ervand. Iran between Two Revolutions. Princeton studies on the Near East. Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1982. p. 463 Nakhshab's movement was based on the tenet that Islam and socialism were not incompatible, since both sought to accomplish social equality and justice. His theories had been expressed in his B.A. thesis on the laws of ethics.Rāhnamā, ʻAlī. An Islamic Utopian: A Political Biography of Ali Shari'ati. London: I.B. Tauris, 1998. p. 26 = Azerbaijani Democratic Party = = United Front of Progressive Parties = From 1946 to 1948, the United Front of Progressive Parties was a political alliance of left-wing parties in Iran originally founded by the communist Tudeh Party and the socialist Iran Party, they invited other parties to join them in their alleged struggle for \\"social progress and national independence\\". One of the main planks of the united front was to recognize Central Council of United Trade Unions as the sole legitimate organization of the working-class in Iran. = Iran Unity Party = The Iran Unity Party was a socialist political party that split the Iran Party following its alliance with the communist Tudeh Party of Iran in 1946. According to Leonard Binder, the party was in a coalition with the National Union Party and Socialist Party in the 14th parliament. = Toilers Party of the Iranian Nation = Founded on 16 May 1951 by Mozzafar Baghai, the Toilers Party of the Iranian Nation was a social-democratic political party, initially a member of the National Front, that pledged support for the nationalization of the Iran oil industry and opposed Tudeh Party. They successfully attracted a considerable amount of educated youth (especially in the University of Tehran), Third Force activists and shopkeepers from Kerman in bazzar. Yet the party also included a nucleus of čāqukeš and čumāqdār. In the 1952 legislative election, the party won two seats by Baghai and Zohari. The party split in 1952 over its relationship with Government of Mosaddegh. Under leadership of Mozzafar Baghai, Toilers left National Front and openly opposed the government while Khalil Maleki reestablished Third Force under the name of Toilers Party of the Iranian Nation — Third Force and continued to support the government. Toilers formed an alliance with Society of Mujahed Muslims, led by Ayatollah Kashani, pooling their resources and coordinating their activities against government. They actively participated in the 1953 coup d'état and called it a \\"national uprising\\", however opposed Fazlollah Zahedi's post-coup military government. Following their opposition, their newspapers was banned and their party office was confiscated by the government and the party went on a hiatus until Iranian legislative election, 1960. They resumed activity in 1961 and expressed support for Ayatollah Khomeini in 5 June 1963 demonstrations. In 1971, the party was reorganized with the permission of the government, but was forced to cease its activities in 1975 after announcement of the one-party state under Resurgence Party. In 1977, Baghai made an attempt to revive the party after declaring loyalty to the Pahlavi dynasty, albeit at restricted level. It was soon after dissolved after the revolution of 1979. = League of Iranian Socialists = In 1960, the League of Socialists of the National Movement of Iran or Society of Iranian Socialists was founded by Third Force activists led by Khalil Maleki and a number of radical nationalists, most of whom had social democratic leanings and some members with Islamic socialist tendencies. Hossein Malek, Ahmad Sayyed Javadi and Jalal Al-e-Ahmad were among people associated with the group. The party of socialist and nationalist ideology, formally joined the Socialist International upon establishment. The organization was a founding member of the National Front (II) and was considered the \\"extreme left-wing\\" within the front. It broke with the front and joined the National Democratic Front after the Iranian Revolution.

They also believed in Materialism. They rejected reformism, and were inspired by thoughts of Mao Zedong, Che Guevara, and Régis Debray. Bijan Jazani, known as the \\"intellectual father\\" of the organization, contributed to its ideology by writing a series of pamphlets such as Struggle against the Shah's Dictatorship, What a Revolutionary Must Know and How the Armed Struggle Will Be Transformed into a Mass Struggle?. The pamphlets were followed by Masoud Ahmadzadeh's treatise Armed Struggle: Both a Strategy and a Tactic and The Necessity of Armed Struggle and the Rejection of the Theory of Survival by Amir Parviz Pouyan. They criticized the National Front and the Liberation Movement as \\"Petite bourgeoisie paper organizations still preaching the false hope of peaceful change\\".

It is a municipal cemetery that is owned and operated by the Des Moines Parks and Recreation Department. It covers at the corner of 20th Street and Woodland Ave and is the site of over 80,000 graves. History The cemetery was created in 1848 when five local farmers donated of land to create it. It was originally called Fort Des Moines Cemetery. The first burial took place in 1850. The city took ownership of the cemetery in 1857, and purchased an additional 36.5 acres in 1864. It has since been expanded to and now houses over 80,000 graves. The City Receiving Vault, which was used to store bodies when the ground was too frozen for graves to be dug, was built in the 1880s. alt=Brick and stone arched door with iron gate, sign above says CITY RECEIVING VAULT. Within the grounds are subsections. These include St. Ambrose Cemetery (relocated from elsewhere in Des Moines in 1866), the Emmanuel Jewish Cemetery founded in 1871, and an Independent Order of Odd Fellows Cemetery. In 1986, the city council of Des Moines designated the cemetery a local historic landmark. Various restoration projects have been undertaken in recent years. A new arch over the entrance was constructed in 2012. An effort to restore the mausoleum of Samuel Merrill, the seventh governor of Iowa was started. A project to add markers to hundreds of previously unmarked children's graves on \\"Baby Hill\\" from the earliest days of the cemetery concluded successfully in April 2017.

Together with Gregorio Silvestre and other disciples of Cristóbal de Castillejo, he stood against the Italianating tendencies of the poetry of his time. He wrote works in prose and verse, gathered in a compilation titled Inventario (Inventory, 1565), which includes the story Historia del Abencerraje y la hermosa Jarifa, written in 1551 and considered the first Moorish novel. It tells how a Muslim, prisoner to a Christian named Rodrigo de Narváez, recovers his freedom by keeping his word and returning to prison after being released to marry his beloved Jarifa. However, modern critics deny Villegas the authorship of this novel. The work's brevity and success caused it to be included, from 1561 onwards, after the fourth book of Jorge de Montemor's Diana. Lope de Vega wrote his comedy El remedio en la desdicha on this theme; Juan de Timoneda, Sebastián de Covarrubias and Miguel de Cervantes praised the Inventario. It also includes Ausencia y soledad de amor, a pastoral novel in prose and verse, and several poems (canciones, coplas, Historia de Píramo, Contienda de Áyax).

In another case, several geese protecting their goslings knocked an Englishman off his bicycle resulting in hospitalization. One Buffalo, New York resident claimed over $2 million in damages for a goose attack while on a neighbor's property. At times, park rangers have killed entire flocks of aggressive geese. Canada geese in Cincinnati parks have been responsible for knocking people down and breaking their bones, and called \\"spitting, hissing, biting attack missiles\\". The same aggressive, territorial behavior can be utilized in the guard capacity. Geese are intelligent enough to discern unusual people or sounds from usual stimuli. Their loud honking will alert humans when the geese are alarmed. History of use The geese of the Capitol by Henri-Paul Motte, 1889 Guard geese have been used throughout history, and in modern times. In ancient Rome, geese are credited by the historian Livy for giving the alarm when Gauls invaded (see Battle of the Allia).

The facility has several massive Tesla Coils on the facility grounds, some of which range over 20 stories in height. Combined these create what the Soviets nicknamed a \\"lightning machine.\\" In all the facility contains a 3 Megawatt capacity transformer cascade, a 9 Megawatt Pulsed Voltage Generator (PVG), measuring 39.3 meters high, capable of creating 150-meter artificial lightning and a 2.25 Megawatt constant voltage unit.  History  Originally built sometime in the 1970s the facility was at first used for a mix of military and scientific testing being maintained by the Moscow Power Engineering Institute. At one point the facility housed a massive ovular dome named Allure. The building was used as an electromagnetic pulse (EMP) weapons testing facility and stationary simulator before it was demolished in January 1985 after the buildings roof collapsed due to the weight of excessive snowfall. This resulted in the construction supervisor on the dome project being terminated from his job and replaced with Communist Party member Boris Yeltsin, who later would serve as the first President of the Russian Federation.

It has a rosette of leaves at its base and up to six flowers on long stalks, branching off a short flowering stem. The flowers have an insect-like labellum and often touch the ground. Description Pterostylis despectans, is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber. It has a rosette of between six and ten leaves at the base of the flowering spike, each leaf long and wide. The leaves are often withered by the time of flowering. Up to six translucent flowers with green and brown markings and long, wide are borne on a flowering spike tall. Each flower is carried on the end of a long, thin stalk. Three or four papery bracts are wrapped around the flowering spike. The dorsal sepal and petals are joined to form a hood called the \\"galea\\" over the column with the dorsal sepal having a thread-like tip long. The lateral sepals are slightly wider than the galea and often touch the ground. They are shallowly dished, densely hairy on their outer edges and suddenly taper to a thread-like tip, . The labellum is brown to green, thin and insect-like, about long and wide. The \\"head\\" end has two long bristles and there are up to 10 to 16 shorter bristles on the side. Flowering occurs from November to December. Taxonomy and naming The lowly greenhood was first formally described in 1950 by William Nicholls who gave it the name Pterostylis rufa var. despectans and published the description in The Victorian Naturalist. The type specimen was collected near Maryborough in Victoria. In 1989, Mark Clements and David Jones raised it to species status. Distribution and habitat Pterostylis despectans has a restricted distribution in each of the three Australian states in which it occurs. In New South Wales there is only a single population growing in grassland near Moama in the Riverina district. In Victoria it grows in forest near Maryborough, grassland near Bendigo and woodland near Horsham and in South Australia in parts of the Northern Lofty flora region. Conservation Pterostylis despectans is classified as \\"endangered\\" under the Victorian Government Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act 1988, \\"critically endangered\\" in New South Wales, \\"endangered\\" in South Australia and as \\"endangered\\" (EN) under the Australian Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act). The main threats to this species are habitat loss and fragmentation, invasive species and low reproduction rates.

Education and career Kivelson received his Ph.D. from Harvard University in 1979, working with C. Daniel Gelatt, Jr. He spent three years as a postdoctoral researcher at the Institute for Theoretical Physics at the University of California, Santa Barbara, before joining the faculty of the State University of New York at Stony Brook, where he was an Assistant (1982–86), Associate (1986–88) and Full Professor (1988–89). In 1988, he moved to the University of California, Los Angeles. In 2004, Kivelson joined the faculty at Stanford University, where he was appointed Prabhu Goel Family Professor of Physics in 2012.  Awards and honors He was awarded the Guggenheim fellowship in 1995 and was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2001, and to the National Academy of Sciences in 2010. In 2012, he was awarded the Bardeen prize (with Chandra Varma and James Sauls) instituted by the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign.  Research  Kivelson is one of the leading figures in condensed matter physics and has made important contributions to many areas in quantum condensed matter physics. He is most famous for his widespread works in the field of strongly correlated systems and superconductivity, particularly high-temperature superconductivity, in which, among other things, he is known for proposing early microscopic mechanisms of cuprate high-Tc superconductivity and phase separation effects (with Victor Emery), and for introducing the paradigm of electronic liquid crystalline phases in these and other strongly correlated systems such as the quantum Hall systems (with Eduardo Fradkin and Victor Emery), and more recently for emphasizing the notion and significance of \\"intertwined orders\\" (with Eduardo Fradkin and John Tranquada) in these and other strongly correlated systems. He is also famous for early important works in quantum dimer models and resonating valence bond theory (with Daniel Rokhsar and others), for the first (bosonic) Chern-Simons field theory description of fractional quantum Hall effect and quantum Hall dualities (with Shoucheng Zhang, Hans Hansson, Dung- Hai Lee and others), and other important problems in fractional quantum Hall physics (with Jainendra K. Jain, Shivaji Sondhi and others). He has also made important contributions to the physics of polymers (with John Schrieffer, Alan J. Heeger and others), fullerenes (with Sudip Chakravarty and others), glasses and supercooled liquids (with Daniel Kivelson, Sudip Chakravarty, Zohar Nussinov and others), and, more recently, to in iron-based high-temperature superconductivity and problems involving nematicity, charge orders and superconductivity in general.

During the 1998 term, Dauber clerked for Judge Stephen Reinhardt, a progressive icon on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit. In 2001, she was hired by Stanford Law School. Dauber finished her dissertation, which would become an acclaimed book on the history of U.S. government disaster relief \\"The Sympathetic State: Disaster Relief and the Origins of the American Welfare State.\\" In 2007, she got tenure. She is an activist against campus sexual assault. In 2011, she became co-chair of Stanford’s Board on Judicial Affairs. Dauber’s committee worked with the provost’s office in its years-long revision of the rules. The new process included lowering the burden of proof to a “preponderance of evidence” and providing for an investigator who reported back to a trained five-person panel. The accuser and accused never had to be in the room together. In April 2017, Stanford administrators discouraged her from using a picture of President Donald Trump to illustrate the fliers for a presentation on sexual assault. Dauber led the petition drive to recall Judge Aaron Persky, the Santa Clara County judge who rendered the verdict in People v. Turner. Dauber, who is a personal friend of Chanel Miller's family, was also involved in disseminating Miller's victim impact speech. In an interview with Amy Goodman of \\"Democracy Now\\", Dauber said that she had seen the speech before it was made public and sent it out to media outlets with the help of one of the makers of \\"The Hunting Ground\\", a documentary about sexual assault on campus. In the same interview, Professor Dauber said that Miller had been \\"gravely injured\\" by Brock Turner, and gave that as one of the main reasons for the recall. On Valentine's Day in 2018, Dauber received \\"an envelope containing white powder and a threatening note\\" with a reference to the Persky case, along with a rape threat. A man was subsequently arrested and charged for this and other crimes, including sending a \\"glitter bomb\\" to Dauber. Persky was recalled by county voters on June 5, 2018, with 61.6% voting to recall him.Northern California Judge Aaron Persky recalled from office for sexual assault sentence critics called too lenient., The Associated Press, June 6, 2018.

Previously he was on the faculty at the University of Pittsburgh, where he held a number of roles: Arthur J. Rooney Sr. Professor of Sports Medicine and the Executive Vice Chair of the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, and a professor in the Department of Bioengineering. He was the director of the Center for Military Medicine Research and an associate director of the McGowan Institute for Regenerative Medicine. Despite his position in Hong Kong, he continues to serve as the Director of the University of Pittsburgh's Center for Cellular and Molecular Engineering. For the 2018 fiscal year, he was one of the top 25 highest paid University of Pittsburgh employees. Tuan's research efforts focus on bioengineering applied to the musculoskeletal system. Education Born in Hong Kong to Republic of China Army veterans, Tuan completed primary and secondary education at St. Joseph's Anglo-Chinese School, and then attended briefly the Queen's College without sitting the matriculation examination. He received his bachelor's degree from Berea College in Kentucky in 1972. He received his Ph.D. from Rockefeller University in New York City in 1977, supervised by Zanvil Cohn. He then began a postdoctoral fellowship at Harvard Medical School, first with Melvin J. Glimcher and later with Jerome Gross. Academic career Tuan began his independent research career in 1980 when he joined the Department of Biology at the University of Pennsylvania. In 1988 he moved to Thomas Jefferson University, where he held joint appointments in the departments of Orthopaedic Surgery and Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. He served as the Director of Orthopaedic Research and Vice Chair of the department, and later took on the role of academic director of the institution's MD-PhD joint degree program. He also worked to develop a Ph.D. program in Cell and Tissue Engineering, launched in 1997 and noted as the first such program in the US. In 2001 Tuan left Jefferson to take an intramural research position at the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMD), one of the United States National Institutes of Health, where he became chief of the newly established Cartilage Biology and Orthopaedics Branch. Eight years later, he and his wife, fellow NIH scientist Cecilia Lo, were recruited to the University of Pittsburgh, where Tuan joined the departments of orthopaedic surgery and bioengineering and became the founding director of the newly established Center for Cellular and Molecular Engineering. He was appointed the Arthur J. Rooney Sr. Professor of Sports Medicine in 2010. Two years later, he assumed the directorship of the University of Pittsburgh's Center for Military Medicine Research and associate directorship of the McGowan Institute for Regenerative Medicine. Tuan is a founding editor-in-chief of the scientific journal Stem Cell Research & Therapy and the editor of Birth Defects Research Part C: Embryo Today. He and Lo co-edited a three-volume book titled Developmental Biology Protocols. In 2017, Tuan was appointed as the eighth vice-chancellor and president of the Chinese University of Hong Kong in his native city. He took up the post in January 2018. During the 2019–20 Hong Kong protests, he was initially condemned by CUHK students for failing to criticise police excesses, but later won plaudits after an evening-long discussion with them in public and private. On 18 October 2019, Tuan released an open letter in which he detailed some of the alleged police abuses that he had heard from his students. He called these \\"serious allegations from a human rights point of view\\" and urged the police to protect the rights of those arrested. He said he would write to Chief Executive Carrie Lam requesting an independent investigation of his students' cases outside existing mechanisms. This earned Tuan the condemnation of several police groups, who wrote that CUHK had \\"reduced itself to a hub of anti-China, Hong Kong independence forces\\". He was named as one of the world’s most influential academics by Times Higher Education in December 2019 as he has reached out to students, called for end to violence, and \\"stood up for his campus and students... despite being criticised by establishment figures\\". Research Tuan's research group focuses on bioengineering and tissue regeneration as applied to the musculoskeletal system, with an interest in translational research. Tuan's group has expertise in the study of adult stem cells and in the development of the musculoskeletal system. Among their efforts is a research project aimed at using 3D printing technology to restore function of joints damaged by diseases such as osteoarthritis, and work funded in 2016 to study model systems on the International Space Station.

The route was opened on 15 May 1876 and was at that time completely within the German Empire. From 1906 to 1914 it was part of the European long-distance transport network. Long-distance services ended as a result of the First World War and the resulting return of Alsace to France. As a result, the remaining part of the line in Germany also lost importance. This resulted in the closure of passenger services between Wörth and Berg in 1984. In 2002, passenger traffic between Wörth and Lauterbourg was reactivated, although no through services currently run through to Strasbourg. Since its reactivation, the German section of the route has also been designated for marketing purposes as the Bienwaldbahn (Bienwald Railway), since it runs along the eastern edge of the Bienwald. Meanwhile, it still plays an important role in the transport of freight, notably in recent decades for the transport of nuclear waste (dry cask storage) from Cap de la Hague to Gorleben.  History = First aspirations (1840–1870) = Originally, it was planned to build a railway line in the north–south direction to Lauterbourg within the then Bavarian Circle of the Rhine (Rheinkreis), which failed, however, due to problems with the then border, as Lauterbourg was part of France at the time. Instead, the Palatine Ludwig Railway (Pfälzische Ludwigsbahn) was built between 1847 and 1849 from Rheinschanze (Ludwigshafen from 1853) to Bexbach; this mainly served the transport of coal. A branch line from Schifferstadt to Speyer was also built at the same time. Plans for a north–south connection were subsequently developed. There were two options for discussion: one would run from Neustadt via Landau to Wissembourg in Alsace and continue from there to Strasbourg. The other would extend the branch to Speyer via Germersheim and Lauterbourg to Strasbourg. The first option prevailed, because France hesitated and because the former option passed through territory that was more densely settled than a route along the Rhine valley. After the Schifferstadt–Speyer branch line, which was opened by the Palatine Ludwig Railway Company (Pfälzische Ludwigsbahn-Gesellschaft) in 1848, was extended to Germersheim in 1864, plans were developed to continue it through to Wörth and along the Rhine to Lauterbourg. Already in 1863, a local committee met in Maximiliansau (until 1938: Pfortz) not far from the Wörth floating bridge, with representatives of Germersheim, Bellheim, Rülzheim, Rheinzabern, Wörth am Rhein and Pfortz. Also present was the mayor of the Alsatian city of Lauterbourg. The latter was open-minded to the plan and reported on French plans to build a trunk line on the Lille – Thionville – Sarreguemines – Lauterbourg – Maxau – Karlsruhe route, as part of a link from London to Vienna and the east. In addition, the French railway company Chemins de fer de l'Est was interested in contesting competition in Strasbourg. = Planning, construction, opening and subsequent period (1870–1876) = In the meantime, the political environment had changed. As a result of the Franco-Prussian War, France had to cede Alsace-Lorraine to the newly founded German Empire. The Palatine Maximilian Railway Company (Pfälzische Maximiliansbahn-Gesellschaft), which owned most of the south Palatinate railway network, and the newly founded Imperial Railways in Alsace- Lorraine (Kaiserliche Generaldirektion der Eisenbahnen in Elsaß-Lothringen) agreed to build a railway from Ludwigshafen via Schifferstadt, Germersheim, Wörth and Lauterburg to Strasbourg. At first, the Reichstag had resolved that the Alsace section had to be built and operated by a private company, but it was taken over directly by the imperial government for strategic reasons. Various railway engineers produced a general draft for the route from Wörth to Lauterbourg in 1872 and 1873 and then presented it to the Bavarian government. The latter gave the go-ahead for the project on 7 February 1874 in the form of a law giving an interest rate guarantee and it granted a concession on 18 August of the same year in the name of the Maximilian Railway Company for the Palatinate Railway. The railway line was opened on 24 and 25 July 1876 together with the line from Germersheim to Wörth as part of the Schifferstadt–Speyer–Germersheim–Wörth–Lauterburg–Strasbourg trunk line. The Maximilian Railway Company was responsible for the Palatinate segment and the Alsace-Lorraine Railways for the Alsace section. = Further development (1876–1930) = In the first decades the line was mainly used for freight transport. Double tracking was completed on the section between Wörth and Lauterburg and the line from Schifferstadt in 1906. The express trains from Berlin to Strasbourg, which had previously run via the Neustadt–Wissembourg railway, now ran via Speyer and Germersheim, as this journey was shorter and there was now sufficient capacity on the line. From then on, the line including its northern continuation to Schifferstadt together with the Maximilian Railway was in close competition with the Baden main line between Mannheim and Basel. The Palatine section, along with the other railways within the Palatinate, was absorbed into the Royal Bavarian State Railways (Königlich Bayerische Staatseisenbahnen) on 1 January 1909. The outbreak of the First World War brought the long-distance traffic to a standstill. After Alsace was ceded to France as a result of the First World War, the French section of the line became the property of the newly founded Réseau ferroviaire d’Alsace- Lorraine, while the Palatine section became part of Deutsche Reichsbahn (DR). The latter allocated its section to the newly created Reichsbahndirektion (railway division) of Ludwigshafen in 1922. In addition, DR ordered that the long-distance services run from now on through Baden to keep them within their own territory as long as possible, thus making the Strasbourg–Wörth line less important. The so-called Regiebetrieb (military operation) commenced in 1923 on the German part of the line as a consequence of the French occupation, which meant that the railway was operated by the French military until the beginning of 1924. Later, as the relations between Germany and France relaxed, cross-border freight operations again took place. = The Second World War and loss of significance (1930–1990) = On 1 February 1937, the German section came under the management of the Karlsruhe railway division, since the one in Ludwigshafen was dissolved two months later. On 1 January of the following year, the French section of the line came to the newly established Société nationale des chemins de fer français (SNCF). Passenger traffic came to a standstill with the outbreak of the Second World War, while freight trains operated almost throughout the war. It was only in the middle of 1945, after the end of the war, that the operation were restored. The Betriebsvereinigung der Südwestdeutschen Eisenbahnen (Union of south-west German railways, SWDE) took over operations on the German section in 1947; it was absorbed into the newly founded Deutsche Bundesbahn (DB) in 1949. The line was part of the area of responsibility of the railway division of Mainz until its dissolution on 1 August 1971, when the railway division of Karlsruhe was again responsible. After the Second World War, the line was downgraded to a secondary line. At the same time, cross-border traffic has been severely limited; Berg (Pfalz), the last station on the German side, was the terminus for rail services. It was not until the 1950s that any trains crossed the border to Lauterbourg. Operations of the Ludwigshafen–Strasbourg express, which had mainly served the French armed forces, was terminated on 11 June 1980, ending cross-border passenger services on the line. The remaining passenger services between Wörth and Berg were also discontinued on 1 June 1984. However, extensive freight traffic continued along the line. For example, up to five pairs of freight train were operated daily, often using French locomotives. During this period the transport of dry casks over the line to and from the nuclear reprocessing facilities at La Hague and Sellafield occasionally took place, which led regularly to protests by nuclear power opponents and resulted in a corresponding media presence. = Reactivation of passenger traffic on the German side (since 1999) = In the course of the rail reform, the section of line in Germany became the property of Deutsche Bahn. From 1999 until the end of 2002, excursion trains ran on the line from Wörth to Lauterbourg without intervening stops on Sundays and holidays from April to October.. The excursion trains were called the Bienwaldexpress and consisted of a total of four train pairs. The reactivation of daily passenger services took place at the 2002/2003 timetable change on 15 December 2002. Modern platforms were built at the disused stations of Hagenbach, Neuburg and Berg. The halt of Maximiliansau Im Rüsten was re-established in 2002, as the development of Maximiliansau was increasingly oriented towards the Bienwald Railway in the west. The line is regularly used for the transport of nuclear waste. Since the prohibition of so-called nuclear reprocessing in 2005, transports of spent fuel no longer take place. However, highly radioactive waste packaged in glass chips (in particular from the French La Hague reprocessing plant to the Gorleben storage unit) continue to be carried along this line. On 8 September 2008, the line was blocked by three demonstrators near Berg, who had chained themselves to a concrete block under the tracks, prior to the running of such a transport. Using heavy equipment, the police managed to remove the activists after about twelve hours. The train with the nuclear waste containers had to wait for this time in Lauterbourg. In 2010, a train scheduled for this route with nuclear waste from La Hague had to be diverted at short notice via Strasbourg and Kehl, because the track near the station was blocked by a sit- in involving several hundred opponents of nuclear power. = Planning = It is planned to abolish the need to change trains at Lauterbourg, which currently still exists, by using the modern SNCF diesel multiple units of the Lauterbourg–Strasbourg on the route to Wörth. Four upgraded connections have been scheduled in Lauterbourg since December 2016. Starting from 2017, between the end of May and the end of October, there will be four regular trips between Wörth and Strasbourg on weekends. This is only possible with the use of SNCF diesel multiple units that are approved ro run on both the German and the French rail network. In addition, there was the idea of establishing a Stadtbahn line from Strasbourg to the inner city of Karlsruhe. This idea, however, has not been pursued so far, since it is feared in France that it would encourage Strasbourg residents to shop in Karlsruhe.  Route SNCF class DU 84 Draisine in Herrlisheim The line leaves Wörth in a southeastern direction and runs along the Bienwald.

It's one of the first outgrowths of the Pirate Party movement in continental Africa. The party achieved notoriety during the Tunisian revolution, as party members declared their intention to break a media blackout on the social unrest taking place across the country. Members distributed censorship circumvention software, and assisted in documenting human rights abuses during the riots in the cities of Sidi Bouzid, Siliana, and Thala. After the revolution, a Pirate Party member who had been detained during the unrest, Slim Amamou, was briefly selected as Secretary of State for Sport and Youth in the new government. He later resigned in protest of the transitional government's censorship of several websites at the request of the army. He was arrested on 6 January 2011 during the protests that led to the Tunisian Revolution, alongside others including Azyz Amami. The Anonymous hacktivist group had led attacks on the Tunisian government's websites, and Amamou was held for five days by the state security forces under the suspicion of having collaborated with the hackers.

These elections were characterized by the fall in popularity of Ennahdha, for the secular Nidaa Tounes party, which became the first party of the country. The demonstrations were caused by high unemployment, food inflation, corruption, a lack of political freedoms like freedom of speech and poor living conditions. The protests constituted the most dramatic wave of social and political unrest in Tunisia in three decades and resulted in scores of deaths and injuries, most of which were the result of action by police and security forces against demonstrators.

It has played a role in the country's history from the time of the Tunisian independence movement against France up through the Tunisian Revolution to the present day.  Tunisian Communist Party   Neo Destour   Movement of Socialist Democrats  In 1978, the Movement of Socialist Democrats (MDS) was founded by defectors from the then ruling Socialist Destourian Party (PSD) and liberal- minded expatriates. The founders of the MDS had already been involved in the establishment of the Tunisian Human Rights League (LTDH) in 1976/77. Its first secretary general was Ahmed Mestiri who had been a member of the PSD and interior minister in the government of Habib Bourguiba, but was dropped from the government in 1971 and expelled from the party after he had called for democratic reforms and pluralism. The MDS to officially register in 1983. It was one of three legal oppositional parties during the 1980s. The MDS welcomed Zine El Abidine Ben Ali taking over the presidency from the logterm head of state Bourguiba in 1987. Many MDS members believed that Ben Ali really pursued reforms and liberalisation and defected to his Constitutional Democratic Rally (RCD), weakening the MDS. Ahmed Mestiri led the party until 1990. In the early 1990s, the party was torn between cooperation with the government and opposition. Those who strove for a strictly oppositional course left the party or were edged out. In 1994, a group of MDS dissidents around Mustapha Ben Jaafar founded the Democratic Forum for Labour and Liberties (FDTL), which was only legalised in 2002.  Unionist Democratic Union   Popular Unity Party   Democratic Forum for Labour and Liberties  In 9 April 1994, the Democratic Forum for Labour and Liberties (Ettakatol or FDTL) was founded and officially recognized on 25 October 2002.

Ettajdid Movement  Ahmed Brahim Active from 1993 to 2012, the Ettajdid Movement (Movement for Renewal) was a centre-left secularist, democratic socialist and social liberal political party in Tunisia. It was led by Ahmed Ibrahim. For the Constituent assembly election, Ettajdid formed a strongly secularist alliance called Democratic Modernist Pole (PDM), of which it was the mainstay. Ahmed Brahim was the First Secretary of the movement and also the leader of the Democratic Modernist Pole until April 2012, when his party merged into the Social Democratic Path of which he became the president. He was the Ettajdid Movement's candidate for President of Tunisia in the 2009 presidential election.Walid Khéfifi. \\"Ettajdid : Ahmed Brahim succède à Harmel\\". Le Quotidien. Brahim was in favor of the emergence of a \\"democratic modern and secular [laicist] state\\" not connected with Islamists. According to Brahim, this would require \\"radical\\" reform of the electoral system, which would improve the political climate in guaranteeing freedom of assembly and a large scale independent press, as well as repealing a law that regulated public discourse of electoral candidates.  Congress for the Republic   Socialist Party   Tunisian Revolution  Protesters on Avenue Habib Bourguiba, downtown Tunis on 14 January 2011, a few hours before president Zine El Abidine Ben Ali fled the country. The Tunisian Revolution was an intensive campaign of civil resistance, including a series of street demonstrations taking place in Tunisia, and led to the ousting of longtime president Zine El Abidine Ben Ali in January 2011. It eventually led to a thorough democratization of the country and to free and democratic elections with the Tunisian Constitution of 2014, which is seen as progressive, increases human rights, gender equality, government duties toward people, lays the ground for a new parliamentary system and makes Tunisia a decentralized and open government. And with the held of the country first parliamentary elections since the 2011 Arab Spring and its presidentials on 23 November 2014, which finished its transition to a democratic state. These elections were characterized by the fall in popularity of Ennahdha, for the secular Nidaa Tounes party, which became the first party of the country. The demonstrations were caused by high unemployment, food inflation, corruption, a lack of political freedoms like freedom of speech and poor living conditions. The protests constituted the most dramatic wave of social and political unrest in Tunisia in three decades and resulted in scores of deaths and injuries, most of which were the result of action by police and security forces against demonstrators. The protests were sparked by the self-immolation of Mohamed Bouazizi on 17 December 2010Tunisia suicide protester Mohammed Bouazizi dies, BBC, 5 January 2011. and led to the ousting of President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali 28 days later on 14 January 2011, when he officially resigned after fleeing to Saudi Arabia, ending 23 years in power. Labour unions were said to be an integral part of the protests. The Tunisian National Dialogue Quartet was awarded the 2015 Nobel Peace Prize for \\"its decisive contribution to the building of a pluralistic democracy in Tunisia in the wake of the Tunisian Revolution of 2011\\". The protests inspired similar actions throughout the Arab world.  People's Movement  Founded in , the People's Movement is a secularist and Arab nationalist political party in Tunisia.

He engaged and managed local and overseas opera, drama, circus, minstrel and variety companies throughout the Australasian colonies. History Allison was by trade a tailor, at which he worked for about 12 years, and had a shop in Castlereagh Street, Sydney. He was somehow associated with Harry Rickards' first visit to Australia in 1871. He may have worked as a travelling salesman for F. E. Hiscocks and Co. of Melbourne, publishers of Australian atlases from 1874.Frederick E. Hiscocks (1842 – 18 July 1901) of Hiscocks, Hayman & Co., manager of St. Georges Hall, and of the Elsie Lander Dramatic Company, the Federal Minstrels, the Hicks-Sawyer Minstrels, The Mammoth Minstrels, The Little Midgets, also associated with Al Hayman, J. Allison, George Rignold, N. Hegarty and J. Wilson. Hiscocks and Allison were both lovers of the turf. Only one of Hiscocks' many obits mentions the atlas business. but was associated with Fred Hiscocks and Samuel Lazar from at least 1875 when they were operating the Queen's Theatre, Sydney, and managed Mr. and Mrs. J. C. Williamson's first Sydney appearance. When Lazar took the Williamsons to Melbourne and Adelaide in July 1875 Allison \\"held the fort\\" in Sydney as treasurer. Lazar had been lessee and manager of the Theatre Royal, Adelaide since 1870; Allison joined in that management in 1873 and became sole lessee around 1876. It was in that year he made his first visit to America, arranging for George Rignold to visit the colonies with his grand production of \\"Henry V.,\\" and introduced to Australia the popular comedian, Fred Thorne. After Edgar Chapman rebuilt the Theatre Royal in 1878 he charged Allison a modest £25 or £30 a week rent. From the renewal of the lease Allison was being charged something like £45 or £50 a week, then charging the touring companies £90, a substantial profit for very little risk. When Allison was preparing to leave for England in 1883 he on-sold the business for £90 a week to a Melbourne speculator, who charged the companies £160–£170, thus putting Adelaide out of the running for any but second-rate acts. Allison continued as sole lessee of the Adelaide Theatre Royal until 1883, when he took on George Rignold as a partner (Arthur Chapman would be added as a third partner and local manager in 1885), freeing him to visit America and England early in 1884, and amongst other attractions he introduced to Australia Miss Jeffreys- Lewis, who made her first appearance at the Theatre Royal, Melbourne as \\"Fedora\\", on 17 May 1884. Allison was also associated with Hiscocks and William Marshall in the erection of the Victoria Hall, Melbourne, but retired from that partnership just prior to his 1884 American visit. He also secured the rights of several comic operas (Falka, Nell Gwynne) to be staged at the Opera House, Melbourne, which Rignold and Allison also managed, commencing with In the Ranks on 25 October 1884. In 1882 they secured a long lease on a site in Pitt Street, Sydney, and formed a company for the purpose of founding Her Majesty's Theatre, which Rignold and Allison opened on 10 September 1887. Allison and Rignold dissolved their partnership; Allison was in financial difficulties, and a benefit organised to alleviate his difficulties gained little public support. In September 1899 Allison left for America to arrange for the shipping of the Wild West Show which he had organised in conjunction with John Solomon and J. B. Gaylord, and to sign other attractions for Australia. Immediately after his arrival in America he was informed of the sudden death of his wife in Paddington, Sydney. Allison died of pneumonia in the German Hospital, San Francisco, and was buried in that city, funeral rites being held at the First Congregational Church. By his death two orphans (a boy and a girl) were left, and very ill-provided for. Family James Allison married Ellen Jane Murray (c. 1856 – 18 October 1889).

Baseball was played in Galveston and other Lone Star State locations prior to the war. The distribution of the game was interrupted by the Civil War but would pick up by the end of the war. Baseball was played during the war mostly by Yankees but occasionally by Confederates. A humorous story by Texas-based Union soldier George A. Putnam told of a baseball game interrupted by Confederate gunfire. Putnam stated: On April 21, 1868, the first occurrence of a baseball game was taken into account by the Houston Post. At the San Jacinto Battlegrounds near Houston, where General Sam Houston led Texas to triumph in the War of Independence from Mexico in 1836, a baseball game took place on the anniversary now celebrated as San Jacinto Day. The Houston Stonewalls defeated the Galveston Robert E. Lees, 35–2, that rivaled the result of what originally happened on the same site. Baseball spread throughout the state in the next two decades as a popular amateur game. The influence of what the Houston club had done in the early 1860s, along with those who acquired the nuances of the game from Civil War travels and immigrants who moved to Texas during the Reconstruction Era, helped in organizing the sport and bringing more attention to the game in the state. Scarcely a generation after the state's first recorded game in 1868, Texas fielded 100 minor league clubs—more than any other state.Baseball As America The acceptance of baseball had greatly expanded throughout Texas by the end of the 19th century. Houston Base Ball Club was a founding member of the Texas League in 1888 and also won their first league pennant the next year. The Houston ballclub went by the nicknames of Babies, Red Stockings, Mud Cats, Magnolias, and Wanderers before the Houston Buffaloes name became permanent around the turn of the 20th century. Professional baseball = Minor league = The Texas League helped to make professional baseball popular in the state beginning in the late 19th century. There were teams in Austin, Beaumont, Cleburne, Corsicana, Dallas, Fort Worth, Galveston, Greenville, Houston, Paris, San Antonio, Sherman, Temple, Texarkana, and Waco. The Texas League is presently a Major League Baseball (MLB) affiliated minor league at the AA level. Not all the teams in the league are in Texas. However, both of the state's two MLB franchises, the Texas Rangers and the Houston Astros, have teams in Texas in the league. The Rangers' affiliate is the Frisco RoughRiders, while the Astros' affiliate is the Corpus Christi Hooks. Along with the Texas League, there have been many baseball leagues that briefly existed in Texas or included at least one team from the Lone Star State such as: Lone Star Colored League of Texas, Negro American League, Colored Texas League, Texas Negro League, Texas-Oklahoma Negro League, South Texas Negro League, West Texas Negro League, Mexican National League, Central Baseball League, American Association, All-American Association, South Central League, Arkansas State League, Cotton States League, Rio Grande Valley League, Rio Grande Association, Southwestern League, Panhandle-Pecos Valley League, Longhorn League, North Texas League, West Texas–New Mexico League, Sooner State League, Arizona–Texas League, Lone Star League, Big State League, Gulf States League, East Texas League, Texas Association, Arkansas–Texas League, West Texas League, South Texas League, Middle Texas League, Central Texas League, Texas-Southern League, Texas–Louisiana League, Texas Valley League, Texas–Oklahoma League, Southwest Texas League, Evangeline League, West Dixie League, Gulf Coast League, Western Association, Texas Winter League, United League Baseball, Continental Baseball League, and Sophomore League. In addition to MLB and the Texas League, present-day teams compete in the Pacific Coast League, the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball, the Pecos League, and the American Association of Independent Professional Baseball. = Major League Baseball =  Houston Astros   Texas Rangers   Amateur baseball  = College baseball = College baseball also has been a staple of Texas culture, and Texas collegiate baseball programs can be found throughout the different levels of college athletics. NCAA Division I conferences that currently include Texas teams are the American Athletic Conference, Big 12 Conference, Conference USA, Missouri Valley Conference, Southeastern Conference, Southland Conference, Southwestern Athletic Conference, Sun Belt Conference, and Western Athletic Conference. Many of the major programs (Baylor, Houston, Rice, Southern Methodist (SMU), Texas, Texas A&M;, Texas Christian (TCU), and Texas Tech) previously all played together in the Southwest Conference (SWC). SMU ended its baseball program in 1980, and the SWC dissolved in 1996. Other conferences that include one or more Texas collegiate baseball programs are the Heartland Conference, Lone Star Conference, American Southwest Conference, Southern Collegiate Athletic Conference, Red River Athletic Conference, Sooner Athletic Conference, Southwest Junior College Conference, Texas Intercollegiate Athletic Association, Western Junior College Athletic Conference, and NAIA independent schools (University of Houston–Victoria). Texas has some intense in-state rivalries such as the Battle of the Brazos between Texas A&M; and Baylor University, Houston-Rice rivalry, the Holy War between Baylor and TCU, Battle of the Piney Woods between Sam Houston State and Stephen F. Austin State University, and the Lone Star Showdown between the Texas Longhorns and Texas A&M; Aggies. Other in-state rivalries include Sam Houston State-Rice, Texas- Rice, Texas State-Rice, Texas State-University of Texas at San Antonio, Texas Tech-Baylor, Texas-Texas Tech, Texas Tech-Texas A&M;, Texas-Baylor, Sam Houston State-Houston, Texas Southern-Prairie View A&M;, St. Mary's-University of the Incarnate Word, Dallas Baptist-Houston Baptist as well as other esoteric rivalries. Tournaments, like the Southwest Diamond Classic in Frisco, Texas, Whataburger College Classic in Corpus Christi, Texas, and Houston College Classic played at Minute Maid Park, take place in late February because of the more convenient, warmer weather.

It comprises a conservation area in the westernmost part of Rawdon town which is unique in that the historic area covered by the designation straddles the boundary of districts of Leeds and of neighbouring Bradford. Apperley Lane (A658) forms the municipal boundary. Geography Little London occupies a spur of high ground in a dramatic position above the Aire valley. Cragg Wood is sloping down to the south, the Esholt estate is located to the west. To the northeast the land rises gradually towards Billing Hill and the moors above Yeadon. The underlying rocks consist mostly of carboniferous sandstone with Millstone Grit sandstone to the north. The sandstone was exploited in at least two quarries within or very near to today's Conservation Area and was used as a building material. The village is located at the westernmost tip of the contiguous urbanised settlement of Rawdon which coalesces with Guiseley, the centre of which is approximately to the northeast of the conservation area. Greengates, and the edge of the Bradford urban area, is to the south of Little London. The area to the west of the conservation area is rural Green Belt, with Esholt village lying to the west of Little London in the Green Belt. Little London, located around the main thoroughfares of Apperley Lane and Micklefield Lane, is mostly made up of long rows of former weavers cottages which contrast with large former villas and open spaces south of Micklefield Lane, and its core has retained its own distinctive character and most of its historic street pattern. History The village probably originated as a farmstead, but due to the booming local weaving industry it grew quickly during the late 18th and early 19th century. Maps of the 18th century show a small number of buildings in the area prior to that. The oldest is Lane Head House which dates from about 1710. The name \\"Little London\\" is first recorded on a tithe map of 1838 and refers to the farmstead; ten years later the whole settlement is so identified. Around or before 1821 London Lane was built on land connected the quarry to Micklefield Lane, and the village developed from there. It was supposedly named by local resident Benjamin Grimshaw, who had been much impressed by a visit to London. The area of Little London included a Baptist chapel and a Quaker Meeting House. The nearby joint Quaker/Baptist school which existed near the junction of Apperley Lane and Warm Lane was rebuilt in 1821 and closed in 1905 when it was sold as a private home. Another school, known as Little London School or Milligan's School after the sponsor Robert Milligan, was built in 1846 in Micklefield Lane in a vernacular Tudor style. It was also used by the Baptists as a Sunday School. From 1920 on it served as an infants school and closed in 1960. After being used for some years for storage purposes, it was converted into flats (1980). The settlement grew further in the late 19th century when larger Victorian terraces were built, first following the auction of William White's estate in 1863, and then in 1890, the latter being characterised by mullioned windows. By the end of the 19th century Little London had grown into a largely self-contained community with a chapel, a pub, a doctor's surgery, a post office, a grocer, two butchers and a draper. However, by the year 2000 many of these services have disappeared, leaving only the pub, a hairdresser, a newsagent, and a small general store. Until 1974 the area of Little London was part of the district Aireborough. After the local government reorganisation the village was divided between the Cities of Leeds and Bradford along the line of Apperley Lane. The portion of the conservation area lying in the City of Leeds was designated in 1975 and was extended in 1988. The portion of the conservation area lying in the City of Bradford was designated in 1977. The Bradford designation centres on Lane Head House, built for the steward of Esholt Hall Estate , with its associated cottages, and outbuildings and other mainly late 18th century development completing the designation. Architecture 19th century houses on Apperley Lane The historic core of the village is laid out in a formal terraced manner with two- and three-storied weaver cottages along narrow streets. South of Micklefield Lane a more formal landscape with larger houses, strong boundary treatments and a more landscaped setting is found. The late 19th century terraces are mostly two-storey buildings with grand bays, dentilled eaves, architraves and some rooms within gable features. Local sandstone is the predominant building material, with the roofs being made of stone slabs or slate. Gateposts, mall front gardens and yards bounded by stone walls with coping stones are characteristic for the village. Some traditional stone paving has survived. Only two of the key historical buildings, Buckstone Chapel and the Sunday School, were demolished in 1992.

Reputedly the fastest steamboat in the world in its time, Telephone served on the Columbia River and San Francisco Bay. Telephone was rebuilt at least twice. The first time was after a fire in 1887 which nearly destroyed the vessel. The reconstructed and much larger second vessel was sometimes referred to as Telephone No. 2. The third vessel, Telephone No. 3, built in 1903 and using components from the second steamer was larger but little used during its time on the Columbia river. Plans and design Newspaper reports of the plans to construct the steamer which eventually was named Telephone appeared in July 1884. U.B. Scott and his partners intended to build the fast boat on the Columbia river which could make the 110 mile distance from Portland, Oregon to Astoria in five hours. The boat was expected to be complete by December 1, 1884. It was expected to cost $35,000. Construction Telephone No. 1 was built in East Portland, Oregon for Captain Uriah Bonser Scott (1827-1913) and his partners. The contract for construction of the vessel was signed on July 18, 1884. Scott was a steamboat owner and captain on the Mississippi and Ohio rivers during, before and after the American Civil War who had come to Oregon in 1873. The steamer was launched on October 30, 1884. The vessel’s trial trip occurred in February 1885. Telephone No. 1 was 172 feet long measured over the hull, exclusive of the extension over the stern, called the “fantail” which mounted the sternwheel. Telephone had a width, called \\"beam\\", which measured across the hull, and exclusive of the long wide protective timbers along the sides of the hull, called the \\"guards\\", of 28 feet, with a depth of hold of 7.2 feet. The steamer drew 3.5 feet of water. The planned draft was 3.5 feet. The total size of Telephone No. 1, measured in tons, a unit of volume and not weight, was 386.27 gross and 333.97 registered tons. Engineering The machinery for Telephone No. 1 was built at Willamette Iron Works in Portland. The engines generated 500 indicated horsepower. The official steamboat identification number was 145400. Power was furnished by two non-condensing steam engines, with a 22-inch cylinder bore and a stroke of 8 feet. The boiler was 32.5 feet long, 6.5 feet in diameter, containing 280 tubes, each 2.5 inches through, and 18 feet long. Total heating surface was reported to be 3,468 square feet. The purpose of having 280 tubes in the boilers was to raise steam rapidly. The authorized steam pressure generated by the boilers was 140 pounds per square inch. With the stern-wheel turning at 38 revolutions per minute, the theoretical horsepower generated by both engines combined would be 1301. (According to one report, the stern-wheel made 14 revolutions per minute, with four paddles in the water, two completely and two partially.) The boilers were wood fired, and when running fast, the consumption of wood was estimated to be approximately 3 cords per hour. Telephone No. 1 was equipped with three lifeboats and 315 life preservers. The steamer was reported to have cost $15,000 to build, and was insured for $30,000. In early 1886, Telephone No. 1s stern-wheel was fitted with new paddles, called “buckets”. These buckets were twenty inches wide, and were four inches wide on the inside of the while, gradually curving and tapering to one and three-quarter inch thick on the outside of the sternwheel. This bucket design was thought to improve the speed of the steamer, because less water would have to be lifted off the paddles after they rotated out of the water. Instead, before the bucket reached the level of the stern-wheel shaft, the water would have completely run off. Backing operations were also improved by the new design. Captain Scott was reported to have estimated fuel savings of 15% as a result of the new paddle design and a speed increase of 10%. In February 1888, Captain Scott ordered a new pair of cylinders for Telephone No. 2. The new engines would have a 25 inch bore and an eight-foot stroke. =Searchlight on Telephone No. 2= In September 1895, Telephone No. 2 was fitted with the most powerful searchlight on the Columbia River, rated at 5,000 candle power. The light was manufactured in New York and had been furnished by Campbell & Swigert, of Portland, and installed by their chief engineer, Joseph Gleason. The light was reported to be “so simply constructed that the pilot can throw it in any desired position by the pressure of three fingers.” Accommodations Telephone No. 1 had 17 staterooms, with a total of 34 berths between them. (Originally the reported plan was to have 20 staterooms.) The steamer was licensed to carry 300 passengers overall. Reportedly the vessel was “handsomely furnished throughout in white and gold,and neatness without lavish expenditure is apparent at a glance.” Telephone was also the first boat on the Columbia river to carry a piano. The planned length for the main dining hall was 119 feet. According to another report, as initially built, Telephone had sixteen staterooms, several closets and cupboards, a purser’s office, a dining room, and for and after cabins. The cabin floors were to be of ash. The interior was to be painted white with gold trimmings. Newspaper reports in 1885 claimed that upon completion, Telephone would be the “handsomest as well as the fast boat on the river.” Launch and initial run According to one source, Telephone was launched on November 6, 1884. Another source gives the launch date as October 30, 1884. William H. Whitcomb (1851-1923) was the first captain of Telephone, and remained so until the vessel burned. Edgar W. Wright (1863-1930), later a maritime historian, served as mate on Telephone at about the same time. Telephone was taken out on a trial trip in early February, 1885. On Sunday, January 31, 1885, Telephone steamed down the Willamette River to St. Johns to test the machinery and take on wood for fuel. The seven mile trip, which began at 7:40 a.m., was completed in 28 minutes. The trial trip was reported to have been successful. At this time the steamer was already being as “said to be the fastest stern-wheeler afloat.” Finishing construction In the second half of February, 1885, Telephone was undergoing final construction. The upper interior painting was being done. The seats had been taken down to the dock, and were soon to be installed. Telephone made its first regular trip from Portland to Astoria, Oregon on March 1, 1885. Telephone departed Portland at 9:00 a.m. and arrived in Astoria at 3:40 p.m. or 3:45 p.m. The boat’s fastest time was between Pillar Rock and Astoria, covering the fourteen mile distance in thirty-seven minutes, for a rate of 22 miles per hour. Crowds attended the departure and arrival of the steamer. Along the way, Telephone made about twenty landings. The steamer carried about 225 passengers on this trip. The actual running time was 5 hours and 26 minutes, for an average speed of 20 miles per hour. When placed into service, Telephone was reported to have been capable of departing Astoria at 9:00 a.m., and reaching Portland at 2:00 p.m., two hours faster than all other vessels on the river. In March 1885, the Columbia Transportation Company advertised “fast time for Portland!” on Telephone, with the steamer departing Wilson & Fisher’s dock in Astoria every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday at 6 a.m., and arriving at Portland at 1:00 p.m. Returning to Astoria, Telephone would depart Portland on Tuesdays and Thursdays, arriving in Astoria at 1:00 p.m. An extra trip would be made every Sunday morning, leaving Portland at 9:00 a.m. Passengers on this trip could make a connection to the overland route to the Puget Sound region at Kalama, W.T. Telephone was able to hold to the five hour running time even in adverse conditions, such as fog on the river, incoming tides, and wind blowing against the steamer’s run, even when all three were combined. Speed Telephone No. 1 was one of the fastest steamers on the Columbia River Indeed, Telephone was reputed to have been \\"the fastest sternwheeler in the world.\\" Telephone No. 1 replaced the propeller-driven steamer Fleetwood, itself considered a speedy vessel, on the Portland-Astoria run. On one of its first runs to Astoria from Portland, Telephone No. 1 made the round trip in 11 hours and four minutes. On July 2, 1887, Telephone ran downriver from Portland to Astoria in the unheard-of time of four hours, thirty-four and one-half minutes, even while heading into a gale during the last 40 miles. Reportedly when in peak trim, Telephone was capable of reaching 22 miles per hour. Early operations Advertisement for steamer Telephone, circa 1887 In April 1885, Telephone was scheduled to depart Astoria, from the Wilson & Fisher’s dock, for Portland every Monday, Wednesday and Friday, arriving at Portland at 1:00 pm. Starting in the 1880s, the Long Beach Peninsula was a popular summer vacation destination for residents of the Portland area. Steamers would run to the dock at Ilwaco, Washington, and passengers would then travel overland to the resort areas of the peninsula. In August 1885, E.A. Seely, agent for Telephone, worked out a plan to provide service from Astoria to Ilwaco with J.H.D. Gray, agent for the Ilwaco Steam Navigation Company. Steamers of the ISN, either the General Miles or the then-new General Canby would meet Telephone at Astoria, and then depart immediately for Ilwaco, without waiting for other steamers to arrive at Astoria. This was claimed to trim three hours off the travel time to Ilwaco. In 1887, Telephone set the record for speed on the Portland-Astoria route. Near destruction by fire At 6:00 in the evening, while en route from Portland to Astoria on Sunday, November 20, 1887, Telephone caught fire and was nearly destroyed. The fire occurred just down river from Tongue's Point, near Astoria. On board at the time were 140 or 150 passengers and 32 crew. The fire started in the oil-room and spread quickly. The steamer was rapidly approaching Wolson & Fisher's dock at Astoria, and preparations were being made for the landing when the fire occurred. A large crowd had gathered on the dock to greet the people arriving on the boat. A cry was heard: \\"the Telephone is on fire.\\" Some of the people along the waterfront, and on the ships moored in the harbor saw a bright flame shoot above the steamer's wheelhouse. Fire control efforts on Telephone failed. Captain Scott was at the wheel, and he quickly turned the steamer towards shore. There were docks along the shore at this point, but Scott was able to maneuver the boat into a gap between two piers towards the shore. The engineer also increased the speed so the steamer could reach the beach faster. Normally an increase in speed would accelerate the rate of the progression of the fire, but a rapid landing was the only course of action to be taken. As a result, Telephone hit the beach at 20 miles per hour. Only three minutes passed between the report of the fire and the beaching of the vessel. According to Alf. D. Rowen, the owner of the Oysterville Journal newspaper: In less than ten minutes the vessel was completely on fire. All passengers save one intoxicated man escaped, as did all the crew. The man, a Swedish logger named Peter Hanson, was badly burned and had to be taken to the hospital, where he died. The pilot house steps had burned while Captain Scott stayed at the wheel, and he escaped through the window just before the entire upper works caved in. The Astoria fire department was summoned to the scene. They were able to save enough of the hull to allow the vessel to be rebuilt. The new Telephone was launched in early 1888, and was under the command of Capt. Thomas H. Crang (b.1858) for at least six years after that. Rebuilt and relaunched =Reconstruction= In late November 1887, the hull of the burned Telephone was towed upriver to Portland by the steamer Governor Newell. Once in Portland, the steamer’s insurance losses would be adjusted. By January 1, 1888, a decision had been made to rebuild Telephone. Work was already under way at that time. The hull would be lengthened by 25 feet. The boiler was to be reused, but the engines would be new. =Relaunched= The rebuilt Telephone was launched on Saturday, April 28, 1888 before a crowd of about 1,500 people. Following the 1888 reconstruction, Telephone was a larger vessel. Gross tonnage had increased to 500, and the registered tonnage went up to 443. At the guards, Telephone No. 2 was three feet wider, and from the guards up, four feet wider. The length of the boat had increased from 170 to 200 feet. Howe trusses and solid bulkheads were installed in the hull. The freight capacity would be 300 tons. The number of cabins was increased to 25. Fire protection was improved, with additional fire valves and hoses. Two side stairs now led to the upper deck rather than a single center set of stairs as in the original vessel. U.B. Scott estimated that the rebuilt vessel’s speed would be 20 miles per hour. The 1888 Telephone also received a new steamboat registry number, which was 145477. Operations resumed The rebuilt Telephone made its trial trip to Astoria on Saturday, May 20. The rebuilt Telephone, sometimes known as Telephone No. 2 was scheduled to make its first trip from Portland to Astoria on May 19, 1888. Telephone No. 2 departed Portland on Friday morning, May 19, 1888, clearing the railroad bridge at 7:08 a.m., and arriving in Astoria at 2:00 p.m. Along the way Telephone No. 2 stopped at all of its regular landings, including St. Helens, Kalama, Washington, Rainier, and Skamokawa. The Daily Astorian reported that \\"all along the river it was a continual ovation, people cheering as she passed, and at every landing place crowding aboard 'to see the new boat.'\\" Officers on board were U.B. Scott, captain, Thomas Crang, pilot, C.R. Barnard, purser, C.J. Hooghkirk, mate, I.N. Scott (nephew of U.B. Scott), chief engineer, Perry Scoot, assistant engineer, John McGillan, steward. The steamer’s agent in Portland was E.A. Seeley, and the Astoria agent was Charles R. Donohoe (c1848-1918). Donohoe also served for 12 years as purser on Telephone. During this trip, Telephone No. 2 carried only 100 pounds steam pressure in its boilers, although it was licensed for up to 140 pounds pressure. In February 1891 the Columbia River and Puget Sound Navigation Co. was incorporated, with U.B. Scott as president, John Leary as vice president, L.B. Seely as second vice president, and E.W. Creighton as secretary-treasurer. The other directors were E.A. Seeley and Capt. Zephaniah J. Hatch (b.1846), although Hatch’s interest was soon acquired by the other principals. The new company acquired Telephone No. 2. From 1888 to about 1894, Telephone was used on the Portland- Astoria route. On this route, Telephone was matched against the crack sidewheeler T.J. Potter. In 1894 alone, Telephone No. 2 made 312 round trips on this route, steaming a total of 65,920 miles and making 12,731 landings. The fast steamer Hassalo was one of Telephone No. 2s chief competitors in the 1890s on the Astoria route. Monopoly plans of the Union Pacific Prior to March 1892, Telephone was being operated in conjunction with the Union Pacific railroad. Telephone had been laid up for repairs, during which time it was replaced by the Harvest Queen. When Telephone was returned to the Astoria route, the understanding with the Union Pacific had ended. In March 1892, it was expected that six steamers would soon be running on the Portland-Astoria route. Reportedly the plans of the Union Pacific were to achieve a monopoly control over the route, by running R.R. Thompson and Harvest Queen at night, and T.J. Potter and Telephone during the day. This scheme was reported upset when Jacob Kamm, owner of Lurline, Undine, and the then new Ocean Wave, refused to renew a lease to the UP on Lurline and Undine, which had expired in December 1891. It was reported that had the lease been renewed, UP would have pulled Lurline and Undine off the route on the lower Columbia river. With the plans for monopoly broken in March 1892 when Telephone returned to service, UP put its fastest boat, the T.J. Potter on the run to Astoria in competition with Telephone. Operations in the late 1890s In 1895, Telephone, owned by the Columbia River and Puget Sound Navigation Company, (CR&PSN;) was competing with the older steamer R.R. Thompson, built in 1878, and the newer T.J. Potter, built in 1888. Both competitors, particularly the Potter, were considered to be fast boats. Early in 1895, the CR&PSN; spent nearly $20,000 in improvements to another one of their steamers, the famous sternwheeler Bailey Gatzert. With Bailey Gatzert and Telephone running on alternate days to Portland, the city of Astoria received the finest steamboat service that it had ever had. In March 1896, the White Collar Line (officially, the Columbia River and Puget Sound Navigation Company) controlled the stern-wheel steamers Telephone and Bailey Gatzert, as well as the side-wheel (a rare type on the Columbia River) steamer Ocean Wave. All three steamers departed the Alder Street dock in Portland for Astoria, where connections would be made either with other steamers running north across the Columbia River to Ilwaco or south along the Oregon coast at Young’s Bay via the Seashore Railroad. Once at Ilwaco, connections would be made by rail travel via the narrow gauge Ilwaco Railroad and Navigation Company to Long Beach, Ocean Park, and, on Willapa Bay, Nahcotta, Washington. Telephone left the Alder Street dock daily at 7:00 a.m. except on Sundays. Returning, Telephone departed Astoria at 7:00 p.m. daily, also excepting Sundays. Freight carried on Telephone also included droves of cattle. The opening of the railroad from Portland to Astoria cut into the passenger carriage business of the Telephone, so that on June 2, 1898, Telephone carried only 75 passengers, yet this was the largest number since rail operations had commenced. Collisions and accidents =January 1892 sinking= In January 1892 Telephone was reported to have been sunk. A contract to raise the Telephone was awarded to Paquet & Co, who arranged to hire the two largest barges on the Columbia river. These barges were the Northern Pacific Railway’s reserve rail transfer barge kept at Kalama, Washington and the Portland terminal company’s transfer barge. On January 10, 2010, Follett, a diver, worked on clearing snags away from the bow of the Telephone, so that the barges could be brought alongside the sunken vessel. One barge would be placed on each side of the steamer, and then timbers laid across from one barge to the over, across the steamer. Chains would be run under the sunken hull, and fastened to the timbers. The chains would then be cranked up by jacks and levers, until Telephone would be hanging in the water held up by the chains. The hole in the hull would be patched and the water pumped out. Telephone would then be brought to a boatyard in Portland at the foot at East Jefferson Street. On January 25, 1892, Telephone was reported to be at the Alder Street dock in Portland, undergoing repairs to the boat’s upper works. The boat was expected to be transferred son to the East Jefferson street yard, where the holes in the hull would be repaired, the boat would be painted, and new furniture and carpeting installed. On March 2, 1892, it was reported that Telephone would resume service on the Astoria route the following day. In January 1892, while running upriver to Portland in a dense fog under the command of Pilot William Larkins, Telephone missed a navigation guide light and collided with the breakwater at the confluence of the Willamette and the Columbia rivers, ripping a large hole in the right side bow of the steamer. The boats were lowered and all passengers taken off and landed on Coon Island. Water flooded in, and Telephone sank so that only the bow was visible above the water’s surface. The steamer appeared to be a total loss, but remained hanging on the breakwater for about a week, which was enough time to raise the vessel. Once Telephone was raised, the damage appeared to be not so severe. =Collision with R.R.Thompson= On August 25, 1892, Telephone collided with the sternwheeler R.R. Thompson at Rainer, Oregon, on the Columbia River. The case was investigated by the steamboat inspection service, and as a result, on September 9, 1892, the license of Charles Spinner, master and pilot of R.R. Thompson, was suspended for 20 days for negligence and unskillfulness. The license of T.H. Crang, master and pilot of Telephone, was suspended for 10 days, for violation of Rule VIII of the Pilot Rules and Regulations for steamers. =Collision with Ocean Wave= In January 1893, on the Willamette River, Telephone No. 2, while making a landing to pick up some hogs at the North Portland stockyards, ran into an anchored ship, breaking the ship’s bow sprit. Telephone backed away from the ship, and in so doing collided with Ocean Wave, smashing the sternwheel on Telephone. Damage to Ocean Wave was about $200 and, to Telephone, about $500. =Collision with Northwest= On the morning of Tuesday, February 28, 1895, Telephone collided with the smaller sternwheeler Northwest (135 feet; 324 gross tons) at Portland in foggy conditions. There were no injuries to anyone. Telephone was not damaged much, but Northwest had to be taken out of service for repairs. Racing =Telephone No. 1= Telephone No. 1 was noted for having engaged, under the command of Capt. W.H. Whitcomb and chief engineer Newton Scott, in races on the Columbia river with the large iron-hulled side-wheel steamer Alaskan. Telephone No. 1 also raced against Alaskans sister vessel, the side- wheeler Olympian in 1886-87. Races between Telephone No. 1, under Captain Whitcomb, with Edgar W. Wright, first officer, were daily occurrences with Olympian, running under Capt. James W. Troup. Telephone No. 1 was much faster than Olympian, so Troup had to resort to strategy to keep ahead. When Telephone would stop at landings along the route, Olympian would pass the rival boat. Other times, Olympian would try to crowd Telephone out of the river channel. A few years before, on July 20, 1885, Capt. U.B. Scott denied that Telephone was racing the Potter, but did state that he would be willing to match times with the Potter, departing one-half hour earlier or latter than the rival vessel, if the Potters managers consented to this test of speed. =Telephone No. 2= On Sunday, August 5, 1894, five steamboats raced up the Columbia River from Astoria. The five steamers departed Astoria in a group, with Lurline in the lead, followed by Ocean Wave, Telephone, Sarah Dixon, and T.J. Potter. Every boat was crowded to its fullest. The Potter reached Portland first, followed by Lurline, Telephone, Ocean Wave, and Sarah Dixon. On Monday, June 17, 1895, Telephone, under the personal command of Capt. U.B. Scott, raced T.J. Potter from Portland to Astoria. Telephone had recently undergone a thorough overhaul, which included, among other things, installation of a new and more powerful dynamo. This was the first run of the Telephone following completion of the overhaul. Both boats left Portland at the same time, but the Potter was in the lead, having had a berth one-third of a mile downriver from Telephone. Telephone arrived first at St. Helens, Oregon, but the Potter was the first to depart. Telephone then arrived first at Kalama, Washington, but again Potter was first to depart. Telephone was in the lead coming into Rainier, Oregon, where both boats took on wood to fuel their boilers. Telephone arrived at Astoria at 1:15 p.m., beating the Potter by one hour and a quarter. Telephone also made all the stops along the river, which the Potter did not do. One day in August 1895, Telephone and T.J. Potter were to depart Portland bound down river. Telephone shot ahead of Potter through an open drawbridge. Just as Potters pilot was about to order full steam to challenge Telephone, Major O'Neill, receiver of the Oregon Railway and Navigation Company, boarded the Potter. O'Neill would not tolerate racing of the company's boats, and the anticipated race never came off. In April 1906 it was reported that a watchman who had been the watchman on Telephone No. 3 for two years was believed to have been drowned. On April 26, 1906 the body of the watchman, William B. Flannigan, was found not far from the steamer. It was surmised from finger marks on the boat's railing that Flannigan had fallen into the river when trying to board the Telephone by climbing over the railing rather than using the gangway. On December 16, 1907, Elmer Durland, age 19, a watchman’s helper on Telephone No. 3, drowned in the Willamette River while rowing away from the steamer in a small boat which suddenly capsized. =Telephone No. 3= On September 20, 1905, Telephone No. 3, which had been only recently returned to service, raced down the Willamette River against Bailey Gatzert. That night the captains of the two vessels, E.W. Baughman, of Telephone, and Fred Sherman, of Bailey Gatzert, were arrested by harbormaster Ben Biglin, and charged with exceeding the 8 mile per hour speed limit on the Willamette River. The combined wakes of the two steamers had, it was charged, so rocked the freighter Arabla, which had been moored at the flour mills, that the cable holding Arabia to the pier had parted, and it was only with two hours of effort that the ship was kept from floating downriver. Both steamer captains were released on $50 bail. On October 8, 1905, Telephone readily beat Charles R. Spencer on in a race to Cascade Locks, with Telephone arriving seven minutes ahead of Spencer. The two boats did not race in the Willamette however. In November 1905, Telephone and two other steamers, Charles R. Spencer and Dalles City cast off lines at Portland and raced down the Willamette River. The wakes created by the racing boats caused the British steamship Agincourt to rock so much that its stern lines broke and its gangway and railings were splintered. The three captains were fined $50 each for breaking the harbor speed limit. Steam whistle Steamers on the Columbia River were equipped with steam whistles, which often had distinctive tones. Telephones whistle (later installed on Bailey Gatzert) could be heard and recognized for 15 miles. The whistle was so distinctive that it could be recognized by the dogs of Cathlamet, Washington, where Captain Scott customarily dropped off the table scraps. When they heard the whistle, they would gather down at the Cathlamet landing with the expectation of food.  1903 reconstruction (Telephone No. 3)  =Telephone No. 2 unfit for service= Telephone No. 3 under reconstruction in June 1903 Telephone No. 2 had been running under the ownership of the Columbia River and Puget Sound Navigation Company (also known as the White Collar Line}, which sold all of its assets to the Dalles, Portland & Astoria Navigation Company (also known as the Regulator Line). These assets did not include Telephone No. 2, however, as the steamer was considered unfit for service, and had not been operated after 1899, when it carried some troops from Vancouver, Washington to Portland in a little more than an hour. As of June 1902, Telephone No. 2 had not been in use for several years, and had been lying at the foot of Jefferson Street in Portland, where one John Stewart was the watchman on the steamer. =Sale to Arrow Navigation Company= In January 1903, it was reported that Telephone No. 2 would be “practically rebuilt” to assist the other boats of the White Collar line during the summer season. In 1903, a newly formed steamboat concern, Arrow Navigation Co., acquired Telephone No. 2 and had the steamer completely rebuilt by Joseph Pacquet at Portland. In March, 1903, Telephone No. 2 was sold to Arrow Navigation by H.C. Campbell as trustee. Campbell had taken over Telephone No. 2 and a new steamer, Arrow which was then being completed in Portland by shipbuilder Joseph Pacquet. =Reconstruction plans and progress= It was reported that Telephone No. 2 was to be \\"practically rebuilt\\" at the yard of the Portland Shipbuilding Company. New engines, reportedly acquired by Campbell at the same time as he obtained the boats, were to be installed into the steamer. Once the reconstruction work was completed, the plan was for the Arrow Navigation Company to take it around the Olympic Peninsula to operate on Puget Sound, with the exact route not publicly known as of March 1903. Construction began with the laying of the keel at the boatyard at the food of Clay Street on April 8, 1903. The new hull was built alongside the old steamer, which had been pulled out of the water. By mid-June 1903, work on the new hull was complete, with the plan being to shift the entire cabin structure (called the “house”) of the old steamer over on to the newly built hull, using winches turned by horses. This was scheduled to occur on Sunday, June 14, 1903. Work was still being done on July 21, with the objective, according to builder Joseph Paquet, to finish the boat in 30 days. The engine cylinders had been placed on board, but the boiler was still at the Willamette Boiler Works. Painting still had to be done, as well as installation of railings and a new tin roof. As of September 23, 1903, reconstruction still had not been completed. The steamer was lying at the dock of the Willamette Boiler Works, having had almost all the machinery installed except for a little piping. Work remaining, which had to be done upriver at the Pacquet yard at the foot of Clay Street, included painting and furnishing of cabins and staterooms. There were various rumors about where the new vessel would be employed, with Puget Sound being thought to be unlikely by Capt. U.B. Scott, as he did not see how the boat could be profitable there. =Strikes and financial problems= The total cost of the new steamer was about $70,000. At the end of September, before the boat could be taken back to the Pacquet yard for the final work, the twelve carpenters working on the steamer went on strike. The carpenters had not been paid for five weeks, and some said seven. Willamette Iron Works also had an unpaid bill against Arrow Navigation Co., but it apparently expected the bill to be paid, as their engineers remained at work while the carpenters walked off. Although the wage liens were settled, various contractors on the 1903 reconstruction were not paid, and they filed liens, sometimes called against the steamer. The total value of the liens was $15,488. By comparison, the vessel was insured during the reconstruction for $27,000 by the St. Paul Fire & Marine Insurance Company. The backers of the Arrow Navigation Company, who were said to be the Isaacs family of Walla Walla pulled out of the steamboat business, and Telephone went back into the ownership of Captain U.B. Scott. =Changes in dimensions= Following the 1903 reconstruction, the overall size of the steamer was increased to 793 gross and 539 registered tons. Length of the hull (exclusive of the fantail on which the stern-wheel was mounted) was 201.5 feet, beam 31.6 feet, and depth of hold 8 feet. In the new machinery, the heating surface in the boilers was 5900 inches, and the boat was licensed to carry 190 pounds pressure of steam. The passenger capacity was 794, the largest on the river. Telephone also received a new steamboat registry number, 200263. After the 1903 rebuild, Telephone was not used on a full-time basis, but found only brief seasonal use. In 1907 Telephone was chartered to the Regulator Line, to run between Portland and The Dalles. Telephone replaced Joseph Kellogg on this route, with the Kellogg going to the Willamette River service. In February, 1904, the hull of Telephone No. 2 (minus the upper house which had been transferred to Telephone No. 3) was acquired by M.C. Harrison & Co. =New vessel kept out of service= Complete except for furnishings, Telephone No. 3 remained out of service through March 1904, as its owners were rumored to be looking for anyone who might be willing to rent the vessel. Telephone No. 3 remained tied up at the Haseltine dock into August 1904 with no word as to when or where the vessel might be placed into service, with the owners refusing to explain. =Sale of hull of Telephone No. 2= Later that month, the hull of Telephone No. 2 had been sold by its owners, M.C. Harrison & Co. to E.J. Kiss, of United States Launch Co. Kiss was reported to be planning to tow Telephone No. 2 across the Willamette River to a point near the Joseph Supple shipyard where he would use the steamer as a workshop. =Continued idleness= In October 1904, Telephone No. 3 remained tied up at the dock in Portland and was the subject of constant waterfront rumors and speculation. This continued until December 1904 when an attorney, J.H. Middleton, was reported to be the owner of Telephone No. 3. The boat was still tied up in February 1905. In May 1905, U.B. Scott and another steamboat captain, H.B. Kennedy, came to Portland to inspect Telephone No. 3 with a view to possibly purchasing the steamer and taking it to Puget Sound. Brief excursion service in 1905 Advertisement for steamer Telephone, placed September 17, 1905 On July 15, 1905, Telephone was reported to still at the Haseltine dock, having been freshly painted with steam up in the boiler, although it was still a mystery as to what route the boat would be placed on. Telephone No. 3 was reported to be licensed to carry 690 passengers if wood was used as fuel, and 720 if oil was used. Telephone finally moved from its dock at about 3:30 p.m. in the afternoon on August 21, 1905. The boat made a preliminary run down the Willamette River past Linnton and then back, making a stop for wood along the way. By early September 1905, Telephone No. 3 was in commercial service for the first time, carrying an excursion of letter-carrier conventioneers up the Columbia Gorge to Cascade Locks. The actual run was made on September 10, 1905, under Captains Cochran and E.W. Baughman, with 617 passengers on board. Advertisement for steamer Telephone, published September 25, 1905 On September 19, 1905, Telephone was advertised as making daily runs to Cascade Locks, Oregon, departing the Oak Street dock in Portland at 8:30 a.m. (9:00 a.m. on Sundays). Excursion work dropped off sharply by mid-October 1905 with the coming of the fall rainy weather. The Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition, which had brought a lot of visitors into Portland, also ended on October 14, 1905. As of October 24, 1905, Telephone was taken off the Cascades Locks run and tied up again at Portland, with no new route being announced. On November 3, 1905, it was reported that Telephone would be tied up until spring. The crew had quit. Captain Baughman resigned to take over as master of the sternwheeler J.M. Hannaford on the Snake River. By mid-August 1906 Telephone No. 3 still had not been placed in service despite having missed a good part of the busy summer season, at a time when other steamers were enjoying a good business. The reason for this remained unknown to the general public. The boat remained out of service as of September 21, 1906, lying at Portland at the Duniway dock on the east side of the Willamette River. The steamer was still of service through February 1907 when there was talk of sale of the vessel for use in California on San Francisco Bay and the Sacramento River. 1907 charter to Regulator Line Telephone No. 3 at dock in Portland, April 1907 In April 1907, Telephone No. 3 was returned to service after being tied up for almost three years by way of a lease to the Regulator Line. The boat would operate between Portland and The Dalles, Oregon in place of the Joseph Kellogg, which the Regulator Line was returning to its owners. Until Telephone No. 3 could be brought into service, the Capital City would be making a few trips in passenger service. On April 18, 1907, Telephone No. 3 was approved by steamboat inspectors Capt E.S. Edwards and Fuller to operate with the Regulator Line. The steamer, which had not turned its stern-wheel since October 1905, was scheduled to make an initial trip on April 20, 1907, carrying no passengers. Repairs to the steering gear were necessary. The boat had been converted to coal-firing rather than wood by the installation of new grates. On April 26, 1907, Telephone No. 3 left on its first regular run to the Dalles. Captain Fred H. Sherman was in command. The Regulator Line intended to run the boat to the Dalles three times a week until Bailey Gatzert could be rebuilt and brought into service. The Regulator Line’s lease on Telephone No. 3 ran for two and one-half months, with an option for an additional 15 days. Fare on Sunday excursions to Cascade Locks was $1.00, with meals costing 50 cents. On an excursion on Sunday, July 21, 1907 to Cascade Locks, Telephone carried its legal limit of 600 passengers,and one man was refused passage because the passenger limit had been reached. Replacement by Bailey Gatzert In late August, 1907, the reconstruction of the steamer Bailey Gatzert was almost complete. Bailey Gatzert was launched at 11:30 a.m. on August 24, 1907 from the yard of the Portland Shipbuilding Company in south Portland. Bailey Gatzert was to be the flagship of the Regulator Line and upon entry into service, it would replace Telephone. Telephone was scheduled to make its final trip to The Dalles for the Regulator Line on Monday, August 26, 1907. The crew of Telephone was scheduled to be transferred over to the Bailey Gatzert on Wednesday, August 30, 1907. There was one final race downriver on the Willamette on August 26, 1907 between Telephone and Telegraph. The race began once both steamers had passed the harbor limits, with both boats running side by side at speeds exceeding 20 miles per hour. By the time that the Columbia was reached, Telephone had a lead of several boat lengths over Telegraph, and had lashed a broom, the traditional symbol of victory in a steamboat race, to its jackstaff. After being replaced, Telephone was tied up to a dock at the foot of Morrison Street on the west side of the Willamette River. The river at this point was reported to be particularly polluted, with Telephone being blamed as the main culprit for dumping \\"decaying vegetables, boxes containing maggot-infested corn, and other polluting debris\\". All of this was alleged in one newspaper report to be the cause of an excessive number of disease-infected rats in the area of the Portland waterfront. As of early February 1909, Telephone had been out of service for over a year. There were rumors that Telephone might have been sold, or possibly placed on the run to The Dalles, but the steamer’s owner was unwilling or unable to confirm any of them. Telephone remained tied up at a location in the Willamette River known as the Victoria dolphins through June 1909. Transfer to California In 1909 Telephone was sold to be taken to San Francisco Bay for service as a ferry. On July 14, 1909, representatives of the Western Pacific Railroad put down some earnest money on the Telephone, with the deal anticipated to close the following day. The purchase price was $24,500. The new owner intended to use the boat on San Francisco Bay to carry construction material and for transfer work. Although the boat was reputed to be in first class condition, it had only been worked for a few months in 1905 and 1907 since it had been constructed in 1903. At 9:00 a.m. on Tuesday, August 3, 1909, Telephone left Portland under its own steam for the last time, bound for Astoria. The steamer reached Astoria at 2:30 p.m. the same day, and was scheduled to depart the following morning for San Francisco in the company of the steam schooner Yosemite. Telephone was expected to make the entire trip under its own power, but as riverine vessel and not having been built for operation on the open sea, if heavy weather were encountered or an engine failure should occur, Yosemite would be able render assistance. Telephone and Yosemite were reported to have passed Point Reyes, near San Francisco, on August 6, 1909, at 2:00 p.m. In September 1909, Telephone was at the shipyard of Moore & Scott, where it was undergoing modifications for ferry work. These changes included being fitted with an oil-burning power plant and extensive adaptations for ferry work. Upon completion, Telephone was expected to run between the Mission Street slip in San Francisco and the Oakland slip in half the time of the Western Pacific’s speediest ferries then in service. In the summer of 1910, Telephone was tied up and out of service for some months before being taken out of the water at the drydock at the Union Iron Works to be painted and have its hull scraped before being returned to service. In May 1911, it was announced that Telephone would be running as freight steamer between San Francisco and Vallejo, California, making a connection with an electric rail line, the Vallejo & Northern, to be built between Vallejo and Sacramento. Disposition In January 1918, the machinery of the Telephone was purchased by the Port of Portland to be shipped back to Portland and installed into a new sternwheeler to be built in Portland for the port. The new vessel was the stern-wheel towboat Portland, completed in 1919. (This is not the same vessel as the existing sternwheeler Portland.) Legacy In August 1922, George McCord announced that he would be building a twin-propeller gasoline launch 60 feet long named Camilla, with a beam of 10.7 feet. McCord stated that the design of Camilla, which would carry 50 people, was based on the lines of Telephone.

It is written by Nic Pizzolatto (under the pseudonym Jim Hammett) and based on his novel of the same name. It follows a dying hitman (Ben Foster), who escapes a set up and heads to the titular town to plan his revenge, taking a young girl who was kidnapped by his boss (Elle Fanning). The film had its world premiere at South by Southwest on March 10, 2018. It was released on October 19, 2018 by RLJE Films. Plot New Orleans, 1988. Roy, a hitman, is diagnosed with terminal lung cancer and storms out of his doctor's office. Roy returns to his hometown of Galveston after a sting is turned against him where he plans his revenge. Roy is a heavy-drinking criminal enforcer and mob hit man whose boss set him up in a double-cross scheme. After killing his would-be assassins before they could kill him, Roy discovers Rocky, a young escort being held captive and reluctantly takes her with him on his escape. On the ride to his hometown she tells him she thought it was a legitimate business because she found it in the yellow pages and had no idea how it really was. Rocky asks him to stop because she says she can get money owed to her. Roy, sitting in the car hears a gun shot, and Rocky and a 3 1/2 year old girl, Tiffany, return to the car. Rocky says she fired a shot at the wall and didn't hurt anyone. Roy later finds out that Rocky shot and killed her stepdad. After Roy leaves for a few days and reconciles with an ex from the past he returned to find out Rocky's real story, and that she (thinking he left for good) is escorting again. He then finds out Tiffany, who she claimed was her sister, is really her daughter, by her stepdad in rape. He finally understood why she picked her up saying she could take care of her better even though they had people chasing them. Roy calls his old boss to blackmail him with incriminating documents found during the failed sting, demanding $75,000 to stay silent. Determined to find safety and sanctuary in Galveston, he tells Rocky that he will give her the money and convinces her to go to school and become something. Just as Roy and Rocky finally start recognizing their feelings for one another on a date at a local bar, they are captured by a crew belonging to Roy's old boss. They are separated, and Roy is severely beaten. After awhile, a woman from his past finds him and frees him, telling him to flee before someone finds him. He looks for Rocky to find her dead in another room from a brutal beating and gang rape. Roy escapes the compound, killing a bodyguard outside and taking his car and gun. He is emotionally distraught as he leaves, and is involved in a car accident. He wakes in a hospital where a nurse says he has Aspergillosis, not cancer, and his condition is treatable by the state. He is then in jail on multiple charges including a warrant. He is then seen talking to his old boss' lawyer where they imply they know where the little girl lives and will kill her and the motel staff if he gives out his old boss' name. Because of his love for Rocky and the child, he stays silent until 20 years later when he is out of prison and still living in Galveston. Tiffany, now an adult, shows up at his door as the town is preparing for Hurricane Ike. He tells her he will tell her the truth then he wants her to leave for her safety. He tells her that her so called sister was her mother and she was not abandoned, giving her much needed closure. Roy is then seen as he is walking toward the beach as he experiences flashbacks of Rocky on the beach.

She was arrested in 2017 for insulting the Ugandan president. Education Stella Nyanzi received her Bachelor of Arts in Mass Communication and Literature at Makerere University where she studied from 1993 to 1996. She received her Master of Science in Medical Anthropology at University College London, where she studied from 1999 to 2000. She received her PhD in Anthropology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, where she studied social anthropology, sexuality, and youth and health policy from 2003 to 2008. She has conducted research on youth sexuality in Uganda, and also in The Gambia in 2005. Career Stella Nyanzi began her career in 1997 as a Social Science Research Associate at the Medical Research Council (UK) Programme in Uganda ,where she worked until September 2002. She then received a new position working as Local Anthropologist at the Medical Research Council Laboratories, The Gambia, where she worked for one year. She left that position to pursue her PhD in London. In 2009, Stella Nyanzi began at Makerere University as a Researcher at the Law, Gender & Sexuality Research Project, as a member of the Faculty of Law, where she worked until December 2013. She then worked as a Research Fellow at the Makerere Institute of Social Research until 2016. While there, she was asked to lecture in the new PhD programme, called the Mamdani PHD Project, but declined. Her office was closed and, in an example of the West African feminist cultural practice of what the scholar Naminata Diabate has called \\"naked agency,\\" made a nude protest against her boss. After her arrest in 2017, she was suspended from Makerere University. She appealed the decision with Makerere University's appeal tribunal, which directed that she be reinstated, promoted to the level of a research fellow with immediate effect, and paid back wages. The university refused to abide by its tribunal's decision. So, she filed a lawsuit against the university requesting reinstatement and back wages. In response, in December 2018, the university dismissed her, along with 45 other academics, arguing that her contract expired. Stella Nyanzi has also done consultation work for various social research organizations outside of Uganda and The Gambia.  Research  Stella Nyanzi is a well-cited scholar in her fields, with 54 articles and 1,432 citations by the end of 2018. Among her most cited articles are those on Ugandan youth's negotiations of sexual relationships, attitudes towards HIV testing among pregnant Ugandan women, Ugandan women's control over sexual encounters, Ugandan men's attitudes towards contraceptive use, and the sexual behavior of many groups. She is also one of the first scholars to publish research on African homosexuality. Activism Stella Nyanzi practices what scholars have called \\"radical rudeness,\\" which is a traditional Ugandan strategy of calling the powerful to account through public insult. It was developed during the colonial era, as \\"a rude, publicly celebrated strategy of insults, scandal mongering, disruption, and disorderliness that broke conventions of colonial friendship, partnership, and mutual benefit.\\"Summers, Carol. \\"Radical Rudeness: Ugandan Social Critiques in the 1940s.\\" Journal of Social History, vol. 39, no. 3, 2006, pp. 741–770. JSTOR, JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/3790288. She has campaigned for the rights of Ugandan women, youth, and LGBTQIA+ people. On 6 March 2017, Stella Nyanzi launched the Pads4girlsUg Project, due to her concerns about girls missing school because they could not afford menstrual products. She collected thousands of re-usable pads and distributed them to school girls and also offered lectures to school children about menstrual health.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlFzK179BGo Arrest In March 2017, Stella Nyanzi referred to the President Museveni as \\"a pair of buttocks.\\" On 7 April 2017, Stella Nyanzi was arrested and detained by police at Kiira Police Station on charges of cyber harassment and offensive communication. On 10 April 2017, she was thereafter produced in court, where she was charged with the misuse of a computer, cyber harassment, and abusing the president under section 24, and 25 of the Computer Misuse Act of 2011. She was then remanded to Luzira Prison. On 11 April 2017, doctors from Butabika Hospital were asked to carry out a psychiatric assessment examination to determine whether she was insane, as the government prosecutor was alleging. However, she resisted the examination and requested that her personal doctor and at least one family member should be present if they want to carry out a medical test on her. On 10 May 2017, she was released on a non cash 10 million Ugandan shillings (US$) bail. In October 2018, she was remanded to prison. She did not request bail because she believed she was safer in jail and because she wanted to continue her education work with the women in prison. In December 2018, her lawyer attacked the charges as unlawful. In January 2019, she asked that her court date be delayed as she was ill and had suffered a miscarriage in prison.  Reputation and reception  The international press has called her \\"one of Africa's most prominent gender rights activists,\\" \\"a leading scholar in the emerging field of African queer studies,\\" and a leader in the fight against \\"repressive anti-queer laws\\" and for \\"freedom of speech.\\" Her scholarship has provided \\"insight into the effects of patriarchy, misogyny and homophobia in Uganda, The Gambia, and Tanzania.\\" Some consider her arrest as having more to do with her status as a gay ally than other factors. An international outcry followed Stella Nyanzi's arrest, with human rights groups condemning the act as a violation of academic freedom and freedom of expression. Amnesty International called for Uganda to drop the \\"absurd charges\\" against her. Pen International, the writer's organization, also condemned her arrest. Human Rights Watch condemned her arrest as \\"an indicator that those who express critical views of the Ugandan government, especially the first family, can face its wrath.\\" International news agencies have reported on the reasons for her arrest as political. NPR reported that her arrest was for giving hope \\"that the powerless can take on the powerful.\\" The Washington Post reported that her arrest was for being an \\"outspoken anti-Museveni activist.\\"Max Bearak, 12 April 2017, \\"This professor called her president ‘a pair of buttocks.’ Now she’s in a maximum security prison.\\" The Washington Post. Al Jezeera English reported that her arrest was due to Museveni's plans to rule for life and his intolerance of critics. The Canadian Globe and Mail reported that her arrest was \\"at the heart of it all it [about] her imaginative use of language and her fierce defiance of the perceived limits for Ugandan women.\\" The Guardian reported that her \\"attack on her government’s refusal to fund sanitary wear for girls led to a successful crowdfunding campaign, and prison.\\" In Uganda, she has a large number of supporters, with the largest social media following of any Ugandan. Many collected food for her in prison. Ugandan scholars have praised her as standing up against \\"our tormentors.\\" Her lawyer Isaac Kimaze Semakadde was named \\"most outstanding public interest litigation lawyer in Uganda\\" by the Uganda Law Society, in part for his work on this case. In Uganda, \\"strong cultural taboos against talking openly and graphically about sex and sexuality\\" exist and \\"homosexuality is illegal and sex education is banned in schools.\\" However, Nyanzi speaks \\"openly - and colourfully - about sex, genitalia and politics. For this, she is adored by many of her fellow citizens but viewed with distaste by some of Uganda's more conservative elements.\\" See also * Education in Uganda *LGBT Rights in Uganda *Lwengo District *Mahmood Mamdani *Sarah Ssali References  External Links  * Makerere Institute of Social Research (MISR) Category:Living people Category:Makerere University academics Category:Ugandan academics Category:People from Masaka District Category:Makerere University alumni Category:1974 births Category:LGBT rights activists from Uganda Category:Medical anthropologists Category:Gender studies academics Category:Ugandan women academics Category:Ugandan women in politics Category:Queer feminists Category:Queer theorists Category:Feminist studies scholars Category:Women anthropologists Category:Women human rights defenders ","title":"Stella Nyanzi"},{"id":"54024562","text":"Antigona somwangi is a species of clam similar to the type specimen Antigona lamellaris, but the latter differs morphologically in terms of having somewhat pointed anterior and posterior ends, is smaller, is more boldly coloured (the exterior is more darkish and the interior in faded pinkish-orange) and the pallial sinus is relatively shorter about a quarter of shell length.

Francesc de Verntallat organized a small army of laborers from Pyrennean areas that assaulted the , where the Lord kept a remensa who didn't want to or couldn't afford. He later besieged the castle of Castellfullit for a similar cause. During the siege of Gerona, it was called by the Queen Juana Enríquez to help in the defense of the city, in which she and the Infante Fernando were blocked. Grateful for the performance of the remences, the Queen gave him the title of Captain Real. From that moment his fully identified with the men began to be known as Verntallats.

The war had ups and downs until finally on 28 October 1472, the troops of Juan II came to Barcelona, where it is signed the Capitulación de Pedralbes, which Catalonia retained its charters and privileges. The remences troops were organized in captaincies and subcapitanies, thus, of every three tenants, two farmed the land of the third, which was mobilized. This recruitment system lasted in the different guerrilla forces that have occurred in the country. As the Catalan site Editorial Base points out, Verntallat could potentially have been a Catalan Robin Hood.http://www.editorialbase.cat/llibres/108  Second Remensa War  When the second Remensa war broke out in 1484, Verntallat did not join the rebellion led by Pere Joan Sala, who had been his lieutenant during the first war, but remained on the sidelines, and headed the moderate sector of the Remensa movement. After the defeat of Joan Sala, the Lords were seen as winners of the war and were willing to maintain and even to accentuate the evil customs, but Verntallat was able to keep possession of his mountain castles and his forces. Íñigo López de Mendoza y Quiñones, the Count of Tendilla, assigned by the King to the end of the war, sought out Verntallat as a representative of the peasants for the agreement of the Sentencia de Guadalupe. Once the principal demands of the remences was achieved, Verntallat remained for a time at the Court of the Catholic Monarchs (Reyes Católicos) until he returned to his castle of San Feliu de Pallarols, where he died at the end of the century.

While acknowledging Past Tense as having \\"some interesting thinking\\" in it, he wrote that this \\"was tossed aside\\" in favor of a basic romcom setup. Past Tense's direction is described by Dy as being bouncy which he says gives energy to the film and acknowledges that the cast gave everything they got. However he describes the core of the film as not very interesting and ugly. He says that film is filled with characters that aren't really worthy rooting for. He says that the characters just do and say terrible things to one another. Dy adds the happiness attained by the characters are the film was earned by the characters who did nothing to earn it although he perceives that the film \\"convinces\\" the audience that this happiness means \\"something\\".https://www.clickthecity.com/movies/a/24325/movie-review-past- tense-is-a-little-icky Oggs Cruz of Rappler wrote that Past Tense was not lacking in ambition but it did waste its ambition.

He is considered as founder of Macedonian basketball, who had a huge role in the exit of Macedonian basketball clubs in Europe in the 70's and 80's. Lecic is also responsible for founding and organizing the youth basketball schools in both Macedonia and Greece. In his lifelong odyssey he has won many prestigious awards such as \\"Giant\\" of the Macedonian Olympic Committee (2002), \\"Giant\\" of the Basketball Federation of Macedonia, \\"11th of October, 13th of November, 8th of September , Zlatna Bubamara among many others. Professional career Lazar Lecic started his professional career in Rabotnički in 1957 and stayed in the club with the player status until 1962 before moving to the coaching position. As a player he won 2 Macedonian Republic League titles in 1960 and 1961. However, his true impact in basketball was jet to begin. In 1962 he sat on the coaching position in Rabotnicki and immediately made an impact. As a dominating force in Macedonia under the wings of Lecic, Rabotnicki won the following two titles in 1963 and 1964, and the team moved to First Federal Basketball League. Lecic stayed in Skopje until 1972 before moving on for another adventure in Borac Cacak for the 1972/73 season when the team finished 4th in Yugoslav First Basketball League as the club's biggest achievement in history. For the next season he moved to Slovenia and Olimpija Ljubljana, before taking on another adventure in Rabotnicki. This time leading the club from Skopje to the semifinals of the FIBA Saporta Cup that is still one of the biggest successes in the team history. In 1978 Lecic moved back to Olimpija Ljubljana where he stayed until 1982. After a season at Vojvodina Lecic was back at his home town, but this time at Skopje, later known as MZT Skopje. In 1986 by leadership of Lazar Lečić, MZT Skopje reached the Yugoslav First Basketball League where they competed for two seasons. In 1990 Lecic moved to Greece and Aris where he competed in the EuroLeague, reaching the Semifinals in 90/91 and Quarterfinals in 91/92. He also won the Greek League in 90/91 and Greek Cup in 91/92. After another season in MZT Skopje in 1996 when he won the Macedonian Cup and also made the Korać Cup R64, he temporarily resigned, but finished his wealthy career in Nikol Fert in the 1999/2000 season by winning the Macedonian League Championship. Lazar Lečić on a basketball court. Besides the club career, Lazar Lecic had an amazing national career as a coach in the Yugoslav National Team. He was an assistant coach in the Yugoslav team first golden medal in 1970 FIBA World Championship held in Yugoslavia. He also had an impact in the dominating years when Yugoslavia won medals in several competitions such as FIBA Eurobasket, Mediterranean Games and Balkanian Championships among others. He was also led Yugoslavia in the European Youth Basketball Championship in 1971. Personal life Lecic was born on 30 January 1939 in Skopje. His father name was Petar, while his mother name was Aleksandra. He finished Middle school and High school in Skopje, while he gained his Higher education in Belgrade 1963. He is considered an excellent trainer, a teacher who has a fantastic personality. Lecic or as his known by his nickname \\"Grk\\" was a trainer-charmer, always ready for a good joke, making positive atmosphere in the gym and outside of it. He was very strict in the training sessions, he did not give in to anyone, but not many people know basketball as he does. Many people did not take him seriously because of his, at first glance, innocence, irresistible charm, temperament and intrigue, but his impact, firstly on Macedonian basketball says all. He is responsible for the making of numerous basketball players who later led Macedonian basketball. Lekic is known for his cocky moves that will be spoken throughout Europe for ages. Here are some of them: Mustaches In the 1975/76 season Rabotnicki played in the European Cup Winners Cup quarterfinals against French side ASPO Turs. In the first game played in France on 7 January 1976, Rabotnicki were down 53-38 by the first half and even worse for Lekic was the fact that Rabotnicki's only true center Dragan Radosavljevic already had 4 fouls. The half ended so in the locker room Lekic had one of his \\"ingenious\\" ideas. He ordered the team's masseur to immediately shave Radosavljevic's mustache and then asked that Radosavljevic, who otherwise carried a jersey with number 14, replaced the jersey with Nikiforovic who was wearing the number 4 jersey! In fact, Radosavljevic appeared in the \\"new edition\\" and without any personal fouls on the field, but this trickery, at first glance, did not helped, the home team won 99-83. The story, however, continues... Lecic then explained to Nikiforovoć that he will start the second half, that he is now Radosavljevic and that he starts the game with 4 personal fouls. At the beginning of the second half of the match, \\"Radosavljevic\\" pushed the opponent in the tip-off and got a personal fouls, according to the record - the fifth! The problem arose when real Nikiforovic \\"forgot\\" that he had 4 personal fouls, so when he started to explain to the referee that this was his first foul... \\"I barely took his out of the field. He almost ruined everything for me\\" - later explained Lecic. However, Lecic's trick did produce the result: Rabotnicki compensated for a deficit of 16 points, won 107-90 in Skopje and went to the semifinals in which he was eliminated from Olympia Milano. The Poodle and the Shepherd Dog At the same game against ASPO Turs behind the Rabotnicki bench there was an elegant lady who held a poodle in her hands. The dog misbehaved in moments so it would jump off the lady's hands and bark around Lecic's legs. Since the oral warnings did not help, the next time the dog jump down at Lecic's hands he grabbed him roughly by his neck and placed it in the arms of the lady. The poodle managed to escape again so this time anxious Lečić grabbed the poodle and threw the dog in the stands. It turned out that the poodle fell at the hands of Yugoslav sailors so within 10 seconds they threw the poodle back like it was a ping-pong ball! \\"I barely got out of the arrest, you know how the French are when the animals are in question. In addition, the lady was the wife of the president of a local club. Somehow I got out of it, but I promised them that they would see in Skopje what the dog was\\" - said Lecic. For the reverse game in Skopje, Lecic also \\"trained\\" a Shepherd Dog, who, as he say, looked like a bear. He dog behaved on the training sessions, but no one knew how would the dog react in a hall with 3,000 loud fans, especially because the atmosphere was \\"heated up\\" before the game with news of the mistreatment in France and referee theft in Tours. That's why there was an injection ready for the dog that would calm him down if it was too sloppy. As the game started the dog got nervous and instead of \\"scaring the French\\" it barked at everyone so he had to be taken off the gym, but the injection stayed inside... \\"We were after 17 point difference and at the half it was 62-48 on our favor. Everything was saying we would succeed, but in the second half the visiting coach began to put pressure on the referee and the record table. Everything was bothering him, he complained about everything... I remembered those injections and organized, so the next time he passes by the record table, someone sting him by the butt a little. That's how it was. For minutes before the end he dosed off on the bench and we won 107-90, just as it was supposed to be. Later on ASPO Turs complained to whoever not, but Bora Stankovic of FIBA replied that they should be better off because if he repeats the match \\"Laza will come up with something else\\" - added Lecic. Man-to-man defense on the referee! In a packed \\"Tivoli\\" arena in Ljubljana, Rabotnicki faced Olimpija on the road. The home team is leading the game so Lazar Lecic calls a timeout. After the timeout one of Rabotnicki's players starts playing man-to-man defense on referee Dragaš Jakšić! The well-experienced ref goes to Lecic and asks him \\"Laza what is your player doing?\\" Lecic turns around and responds: \\"I told him to stay with you since I realized you are their best player.

He had been commissioned as a Lieutenant in the Indian Army from the Indian Military Academy, Dehradun on December 10, 2016 and was serving in the 2nd battalion, Rajputana Rifles. Early life Ummer Fayaz was born in Kulgam, Jammu & Kashmir, India in 1994, and studied at Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya,Anantnag and the National Defence Academy. He faced several difficulties while in training as people in his home were not supportive of his decision to join the Indian Army. However, Fayaz was determined to join, as he used to say \\"I will change my Kashmir, I will make it heaven on earth again\\".  Abduction and killing  At the time of Fayaz's abduction he was on leave from duty and was also unarmed. He had come to his uncle's house in Shopian district, Jammu and Kashmir to attend a marriage ceremony in his family. On the night of 9 May 2017 he was abducted from his uncle's house. Militants shot him twice, and his dead body was found the next morning.  Aftermath  He is survived by his father, who is a farmer, his mother and two sisters. He was given a guard of honour and the funeral was attended by 400 people. His murder was extensively criticized on social media. A candle march in his memory was also organised at India Gate, Delhi on an evening in May 2017, which attracted enormous support and publicity. All the militants who were responsible for his murder were killed in security operations on 31 March and 1 April 2018 by Rashtriya Rifles units. Jammu & Kashmir Police stated that militant Abbas Bhat, who was wanted in connection with Fayaz's abduction and murder, was among the militants killed in Operation Batagund on 25 November 2018.

The song tells a story of a man named Balikoowa. The lyrics of the song portray Balikoowa's first time in the city, how he could not fit in. He sees many vehicles and he was almost knocked by a speeding motor bike. Balikoowa is so primitive and he has to face the city. Reception Balikoowa received favourable reception mostly around the Buganda area because of its traditional kiganda sound. It has been played at parties and clubs with audiences getting to their feet to dance the traditional kiganda dance. This song has always closed the duos repertoires since its release.

As with many of her class, the ship was never named. Instead, she was referred to by her hull designation. Construction LST-422 was laid down on 12 November 1942, under Maritime Commission (MARCOM) contract, MC hull 942, by the Bethlehem-Fairfield Shipyard, Baltimore, Maryland; launched 10 December 1942; then transferred to the United Kingdom and commissioned on 4 February 1943. Service history LST-422 saw no active service in the United States Navy. The tank landing ship was lost in action while in Royal Navy service 26 January 1944, when she struck a mine off Anzio, Italy. LST-422 was carrying the C and D Companies, and the Headquarters of the US Army's 83rd Chemical Battalion, Motorized and also members of the 68th Coast Guard Artillery Battalion,DPaa at the time. She had departed Naples, along with 12 other LSTs, the night of 25 January 1944, with a capacity load of trucks, most likely GMC 2½-ton trucks, jeeps, M3 Half-track, ambulances, and other vehicles. In addition, she was carrying steel barrels of gasoline on her deck, along with a variety of ammunition. The 83rd utilized mortars firing either white phosphorus, smoke, gas, or high explosive shells. LST-422 had arrived off of Anzio, around 01:00, after sailing through deteriorating weather and high, gale force, winds, and set anchor. With waves at and continued gale force winds, the LST was blown into a known mine field located around offshore. At 05:20 an explosion ripped open a hole in the bottom starboard side of the ship, between the main and auxiliary engine rooms, which immediately ignited the ship's fuel oil supply. The tank deck was the first to flood, with most of the men of the 83rd asleep on this deck over 400 men were unable to escape. The vehicles on the tank deck, which were fueled and loaded with ammunition, began to explode, which in turn ignited the gasoline that had been stored on the top deck. With all power lost, it was impossible to contact the engine room and with the fires it was impossible to reach the mess deck where the fire fighting suits and helmets were stored. The auxiliary fire foam motor had been damaged by flying shrapnel and could not be started. The order was given for the US Army personnel to abandon ship, however, only four life rafts were undamaged, so any floatable loose materials were thrown overboard to assist men that were already in the water. came to assist but many of the men who had jumped into the frigid waters perished before being rescued. also tried to assist LST-422, but struck a mine herself and sunk with a loss of 30 of her crew. Soon the minesweepers and , along with , , , and other YMS craft joined in the rescue and were able to pull 150 survivors from LST-422 and LCI-32 from the storm tossed waters. Lieutenant Commander Braodhurst, along with eight of his crew, finally abandoned ship at about 06:00. At 14:30 LST-422 broke in two and sank. She was struck from the Navy list on 16 May 1944.

Schmid graduated with a diploma in 1997. He received the first engagement at Theater an der Wien. There he was on stage at Anatevka in 1997, before he took over the cover of the Rudolf in Elisabeth. Since 1998, the artist also inspired audiences in Germany with \\"Joseph\\" in Essen and as the first member of the \\"Alfred\\" at \\"Tanz der Vampire\\" in Stuttgart. Schmid was one of the premier cast of the German premiere of \\"Mozart - das Musical!\\" in Hamburg. Under the direction of Harry Kupfer he played the leading role in the New Flora: \\"Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart\\". The favorite artist likes to spend his spare time with music, painting and sport (golf, tennis, climbing...). Since 10 September 2004, Schmid has been on the stage again as Rudolf in the Theater an der Wien. In the summer of 2005, Schmid taught elocution and singing in Vienna, and in the summer of 2005, he directed his first production in the production of Broadway Connection's first show school \\"Cindy's Dream\\", which premiered at the Theater Akzent in Vienna. In addition to his role as Rudolf, Schmid as a soloist takes part in a musical gala. In 2005, Schmid was a member of the ensemble of a world performance at REBECCA in Vienna, directed by Francesca Zambello. He was one of the swings and the second occupation of “BEN”. At the beginning of the year 2006, he started again working with Broadway Company Artistic Team as the director of “Akida”. Later in the summer, he gave professional coaching in acting and singing for the major musical project \\"Les Miserables\\" in Vienna. Then in 2008, he joined the musical “Rudolf” in Raimund Theater as a swing for Szeps and Clemenceau, which was under the direction by David Leveaux. In 2011, the joint production musical “Am Musikum” in Salzburg, directed by Stephan Höllwerth, gained his professional support.

Noah Kross is an agent of the Humanity Bureau who manages the deportation of Chester Hill, a former governor of Colorado, who now lives in misery. When asked why he wishes to stay in squalor rather than be relocated to New Eden, he says he knows \\"the truth\\". Kross kills him in self-defense. Kross evaluates a single mother, Rachel Weller, and her son, Lucas. Though apparently struggling, they wish to stay rather than go to New Eden. He delays sending in his report so the boy can perform at a musical recital the following day; Kross fondly remembers fishing in Canada as a boy and wants Lucas to have a positive memory of his recital. This act of minor insubordination upsets the Bureau and catches the attention of Kross’s supervisor Adam, who places him under investigation. Rachel's resistance to relocation and the \\"truth\\" purported by Chester motivate Kross to investigate New Eden. A defense contractor working for the bureau gives Kross a memory card. The next day, Kross attends Lucas' recital and spends the night with them. When he wakes up the next morning, he sees the Bureau coming and rushes inside to get Rachel and Lucas. Rachel is being held hostage by Adam. Lucas shoots Adam in the eye with a BB gun and they escape. They drive to a gas station, where the owner assists in their flight by crashing his truck into the Bureau vehicles pursuing Kross. When asked by the owner if Kross is a family man, he says he is \\"trying to be\\". Back at the Bureau, Adam is admonished for failing to stop Kross. The Bureau's director opens a package of what looks like dust in front of him and shows Adam a child's tooth, warning him that if he fails again, he will end up in New Eden, revealed to be an extermination camp where unproductive citizens are incinerated. Kross has learned the truth and seeks to save Lucas and Rachel. During their flight, Kross trades his Bureau vehicle for an unmarked station wagon and learns of a man who may know a way north. When they find the man, they learn that the way north to Canada is highly irradiated and that no one who ever goes returns. When he insists, the man gives Kross a Geiger counter, a device which measures radiation, and iodine tablets which absorb radiation. Kross gives Lucas a rabbit's foot for good luck during the trip. Along the road, they spot a drone searching for Kross. After becoming tired and frustrated waiting for it to pass, Kross and Rachel get into an argument where Kross reveals that he knows the real Rachel Weller, and this woman is not her. Years ago on a Bureau investigation, Kross and the real Rachel conceived a child, who is Lucas. When the famine struck, Rachel tried to sell Lucas. Amanda, her neighbor, got into an argument over this and the resulting fight ended in Rachel's death. Amanda then assumed Rachel's identity and raised Lucas as her own. The three continue to evade the Bureau and eventually make it to a nuclear power plant, which the man warned them was highly irradiated. Their Geiger counter reveals that there is not any radiation; it was a scare tactic to try to keep people from fleeing north. Finally at the border the Bureau catches up with Kross, and Adam shoots Rachel, demanding the memory card. Noah agrees to give Adam the card so long as Lucas can go. Lucas runs away and Noah gives Adam the card, which Adam scans to find out is empty. Adam shoots Noah and Lucas comes running back. At this moment, Canadian troopers shoot the Bureau members and take in Lucas. They find that the real memory card was in the rabbit's foot and disseminate the footage revealing New Eden as a death camp, sparking a revolution against the Bureau. Lucas finally gets to visit the lake Kross used to fish in.

The player plays as the vampire huntress Rusty who investigates the disappearance of a number of women, and travels through ten stages, fighting skeletons, monsters and boss characters with her whip and items. Critics and journalists frequently compared the game to the Castlevania series, some calling it a \\"clone\\", but still reviewed it favourably; one called it a gem that everyone should play, and one called it among the best game of all Castlevania clones. Although it was not published in English, it was unofficially translated by a ROM hacking group in 2017. Gameplay The player uses their whip to attack enemies, and the large bosses that are encountered in each stage. Here, the player battles the Bungee Demon boss of stage 3, which is the manor house. Rusty is a side- scrolling action game in which the player takes the role of Rustea \\"Rusty\\" Sprincul, a vampire huntress who together with her owl companion investigates a case of women who have disappeared from various villages in the countryside. The player fights against enemies such as skeletons, zombies, and many other monsters, as well as the large boss characters by using the player character's whip and items they find in the stages; additionally, the player's owl companion helps the player by attacking enemies for them. By jumping and attacking at the same time, the player can use the Mind Slasher - which is a \\"power crash\\" move that differs depending on what power-up they are currently using; these moves include slowing down time, shooting exploding energy balls, or becoming temporarily invulnerable. In addition to its use as a weapon, the player can also use the whip to swing from golden rings found in some of the stages. The game consists of ten stages, of which eight are based around finding keys to unlock doors; the seventh stage involves quickly making one's way through the area, and the tenth is a boss-only stage. Stage designs are non-linear, with paths that loop around, and alternative routes with hidden rewards for the player to find. However, in contrast to the game's stage design, a timer is included. The stages include a village, a graveyard, a manor, a cathedral tower, a cavern, a water-filled labyrinth, a courtyard, a clocktower, and Bloodsoon Castle - itself divided into several stages. Every stage ends with a fight against one of the bosses. Plot Many women have been abducted from various villages throughout a European countryside, and have been transformed by demon possession into hideous monsters, who are known as the Eight Fiends. Responsible for performing the sacrilegious act is Bloody Mary, a vampiress who is Queen of Bloodthorne Castle. Assisting her is a mysterious masked hunter named Gateau. Along with creating monsters, the two are also using the blood of women to resurrect the ancient vampire Monte Carlo, the Master of Bloodsoon Castle who has been deceased for 300 years. Being implored by the townspeople and the village elder, Rusty Springcul sets out to rescue the girls, and vanquish the evil terrifying the land. Development and release The game was developed and released by C-Lab in July 1993 in Japan for PC-98, Epson PC, and MS-DOS. It was produced by Masayoshi Koyama and directed, programmed and written by Naoto Niida, and features music by Masahiro Kajihara, Kenichi Arakawa, and Ryu Takami. It was never released officially in English, but received an unofficial English translation patch in 2017, 24 years after its original release; the English version was developed by the ROM hacking group 46 OkuMen, who had formed to translate the game 46 Okunen Monogatari: The Shinkaron and then gone on to translate other Japanese games. Kotaku was impressed with the efforts to translate the game, and noted that it was unusual for games more than 20 years old to get translations. Reception The game was frequently compared to Konami's Castlevania series, to the point where authors John Edgar Browning and Caroline Joan S. Picart wrote in their book Dracula in Visual Media that they think it is possible that there were connections to Konami during Rusty development, but that it for some reason was not released as a Castlevania game. They also noted that the Castlevania title they thought it resembled the most – Rondo of Blood – was released three months after Rusty. John Szczepaniak, writing for Hardcore Gaming 101, said that despite several similarities, no connections between Konami and C-Lab had been proven, and considered it more of an homage with high production values than a cash-in. Szczepaniak called the game a \\"hidden gem\\" that everyone should try, particularly fans of the Castlevania series. He praised its level design for using a structure where the level doubles back on itself, thus eliminating the feeling of backtracking and giving the game a sense of exploration in contrast to the linearity of the early Castlevania games. He noted that the game did not play well with a computer keyboard, recommending players to use a controller instead. Fabio D'Anna of GamesVillage.it called the game one of the best Castlevania clones, but questioned Rusty's character design, saying that she looked more like someone from a Japanese BDSM circle than a vampire hunter. Szczepaniak, while describing Rusty as a dominatrix archetype, did however say that the difference between her and Castlevania protagonists is that she is a \\"strong-willed sexy woman in tight leather\\" compared to Castlevania \\"strong-willed muscle man in tight leather\\". He liked the enemy characters, calling them original and quirky, citing examples such as the spike beetle enemies and the naked, dragon-riding demon woman boss. He said that the visuals for the enemies and environments were well constructed despite the PC-98's graphical limitations, including good use of dithering to counteract the system's 16-color palette. He also liked the game's music, calling it consistently good and worthy of standing alongside Castlevania, with each stage having its own theme that makes the player excited.

It stars Aubrey Plaza, Emile Hirsch, Jemaine Clement, Matt Berry, and Craig Robinson. It had its world premiere at the Sundance Film Festival on January 20, 2018. It was released in the United States on October 19, 2018, by Universal Pictures, before being released in the United Kingdom on October 23, 2018, by Picturehouse Entertainment. Plot Lulu Danger is a waitress in a coffee shop managed by her husband, Shane, in a small town in the early 1990s. One evening while watching television, Lulu sees an advertisement for a mysterious, upcoming live show to be held at the town's hotel called “An Evening with Beverly Luff Linn; For One Magical Night Only.” Lulu recognizes Beverly from a series of photos she keeps hidden in a dresser drawer and becomes excited. Meanwhile, Shane becomes incensed when he learns that Lulu's brother, Adjay, has more money than him and that he keeps his life's savings in a lockbox at the spice store he owns. With the help of his dimwitted employees, Carl and Tyrone, Shane steals the lockbox, though Adjay quickly recognizes Shane as the culprit. Later, at the laundromat, decrying his situation, Adjay meets a drifter named Colin who offers to retrieve the lockbox in exchange for $200. Colin goes to the Danger household, where Lulu catches him snooping outside and mistakes him for a friend of Shane's. Colin pulls a gun on Shane and demands the lockbox, but, when he panics, Lulu takes charge of the situation, taking the gun from Colin, retrieving the lockbox, and forcing Colin to drive her to the hotel. Colin and Lulu check into the hotel, where they begin a bizarre flirtation characterized by Lulu making romantic overtures towards Colin before abruptly pulling back and Colin making awkward sexual advances on Lulu that he immediately regrets. Beverly checks into the hotel along with his sidekick, a Scottish man named Rodney. Beverly and Lulu immediately recognize one another, though Beverly—who appears to be subverbal and communicates only through a series of grunts— does not indicate this to Rodney, who harbors secret homosexual feelings for him. Behind Rodney's back, Beverly attempts to arrange a meeting with Lulu by sending a letter to her room, but Rodney intercepts it and drugs Beverly. When Lulu arrives to meet Beverly, she instead finds Rodney wearing synchronized swimming makeup; he tells her not to come between him and Beverly. On the night of the show, Beverly apparently falls ill and the event is postponed for 24 hours, only to become postponed for another day as Colin, Lulu, Beverly, and Rodney all jockey for one another's affections and Shane arrives at the hotel in search of the lockbox. The nature of the show remains elusive and guests speculate as to what it will entail. A despondent Colin has sex with a woman he meets in the hotel bar, only to learn that she's a prostitute. Later, he confesses the liaison to Lulu, who becomes upset. Colin further admits that he had been a virgin up until that point. Later, demanding to know the reason for Lulu's fixation on Beverly, she confesses that he was her poetry professor in college and that he left his wife for her; in the midst of their affair, he apparently drowned while the pair were on vacation, an event which emotionally destroyed her. Lulu, Colin, and other guests gather for the show, which turns out to be a simple musical revue in which Rodney and Beverly perform whimsical Scottish folk melodies. Beverly suddenly becomes articulate, singing in an incongruous alto and regaling the audience with stories of his time visiting Scotland. Addressing Lulu, he gives a heartfelt speech about the nature of lost love, apologizing for breaking her heart and telling Rodney that, while he loves him as a friend, he has no romantic feelings for him. The event ends when Shane and Carl crash the show while Lawrence steals the lockbox from Colin's room. A fight erupts between Colin, Shane, Carl, and hotel security. Following Beverly to his room, Lulu demands to know why Beverly faked his death. Beverly confesses that the decision was impulsive and that he didn't really have a reason; he further admits everything he says onstage is similarly impulsive and that he's unsure he meant anything he said. A heartbroken Lulu leaves. Lulu and Colin meet in the hotel bar, where Lulu tries to make amends for her treatment of him. When F.R. David's \\"Words\\" begins to play—a song neither have heard before—Lulu invites Colin onto the dance floor and the pair share an exuberant dance that ends with her jumping into his arms. Later they return to their room to have sex, but Lulu falls asleep while Colin undresses. As Colin gets into bed, Lulu wakes up and the pair tell each other “I love you.” Cast * Aubrey Plaza as Lulu Danger * Emile Hirsch as Shane Danger * Jemaine Clement as Colin Keith Threadener * Matt Berry as Rodney Von Donkensteiger * Craig Robinson as Beverly Luff Linn * Zachary Cherry as Tyrone Paris * Sky Elobar as Carl Ronk * Jacob Wysocki as Lawrence Doggi * Sam Dissanayake as Adjay Willis * Maria Bamford as The Elegant Woman * John Kerry as Kennedy Gordon * Russ Burd as Barry Ofeld * Carl Solomon as DJ Valerie Grillz * Bettina Devin as Paulette * Bruce J.

It aired on May 11, 2017 on ABC in the United States. The episode was written by William Harper and directed by Kevin McKidd. In the episode Owen Hunt (McKidd) is informed about the fate of his sister, Megan, who's Nathan Riggs' fiancée and had been MIA. Alex Karev (Justin Chambers) discovers the identity of Jo Wilson's (Camilla Luddington) abusive ex-husband, meanwhile the Grey Sloan Memorial's doctors treat a couple from a car accident, only to later discover their true identities as a rapist and his victim. \\"True Colors\\" was conceived as a vehicle to set up the eventual exit of series regular Jerrika Hinton in the season finale. Upon release it garnered mostly positive reviews, with critics highlighting the performances of the cast, McKidd and Hinton's in particular, as among their best. They were also appreciative of the tense writing, and McKidd's direction. Although the storyline focusing on Chambers' character drew mixed response. It garnered a total of 7.02 million viewers and a 1.8/7 score in the Nielsen ratings. Plot Dr. Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo) frantically wakes up in the morning with Nathan Riggs (Martin Henderson) at her side after a date night, and she asks him to leave so as not to be discovered by her three young children. Still struggling with the possibility of being in a relationship after her husband's death, she tells Riggs she is not ready for him to meet her kids. At the same time Owen Hunt (Kevin McKidd) gets visited by two army soldiers, who reveal information about his younger sister Megan, who many years previously had gone MIA in Iraq. Later in the day after seeing him interact with a young child, Nathan is invited by a nervous Meredith to meet her children, after being advised by her sister-in-law, Dr. Amelia Shepherd (Caterina Scorsone), to move on. Owen does not deal well with the news of his sister, having erratic behavior, hostile attitudes towards patients, and experiencing PTSD symptoms; Amelia notices it and confronts him. Owen reveals that Megan was found alive within a basement in a neighborhood held by rebels and she is now in an Army hospital in Germany, however Owen cannot bring himself to believe the news. Immediately, Amelia starts making calls to the hospital on Owen's behalf and eventually contacts Dr. Teddy Altman, who confirms that she had seen Megan. Amelia makes arrangements with Teddy to transfer Megan to Grey Sloan Memorial, and tells Meredith about the situation. Meredith knowing that Riggs and Megan had been previously engaged before she was declared missing in action, decides that she must go and tell him straight away as she would want to know as soon as possible if Derek were still alive. After throwing a tablet to a patient's father, who had refused to have his son's brain tumor treated on religious grounds, Stephanie Edwards (Jerrika Hinton) returns to work after attending mandated counseling sessions by Dr. Eliza Minnick (Marika Domińczyk), who was unaware of Edward's personal history of illness as a young child) who had become worried about Edward's behavior with patients. Edwards works with Jackson Avery (Jesse Williams) and Maggie Pierce (Kelly McCreary), attending an unconscious couple who had been found half naked and with severe injuries in a car at the bottom of a cliff. All doctors assume the two were romantically involved and had pulled over to have sex. The two patients Keith and Alisson are separated for treatment and wake up in different rooms. Keith, tells the doctors he is in love and worried about Alisson; then begs to Edwards to take him to see her. When the female patient, Alisson, gains consciousness with Jackson, Maggie, and Bailey, she becomes nervous and terrified, and asks the doctors if she killed Keith. When she becomes agitated at news of his survival, the doctors don't understand her until she explains Keith had held a knife to her, and forced her to go to drive to an isolated spot in the woods in her car, where he then raped her. She drove off of a cliff in an attempt to save herself from his attack and kill him. Upon discovering this, as well as the fact that Keith and Edwards were no where to be found, Bailey orders a lockdown on the hospital. Meanwhile, in Los Angeles, Dr. Alex Karev goes to a medical conference to meet with Dr. Paul Stadler (Matthew Morrison), who he reveals in a phone call at the beginning of the episode to Meredith that he is Jo's husband whom she has been hiding and running from. Alex fantasies about possible ways to confront the man who had abused and terrorized Jo (Camilla Luddington) into running away and going so far as changing her name to hide from him. In the first possibility Alex gets Stadler drunk and then when they are outside and alone Alex beats him up, but gets caught and winds up behind prison. In the second possibility Alex considers, he thinks about confronting Stadler backstage when he is about to give a speech, and Alex reveals himself as a friend of his missing wife, Brooke (Jo's real name). Alex then threatens Stadler and tells him to stay away from Brooke, he then returns to Seattle to discover Paul choking Jo to death, turning to Alex to say thank you for helping him find her. At the end of the night, Alex still unsure about what to do, that would not result in him ending up in prison, and Jo remaining hidden, he runs into Stadler when they both attempt to claim the same cab. After insisting and conceding the cab to Stadler, Alex watches him leave with a dark look in his eye, which is not missed by Stadler. After being informed about the lockdown, Keith holds a scalpel to Edward's neck and threatens her to take him to see Alisson. However, they both become trapped on an empty floor with Erin (a young girl who has been wandering the hospital unattended while her distracted parents were panicking and worrying about her younger baby sister who had almost choked to death on a penny). When Keith becomes frantic when Edwards informs him the lockdown will only stop in case of a major emergency, such as a fire; Keith attempts to trick the fire alarm system by lighting on fire a piece of cloth soaked with alcohol. As he tries to hold the lit piece of cloth up to the smoke alarm, Edwards notices and stares at the discarded scalpel he had held to her throat next to the bottle of alcohol he had used for his cloth on the floor. Edwards turns to the young girl beside her, and asks her to turn around and cover her eyes \\"like playing hide and seek\\", runs towards the bottle of alcohol, and drenches Keith with it. He catches fire instantly when a stray piece from the cloth, still on fire, lands on his arm, setting fire to him instantly. Edwards turns to run with Erin, but upon looking back, notices that Keith had collapsed beside the oxygen tanks. Edwards attempts to run and quickly to pull him away, but the tanks explode in front of her before she could reach him. The explosion is seen outside of the hospital by Meredith just as she arrives, looking for Riggs.

Its origins go back to the Middle Ages and its first known recipes are in the Manuscript of Sion, the oldest treatise of cooking written in French around the 13th century. Although almost the same word is used in both Dutch and French, it has nothing to do with Dutch hutspot which is a dish made from mashed potato and whose recipe is said to have been concocted during the siege of Leiden in 1574. Definition It is a Flemish stew made with oxtail, shoulder of mutton, salted bacon, and vegetables. The stewed vegetables are served whole, unlike the Dutch hutspot, in which they are served mashed. The hochepot was formerly a meal with meat, chestnuts and turnips cooked with stock in a clay pot. Nowadays, it is cooked with different kinds of meat: beef ribs, shoulder or neck of mutton, veal chest or veal collar, salted pork, pig's ears and pig's trotter and sausages. They simmer in a pot with winter vegetables: carrots, parsnips, onions, leeks, celery, potatoes and herbs. Origin and etymology It is an old recipe from the north of France and the emblematic dish of Flanders and the province of Hainaut. The etymology of the word comes from the old French \\"\\"hottison\\" which mean \\"shake\\" in English. The term also refers to a pot roast chicken with vegetables cooked with down pieces of beef. Historical background The oldest treatise of cooking in French is the Manuscript of Sion. It was written at the end of the 13th century. It was found in the Cantonal Library of Valais. It gives a recipe that says how to accommodate boar and deer meat which must be \\"Long boiled, larded lengthwise from within. Then cook in new water with mace and a lot of wine. Add a cameline sauce\\". If no vegetable to go with the dish is mentioned in the manuscript, it is not the same for the salted meat. To accommodate it, he advises: \\"Soak. Then wash very well. Throw out the first broth. Wash with clean water. Let cool. Then cut into thin slices. Bring to a boil with half water and half white wine. Then peel the chestnuts cooked on the coals. Place everything on a plate. Serve the game meat with the broth. Eat with some mustard \\". This kind of preparation is very close to the hochepot recipe of a manuscript of Ghent University Library dated to the late 15th or early 16th century. This recipe of hochepot with venison is called \\"Om hutspot te redenen van een hert\\". It looks like the medieval stew which contains onions and red wine. It is reported that besides venison, onions and red wine, you need verjuice, butter, sugar, nutmeg and cardamom. The hochepot was then just a kind of meat cooked in a liquid. It is the only similarity that allows to connect the medieval hochepots with the current Flemish hochepots. Le Viandier de Taillevent, the oldest manuscript of which was written in the 14th century, possesses only one hochepot recipe, with poultry. The oldest version remains the one in the Manuscript of Sion. This reads: \\"Hochepot de poullaile metez par membres surfrire en saing de lart prenez ung pou de pain brullé & des foyes deffais de vin & du boillon de beuf metez boulir vostre grain affinez gingembre canelle grene de paradis deffait de verjus et doit estre noiret & cler\\".Pierre Leclercq Le hochepot dans les livres de cuisine médiévaux, November 2010 Its modern editor affirms that \\"the different versions of the Viandier are rewritings and enlargements of the original version of the manuscript of Sion, prior to the presumed birth of Taillevent\\". The recipe for hochepot has changed with time and this recipe is quite unlike the hochepot recipe from Ghent. In the manuscript of Sion, it is a stew with \\"pieces of poultry fried with bacon. It is cooked then in a broth and thickened with some liver and toast. It is spiced with cinnamon and maniguette and then mixed with some verjuice to give it a clear appearance.\\" The hochepot in the Middle Ages and its wide diversity of recipes do not make it possible to give a more precise definition except to say that it is the ancestor of the current hochepot. Food / beer / wine pairings  Traditionally in the Nord-Pas-de- Calais region, this dish is accompanied by a lager or a fresh, young, white wine .

She was the second Royal Mail ship to be named after the South American Andes mountain range. The first RMS Andes was an A-class liner . In 1929 that RMS Andes was converted into a cruise ship and renamed Atlantis. The second Andes was built in Belfast in 1937–39 and completed at the outbreak of the Second World War. The Admiralty almost immediately requisitioned her as a troop ship and had her converted to carry about 4,000 troops. In troop service she broke three speed records for long-distance voyages. Andes was converted back into a civilian liner in 1947. She entered civilian service in 1948 on RMSP's premier liner route between Southampton, Rio de Janeiro and Buenos Aires. For seven years she worked the route full-time, but from 1955 the frequency of her liner voyages decreased and she spent an increasing proportion of her time cruising. In 1959–60 she was converted at Flushing, Netherlands into a full-time cruise ship. She was scrapped at Ghent in 1971. Background In 1924 RMSP ordered two new ocean liners for its Southampton – South America route from Harland and Wolff in Belfast. At each, and were far larger than the \\"A-series\\" liners built for RMSP in 1903–16. And they were motor ships, then a relatively new form of propulsion in which Harland and Wolff had taken an early lead. But their cruising speed turned out to be only : well below the that the contract had specified. The German liner , , outperformed RMSP's and Compagnie de navigation Sud-Atlantique had two liners on the route, Lutetia (1913) and Massilia (1920), that were smaller and older but at could offer a passage that was quicker by several days. Hamburg Südamerikanische Dampfschifffahrts- Gesellschaft (\\"Hamburg South America Steamship Company\\") also competed on the route with the , . In 1927 Hamburg Süd strengthened its competition by introducing the liner , which not only matched the speed of the French ships but at also became the largest ship on the route between Europe and South America. Asturias on a poster in about 1930 In 1931 the Royal Mail Case resulted in the jailing of RMSP chairman Lord Kylsant, and in 1932 the company was reconstituted as a new body, Royal Mail Lines, chaired by Lord Essendon. Essendon claimed that German, French and Italian competitors were running ships to South America at , giving a passage about five days quicker than RMSP. He urged RML directors to have Asturias and Alcantara re-engined with steam turbines to cruise at , and to order a new third ship of similar performance to augment the fleet. He also proposed to seek agreement with foreign competitors for a voluntary 19-knot speed limit on the route to give all operators enough fuel economy to cover their operating costs. Directors approved the re-engining of Asturias and Alcantara, foreign competitors agreed to Essendon's voluntary speed limit, but in 1932–33 the Great Depression was acute and the Board rejected his proposal for a new ship. Harland and Wolff re-engined Asturias and Alcantara in 1934 and 1935 respectively. Building In February 1935 RML began to consider replacing the ageing A-series ship , which had been transferred from liner service to cruising. The new ship was to be suited to both liner service and cruising, larger and quicker than Asturias and Alcantara, and able to cruise at . She would be almost as large as Hamburg Süds Cap Arcona, and marginally quicker. She would also have considerable cargo space, most of which would be insulated and refrigerated to ship meat and fruit from South America. In November 1935 RML invited five shipbuilders to tender for the contract: John Brown & Company of Clydebank, Cammell Laird of Birkenhead, Harland and Wolff, Hawthorn Leslie and Company of Hebburn and Swan Hunter & Wigham Richardson of Tyneside. Harland and Wolff's tender of £1,365,356 was the lowest, and RML negotiated this down to £1,360,000. In March 1937 RML announced that the new ship would be called Andes. On 17 June that year Harland and Wolff laid her keel at Belfast. Passenger accommodation was originally projected as first and third classes, but during construction this was changed to first and second (or \\"intermediate tourist class\\"), with a total capacity of 607. The reclassification would better suit the cruising part of the ship's intended service. Other changes were made during construction. In autumn 1937 it was decided to add air conditioning to the first class dining room and foyer, which cost an additional £21,436. =Launch= In September 1938 the Duchess of Kent accepted RML's invitation to launch Andes. However, there was unrest in Northern Ireland against high unemployment, and B Special police were on nightly patrols. In February 1939, on the advice of the Duke of Abercorn, then Governor of Northern Ireland, the Duke of Kent and his wife postponed their visit to the province. Instead Viscountess Craigavon, wife of Northern Ireland's Prime Minister Lord Craigavon, agreed to sponsor the ship. She launched Andes on 7 March 1939, in high wind and heavy rain. A short, silent Pathé News film shows the event. video of Viscountess Craigavon launching Andes After the launch, Lord Essendon complained that British re-armament had both increased shipbuilding costs and depressed the merchant shipping trade. =Equipment= With her liner route linking Southampton and South America, Andes was built to cover long distances without resupply. Her fuel capacity was specified to be \\"not less than 4,950 tons\\", and she had bunker oil tanks in her double bottom, aft peak, and between her machinery space and No. 3 hold. Her original fresh water capacity was nearly 2,500 tons, with tanks in her double bottom, forepeak, No. 1 hold, and between and beside her propeller shaft tunnels. After Asturias and Alcantaras embarrassing and costly under-performance as motor ships, Andes was engined with steam turbines. She had three 485-lbf/in2 water tube boilers, each heated by seven oil-burning forced-draught furnaces. Their total heating surface was and their working pressure was 430 lbf/in2. They supplied superheated steam to six turbines designed by CA Parsons & Co and built by Harland and Wolff. The turbines had three stages of steam expansion for ahead motion and two for astern. They were single-reduction geared to two propeller shafts and combined to give the ship 5,599 NHP. G & J Weir regenerative condensers returned condensate to the boilers at . Andes was built with five cargo holds. Parts of holds 1, 3 and 5 and all of holds 2 and 4 were insulated and refrigerated. Electric cranes served holds 1, 4 and 5; derricks served holds 2 and 3. The ship was built with navigation equipment including a semi- balanced rudder, electro-hydraulic steering gear, an automatic helmsman, wireless direction finding equipment, an echo sounding device, and Kelvite and Husun compasses. The French liner , , was to have competed with Andes. Instead in 1941 the two sailed together as troop ships in convoys WS 7 and TC 11. As built, Andes had 14 lifeboats with a total capacity of 1,174 people. There were two , motor boats, ten lifeboats and two lifeboats. All were mounted on Taylor's patent gravity davits. =Pasteur= While Andes was being built, Compagnie de Navigation Sud-Atlantique intensified potential competition by also ordering a new liner for the South American route. was launched in February 1938, 13 months before Andes. At , with a service speed of and top speed of Pasteur was larger and quicker than Andes and Cap Arcona, and would certainly have broken the latter's records for size and speed. But Pasteur was not completed until August 1939, and just weeks later the Second World War began. Pasteurs maiden voyage to Buenos Aires was cancelled, and she was instead commissioned for war-related service. Troop ship 1939–47 Andes sea trials were scheduled for 29–31 August 1939. She was scheduled to leave Southampton on her maiden voyage to Rio de Janeiro and Buenos Aires on 26 September, which was the centenary of RMSP's foundation. But her sea trials were postponed, and when the UK and France declared war on Germany on 3 September the Senior Naval Officer at Belfast cancelled them. RML agreed to accept her without sea trials, and Harland and Wolff handed her over at midnight on 24 September. Andes did make her first voyage on 26 September, but instead of being a passenger voyage from Southampton to South America it was a short crossing unladen from Belfast Lough to Holy Loch, where on 21 November the Admiralty requisitioned her to be a troop ship. She then went to Liverpool where she arrived on 26 November for modifications. Some of her passenger liner fittings were removed and stored and the remainder were panelled over with plywood. On 9 December 1939 Andes began her first voyage as a troopship, crossing the North Atlantic, mostly unescorted, to Halifax, Nova Scotia. At this stage in the war her only armament was a single Hotchkiss Mle 1897 machine gun with very little ammunition. In the course of the war her armament was radically improved. escorted two convoys that included Andes: TC 2 from Canada to Scotland in December 1939 and WS 7 from Scotland to Sierra Leone in March and April 1941 In Halifax joined the RML liner , Orient Line ships and , Pacific Steam Navigation Co liner and Gdynia – America Line ships and . Between them the seven ships embarked 8,152 Canadian troops, including 1,358 of The Seaforth Highlanders of Canada aboard Andes. The troop ships left Halifax on 22 December as Convoy TC 2, with an escort of Royal Navy, Canadian and French destroyers led by the Royal Navy battleship and . More escorts joined the convoy in the Western Approaches on 28 and 29 December, and it reached the Firth of Clyde on 30 December.

She called at Marseille, Port Said, Colombo, Singapore, and reached Hong Kong on 2 March 1940. Andes then turned south to New Zealand, reached Wellington on 20 March and left Lyttelton on 1 May. She was one of seven large troop ships that then formed Convoy US 3. The others were the Cunard-White Star liners , and and the Canadian Pacific liners , and . The led US 3's escorts. Between them the seven troop ships brought 17,576 military personnel to the UK via Cape Town and Freetown, of whom 1,508 sailed on Andes. At Cape Town another 100 people joined Andes, many of them sleeping on deck. From there to the UK she averaged and at times reached . US 3 reached the Clyde on 16 June. =Iceland= Since May 1940 the UK had occupied Iceland. On 24 June Andes left the Clyde and sailed to Akureyri in northern Iceland. She called at Seyðisfjörður in eastern Iceland and got back to the Clyde on 2 July. =Twice to Egypt via South Africa= sailed with Andes in Convoys WS 2 in 1940, WS 7 in 1941 and KMF 3 in 1942 Andes next voyage was to Suez, going via South Africa to avoid the Mediterranean Sea because on 10 June Italy had entered the War. She left the Clyde on 7 August as part of Convoy WS 2, which included eight other troop ships: Batory, Empress of Britain and Empress of Canada again, plus Cunard's , Furness, Withy's Monarch of Bermuda, Orient Line's and P&O;'s and . Escorts included three s, a light cruiser and six Royal Navy destroyers. The next day the convoy split into fast and slow sections, with the troop ships sailing in the fast section, WS 2F. This called at Freetown a week later and reached Cape Town on 25 August. Most of the troop ships, including Andes, left Cape Town on 30 August as part of Convoy WS 2A, which dispersed in the Indian Ocean a fortnight later. In September she reached Suez. Enemy aircraft bombed the port while Andes was there but she was not hit. It was the only time in the war that she came under fire. On 9 September Italy began to invade Egypt. Its forces' success was limited, but on 24 September Andes, the two Empresses, Franconia, Otranto and Strathaird left Suez in the lightly-escorted Convoy SW 1 carrying civilian evacuees. This reached Durban on 8 October, whence Andes continued unescorted via Cape Town, reaching Liverpool in late October, where she remained in port for three weeks. sailed with Andes in convoys WS 2 and WS 4B in 1940, and SW 4B and WS 7 in 1941 On 17 November Andes left Liverpool again for Egypt via South Africa. She sailed as one of 10 troop ships in Convoy WS 4B, which started from both Liverpool and the Clyde. The others were P&O;'s Strathaird, Strathallan, Strathnaver and Viceroy of India, Orient Line's and Otranto, CP's Empress of Canada and Duchess of Atholl and Pacific Steam's Reina del Pacifico. The County-class heavy cruisers and led an escort that included two light cruisers, two RN destroyers and four Canadian destroyers. WS 4B sailed west into the North Atlantic for several days before turning south. This was usual for southbound convoys to reduce the risk of attack from aircraft and surface craft based in enemy-occupied France. One soldier who travelled on Andes recalls that when the convoy reached warmer latitudes he slept on deck under the stars to escape the crowded accommodation below. WS 4B reached Freetown on 29 November, sailed again two days later and reached Durban on 12 December. After four days in Durban WS 4B sailed again. A few miles out Duchess of Atholl broke down and returned to port. One of the soldiers aboard her recalls \\"We quickly transshipped to Andes which set off to catch up the convoy. A new ship, she strained every bolt and rivet. I stood by the rail at night and felt the power vibrating through her.\\" WS 4B spent Christmas 1940 at sea in the Indian Ocean and reached Suez on 28 December. Andes spent New Year 1941 in port in Suez and left on 12 January in Convoy SW 4B for her return voyage. SW 4B included Duchess of Atholl, which evidently had been repaired in Durban and reached Suez. Most of the other ships that formed SW 4B had arrived in WS 4B a fortnight earlier: Strathaird, Strathallan, Strathnaver, Viceroy of India, Orcades, Otranto and Empress of Canada. The one additional ship was , a Blue Star Line refrigerated cargo liner. SW 4B called at Mombasa, Kenya 20–22 January and reached Durban 25 January. Andes continued independently, called at Cape Town 28–30 January and reached the Clyde 17 February. In 1941 led Convoy WS 7, in which Andes sailed from Scotland to Sierra Leone In spring 1941 Andes was part of Convoy WS 7, which included 10 troop ships carrying a total of at least 24,615 troops. WS 7 left the Clyde on 24 March, reached Freetown on 4 April and then split into sections to continue to Cape Town and Suez. Among the troop ships was Pasteur, built to compete against Andes to South America but now also requisitioned for war service. The others were the Canadian Pacific ships , , and Empress of Canada, Cunard-White Star Line's , Netherland Line's Johan van Oldenbarnevelt, Orient Line's Orcades, and Otranto, Union-Castle Line's and , P&O;'s and all five of P&O;'s \\"Strath-\\" liners: Strathaird, , Stratheden, and . WS 7's escorts were led by the , supported by the battleship Revenge and two light cruisers. There were 19 destroyers: 16 Royal Navy plus the Royal Canadian Navy destroyer HMCS St Clair, Free French destroyer and Free Polish destroyer . Andes left Freetown on 7 April, called at Cape Town and reached Suez on 6 May. =Clockwise around the North and South Atlantic= In 1941 led two convoys that included Andes: TC 11 from Canada to Scotland in June and WS 14 from Scotland to Sierra Leone in December From Suez Andes went via Cape Town and Trinidad to Halifax, where she embarked 2,744 troops. She left Halifax on 21 June as one of six troop ships in Convoy TC 11. The others were Pasteur, Cunard-White Star's , KRL's , and Union-Castle's Stirling Castle and . The escorts were led by the Revenge-class battleship and and included 10 Royal Navy destroyers, three Canadian destroyers and the Dutch anti-aircraft destroyer . TC 11 reached the Clyde on 30 June and on 2 July Andes continued to Liverpool, arriving the next day. A month later Andes embarked 3,076 troops and joined 12 other troop ships in Convoy WS 10 from the Clyde to South Africa. She had sailed with five of them before: Britannic, Indrapoera, Orcades, Reina del Pacifico and Strathallan. WS 10's other troop ships were Anchor Line's , RML's , Greek Line's Nea Hellas, New Zealand Shipping Company's , Holland America Line's and Union-Castle's Warwick Castle and . Warwick Castle suffered a collision and had to return home, but the other 12 ships reached South Africa carrying a total of 28,282 troops. WS 10's escorts included the heavy cruiser , two light cruisers, nine Royal Navy destroyers, the Polish destroyer Piorun, Dutch destroyer and two Royal Navy s. The convoy left the Clyde on 2 August 1941, called at Freetown 17–21 August and reached Durban 5 September, whence it dispersed. Andes doubled back, leaving Durban unescorted on 8 September and calling at Cape Town 12–14 September. Continuing unescorted she crossed the South Atlantic, called at Trinidad on 25–26 September and reached Halifax on 1 October. The Cunard-White Star liner sailed with Andes in three convoys: TC 11 and WS 10 in 1941 and WS 19P in 1942 At Halifax, Andes embarked 2,719 troops and joined eastbound Convoy TC 14 to the UK. She was also carrying 2,454 tons of general cargo. Other troop ships in TC 14 were Monarch of Bermuda, Reina del Pacifico and Warwick Castle, plus Union- Castle's and Union Steam Ship Co's . The light cruiser led an escort of seven Royal Navy and four Canadian destroyers. TC 14 reached Liverpool on 17 October, where Andes then stayed for repairs that took 12 days. =Across the North Atlantic= On 30 October Andes left the Clyde for Halifax as one of eight troop ships in Convoy CT 5. She had sailed with four of the troop ships before: Duchess of Atholl, Orcades, Reina del Pacifico and Warwick Castle. The others were Union-Castle's , Orient Line's and Gdynia – America Line's . CT 5 carried 19,959 troops, 3,169 of whom were on Andes, and reached Halifax on 8 November. The same eight troop ships stayed together for the return voyage to the UK as Convoy TC 15. Between them they embarked 15,974 troops, 2,091 of them on Andes. They were joined by Netherland Line's and an escort that included six Royal Navy destroyers, and left Halifax on 13 November. At this time the United States was still neutral, but TC 15's escort also included 10 United States Navy destroyers. The convoy reached the Clyde on 21 November, and Andes again put in for 12 days of repairs at Liverpool. =Eastward around the World= Between 7 December 1941 and 11 May 1942 Andes made her first circumnavigation of the World. She began by sailing from Liverpool to Oversay, Scotland, where she joined 12 other troop ships to form Convoy WS 14 to the Indian Ocean. They included Duchess of Atholl, Empress of Australia, Highland Monarch, Orcades, Oronsay, Reina del Pacifico, Strathallan and Warwick Castle, plus Elder Dempster Lines' , Union-Castle's , RML's and Furness, Withy's . The escorts were led by the battleship HMS Ramillies and included 17 Royal Navy destroyers, the armed merchant cruisers and , the anti-aircraft ship and Royal Australian Navy destroyer . HMS Corfu escorted Convoy WS 14B, in which Andes sailed from Durban to Bombay WS 14 left the Clyde on 9 December, reached Freetown on the 21st, stayed until Christmas Day and then continued to South African waters off Durban, where it divided into sections. Andes, Nova Scotia, the British-India SN Co troopship and four cargo ships formed Convoy WS 14B. Escorted by the armed merchant cruisers HMS Corfu and they headed out into the Indian Ocean on 19 January 1942, reaching Bombay on 28 January. On 4 February Andes, with Strathallan and the unladen Durban Castle left Bombay as Convoy BA 14. The convoy, which had no naval escort, reached Aden three days later. Andes left Aden independently on 9 February and reached Suez three days later. On 18 February Andes left Suez independently and on 27 February she reached Colombo. On 2 March Andes, Orcades and Strathallan, all carrying troops, left Colombo as the unescorted Convoy SU 3. The convoy dispersed at sea and Andes, with 3,200 troops, continued independently to Australia. She called at Fremantle on 10–12 March, Adelaide on 15–16 March and reached Melbourne on 17 March. In 1942 escorted Convoy NA 8, in which Andes sailed from Nova Scotia to the Clyde On 22 March Andes left Melbourne independently to return to Britain. She reached Balboa, Panama on 9 April, made her first passage through the Panama Canal and two days later left Cristóbal on Panama's Caribbean coast. She reached Boston, MA on 19 April, where she was dry docked for repairs. She left on 28 April and reached Halifax the next day, where she became one of five troopships in Convoy NA 8. The others were Batory and Orcades, P&O;'s and Anchor-Donaldson Line's . NA 8 left Halifax on 3 May, escorted by the escort carrier and eight US Navy destroyers. The convoy crossed the North Atlantic without loss and reached the Clyde on 11 or 12 May. Andes had completed her first round-the-World voyage. It had taken almost five months, covered 38,000 miles and she had carried 4,500 men. From the Clyde she continued to Liverpool where she stayed 18 days for repairs. =Twice more to South Africa= In 1942 escorted Convoy WS 19P, in which Andes sailed from the Clyde to Freetown After repairs at Liverpool Andes embarked 3,499 troops. On 30 May or 1 June 1942 she left in Convoy WS 19P, a large convoy that included at least 17 troop ships carrying at least 50,828 troops. The troop ships included Cunard-White Star's Aquitania, Britannic and , P&O;'s Cathay, Strathallan and Viceroy of India, Orient Line's Orcades, Orontes and Otranto, Anchor Line's Warwick Castle, Shaw, Savill & Albion Line's , Bibby Line's and Netherland Line's Christiaan Huygens. Also in the convoy were 10 US transport ships, at least six of which were carrying troops. The battleship HMS Nelson, aircraft carrier and 11 Royal Navy destroyers escorted the convoy. WS 19P called at Freetown on 15–20 June and reached Durban on 4 July. Andes left Durban independently two days later and reached Cape Town 8 July. Three days later Andes left Cape Town for New York, where she arrived on 27 July. There she joined Batory and Orcades, Furness, Withy's and eight US transport ships to form Convoy AT 18. The US ships included , , and West Point, and Moore-McCormack's three sister ships , and Uruguay. The Convoy left New York on 6 August, heavily escorted by 19 US Navy destroyers, and reached the Clyde without loss on 17 August. Andes left Liverpool on 28 August and joined a large number of ships to form Convoy WS 22, which left the Clyde the next day. WS 22 included 19 troop ships, of which six were from RML. As well as Andes the RML contingent included Almanzora, and the three sister ships , and Highland Princess. Other troop ships in WS 22 included Anchor Line's , Shaw, Savill & Albion's and company flagship , Cunard-White Star's Franconia, Orient Line's Orcades, Messageries Maritimes' , the Greek Nea Hellas and New Zealand Shipping Co's . There were also six Dutch troop ships: KPM's , and , KRL's Indrapoera and and Netherland Line's Johan van Oldenbarnevelt. In 1942 Andes sailed in Convoy WS 22 from the Clyde to Freetown. Escorts included the modern and well-armed Polish . The heavy cruiser led the escorts, supported by the light cruiser and three armed merchant cruisers: Alcantara from RML and and from P&O.; There were also ten destroyers: seven Royal Navy, plus the Polish , Greek and Australian . WS 22 left Liverpool on 29 August and reached Freetown without loss on 9 September. Andes left Freetown on 13 September and continued to Cape Town, where she was in port from 25 September to 3 October. From there she returned independently to Britain, reaching Liverpool on 19 October. She then spent a month in Liverpool, presumably for repairs. =North Africa= On 8 November Allied forces invaded Vichy French North Africa in Operation Torch. When Andes returned to service a few days later it was to take troops to French Algeria. She sailed with Convoy KMF 3, which left the Clyde on 14 November. KMF 3 included many vessels with which Andes had sailed before, among them the troop ships Christiaan Huygens, Duchess of York, Empress of Australia, Nea Hellas, Orontes, Rangitiki, Staffordshire, Strathaird, Strathallan and Windsor Castle. Other troop ships in KMF 3 were Orient Line's , Cunard-White Star's , Norwegian America Line's , Compagnie Maritime Belges , and Matson Lines' . The convoy was escorted by six destroyers including the Australian Quiberon, two sloops, two United States Coast Guard cutters that had been transferred to the Royal Navy as sloops, and one Flower-class corvette. Off the Algerian coast Andes and Rangitiki left the convoy and entered Oran. The rest of KMF 3 continued to Algiers, arriving on 23 November. sailed with Andes in Convoy WS 7 in 1941 and Convoys WS 14 and KMF 3 in 1942 Many of the same ships returned as Convoy MKF 3, which left Algiers on 23 November. Andes and Rangitiki left Oran two days later and joined MKF 3 as it passed. Orient Line's Ormonde later joined the convoy from Gibraltar. MKF 3 reached the Clyde without loss on 2 or 3 December. Andes was in the Clyde until 18 December, and then spent the next two months shuttling between there and Halifax, Nova Scotia. Her voyages were listed as AT- and TA-series convoys, but in reality she seems to have sailed independently without escort. She reached Halifax on Christmas Day 1942, was in port for the next five days, and then brought 3,987 troops to the Clyde, where she arrived on 6 January 1943. She made another round trip between 14 January and 3 February, and then headed west again, leaving the Clyde on 17 February and reaching Halifax six days later. Andes left Halifax on 24 February and sailed down the coast to New York. In the next two months she made three crossings from there to Casablanca, bringing a total of 22,000 troops to Morocco for the North African Campaign. After her third visit to Casablanca she returned to Halifax, arriving on 4 May. She then spent six weeks making crossings between Halifax and Liverpool, recorded as convoys but apparently sailing independently and unescorted. Her eastbound crossings were from 14 to 21 May with 4,109 troops and from 17 to 24 June with 4,182 troops. =Propeller shaft repairs= By now the brackets of Andes twin propeller shafts were suffering from vibration. From late summer 1943 she was refitted at Liverpool. Her builders Harland and Wolff made and fitted a pair of large struts, one between each bracket and her hull. =More North Atlantic crossings= Andes returned to service in October, leaving Liverpool on the last day of the month carrying 2,162 troops to New York, where she arrived on 8 November. She was listed as Convoy TA 69A. Andes left New York again on 12 November, this time packed with 5,004 troops and reaching Liverpool on 20 November. This trip was designated Convoy AT 74A, but again in reality she sailed alone and unescorted. From October 1943 to June 1944 Andes spent eight months crossing and re-crossing the Atlantic, usually from New York or Halifax to Liverpool. One exception was on 3–6 December 1943, when she was in Norfolk, VA. From there she sailed to Casablanca, where she called on 14–16 December. Her next westbound trip was to New York, where she spent Christmas 1943 and New Year 1944. Her next eastbound trip was again to Casablanca, where she spent 9–12 January. Andes movements changed on 1 July 1944, when he left the Clyde for South Africa. Her voyage as far as Freetown was designated Convoy KMF 32A, but was in fact another unescorted solo voyage. She called at Freetown on 10–11 July and continued independently to Cape Town, where she arrived 18 July. On her return voyage she left Cape Town on 26 July and reached Liverpool on 11 August. Andes then made another unescorted round trip to South Africa. She left Liverpool on 26 August, was in Cape Town 13–19 September and got back to Liverpool on 6 October. Andes was then switched back to the North Atlantic crossing for one unescorted round trip. She left Liverpool on 1 November as Convoy TA 160 carrying 261 troops. She spent 17–21 November in Halifax, returned wast as Convoy AT 165 and reached Liverpool on 27 November, where she then spent 22 days under repair. After repairs Andes resumed voyages between Liverpool and South Africa. She left Liverpool on 21 December, spent Christmas 1944 and New Year 1945 at sea and 6–12 January in Cape Town. She completed two more round trips between Liverpool and South Africa, calling in Cape Town on 2–8 March and from 28 April to 4 May. She was on the return leg of this trip when Germany unconditionally surrendered to the Allies on 8 May and the UK declared Victory in Europe Day. Andes dressed overall and fired a 21-gun salute. in White Star Line livery in 1932. As a troop ship in the Second World War she twice sailed with Andes, in Convoys WS 7 in 1941 and MKF 44 in 1945. On the same trip Andes called at Gibraltar on 16–17 May, where she joined Convoy MKF 44 to Liverpool. This included 10 troop ships, which between them carried 28,638 troops back to the UK. The other troop ships were RML's Alcantara, Union-Castle's and , Cunard-White Star's Georgic and , P&O;'s Strathmore and Strathnaver, the Norwegian Bergensfjord and Dutch Boissevain. They were accompanied by three cargo ships and escorted by five Royal Canadian Navy s. MKF 44 reached Liverpool on 22 May. =Norway= Norwegian Prime Minister Johan Nygaardsvold, who with most of his cabinet returned to Oslo on Andes in 1945 On 28 May Andes left Liverpool carrying Norwegian Prime Minister Johan Nygaardsvold and most of his cabinet- in-exile home to Oslo. As she came up Oslofjord on 31 May an armada of small boats surrounded her to welcome and accompany her into harbour. Andes left Oslo on 2 June and reached Liverpool two days later. =Second voyage around the World= On her next voyage in 1945 Andes again circumnavigated the World, but this time heading west. She left Liverpool on 29 June, stopped at Balboa, Panama on 10–11 July, then went through the Panama Canal. She called at Wellington on 24–25 July and was in Sydney from 27 July to 3 August. She then sailed for Karachi and was at sea in the Indian Ocean when she received news of the unconditional surrender of Japan and Victory over Japan Day. Andes celebrated with another 21-gun salute and a firework display. She called at Karachi 20–25 August, Port Said 1 September and then passed through the Suez Canal. Child evacuees on Andes boat deck in Southampton on 11 September 1945, celebrating their return from Australia. In the centre background, seen over the children's heads, is one of Andes wartime anti-aircraft gun platforms. On 10 September Andes reached Southampton. It was almost exactly six years since Harland and Wolff handed her over to Royal Mail Lines but this was her first ever visit to her home port. Her circumnavigation set a new record of 72 days, eight hours and 55 minutes, breaking by nine days the previous record set by Mauretania. By now Andes had sailed and carried more than 350,000 troops. The passengers that Andes landed in Southampton included British child evacuees returning from Australia. Throughout the war Andes carried cargo as well as troops. To the UK she brought cotton from Suez, bacon from Canada, beef and pork from New York and oranges and copper from South Africa. She also took a cargo of South African wine to Canada. One of her most valuable cargoes was gold bars worth $7.75 million from New York to the UK in winter 1944. Although Andes was built as an ocean-going ship she was designed for the temperate to tropical sea and weather conditions between the UK and South America, rather than cold North Atlantic winters. Early in 1944 on a westward crossing she suffered weather damage to her forecastle, lifeboats and other fittings. Repairs at New York cost $46,500. =Post-war troop service 1945–47= On her first post-war voyage from the UK Andes repatriated 1,500 RNZAF and 1,000 RAAF officers. She sailed from Southampton on 23 September, where a Royal Air Force band played her away from the quayside. Avro Lincoln, Gloster Meteor and Short Sunderland aircraft escorted her down the Solent. She sailed via the Suez Canal, calling at Port Said on 30 September arriving in Melbourne in 23 days, seven hours and 47 minutes, beating by five days another record set by Mauretania. After calling at Lyttleton and Wellington on 23 and 24 October she sailed to Sydney, where she arrived on 27 October and left on 2 November. Her return voyage to Britain involved calls at Fremantle 7–8 November and Bombay 16–19 November. She reached her home port of Southampton on 3 December 1945. In 1946 Andes continued in HM Government service, mainly between the UK and Bombay via Suez. She occasionally called at Singapore, Aden, Naples, Piraeus, Saigon and Colombo. Early in 1946 she sailed from Singapore to Southampton in a record 16 days, 15 hours and 31 minutes, averaging and beating by almost three days the previous record set by Winchester Castle. Andes final voyage in Government service began in January 1947 and took 2,600 armed forces personnel and 400 civilians to the Far East. Marking her wartime service to the RAF, the Central Band of the Royal Air Force played as she departed. She returned to Southampton on 7 March 1947 and was returned to her owners. A week later she left for Belfast for her builders to refit her for civilian service. Ocean liner 1948–59 =1947–48 refit= Before the war Andes was designed and built with accommodation for 403 first class and 204 second class passengers: a total of 607. In straitened conditions after the war, RML got Harland and Wolff to reduce the first class accommodation so that the two classes added up to a total of 528. The space thus released was used to make crew accommodation more generous. Wartime air raids in Britain had destroyed many of the civilian fittings that had been removed in November 1939 and stored ashore. Other fittings had been left aboard but panelled over. These included a large tapestry in the First Class smokeroom that depicted Medieval hare coursing. However, when Harland and Wolff removed the wartime panelling in 1947, the tapestry had gone. Under post-war austerity RML settled for a painted replica of the picture to replace it. Among the First Class cabins there were only four luxury suites, this being considered enough for even a premiere liner on the South American route. But First Class facilities did include a Grand Hall with a stage and a dance floor, an Observation Lounge, writing rooms, a library that could double as a chapel, and the smokeroom complete with stone fireplace, timber beams, stone corbels supporting some of the beams, wood panelling, and even some Gothic Revival stone tracery. Concealed lighting was a feature of many of the rooms. Second Class facilities also included a smokeroom. Many of the Second Class cabins were the same size as first class ones. When Andes alternated between liner service and cruising, these cabins could be converted from Second to First Class by removing the top berth. Andes had generous promenade decks, a sun deck with a café, a sports deck, swimming pools, a gymnasium, a cocktail bar and its own orchestra. In January 1948 Andes at last had the sea trials that had been cancelled in August 1939. They included a measured mile off the Isle of Arran, over which she averaged . =Liner service= On 22 January 1948, eight years and four months after her cancelled civilian maiden voyage, Andes sailed from Southampton on her first commercial run to South America. RML had innovated by selling 100 First Class berths to round trip passengers, who for a £10 supplement could remain aboard Andes in Buenos Aires, using her as an hotel. President Juan Perón (right, signing a document) and UK Ambassador Reginald Leeper (left, watching him) in 1948. The event is not the trade agreement aboard Andes but the nationalisation of British-owned railways in Argentina. Since the beginning of December 1947 the UK ambassador to Argentina Sir Reginald Leeper and British Trade Mission led by chairman Clive Baillieu had been trying to negotiate a new trade agreement with President Juan Perón and his National Economic Council chairman Miguel Miranda. Nine weeks of discussions seemed on the brink of failure. Then Andes reached Buenos Aires, and on 7 February hosted a reception for President Perón. At the reception the Argentinian and UK delegations unexpectedly reached agreement, and both sides accepted Leeper's proposal that it be named the \\"Andes Agreement\\". Her holds were duly loaded with 1,900 tons of beef and 140 tons of canned meat, shipped under the newly agreed trade terms. In the South Atlantic on her second South American voyage Andes responded to distress calls from a Norwegian oil tanker, Fenja, which had suffered a fire in her engine room. A party from Andes boarded Fenja to assist, and another ship later towed the tanker to Montevideo in Uruguay. In liner service in 1948 Andes consistently achieved the 21 knot cruising speed that RML had required of Harland and Wolff in her specification in 1937. At about this time the Canadian Army presented her with a bronze plaque commemorating her part in Convoy TC 2 in December 1939, which had brought the first Canadian troops to the UK in the Second World War. The older Asturias and Alcantara, like Andes, had spent the war in Government service. Alcantara was released in August 1947, refitted for commercial civilian service and in October 1948 joined Andes on RML's South American route. But Asturias had been badly damaged by a torpedo in 1943, her repairs were not completed until after the war, and she then became property of the Ministry of Transport. At the time many people wanted to emigrate from war-damaged Britain to a new life in the British Dominions, so the MoT had Asturias refitted to carry emigrants to Australia. RML managed and crewed Asturias under contract, but she never returned to the route for which she was built. Thus Lord Essendon's 1932 plan to have three liners on RML's prestige South American route was never fulfilled. Andes was dry-docked annually. In June 1952 this included renewing her propellers, overhauling her rudder and preparatory work for the future fitting of a pair of Denny-Brown stabilisers. That autumn Andes suffered a defect in one of her intermediate pressure turbines. Thereafter RML reduced her cruising speed from 21 to for the rest of her career. Swedish cruiser (foreground) and Soviet cruiser (background) at the 1953 Coronation review at Spithead On 15 June 1953 the Royal Navy commemorated the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II with a fleet review at Spithead. Two days before the review Andes embarked 404 passengers in Southampton to spectate. She spent the night at anchor in Portland Bay, where her passengers danced on deck under the stars. At the review her passengers saw not only the Royal Navy fleet but also ships from foreign navies, including the heavy cruiser , Soviet Navy and Swedish Navy cruiser . Later in 1953 Andes was fitted with the pair of stabilisers for which preparatory work had been made the previous year. Each stabiliser was in size and was retracted or extended hydraulically. They could be controlled from either the bridge or the engine room. In June 1955 Andes made her first cruise. It was a relatively short trip of 4,600 miles to and from the Mediterranean. Thereafter her liner voyages to and from South America were often separated by cruises to either the Mediterranean or the Caribbean. In the 1950s Prince Chula Chakrabongse (seen here in the 1930s with his fiancée Elizabeth Hunter) travelled on Andes several times Several times Prince Chula Chakrabongse of Siam sailed on Andes between Europe and South America. In 1955 the Earl and Countess Alexander of Tunis sailed on her to Lisbon. In cruise service Andes passengers included Law Lord Baron Birkett and actresses Joan Regan and Margaret Rutherford. Magician David Nixon and comedian Frankie Howerd each took a Christmas cruise on her. BBC Television presenter Alan Whicker and his television team filmed an episode of Whicker's World aboard her. Andes started to make longer cruises, for which her long-range bunker, water and victual capacities were well- suited. In 1958 she made her first winter cruise: 17,000 miles including visits to both Rio de Janeiro and Cape Town. By 1959 Andes was making more cruises than liner voyages. One of her cruises was a 45-day trip that included the Caribbean, Venezuela and New Orleans. On a cruise in June 1959 Andes visited Lisbon during a British trade fair; aboard the ship RML hosted a cocktail party at which the guests included Princess Margaret and the Portuguese dictator António Salazar. In 1959 Andes made her last two liner voyages on the South American route. She completed the second when she docked in Southampton on 23 November 1959. The remainder of her career was given entirely to cruising. Cruise ship 1960–71 =1959–60 refit in the Netherlands= After her last ever liner voyage in November 1959 Andes sailed to Flushing, Netherlands, where Koninklijke Maatschappij De Schelde converted her into a full-time cruise ship. She was no longer to carry cargo, so KM De Schelde converted No. 4 hold into a 260-seat theatre and cinema called the Ocean Theatre. Additional refrigerating and air conditioning plant was installed in some of the other disused holds. Without cargo the ship would be higher in the water, so holds 2 and 3 were ballasted with 250 tons each of concrete blocks. The change of use of the holds meant that Andes four cranes (two forward, two aft) could be removed. The two cranes on her after deck were replaced with a single kingpost and derrick abaft the E Deck superstructure for loading stores. The superstructure of D Deck was extended both fore and aft to add new cabins, which became known as the Dutch Cabins. Existing cabins were upgraded so that all now had either a shower or a bathroom en suite. A new children's playroom was added. The after extension allowed the lido area above to be enlarged and given greater facilities, including a cocktail lounge. Air conditioning was extended to all cabins and almost all public accommodation. Despite the addition of the Dutch Cabins, the refit reduced Andes total passenger capacity from 528 to about 470, due to space taken to increase public areas, and to install baths or showers in all remaining cabins. Two launches were added to the ship's boats, and were installed above the forward extension of D Deck. They were larger than Andes existing boats, and had canvas covers for bad weather. As well as increasing her life-saving capacity, the launches could ferry cruise passengers in and out of destinations where the sea was too shallow for Andes herself to dock. Andes 1959–60 refit included enlarging her restaurant. It was renamed the Atlantis Restaurant after an earlier RML cruise ship, Atlantis, which had been launched in 1913 as RMSP's first RMS Andes. Some rooms were given new names. The Grand Hall became the Princess Lounge in honour of Princess Margaret's visit to the ship. The First Class smokeroom was named the Warwick Room after RMS's retiring Chairman, Walter Warwick. The names Galleon Grill and Seahorse Inn referred to parts of RML's coat of arms. The four First Class luxury suites were now named Alcantara, Almanzora, Araguaya and Asturias after famous Royal Mail liners of the past. The First Class restaurant was enlarged, and now named the Atlantis Restaurant after an earlier Royal Mail cruise ship, which had been in service until 1952. KM De Schelde refitted Andes in two phases. The first phase, from late November 1959 until early January 1960, was mainly to extend the D deck superstructure and complete the new cabins. She then returned to passenger service for her annual winter cruise. Andes then returned to Flushing for the second phase, in which KM De Schelde completed her refit. Until now Andes had been in RML's normal colours for a liner, which included her hull being painted black. For cruising KM De Schelde repainted her hull white, following a tradition set by cruise ships of various lines including RML's own Atlantis when she became a cruise ship from 1929. =Full- time cruising= KM De Schelde completed the second phase of Andes refit in the first half of 1960. Then in June 1960 Andes made a short shakedown cruise in the English Channel. RML staff, families and travel agents were the passengers. The only port of call was Guernsey, where at the time she was the largest ship ever to visit the island. Andes then entered full-time public cruise service, starting with a three-week one to the Mediterranean. Many of Andes cruises were to the Caribbean (typically in spring and autumn), the Mediterranean or the Baltic. Most of them lasted from 16 to 26 days. Her calendar always included a Christmas and New Year cruise, typically to islands in the Atlantic and perhaps the North African coast. That was followed each year by a Winter Cruise, which was longer and could be up to two months. The length of the Winter Cruise allowed Andes to sail farther from her home port of Southampton, to any ocean that was exotic and warm while the Northern Hemisphere was in winter. Gracie Fields on the Commodore's barge in Trincomalee Harbour, Ceylon, with members of the Royal Navy's Eastern Fleet in 1945. She visited Andes in 1964. In Lisbon in 1962 Andes port propeller fell off in the River Tagus. With only her starboard propeller she still maintained on her return voyage to Southampton. Her Master reported that despite her one- sided propulsion she \\"handled beautifully\\" with her steering adjusted by 12 degrees to compensate. The UK endured a notably long, cold winter in 1962–63. This may have increased demand for winter cruises. In December 1963 Crockfords of Mayfair installed a gambling table on Andes. It was used for the first time on the 1963–64 Christmas and New Year cruise. Her 1964 Winter Cruise covered 20,570 miles and included visits to Madras, Bombay and the Far East. In June 1964 Pears soap held its annual Miss Pears children's beauty competition aboard Andes. The singer Gracie Fields presented the prizes in a packed Princess Lounge. Portsmouth in 1994. Britannia and Andes met in Barbados in 1964 and 1966. Also in 1964 Andes was in the Caribbean at the same time as Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother made a Caribbean cruise aboard royal yacht ; the ships berthed next to each other in Barbados. The two ships met again in Barbados in 1966, when Queen Elizabeth II and her husband Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh were visiting the island. In 1965 Furness Withy took over RML. Andes cruising became increasingly diverse. In 1966 she visited Livorno for the first time, and she returned to Akureyri for the first time since she landed Allied troops there to join the occupation of Iceland in 1940. In 1967 she made her first visits to Mahé in the Seychelles and Tobago in the Caribbean. =1967 refit and final years= About this time the US Government tightened the fire regulations for ships entering ports in the USA. Andes was almost 30 years old and nearing the end of her career, but RML decided to have her upgraded to the new standards. In May 1967 she returned to Belfast, where Harland and Wolff undertook the first phase of her final refit. She resumed cruising for the summer and autumn, but her 1967–68 Christmas cruise was cancelled to allow her builders to complete the work. The refit added new fire-resistant bulkheads, doors and ceilings. At the same time the opportunity was taken to replace her boiler tubes. RML intended Andes 1968 Winter Cruise to be the most ambitious yet: 25,000 miles in 78 days, including the Mediterranean, East Africa, South Africa, India, South East Asia and the Far East. However, in 1967 the Six-Day War closed the Suez Canal, there were riots in Hong Kong and anti-apartheid unrest in South Africa. The cruise plan was revised to omit the Mediterranean, Suez and Asia. RML added a South Atlantic leg to Saint Helena and Rio de Janeiro, still included South Africa, and revised the Indian Ocean leg to include the Seychelles. Andes had 458 crew but carried only about 470 passengers, and in the 1960s this generous ratio became less economic. Also the cost of bunker oil was rising and competition in the cruise market was increasing. In December 1970 Furness, Withy announced that a number of RML ships would be withdrawn from service, including Andes. Andes made her final three cruises in the first half of 1971. All were winter cruises in the Atlantic: the first to South and West Africa, the second to Rio de Janeiro and the third to the Caribbean. Passengers could take either one cruise or two or three of them in succession. But Andes was becoming unreliable. On the first cruise she twice suffered boiler trouble. When in Cape Town she stayed on for boiler repairs, after which she was three days late. On the second cruise the drive shaft for the forced-draught fan to Andes central boiler sheared, and as she left Rio de Janeiro her steering gear failed. On the third cruise, in the Caribbean, Andes had both boiler and engine trouble and ended up a day late. Andes reached Southampton for the final time on 4 May 1971. She entered port flying a paying-off pennant long, and she was dressed with signal flags that spelt out a message in Latin: Andes in opus per mare ubique 1939–1971 hodie recedere. It means \\"Andes in operation by sea everywhere 1939–1971 today retires\\". She had completed 285 voyages, called at 174 ports, and steamed about 2,770,000 miles. =Scrapping= Andes left Southampton on 6 May 1971 under a skeleton crew. The next day she reached Ghent in Belgium, where she was sold to Van Heyghen Frères for £325,000 for scrap. The Canadian Army plaque that had been presented to Andes in 1948 had already been removed, and RML presented it to The Seaforth Highlanders of Canada Regiment in British Columbia.

Crowds at Alcalá street seen from Cibeles square (2007). Madrid Pride, popularly known in Spanish as the Orgullo Gay de Madrid and its acronym MADO, is the annual LGBT pride festival hosted at Chueca neighbourhood in the centre of Madrid, during the weekend immediately after June 28, International Day of LGBT Pride. The celebration usually begins Wednesday afternoon with the popular announcement at Chueca Square, carried out by notorious public figures, and ends on Sunday, after the parade of claiming floats that takes place on Saturday. Madrid Pride has gone from being a small concentration of people in the late 1970s and early 1980s to being considered the biggest LGBTQ party in Europe and one of the most important in the world, only surpassed by the city of San Francisco (California), attracting more than a million and a half people each year (300,000 of them foreign tourists) and with an estimated contribution to the economy of the city over €150 million in 2015, consecrating itself as one of the most important and multitudinous festivals in all of Spain. As of June 2019, it is Europe’s largest Pride event. Crowds at Gran Vía avenue in downtown Madrid during the Madrid Pride parade (2008). Façade of Madrid City Hall with the rainbow flag during Madrid Pride (2015). In July 2017 Madrid hosted WorldPride Madrid 2017, the 5th Edition of the biggest LGBT event in the world. History After the incidents of June 28, 1969 in the New York pub Stonewall Inn, many cities in the world began to celebrate mass demonstrations in repulsion, but in Spain the dictatorial Franco regime of the time avoided the news entry in the country. Thus, it was not until 1977, two years after the death of the dictator, that in Barcelona was celebrated for the first time in Spain a demonstration in favor of the rights of homosexual people. It hardly concentrated 4,000 people who were dissolved by force. The following year, in 1978, the demonstration was authorized in Madrid and since then, except in 1980, Madrid Pride is celebrated annually. By those first years, the demonstration started at Santo Domingo square and finished at Puerta del Sol square. In 1986, a seminar on homosexuality was organized in Chueca neighbourhood, which was the seed to constitute the Lesbian, Gay, Transsexual and Bisexual Group of Madrid (COGAM, from Colectivo de Lesbianas, Gays, Transexuales y Bisexuales de Madrid). At that time it was becoming common that after the demonstration the participants returned to Chueca to celebrate and the protest started taking on a festive character. Years later, in 1996, the magazine Shangay introduced in the parade the first carriage, with Alaska cheering the parade. Since then, the number of people has been increasing each year. In 2005, with the approval of equal marriage in Spain, there was an explosion of assistance to Madrid Pride, which for the first time reached up to two million people. This made Madrid to be chosen as the European capital of Pride, celebrating Europride 2007, which was attended by more than 2.5 million people from around the world. In October 2012, InterPride members voted in favor of holding the 5th WorldPride 2017 Edition to the city of Madrid, surpassing Berlin and Sydney. Nowadays, nearly 2 million people are out on the streets during the Pride Week, thus becoming one of the most crowded parties, not only in the capital, but also in the whole Spain, and being the European city with the largest number of attendees to the march of Pride, far above cities like London or Paris and only behind the San Francisco Pride. In 2016, the number of concerts and security of the event was increased in order to start preparing for 2017, in which Madrid will celebrate the largest LGBT event in the world, the WorldPride, being expected a record attendance of 3 million people. Large concerts were installed in larger spaces such as Puerta del Sol, Plaza de España and Puerta de Alcalá. The City Council declared the Madrid Pride Celebrations as a Festival of General Interest in July 2016.  WorldPride Madrid 2017  In October 2012, InterPride's membership voted at its annual conference in Boston, Massachusetts, United States, to award WorldPride 2017 to the city of Madrid, Spain. The other candidate cities to host the event in 2017 were Berlin and Sydney, but Madrid won unanimously in the voting of more than 80 delegations from around the world.Puerta de Alcalá, Madrid, illuminated with the rainbow colours during the celebrations of WorldPride 2017left Cibeles Fountain, Madrid, illuminated with the rainbow colours during the celebrations of WorldPride 2017 This celebration in Madrid coincided in time with the 24th Europride, which was hosted for the second time in the Spanish capital (the first one was in 2007). It took place from June 23 to 2 July 2017. The event's slogan was \\"Whoever you love, Madrid loves you!\\", and the song chosen as the anthem was ¿A quién le importa? by Alaska y Dinarama, which was specially adapted for the event with the collaboration of several Spanish popular singers among the LGBT community, including Fangoria (band) -the group of two of the three former members of Alaska y Dinarama-. WorldPride Madrid 2017 also coincided with two key anniversaries in the history of the LGBT community in Madrid and Spain: the 40th anniversary of the first demonstration in Spain in support of the rights of homosexual people -which took place in Barcelona in 1977- and the 25th anniversary of the foundation of the State Federation of Lesbians, Gays, Transsexuals and Bisexuals (FELGTB, from Federación Estatal de Lesbianas, Gays, Transexuales y Bisexuales). The opening ceremony of the event took place at the Calderón Theatre on Friday, June 23, 2017. Few days later, on Monday, June 26, the Madrid Summit, the International Conference on Human Rights, was inaugurated at the Autonomous University. Several cultural events took place in the subsequent days, including the traditional and massive demonstration on July 1, with up to 52 carriages going all over the 2 kilometers between Atocha (Plaza del Emperador Carlos V) and Plaza de Colón. The WorldPride closing ceremony took place on July 2, giving the baton to New York City for the celebration of WorldPride 2019.

It is supposed to enable fast transactions among participating nodes and has been proposed as a solution to the bitcoin scalability problem. It features a peer-to-peer system for making micropayments of cryptocurrency through a network of bidirectional payment channels without delegating custody of funds. Lightning Network implementation also simplifies atomic swaps. Normal use of the Lightning Network consists of opening a payment channel by committing a funding transaction to the relevant base blockchain (layer 1), followed by making any number of Lightning Network transactions that update the tentative distribution of the channel's funds without broadcasting those to the blockchain, optionally followed by closing the payment channel by broadcasting the final version of the settlement transaction to distribute the channel's funds. To perform as intended, Lightning Network required a transaction malleability fix in the layer 1 blockchain, such as Segregated Witness (SegWit) in bitcoin. History Joseph Poon and Thaddeus Dryja published a draft of the Lightning Network white paper in February 2015. In 2017 the bitcoin community activated SegWit which enabled second layer solutions such as the Lightning Network. On March 15, 2018, Lightning Labs CEO Elizabeth Stark announced the initial release of \`lnd 0.4-beta\` for developers, with the intent on making it available for testing purposes on the main Bitcoin network with Litecoin support. The network was endorsed by mobile payment entrepreneur Jack Dorsey. =2019 bitcoin lightning torch= On January 19, 2019, pseudonymous Twitter user hodlonaut began a game-like promotional test of the Lightning Network by sending 100,000 satoshis (0.001 bitcoin) to a trusted recipient where each recipient added 10,000 satoshis ($0.34 at the time) to send to the next trusted recipient. The \\"lightning torch\\" payment reached notable personalities including Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, Lightning Labs CEO Elizabeth Stark, and Binance CEO \\"CZ\\" Changpeng Zhao, among others. The lightning torch was passed 292 times before reaching the formerly hard-coded limit of 4,390,000 satoshis. The final payment of the lightning torch was sent on April 13, 2019 as a donation of 4,290,000 satoshis ($217.78 at the time) to Bitcoin Venezuela, a non-profit that promotes bitcoin in Venezuela. Design A Lightning Network overview Andreas Antonopoulos has referred to the Lightning Network as a second layer routing network. The payment channels allow participants to transfer money to each other without having to make all their transactions public on the blockchain. This is done by penalizing uncooperative participants. When opening a channel, participants must commit an amount (in a funding transaction, which is on the blockchain). Time-based script extensions like CheckSequenceVerify and CheckLockTimeVerify make the penalties possible. The CheckSequenceVerify (CSV) Bitcoin Improvement Proposal details how Hash Time- Locked Contracts are implemented with CSV and used in Lightning: BIP 0112. =Benefits= There are several claimed future benefits to using the Lightning Network compared to on-chain transactions: *Granularity: According to Andreas Antonopoulos, some implementations of the Lightning Network allow for payments that are smaller than a satoshi, the smallest unit on the base layer of bitcoin. Routing fees paid to intermediary nodes on the Lightning Network are frequently denominated in millisatoshis or msat. *Privacy: The details of individual lightning network payments are not publicly recorded on the blockchain. Lightning network payments may be routed through many sequential channels where each node operator will be able to see payments across their channels, but they will not be able to see the source nor destination of those funds if they are non-adjacent. *Speed: Settlement time for lightning network transactions is under a minute and can occur in milliseconds. Confirmation time on the bitcoin blockchain, for comparison, occurs every ten minutes, on average. *Transaction throughput: There are no fundamental limits to the amount of payments per second that can occur under the protocol. The amount of transactions are only limited by the capacity and speed of each node. =Limitations= The Lightning Network is made up of bidirectional payment channels between two nodes which combined create smart contracts. If at any time either party drops the channel, the channel will close and be settled on the blockchain. Due to the nature of the Lightning Network's dispute mechanism, which requires all users to watch the blockchain constantly for fraud, the concept of a \\"watchtower\\" has been developed, where trust can be outsourced to watchtower nodes to monitor for fraud. Another limitation the Lightning Network faces is payment routing, a concept discussed below. = Routing = In the event that a bi-directional payment channel is not open between the transacting parties, the payment must be routed through the network. This is done using an onion routing technique similar to Tor, and it requires that the sender and receiver of the payment have enough established peers in common to find a path for the payment. In effect, a simple route would look like this: * Bob wants to pay Alice 1 BTC but Bob and Alice don't have a channel open with each other. * Bob does have a channel open with Carol, and Alice also has a channel open with Carol * To route the payment, Bob sends 1 BTC to Carol, and Carol then sends 1 BTC to Alice The original whitepaper in reference to routing suggests that \\"eventually, with optimizations, the network will look a lot like the correspondent banking network, or Tier-1 ISPs\\".  Implementations  BOLT (Basis of Lightning Technology) specifications were drafted in late 2016. Several implementations were made: * Lightning Labs' lnd implementation in Go * Blockstream's c-lightning implementation in C * ACINQ's eclair implementation in Scala * A non-commercial implementation by MIT Digital Currency Initiative Use cases Cryptocurrency exchanges such as Bitfinex use it to enable deposits and withdrawals. Laszlo Hanyecz, who gained fame in the cryptocurrency community for paying 10,000 BTC for two pizzas in 2010, bought two more pizzas in 2018 using Lightning Network and paid 0.00649 BTC.

Vuorinen became a panelist on the show Hyvät ja huonot uutiset on Nelonen in 2017. =Writing= Books In spring of 1998, Vuorinen was asked to write a comedy piece for the keskus.net portal. He had just done a radio show about Tarno Manni whose play Mielipuolen päiväkirja (\\"Diary of a Maniac\\") gave him the idea for Juoppohullun päiväkirja (lit. \\"diary of a dipsomaniac\\"). At first, Vuorinen had a blog, but it was eventually made into a book at the request of his readers. After the first printer refused to print \\"this kind of shit\\", Vuorinen started his own self- publishing at a copy shop in Kerava. In 2002, the publisher Like was interested in the book and released it as a paperback, releasing 36,000 copies until Vuorinen bought back the rights for his own publishing company Diktaattori. By the end of 2013, 200,000 copies of Totally Smashed! had been sold. Totally Smashed! has been sold in Germany, Austria and Switzerland (as Göttlich versumpft: Aus dem Tagebuch eines Saufkopfs), Norway (as En finsk fyllefants dagbok), Sweden (as Dilledagboken) and Estonia (as Joomahullu päevaraamat). Vuorinen currently has nine of his books published in Estonian. The fourth volume of The Hangover Diaries, Vaippaihottuma (Diaper Rash!), became the most sold book in Estonia when it was released and is Vuorinen's fourth novel to be on Estonia's the top ten list. The book was translated into English in 2017. Vuorinen's books have virtually always been at the top of the paperback lists, outselling the 200,000 copy limit for receiving a Kultapokkari (\\"Golden Paperback\\") award. Vuorinen sells his books through Diktaattori Oy. In all, he has sold over 2 million books in Finland. Totally Smashed! was made into a film which premiered on December 28, 2012. It premiered in Estonia in January 2013. Once a year since 2009 Vuorinen has been releasing a charity paperback, with the proceeds going to, for example, homeless and women's shelters. Columns In May 2008, Vuorinen began writing columns for Metro Live online. In January 2011, he took his columns to Iltalehti. He began writing columns for Apu in April 2016.

(born 1938) is a Fijian former politician and educator. She served in the Cabinet of Fiji under the Soqosoqo ni Vakavulewa ni Taukei (SVT) during 1993–1995 and 1997–1999. In 1997, she became Fiji's first female Deputy Prime Minister. Biography Taufa Vakatale was born in 1938 on Batiki in the Lomaiviti Islands. Her parents were Alanieta Naucukidi and Mosese Vakatale, a Methodist minister. She attended primary school on Gau Island before enrolling in the first cohort of students at Adi Cakobau School, a government boarding school for girls on Fiji's main island, Viti Levu, in 1948. She received the New Zealand School Certificate in 1954. Three years later, she became the first indigenous Fijian girl to pass the New Zealand University Entrance examination and upon graduating from the University of Auckland in 1963, the first Fijian woman to receive a Bachelor of Arts degree. Vakatale returned to her boarding school, Adi Cakobau, as a teacher. She was the school principal from 1973 from 1979, making her the first indigenous Fijian woman to serve as a secondary school principal. She left the school to become a diplomat in 1980 and became the first indigenous Fijian woman appointed as a deputy high commissioner. She held various positions in the civil service, particularly in the field of education, and became Chief Education Officer in 1983. Vakatale left the civil service in 1990. She ran for election in 1992 under the Soqosoqo ni Vakavulewa ni Taukei (SVT) party ticket; she was elected and won a bid for re-election in 1994. Her win in 1992 made her the first Fijian woman elected as a cabinet minister. She was Minister of Education, Science and Technology from 1993 to 1995, but she was dismissed from her cabinet post in 1995 because, in contrast to the SVT's policies, she opposed French nuclear weapons testing in Moruroa Atoll in French Polynesia. In 1997, she was appointed Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Education and Technology, and in 1999 she became the first female president of the SVT. Vakatale resigned from the SVT in 2000 in opposition to the coup d'état by i-Taukei nationalists which had removed then-Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry from power. After retiring from politics, Vakatale worked in the private education sector. She was made an Officer of the Order of Fiji in 1996 and was awarded an honorary Doctor of Letters degree by the University of St Andrews in 2009. In 2012, she was selected as a member of the Constitutional Commission headed by Yash Ghai.

As with many tracks once in the area, this track originally ran across the ground surface but was later cut through a limestone reef to facilitate efficient and safe travel for people and small loads. The track would have been most important from the 1870s to 1921 as part of a direct route between Mount Salt Station and Mount Schank Station, head station of an enormous pastoral operation. Featuring three linear grooves, the track was designed for use by single animal (or file of animals) drawn cart or buggy. This design is unusual in limiting vehicle types able to use it. The track's design was never updated after 1921, when the State government repurchased most of the land for closer settlement.

The proposal with a budget of £3,770 involved the reuse of the “catoptric apparatus now at Cape Northumberland lighthouse.“ The lighthouse was described as being about high with the light's focal plane being about about the high water mark and that it would be visible as far away as . On 27 July 1882, Goss & Lambert of Mount Gambier was contracted for an amount of “about £3,000“ to build the “lighthouse, a store, and two lightkeepers' cottages.” The light was first used on 1 January 1883. In May 1928, an automated light was commissioned resulting in the departure of the keeper and their family. Offers for either the removal of the keepers’ cottages or for the lease of the cottages and associated land for periods of five or ten years were advertised in the press by the Commonwealth Department of Works and Railways in August 1928. The cottages and the store were subsequently demolished. The lighthouse has been listed as a state heritage place on the South Australian Heritage Register since 11 November 1999.

His work was heavily promoted by LensCulture. Plagiarism controversy In a May 2017 article in PetaPixel, Datta was exposed for plagiarising elements of an image by American photographer Mary Ellen Mark for a photo project on prostitution in Calcutta in 2013. Similar evidence emerged from other sources. Datta himself gave an interview to TIME Magazine, admitting these and other allegations, including the appropriation of images for use on social media originally taken by photographer Daniele Volpe in Guatemala. The incident led to Datta's work being taken down by a number of photojournalism websites while grants and awards were withdrawn by bodies such as the Pulitzer Center, Visura, Magnum Photos and the Alexia Foundation. Datta's profile on LensCulture was suspended \\"due to ethical concerns\\". Donald Weber described Datta's conduct as \\"utterly mind-blowing idiocy\\". Datta's breach of photojournalistic ethics kicked off a round of questioning and soul- searching in the photojournalism community at large.

Having been sent to photography the daily life of Sami people tribesmen living in a frigid environment, Datta presented to the judges a nighttime image of a man with a torchlight on his head facing away from the camera and illuminating the landscape. The judges assumed that the figure was one of the tribesman Datta had been assigned to document. However, in response to a question from judge Caroline Hunter of The Guardian, Datta explained that his approach to the assignment had in fact become more interpretive, that the subject was himself and that he had staged the image to capture the northern lights. Another judge, photographer Darcy Padilla, commented that Datta had \\"led us to believe [his style] was more reportage\\" and that he \\"could have done some more thinking\\". He nevertheless progressed to the final round and was runner-up in the competition.

Known for his research on quantum mechanics and other areas of condensed matter physics, Kumar was an elected fellow of the Indian Academy of Sciences. The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, the apex agency of the Government of India for scientific research, awarded him the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize for Science and Technology, one of the highest Indian science awards, for his contributions to physical sciences in 1988.  Biography  IIT Roorkee Born on 1 April 1946 in New Delhi, Kumar completed his early schooling at local schools in 1962 before joining St. Stephen's College, Delhi from where he graduated in science with honors in 1965. He continued his studies at the University of Delhi and after earning a master's degree in physics in 1967, he moved to the US to pursue his doctoral studies under the supervision of A. B. Harris at University of Pennsylvania to secure a PhD in 1972. Subsequently, he returned to India to start his career as a member of faculty of the physics department at University of Roorkee (present- day Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee). He served the institution for 16 years and when Jawaharlal Nehru University established a School of Physical Sciences, he returned to his native place to take up the position of a professor at the school in 1988. In between, he had a short spell in Germany as an Alexander von Humboldt Fellow during 1978–79. Kumar maintained his association with JNU for the rest of his life and it was during his return from the university on 25 January 2016, he fell ill. He died the next day at a local hospital, at the age of 69, survived by son, Sharad, and daughter. Jyoti.  Legacy  The main focus of Kumar's research in condensed matter physics was the theory related to disordered magnetic systems. At IIT Roorkee, he collaborated with a number of scientists such as Mustansir Barma and S. Shenoy and studied superparamagnetic particles, magnetic anisotropy and disordered ultrametric models. His work on the percolation threshold of anisotropic magnets widened the understanding of the fractal nature of spin clusters and was one of the first Indian scientists to estimate the consequences of the clusters near the percolation threshold. Binary liquids, statistical mechanics, phase separation, Stern–Gerlach measurement and Bell’s inequality were some of the other areas of his study for which he collaborated with many physicists including Subir Kumar Sarkar, Sanjay Puri, Rupamanjari Ghosh, Ramamurti Rajaraman and A. K. Rastogi. His studies have been documented by way of a number of articles and the online article repository of Indian Academy of Sciences has listed 98 of them. Besides, he co-edited two books viz. Proceedings Of The Discussion Meeting On Physics Of Defects with C. N. R. Rao, and Proceedings of the Conference on Quantum Many-Body Physics: From cosmology to superconductivity with S. Puri. He also wrote about the sociological aspects of education and research, contributed chapters to books published by others and his work has drawn citations from others.  Awards and honors  Deepak Kumar, an Alexander von Humboldt Fellow, was selected as a senior associate of Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics in 1986 and the Indian Academy of Sciences elected him as a fellow in 1987. The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research awarded him the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize, one of the highest Indian science awards in 1988.

It acts as a prequel to the film Baahubali: The Beginning. It was originally released in English on 7 March 2017, with Telugu, Hindi and Tamil versions released in April 2017. The story revolves around Sivagami, a character of Baahubali. The novel is intended to extrapolate the Baahubali films. It also tells the readers more about Kattappa, another important character of the story. Plot Sivagami hates the royal family of Mahishmati because their king, Somadeva, executed her father, Devaraya. She was informed that her father had left behind a book which held certain secrets, upon which she retrieved it from her father's house accompanied by her foster brother Raghava, who reveals that the book is written in Paisachi, an ancient language of Mahishmati. He proclaims his love for her, but Sivagami rejects his advances. He promises to find an empire more powerful than Mahismati to help overthrow it. Her foster father, Thimma, who raised her for 12 years after Devaraya's death, drops her off at the royal orphanage for a grave reason. On the way, Sivagami attempts to run away, but is followed by her foster sister Akhila who gets into a scuffle with a man for her pouch of pebbles. Thimma later kills the man. Kattappa and Shivappa are the sons of Malayappa, an experienced slave to the royal family. On a hunting party they go with the sons of Somadeva - Bijjaladeva and Mahadeva. Bijjaladeva, being the eldest, shows bravery but is corrupt, rude, brutal and heartless towards people who worked in Mahishmati. Mahadeva is sincere but weak at heart. Bijjala hits Kattappa, Shivappa in turn hurts Bijjala. His father punishes him, but Bijjala comments that the punishment given was not enough and pursues Shivappa, who leads him into a trap. Kattappa saves him and is promoted by Somadeva to the position of the Sevaka () of Bijjala. Parameshwara, the Mahapradhana (), is informed by the head blacksmith Dhamaka that they were short of Gaurikanta, a special stone derived from the volcano Gauriparvat, which is used to obtain the alloy Gauridhooli. When mixed with metal weapons, it makes the wielder invincible. A young blacksmith complaints about a leak to Parameshwara. Later, Parameshwara secretly tells his assistant Roopaka that the leak should be fixed for security, and that a blacksmith was missing, along with six Gaurikanta stones. Pattaraya, the Bhoomipathi (), a corrupt official, receives a message from Rudra Bhatta, the Rajguru (), that the blacksmith Nagayya, who stole the stones and went missing was making a lot of demands, including safe passage to Kadarimandalam with his wife and son. Nagayya says that he will not start working on the stones until his family is with him. Pratapa, the Dandanayaka (police chief) kicked him and takes the stones from him. Nagayya retaliates using his hammer, takes the stones and runs away. In the hustle that followed, a stone fell to the ground which was retrieved by Pattaraya, who hides it. Pratapa orders his men to search for Nagayya. Parameshwara reports to the king that the blacksmith was found dead with another man and the stones were still missing. He doubts whether Thimma will be up to task due to his closeness with Devaraya. Parameshwara says that he was admitting the daughter of Devaraya into the royal orphanage and demanded an audience with the king. Thimma requests that Sivagami stay in the royal orphanage until she is eighteen, which is a few months away. The king agrees, although he comments that they are harbouring a snake. He retires to the Antapura, where Senapati Hiranya informs him that Mahadeva was beaten by Shivappa and his performance was unsatisfactory. Sivagami notices that Mahadeva was really tall, handsome and a gorgeous prince. Mahadeva blushes when he notices Sivagami looking at her. Shivappa is scolded and beaten by Malayappa for defeating Mahadeva and says that slaves should know their place and not challenge princes. Shivappa talks with her lover and later tells Kattappa that he will marry her. He manages to fool Kattappa and run away. The eunuch Keki, the employee of Kalika(who owns a den for prostitutes to engage in sexual contact with men), teases Kattappa when visiting Bijjala. The two of them move out of the palace, followed by Kattappa, who has to do his duty. Keki leads Bijjala to Brihannala, another eunuch, who gives him the clothes of a merchant to disguise himself. Keki bribes the guards and smuggles Bijjala out of the palace. Brihannala turns into a man Dananjaya in his private chamber. He tells his adopted brother that he will turn into a man only after destroying Mahishmati and tells him that their mother Achi Nagamma did not reveal what she suffered to Nala as he was only adopted. Parameshwara meets Sivagami, who is impressed by his collection of books. She is surprised that there was never a female Mahapradhana. Later, the book comes in the hand of Skandadasa, through the head of Royal orphanage Revamma. Skandadasa was the Upapradhana of Mahishmati. He warns Sivagami that the book was gone missing twelve years back from the Royal library. If proof turns up, then it might turn up that Devaraya stole it from the Royal library. Skandadasa even suggested Sivagami run away in turn someone comes to know about it. But, Sivagami was sure that her father never did anything wrong and decided to stay put and work on her mission. She even decides to steal the book from Skandadasa's office. Katappa enters the forest to find Shivappa. He is found and arrested by the Vaithailis. They take him to Bhutaraya, leader of the Vaithailis. SHivappa is there willingly, as one of the soldiers in Bhutaraya's army. Bhutaraya calls himself as the true king of Mahismati. Mahishmati was once ruled by a tribal group called The Vaithailis. The story was told to Kattappa by the Vaithailis head Bhutaraya who reveals to Kattappa that it was one of his ancestors who deceived them. They provided shelter to Uthama Varma, who stole the secret Uthama Varma chases the Vaithailis into the forest using Gaurikanta and captures the Mahishmati kingdom. He knew the loose character of his elder brother yet, he never revealed it to his mother Queen Hemavati who called her elder son 'a rogue' and her younger son 'a coward'. Bijjala loathed Mahadeva but, Somadeva always praised Mahadeva and took all types of suggestions regarding royal matters from him even though everyone knew he was weak at heart and even got beaten by a slave Shivappa - the brother of slave Kattappa. Mahadeva helplessly falls in love with Sivagami and proposed her to marry. But, Sivagami laughs at him and even pities him. Mahadeva gets hurt by the response of Sivagami and feels the urge to commit suicide. But, the dreadful fate of Mahishmathi leads him to take an extra step and he fights with Shivappa who was one of the Vaithailis. The Vaithailis attack the royal palace. Mahadeva defends his kingdom and begets the title of Vikramadeva. Sivagami comes across a lots of mishaps on the day of the Mahamukum festival which was held for nine days. She tries to steal the book of her father from the office of Skandadasa who was then Mahapradhana but, end up watching Skandadasa getting killed by then corrupt officials Bhoomipathi Pattaraya, Rajaguru Rudra Bhatta and Dandanayaka Pratapa. This shocks her to the core and she realises that it was not only her father but, all the honest people in Mahishmati get assassinated for some reason or the other. She later gets chased by Dandanayaka Pratapa and ends up reaching the second floor of Antapura - the Royal Harem. There she got the golden chance of killing the King. But, things did not turn out to be as it was thought or planned. Though some of the tricks were played by Brihannala, the eunuch. Brihannala was the head of Royal Harem. She was the one who brought up the bravery of Sivagami in front of King Somadeva's eyes. Kamakshi, Sivagami's best friend, is raped and killed by Bijjaladev and Shivappa is paralyzed by Katappa. Somadeva chops off the head of Bhutaraya - the leader of the Vaithailis. On the other hand, Shivappa gets imprisoned by Kattappa himself who hands him over to King Somadeva as a traitor of the country. Sivagami, who arrived at Mahishmati with the intention to kill Somadeva, was praised as she had bravely killed the king's assassin and received the title of Bhoomipathi - the executioner. For unsuspecting Sivagami, the first execution she is to carry out is of her foster father Thimma. It was suspected from the words being shared between Somadeva and Sivagami was that Thimma might have been one of the members of Vaithailis. So, she needs to start her job by executing him. The story ends with a cliffhanger. SEQUEL A Sequel CHATURANGA was announced on 25th July 2020.It is scheduled to be released on 6th August 2020.

It was released on Microsoft Windows, macOS, Linux, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on March 15, 2018. The player serves as an overseer who must build a colony on Mars and ensure the survival of the colonists.  Gameplay  Surviving Mars is a city builder simulation game which takes place on Mars and is modeled after real Martian data. The player chooses a sponsoring nation, each conferring slightly different benefits and a unique building, and then lands on Mars with robotic drones and rovers. These rovers and drones prepare the colony for humans on the red planet by setting up power and water infrastructure, domes, resource depots, oxygen generators, and landing pads. The player's goal is to create a thriving colony on Mars with occasional rockets from Earth, which have limited cargo space, forcing the player to balance bringing resources from Earth and producing resources on Mars. For example, the first human colonists will bring limited food with them on their rocket, so hydroponic farms are crucial to a thriving colony on Mars. The player can bring electronics, machine parts, food, concrete, metal, prefab buildings, rovers and drones from Earth, or research technologies to manufacture them on Mars. Players must balance expanding the colony with managing oxygen, food, water and replacement parts. The game also has story lines called mysteries, which add various events to the colony, including plagues, war, rival corporations, AI revolt, alien contact, and others. Rare metals can be exported back to Earth for funds. Landing sites also have various natural disasters like meteor storms, cold waves and dust devils to increase difficulty. Development Haemimont Games, the developer of the Tropico series, led the game's development. The team studied science and challenges real-life scientists consider when thinking about colonizing Mars, then turned them into gameplay elements. The game's aesthetics were inspired by The Jetsons and Futurama. Describing the game as a \\"hardcore survival city- builder\\", publisher Paradox Interactive announced the game in May 2017. The game was released for Windows, macOS, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on March 15, 2018 with mod support. =Downloadable content= Surviving Mars has several DLCs, available either separately or as part of the digital season pass available in the game's \\"First Colony Edition\\". Space Race, the game's first expansion, was released on November 15, 2018, and introduces rival colonies competing to achieve milestones on Mars. The second, Green Planet, was released on May 16, 2019, and introduces the concept of terraforming Mars into a planet that can sustain human life. Several content packs were also released, including a building pack and the \\"Marsvision Song Contest\\" radio station (with the release of Space Race) and \\"Project Laika\\", which introduced ranching on Mars as well as pets in the colony (with the release of Green Planet). The city-builder game Cities: Skylines, also published by Paradox, received a free DLC based on Surviving Mars.  Reception  The game received generally favorable reviews according to review aggregator Metacritic, scoring 80% on PC Gamer, and 78/100 on IGN.

Plans for a new Scooby-Doo theatrical film began in June 2014, when Warner Bros. announced that they would reboot the Scooby-Doo film series with an animated film. Cervone was hired to direct the film in August 2015, with Dax Shepard being brought to co-direct it in September 2016. By October 2018, Shepard was no longer a part of the project.

Despite receiving mixed reviews from critics, it topped the digital rental charts in its first three weekends of release. To make up for its intended worldwide theatrical release, the film was theatrically released in select international countries beginning in July 2020.

Inside, the kids encounter a ghost, whom they capture and unmask as costumed thief Mr. Rigby. Inspired by the experience, they decide form a group, Mystery Inc., to solve mysteries together. Ten years later, Mystery Inc. goes into business with entrepreneur Simon Cowell as their investor, but Shaggy and Scooby are excluded as Cowell refuses to do business with them. Later that night, Shaggy and Scooby are attacked at a bowling alley and chased by small robots called Rottens. The pair are rescued by Dee Dee Skyes, Dynomutt, and the masked superhero, Blue Falcon. The Rottens are then revealed to belong to super criminal Dick Dastardly who wants to capture Scooby as part of a plan involving the mystery behind the three skulls of Cerberus. Meanwhile, Fred, Daphne, and Velma discover that Shaggy and Scooby are with Blue Falcon before Dastardly captures them. Escaping with the help of one of the Rottens, they make contact with Dee Dee via Dynomutt. Velma explains that she and the others are being taken to Messick Mountain, where the last skull is located. The group then finds out Dastardly's plan is to open the gates to the Underworld in order to rescue his dog Muttley, who was trapped during an attempt to steal the Underworld's riches, and Dastardly needs Scooby-Doo because only he can unlock the gates. Blue Falcon, Scooby, Dee Dee, and Dynomutt arrive at Messick Mountain and head underground to a hidden Mesozoic island. There they find the last skull being guarded by Captain Caveman. Following a short battle, Fred and Shaggy arrive, but Fred is revealed to be Dastardly in disguise as he steals the last skull. The Rottens then throw the real Fred, Daphne, and Velma out of his airship and Dastardly destroys the Falcon Fury. Dastardly then captures Scooby and takes him to Athens. After Shaggy gives an inspiring speech, everyone works together to reconstruct the Mystery Machine in order to pursue Dastardly. Arriving in Athens, Dastardly uses the three skulls to reveal the gate to the Underworld and attempts to use Scooby's paw to open it, only to be interrupted by Scooby's friends in a flying Mystery Machine. The Rottens shoot them down while Dastardly releases Cerberus; unaware that Dynomutt landed them safely. As Scooby, Dastardly, and the civilians flee from the rampaging Cerberus, Scooby runs to the crash site and reunites with his friends while Dastardly reunites with Muttley in the Underworld and they escape after stealing some of Alexander the Great's treasure. While determining how to capture Cerberus, Velma discovers more of the mystery behind Scooby's ancestry and its connection to the Underworld. With help from the Rottens, Mystery Inc. and friends trap Cerberus and put him back in the underworld. However, Shaggy sacrifices himself to lock the gate. The gang realize that there is another exit, which Scooby unlocks, and Shaggy is reunited with them. The Rottens turn on Dastardly and Muttley, who are arrested. Back home at Venice Beach, the gang unveils their new Mystery Inc. headquarters and celebrate with Blue Falcon, Dynomutt, and Dee Dee, who in turn give the gang an upgraded Mystery Machine before heading off to solve another mystery together.

Pictures announced that they would reboot the Scooby-Doo film series with an animated film, then being written by Randall Green. On August 17, 2015, Tony Cervone, who had previously worked on several Scooby-Doo projects, was hired to direct the animated film, now with a script by Matt Lieberman. Allison Abbate and Pam Coats produced the film, with Charles Roven and Richard Suckle among its executive producers. Dan Povenmire was set to be involved in a creative capacity, and was eventually also credited as an executive producer on the film. At the 2016 CinemaCon, the film's official title was announced to be S.C.O.O.B., with a plot involving Scooby-Doo and the Mystery Machine gang working for a larger organization. The film was intended to lead into a cinematic universe based on Hanna-Barbera properties. In September 2016, it was reported that Dax Shepard would co- direct the film along with Cervone, and would also revise the script. In October 2018, it was announced that Shepard was no longer part of the project, and Kelly Fremon Craig was set as a screenwriter instead. Ultimately, Adam Sztykiel, Jack Donaldson, Derek Elliott, and Matt Lieberman received screenplay credit, with Lieberman, Eyal Podell, and Jonathon E. Stewart having \\"story by\\" billing. = Casting = In March 2019, Frank Welker was revealed to be reprising his role as Scooby-Doo, while Will Forte, Gina Rodriguez, and Tracy Morgan signed on to voice Shaggy, Velma, and Captain Caveman, respectively. Later that month, Zac Efron and Amanda Seyfried joined the voice cast as Fred and Daphne, respectively. Matthew Lillard and Grey DeLisle, the longtime voices of Shaggy and Daphne, respectively, both expressed their disappointment at not being contacted about the decision to recast their roles. Efron's casting as Fred also marks a rare occasion in which the character has not been voiced by Welker, who has played Fred in most incarnations since the show's debut in 1969.Behind the Voice Actors: Fred Jones Behind the Voice Actors, Retrieved May 18, 2020 In April 2019, Ken Jeong and Kiersey Clemons were announced to be joining the cast.

It was announced on April 21, 2020 that Warner Bros. would release Scoob! digitally in the United States and Canada through Premium Video on demand on the originally scheduled date instead of in theaters. Variety wrote that releasing the film digitally was \\"a big risk — and an almost certain loss — for Warner Bros.,\\" but noted the success of Trolls World Tour in a similar release venue could be a positive sign. As the pandemic receded, Warner Bros. confirmed the film would still play in theaters in select countries with relaxed COVID-19 restrictions beginning July 8, 2020. On June 18, it was announced Scoob! would be available for streaming on HBO Max beginning June 26, 2020. The film was released on DVD, Blu-ray, and Ultra HD Blu-ray on July 21, 2020. = Marketing = The first official trailer was released on November 11, 2019.

In Spain, the film had a four-week running total of $1.6 million. , the film has grossed a total of $21.3 million from international territories. = VOD sales = Scoob! was the top-rented film on Prime Video, Google Play, FandangoNow, Spectrum, and the iTunes Store in its opening weekend. Although Warner Bros. did not report actual figures, the film had a higher sales count than Trolls World Tour, which made $40 million over its first three days. It remained the top-rented film across all services in its second weekend, then on three of four services in its third. In its fourth week it remained #1 on FandangoNow, while falling to second on Amazon Prime and fourth on the iTunes charts. In its fifth weekend of release Warner Bros. lowered the price from $19.99 to $14.99, and the film finished second on FandangoNow, Amazon Prime, and Spectrum, and fifth on iTunes. While no official numbers were released by Warner Bros., Deadline Hollywood estimated that by mid-June the film had made about 35–40% less than Trolls World Tour (which had itself totaled at least $100 million in sales over its first month). =Critical response= On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 49% based on 143 reviews, with an average rating of 5.21/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"Scoob! is fun enough for youthful viewers and some hardcore fans, but never quite solves the mystery of why audiences shouldn't watch old episodes instead.\\" At Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 43 out of 100, based on 33 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews.\\" In his review for The Mercury News, Randy Myers wrote, \\"Scoob! is a goofy and bright surprise - an imaginative reboot that respects its shaggy dog TV roots but is smart enough to add dashes, not shovelfuls, of wry pop-culture and movie references.\\" Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune gave the film 2.5 out of 4 stars and said, \\"I'm reasonably happy to report that it's a reasonably diverting reboot. It's also ridiculously overpacked, crammed with Hanna-Barbera cartoon characters from various TV series beyond Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!\\" USA Todays Brian Truitt, who also gave the film 2.5 out of 4 stars, found the opening \\"super-fun\\" but thought everything else was “Ruh-roh” after that. Peter DeBruge of Variety wrote that \\"this attractive but calculated attempt to connect Scooby-Doo to other Hanna-Barbera characters abandons the show's fun teen-detective format,\\" and RogerEbert.coms Christy Lemire gave the film 1.5 out of 4 stars, finding the origin story to be \\"confounding and convoluted for a pretty straightforward Saturday morning cartoon.\\"  Notes   References   External links   Scoob! on Rotten Tomatoes Category:2020 computer-animated films Category:2020 films Category:2020s adventure comedy films Category:2020s American animated films Category:2020s animated films Category:2020s children's animated films Category:2020s comedy mystery films Category:American adventure comedy films Category:American children's animated adventure films Category:American children's animated comedy films Category:American children's animated mystery films Category:American comedy mystery films Category:American computer-animated films Category:American films Category:Animated crossover films Category:Animated films about dogs Category:Animated films about friendship Category:Atlas Entertainment films Category:Films directed by Tony Cervone Category:Films produced by Chris Columbus Category:Films scored by Junkie XL Category:Films with screenplays by Matt Lieberman Category:Hanna-Barbera animated films Category:Reboot films Category:Films set in Greece Category:Films set in Athens Category:Reel FX Creative Studios films Category:Scooby-Doo animated films Category:Warner Bros.

Robinson Department of Special Collections, \\"John M. Hancock Papers, 1903-1956; Administrative/Biographical History,\\" at apps.library.und.edu. Accessed 12-05-2017 He is known for distinguished achievement in industrial management in the private and public sector, for which he has been awarded the Henry Laurence Gantt Medal in 1944.American Management Association, The Henry Laurence Gantt Memorial Gold Medal: John Milton Hancock, medalist, 1945.  Biography  = Youth and education = Born in Emerado, North Dakota in 1883, Hancock was the son of Henry and Isabel (Irvine) Hancock. A 1950 newspaper article recalled, that \\"it was thirty below zero the February 2, 1883, that John Milton Hancock was born in Emerado... by the light of a kerosene lamp. If life in North Dakota lacked modern conveniences, it was also remarkably free of modern apprehensions.\\"The Saturday Evening Post, Vol. 222, 1950, p. 152 Hancock's father originated from Canada, had set up a farm in North Dakota in 1878, and had founded the town of Emerado. In town he was also partner in the local hardware store and a realtor in the township. The family originated from Britain, and one of their forebears had been British drummer boy at the Battle of Waterloo.Maxine Block, Anna Herthe Rothe, Marjorie Dent Candee (1950), Current Biography Yearbook. p. 239 In 1897 the family moved to Grand Forks, North Dakota, where after preparatory college Hancock attended the University of North Dakota obtaining his AB in 1903. At the University Hancock participated in the football team, until serious injuries forced him out of the game three years later. In those days he also participated in the newly founded literary society, and was editor-in-chief of The Student, the student magazine of the university. = Early career in the US navy = After a year as principal in a high school in Tower City, North Dakota, Hancock enlisted in the US Navy in 1904. He joined Bureau of Supplies and Accounts, and started as storekeeper in Olongapo Naval Station in the Philippines, now the U.S. Naval Base Subic Bay, and out on the see with the USS Galveston. In the last five years before World War I Hancock served Navy yards back in the States in Boston, Philadelphia, and Puget Sound, and returned to the Philippines to the Naval Base Cavite. he was on the Wilmington-class gunboat USS Helena on the Yangtze River in China, when war broke loose. In 1914 Hancock was appointed head of the US Navy Bureau of Supplies and Accounts, and was promoted to the rank of lieutenant commander in 1916, and commander in 1918. The University of North Dakota (2017) recalled that \\"ss head of the purchasing division, Hancock made purchases of Navy supplies in excess of $2 million per day. He designed a system based on commodity sections: estimates were made to reflect as closely as possible the Navy’s material needs, and contact was maintained with the country’s industries. The Navy's newly legalized authority to award contracts based on profitability prompted the War Industries Board to form a price-fixing committee, of which Hancock was a member. From April to August 1917, he served on the General Munitions Board, and in 1919 accompanied Franklin D. Roosevelt, then Assistant Secretary of the Navy, to dispose of accumulated naval equipment overseas. Hancock also established organizations to settle claims against the Navy.\\" = Private sector and back in Washington = After World War I Hancock moved to the private sector to join the Lehman Brothers in New York City, where he came into prominence.Steve Fraser, Gary Gerstle.

Again the University of North Dakota (2017), recalled that the \\"Jewel Tea Company, Chicago, Illinois... had been financed by them and was now deep in debt. The company had been operating at an annual loss of $2 million, along with a substantial debt of $4.5 million. Hancock came on board as vice-president and under his watch implemented corrective strategies: unprofitable branches were closed, low-volume routes were dropped, inventories were substantially reduced to provide badly needed cash, common dividends were canceled, and preferred dividends were deferred. After these changes were implemented, the result was a complete turnaround for the company. By 1924, the company's annual profit was $750,000.\\" In 1922 Hancock had been appointed assigned president of the Jewel Tea Company, and in 1924 he became partner in Lehman Brothers, a milestone since he was the first partner not to be a Lehman family member. In the next decennia Hancock was interim-director in more company's such as Sears, Cluett Peabody & Company, Brunswick Corporation, and Kroger. In the 1930s he also got into civil affairs. Hancock was also involved in civil affairs again. He was executive officer in the National Recovery Administration in 1933, member of the War Production Board in 1939, and assistant director in the Office of War Mobilization in 1943 appointed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. In 1942 he had done a government survey of the rubber industry with Bernard Baruch, and in 1946 again joined him as general manager of the U.S. Delegation to the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission.  Reception  One of Hancock's most remarkable accomplishments was reported in Time (magazine) in 1944: :\\"For about 18 months the Army, Navy and other war procurement agencies have quick-fingered a hot potato that never grew cool. The problem: How could U.S. war contracts be ended uniformly and quickly so that the industrial plant could speedily shift from one war product to another and reconvert without waste motion at the war's end? : When a solution seemed finally impossible, the hot potato was tossed over to Elder Statesman Bernie Baruch and his assistant, ex-Wall Street Banker John Milton Hancock. The two cooled it off in just two months and two days. Then the Baruch-Hancock combination presented Home Front Czar James F. Byrnes with a contract-cancellation clause, ready-made to fit almost all fixed-fee contracts. Promptly Czar Jimmy ordered it put into effect...\\"\\"Briton Hadden, Henry Robinson Luce. Time, Vol. 43. 1944, p. 84 In recognition of his achievements Hancock received US Navy Distinguished Service Cross in 1919, the Henry Laurence Gantt Medal in 1945 by the American Management Association and the ASME, and the US Army Medal of Merit in 1948. In 1950 the Hamilton College in New York, and the New York University both granted him an honorary degrees.  Publications  * Bernard Baruch, John M. Hancock.

Joseph Waite, Cambridge University Press, 1893, and online .pdf here. Waite collected the poems and wrote the preface. He was born on 8 March 1816, 4th son of David Evans, of Belper. He had a very good memory for architectural detail in buildings. From 9 years old he was tutored by an uncle, George Evans, vicar of Ruyton-XI-Towns, including in Latin and Greek. At age 12 he was transferred to Shrewsbury School. There he wrote many Latin and Greek poems, many voluntarily and inspired by personal events and escapades, as well as school exercises. There in 1834 he won the blue ribbon of Shrewsbury for the best poem in Latin hexameters on a given theme, which that year was \\"Arcticus Oceanus\\". His entry was described as \\"The exercise which has been successful this year is one of no ordinary kind. It is worthy of Vergil.\\". Joseph Waite (editor of the book referenced below) could not find any copy of this entry; but Evans recited about ten lines of it shortly before he died. In April 1835 at age 19 he joined St John's College, Cambridge, where he achieved well in Latin and Ancient Greek matters and won several prizes, including in 1838 the Porson Prize, and in 1839 he got the degree B.A.. He did not get Mathematical Tripos, and thus the university's rules stopped him from going for Classical Honours. In 1841 he was appointed a Classical Master at Shrewsbury School under Dr Benjamin Hall Kennedy. In 1843 a sister of his died after a day's illness, and Waite wrote that the distress caused may have pushed Evans into going for Holy Orders. In 1844 he was ordained deacon. In 1846 he was ordained priest. Later he became a curate at St.Mary's in Shrewsbury (added to his other duties), and sometimes he preached there. In 1847 he became a schoolmaster at Rugby School. In 1849 he married Miss Rosamond Broughton of Llwynygroes House, Llanymynech. His two daughters and three sons were born at Rugby. In 1862 he became Professor of Greek and Classical Literature in the University of Durham, and thus became a Canon of Durham Cathedral. He lived in Durham nearly 28 years. The old stone buildings and wooded slopes in Durham inspired him to write many admiring Latin and Greek verses. In November 1863 his wife died after long illness, and this upset him severely. In 1870 his youngest son died aged 8 of a fever. During these times he translated much English poetry into Latin and Greek verse, and composed much new matter in Latin and Greek verse. He communicated with Hugh Andrew Johnstone Munro. From about 1886 his health deteriorated. He went to spas a few times in Switzerland and Germany with no effect. In 1889 he went to London for medical examination and treatment, with good results. He moved to Weston-super-Mare and lived with some of his family members. There, while appearing to improve, he died on 15th May 1889, aged 73, stated to be of embolism, and was buried in Durham Cathedral churchyard. The last words that he is recorded as saying, a few minutes before he died, were in Latin: \\"Atrae iuvencae lac Acherontium\\" (an iambic trimeter) (\\"milk of a black heifer of Acheron\\", referring to a black medicine that had been prescribed for him).

VSLS are responsible for atmospheric damage once they enter the stratosphere and are a contributing factor to the destruction of ozone. Description VSLS are ozone-depleting halogen-containing substances found in the stratosphere. These substances have very short lifetimes, typically less than 6 months. Approximately 90% of VSLS are produced by natural processes and their rate of production is increasing. “They are bromine compounds produced by seaweed and the ocean's phytoplankton”.Puiu, T.

VSLS are responsible for atmospheric damage once they enter the stratosphere and are a contributing factor to the destruction of the ozone layer. In previous decades it was believed that the most significant factor in ozone depletion was the increase in chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). Currently VSLS are increasing rapidly, mainly due to industrial activities. The primary VSLS is n-propyl bromide (CHBr). It has been forecast that brominated VSLS will increase to about 8 - 10 % of the total VSLS emission by the end of 21st century. There has not been much research in this area, although this is changing as more scientists study this substance to predict its long-term impact on ozone levels.

One study has shown that every five additional parts per trillion by volume (pptv) of VSLS in the atmosphere reducesthe global ozone column by about 1.3%. Long-term calculations of VSLS injection into the stratosphere reveal a robust correlation between sea surface temperature, convective activity and the number of short-lived source gases in the tropical tropopause layer (TTL), which becomes especially clear during the perturbations induced by El Niño seasons. This trend is attributed to increased activity by bromine-generating marine life under warmer temperatures and indicates that VSLS concentration will likely increase over the 21st century due to climate change.

It is in the collection of the Mauritshuis and exhibited at the Gallery Prince Willem V. Early history and creation This work was painted in Amsterdam where it was signed and dated Guill.mo van Aelst. 1663. Van Aelst had recently returned from Italy and thus signed as \\"Guillelmo\\" rather than Willem. He remained in Amsterdam until his death and was a strong influence on other Amsterdam flower painters, including Rachel Ruysch. Description and interpretation The work shows a watch with a blue ribbon attached. It is not clear which watchmaker designed it. The bouquet shows Rosa gallica, poppy, Pieris, Myosotis, Gentiana, Viburnum opulus, Tagetes lucida, Tagetes patula, butterfly, Southern Hawker, and Calliphoridae. The vase itself is an object created by Johannes Lutma in the auricular style. The painting follows in a tradition of Dutch and Flemish flower still life paintings showing a pocket watch attached to a blue ribbon with a wind-up key. This is one of many recurring symbols of the Vanitas genre that Van Aelst and others used: File:Jan Davidsz. de Heem - Flower Still-life with Crucifix and Skull - WGA11259.jpgJan Davidsz de Heem, 1630s File:Jan van Kessel de Oude - Stilleven met bloemen in een glazen vaas, samen met een atalanta vlinder etc.jpgJan van Kessel the elder, 1652 File:Willem van Aelst - Vase of Flowers with Pocket Watch - WGA00050.jpgWillem van Aelst, 1656 File:Willem van Aelst - Bloemenstilleven met horloge.jpgWillem van Aelst, 1663 Later history and influence The painting is one of many from the Dutch Royal collection at Het Loo Palace, Apeldoorn.

It was demolished in 2011. Alziro Bergonzo (30 December 1906 – 22 May 1997) was an Italian architect and painter. His primary style was the rationalized Stile Littorio. He was the son of Luigi Bergonzo, an engineering graduate from Bern who had moved to Bergamo in the early 1900s. He studied at the Liceo Sarpi, before enrolling at the Faculty of Architecture at the Polytechnic University of Milan in 1925, where he met Franco Albini and . His studies were interrupted by military service, but he graduated in 1933. He worked in his father's established studio, which helped him get to know directly other renowned professionals and artists in the field of decoration. The quality of his early work was noted and he began to receive commissions from various public and private clients, most often in Bergamo. When World War II broke out, he moved his studio to Rome, where he participated in the competition of the EU42 and collaborated with Luigi Moretti for the Foro Italico. After the war, he was purged from the professional register for political reasons, but in 1946 he was reinstated and won a competition for the Lido di Venezia. Bergonzo's post-war work includes the Casa Trussardi in Bergammo, the in Milan, port works in Saudi Arabia, and a theatre in Cairo. He also designed the fourth City Gate of Valletta, Malta in the mid-1960s. After designing many public works, Bergonzo began to reserve his projects for private clients, at the same time devoting some of his time to painting, especially in the last few years of his life. He died in Milan in 1997, shortly after the opening of his last major work, the new Piazza della Libertà in Bergamo.

It is a national women's health charity which aims to raise awareness and funds for research into, and treatment of, gynaecological cancers. The foundation was started by a group of high-profile women, all of whom had been affected by gynaecological cancer in some capacity. Among these women are Jenny Halpern Prince, Tamara Beckwith Veroni, Chloe Delevingne, Astrid Harbord, Kate Percival, Josephine Daniel, Mika Simmons and Bridget Barker. It notably launched the Lady Garden Campaign on social media during Gynaecological Cancer Awareness Month in September 2015. Amber Le Bon, Jazzy De Lisser and Anais Gallagher were the faces of the campaign, with many other celebrities endorsing the charity and its Lady Garden Campaign. In 2016, Topshop partnered with the Lady Garden Foundation to sell merchandise to promote the charity and its campaigns. Most notably Cara Delevingne was the face of this campaign. In 2017, the Lady Garden Foundation partnered with Selfridge's to sell t-shirts designed by Simeon Farrar in collaboration with Naomi Campbell, the Delevingne sisters, Suki Waterhouse and Charlotte Tilbury. Background The Lady Garden Foundation (previously the Gynaecological Cancer Fund) was launched in 2014 in order to raise funds and awareness of a number of gynaecological cancers. Many of the cancers, such as cervical cancer, ovarian cancer, womb cancer, vaginal cancer and vulval cancer, have high death rates in developed countries, due to a lack of understanding and treatments. The charity has also created a number of fashionable items, such as hoodies, which have appeared in Hello! and Vanity Fair. Dr. Susana Banerjee at The Royal Marsden Hospital is one of the main beneficiaries of the funds raised by the charity. Her treatment is aimed at targeted treatment for women with gynaecological cancers. The original mission of the charity was to raise £750,000 for Dr Banerjee over three years. This was achieved in early 2018 and the foundation now funds various research projects at The Royal Marsden. Shortly after its establishment, the Lady Garden Foundation held a number of notable fundraising events to raise money for the cause. The events began in 2015, when they hosted a lunch for gynaecological cancer charities at Fortnum & Mason in London. In 2016, a Gala was held by Chopard and hosted by Naomie Harris. The Duchess of York was also in attendance. In April 2016, the campaign held its first Lady Garden 5k, which took place in Battersea Park, London. Since 2015 onwards, various fashion icons and companies have designed accessories and clothing to promote the Fund and its campaigns. It notably signed an agreement with the retailer Topshop to sell Lady Garden hoodies during Gynaecological Cancer Awareness Month. In early 2017, Marloe London also designed a scarf for the Gynaecological Cancer Fund.. The charity then partnered with Selfridge's in 2017, and more recently, Stripe & Stare in November 2018. Lady Garden Campaign The Lady Garden Campaign was started by the charity as a social media campaign to raise awareness for numerous cancers. It also wanted to promote screening and also funding for the treatment of gynaecological cancers. Since 2015, the campaign has coordinated its promotional efforts around Gynaecological Cancer Awareness Month, which takes place in Britain every September. The social media campaign was started after research suggested that over a third of women were too embarrassed to go to the doctor with gynaecological concerns in the United Kingdom. The campaign was launched in 2015, to raise awareness and funds for the treatment of gynaecological cancer. It was launched in conjunction with Gynaecological Cancer Awareness Month in September. As soon as the social media campaign was launched, it saw huge celebrity endorsements online, from the likes of Ellie Goulding, Margot Robbie, Alexa Chung and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley on social media. The media suggested that the campaign went viral in the summer of 2015, reaching more than 40 million people on social media within 24 hours. After the campaign's launch in 2015, the Lady Garden Foundation carried out research to measure the impact of the cancer awareness campaign. They discovered that 81 percent of women exposed to the campaign were more aware of gynaecological health, while 59 percent were more aware of the symptoms of gynaecological cancers.

It offers Bachelor Of Fine Arts (Degree)(B.F.A.) to students of North-East India. History The School of Art was initially started in a single room in the Don Bosco School at Paanbazar in 1947 by late Jibeswar Baruah. Jibeswar Baruah was the head of the school till 1964. In 1948 the school of art started to receive a recurring grant of Rs. 50.00 per month from the State Government. After few bad patches it moved to a rented house in Panbazar. It was a time when art was almost a taboo for the high or middle-class families to be taken it seriously. The grant was subsequently increased to Rs. 150.00. In 1959 it was further increased to Rs. 300.00 per month when it shared a portion of a two-storeyed building at Lakhtokia with the State Lalit Kala Akademi. Late Jibeswar Barua was also the Secretary of state Lalit Kala Academi. The art classes were continued at the two rooms of the first floor which had three rooms, one room being used as an office. During that period, one major break in the story rather history of the School came when Prof Humayun Kabir, the late Honourable Minister of Education and Scientific Research, Govt. of India inaugurated an exhibition arranged at the second floor of the District Library. The exhibits were collected from living artist and art students at the time and included works from the teachers and students of the school. It was indeed a tremendous success to far as the enthusiasm it created among the visitors which neared about three thousand was concerned, but not so with the Press where the event could hardly find a single mention. The exhibition was organized at the instance of the late Shri B. P. Chaliha, the then Honourable Chief Minister, Assam. Another impeccable event was when Shri K. P. Padmanabhan Thampy, the art critic from Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, was inaugurated an exhibition of works of contemporary artists. It was in 1961 the year of Rabindra Nath Tagore Centenary Celebration that the exhibition was organized. The first annual exhibition of the school students was arranged during the Saraswati Puja in 1961. From then on, it was a regular feature every year, with few exceptions when circumstances were not in favour Important people, art connoisseurs, art lovers, men in high office, dignitaries, journalist, intellectuals were invited to inaugurate the exhibition and to grace the functions as honored guests. Satyajit Ray, the celebrated film maker visited the Tagore exhibition. Late Dr. Birinchi Kumar Baruah, Justice S. K. Dutta, Dr. m. Neog, late Joy Bhadra Hagjer, the then Education Minister, Assam, veteran journalist Shri S. C. Kakati, Prof. Nva Kanta Baruah, honorable Ministers, Education and others inaugurated the exhibitions year after year. A sad part of the story was on 31 January 1964, when Shri Jibeswar Baruah became mortally sick. The school was still not its full grown state. The School of Art was without a foothold; without a piece of land and building to stand on ; the only asset it had was the monthly grant of Rs. 300.00- and few belongings. After Jibeswar Baruah's sad demise, the Lalit Kala Akademi and the School of Art were separated; the assets belonging to the Lalit Kala were taken charge of by the new incumbent and those of the School of Art by his counterpart. It was a divided house and the owner of the building also declined to rent the house further. So, with a past which was not so palatable and the future or present equally uncertain, the School of Art was headed by Sobha Brahma, moved to Santipur, Guwahati and established itself in a small rented building newly constructed. A new chapter in the history of the institution was commenced. In the meantime, artists trained in the Visva-Bharti and the Govt. College of Art. Calcutta began to pour in. There was practically no place to absorb them, for art was never taken seriously. Some of them served the School for some time at certain periods. But, each of them was compelled to quit for obvious reasons; the minimum remuneration for their service was eluding them. It was the hardest of times art was never taken for seriously the Press though friendly by the time, could help little; the Government officials and ministers were too busy with matters more of national importance. For them art could always wait, others are not. It was the first phase of the history in its second phase in Sanitipur the school had its opportunity. It was the latter part of the sixties a benevolent Chief Minister, an equally benevolent Education Minister, legislators known for their service to art throughout their lives, late Bishnu Prasad Rabha, Late Lakshyadhar Chowdhury, Late Dr Bhupen Hazarika few lady social workers. They all made possible the Provincialisation of the Institution on first September, 1970. The present Govt. School of Art & Craft thus came into being. In 1971-72, the control of the Govt. School of Art & Craft Assam was transferred to the newly created Directorate of Cultural Affairs from the Directorate of Public Instructions. In 1979 twenty bighas of land was allocated to the School of Art, under auspicious endeavors of Sri Jyoti Prasad Rajkhowa, when he was the D.C. Kamrup. Two Assam-type houses constructed at the time are being used as a student hostel and for sculptures including that of the principal. The Gauhati University has lent affiliation to the Institution for starting Bachelor of Fine Arts Degree Course from the academic session of 1988-89 onward. In 2005 September, the entire college which was running from a depreciated rented house at Santipur Hillside ever since 1968 moved to its newly constructed building at Basistha. The new campus and administrative building was conducted in a befitting manner by the honorable Chief Minister of Assam Sri Tarun Gogoi. This is indeed a Historic event for the Government College OF Art & Crafts Assam. For the first time the institute has fulfilled its basic requirements for its students. Now the institute also had fulfilled the primary requirements as a full-fledged Visual Art Institute as per with order such college of the UGC. Courses The Government College of Arts and Crafts Assam offers Bachelor Of Fine Arts in four subjects Applied Art, Graphics (print making), Painting and Sculpture.

About 125 of the fountains were donated to cities throughout the United States and Mexico between 1902 and 1915. Most of the fountains have been removed from their original sites, usually in the center of busy intersections, but at least 70 of them are still publicly viewable. Two examples are listed on the National Register of Historic Places: one in Des Moines, Iowa (also known as the Southeast Water Trough) and one in Albuquerque, New Mexico. History The National Humane Alliance was founded in 1897 by Hermon Lee Ensign, a philanthropist and animal welfare advocate who had amassed a fortune in the advertising business. When he died in 1899, he left much of his wealth to build animal drinking fountains for any city that requested one. The fountains were provided free of charge as long as the city provided an appropriate site, water supply, and maintenance. Between 1904 and 1912, more than 100 cities took advantage of the offer. The fountains were produced in Vinalhaven, Maine by the Bodwell Granite Company, the same company that supplied the stone blocks for the Brooklyn Bridge. The fountains' original use became obsolete not long after they were installed as motor vehicles replaced horses in urban areas. Mostly located in busy intersections, the fountains became traffic hazards and many of them were removed to parks or other quieter locations. Nevertheless, around 70 of the fountains are still publicly viewable, including several examples that have been restored and are still functional. Design An example of the plaque which appears on each fountain The fountains are not all identical, but most share one of two basic designs. The most common version is tall, consisting of a large circular bowl with a square pillar rising from its center placed on a square pedestal. The main bowl, intended for horses, is in diameter and is fed by bronze spigots in the shape of lion heads on three sides of the upper pillar. The fourth side contains a bronze plaque listing details of the fountain's construction. The lower pedestal is high and has niches on each side with drinking bowls near ground level for dogs, cats, and other small animals. The fountain is assembled from five pieces of granite weighing in total. The second fountain design has a smaller bowl and a round, rather than square, pedestal. These were intended for smaller cities and other locations where the bigger fountain, which could accommodate eight horses at a time, was considered unnecessarily large. Some of the fountains originally had decorative light standards mounted on top; however, few of these have survived. Locations More than 100 cities across the United States received the fountains, and at least 70 are still in existence. (A handful were also located in Mexico and Puerto Rico.) Derby, Connecticut has a website dedicated to the fountains that includes an interactive map of the United States with locations and pictures.

At the time, enrollment had dropped to 185 students and there was only one building in the downtown area. It was apparent that the university did not have the funding needed to match the needs of the returning World War II veterans. The budget that year $103,000.40. Working with another VU alumnus and chairman of the college's Board of Trustees, Judge Curtis Shake, Beckes was able to make some rapid improvements with the university through a local capital funds drive. The city and the U.S. government donated Harrison Park to the school for use as a new campus and the new classroom and administration building was moved into in October 1953. The rest of the buildings were composed of the city water utilities’ old renovated pump house and some army surplus structures. Other nearby vacant industrial building were later bought and renovated causing Shake to comment that \\"the school had the best second- hand campus in the U.S.\\" In 1955 the Indiana Legislature agreed to provide two dollars of funding for every dollar that was raised by a Knox County tax that supported the university. The college and its two-year programs were approved and fully accredited by the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools in 1956, and the school grew rapidly thereafter. This allowed the school to build a new student union building in 1959 and a new library in 1960. In 1957 he signed a trial (one year) transfer agreement with Frederick L. Hovde of Purdue University. The agreement allowed students at VU who completed as associate degree in Agriculture to transfer to Purdue to complete their bachelor's degree. VU students are treated the same as Purdue students who are entering their junior year. The agreement has been offered continuously since it was first signed. When Colonel Eugene C. Wharf died his widow, Mrs. Stella C. Wharf, conveyed the family home, Shadowwood, to the university as a memorial. At the suggestion of Judge Shake, Beckes worked to transfer the property to the Grand Chapter of the Sigma Pi fraternity for use as its national headquarters in August 1961. The fraternity had been founded at the university in 1897. Mrs. Wharf heartily approved of the deal. In 1964 Beckes appointed Fred Walker to create a journalism program for the college. VU also established its own cable television outlet. With the growth and accreditation of the school, Beckes looked for other ways to enhance the university. Working with Sigma Pi, he was able to get an exemption from the North American Interfraternity Conference (NIC) in 1964. The NIC had forbade fraternity chapters at junior colleges. He helped form an interest group known as the Corinthian Club that eventually became a colony of the fraternity. When the Alpha chapter’s charter was granted in 1965, he was initiated into the organization with the undergraduate members and their faculty advisor. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Beckes served as a director for the National League of Nursing. He would have an affiliation with the group into the early 1980s. As the school grew, it began getting line-item funding in the Indiana state budget in 1965. It also grew more complex and Dr. Beckes, along with VU Director of Administrative Services Robert Stryzinski, worked with the legislature to revamp the school’s Board of trustees from twenty-four members to a more manageable number in 1976. That year the school’s budget was over $5 million. Retirement When Beckes resigned as president in 1980, the school had grown to 4,600 students with a campus of 85 acres and fifty buildings After retirement he continued to improve the university as head of the VU Alumni Foundation and as a member of the Vincennes Area Community Development Corporation. He died at Good Samaritan Hospital in Vincennes in 1988. Honors In 1964, Beckes was given the Indiana State University Distinguished Alumni Award. On May 17, 1980, he received an Honorary LL.D Degree from Indiana State University - Muncee. In the summer of 1980 he received Sigma Pi Fratenity’s Founders’ Award. In 1981, he was given the Walter A. Davis Citation by the Vincennes University Alumni Association. In 1992, VU built a new student center which was named for him. The Knox County Development Corporation named their industrial park in his honor.

Although Christian, he was heterodox in his Christology, a critic of the Serbian Orthodox Church, its nationalism and advocate for secularism. Đorđević was an opponent of political intolerances in Serbian society. Biography Đorđević was born in the Belčine mahala, located in the Crna Trava municipality, a part of the Jablanica District, on 29 November 1938 to Čedomir and Rajinka Đorđević. In 1964, Đorđević graduated from the University of Belgrade Faculty of Philology, having previously studied Yugoslavian Literature. He received his master's degree in 1975 and became a Serbo-Croatian teacher in a Šimanovci primary school. He also taught Serbo- Croatian Language and Literature at the Belgrade Pedagogical Academy before he had retired. He was married to Mirjana, with whom he had two children, a son and a daughter, respectively called Aleksandar and Ksenija. Đorđević died in 2014, aged 75. Points of view =Criticism of the Serbian Orthodox Church= Đorđević championed ecumenism and, having vociferously opposed the right-wing nikolajevci (followers of Nikolaj Velimirović) and justinovci (followers of Justin Popović) factions within the Serbian Orthodox Church (hereafter SPC), pushed for evangelisation, not clericalisation, terming those in favour of the latter as \\"captives of phyletism\\". He considered the SPC to be a surrogate for the Central Committee of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia in post-Titoist Yugoslavia.http://www.danas.rs/dodaci/vikend/crkva_umesto_komiteta.26.html?news_id=178385 (Serbian) Staunchly opposed to Milošević, Đorđević found himself disheartened by the ostensible support of the SPC for his regime. Ultimately, Đorđević believed the Church to be a salvific institution and as such, disqualified from becoming too involved with local politics. =Historical Jesus= While remaining true to the traditional Christian belief in regard to Jesus' divinity, exemplified by the title Son of God, Đorđević was quick to add that Jesus was the Son of God \\"much like the rest of us\\" thus repudiating the traditionally prevalent Christological notion of dyophysitism. Đorđević didn't believe Jesus committed any of the miracles attributed to him in the New Testament. Upon criticising Anti-Semitism, he besought the Christians of Serbia not to be swayed by Anti-Semitism, reminding them that both Jesus and his Apostles have all been Jewish. He also believed that Jesus had been in a romantic relationship with Mary Magdalene and opted for a figurative interpretation of his resurrection, rather than a literal one.http://pescanik.net/uskrs/ (Serbian)  Bibliography (selection)  *Осмех богиње Клио (The Smile of the Goddess Clio), Belgrade 1986. *Знаци времена (Signs of Times), Belgrade 1998. *Слобода и спас: хришћански персонализам (Freedom and Salvation: Christian Personalism), Belgrade 1999. *La Voix d'une autre Serbie : L'Anti-journal (The Voice of Another Serbia: The Anti-Journal), Saint-Maur-des-Fossés 1999. *Ратни крст српске цркве (The Crusade of Serbian Church), Belgrade 2001. *Легенда о трулом Западу (Legend of the Rotten West), Belgrade 2001. *Кишобран патријарха Павла: критика паланачког ума (Umbrella of Patriarch Pavle: Criticism on Provincial Mind), Belgrade 2010.catalogue of National Library of Serbia, Retrieved 2017-05-29.

It is on the SNCF and the TER Alsace networks and is served by regional express trains. As a border station, it is also served by Deutsche Bahn trains.  Location  Lauterbourg station is 111 metres above sea level and located at kilometric point 55.493 on the line from Strasbourg to Lauterbourg, between Mothern and the Franco-German border.. It is connected to the German railway network by the Bienwaldbahn (Bienwaldbahn). It is at the junction to the short Lauterbourg Port railway and was the terminus of the former Lauterbourg–Wissembourg railway.  History  Construction of the Lauterbourg railway station began in 1874 after the German Empire annexed Alsace-Lorraine in 1871. The line from Strasbourg to Lauterbourg was opened on 25 July 1876 by the Imperial Railways in Alsace-Lorraine (Kaiserliche Generaldirektion der Eisenbahnen in Elsaß-Lothringen).* In 1900, the station was enlarged for the opening of the new Lauterbourg–Wissembourg railway, which was put in service on 1 July of the same year.. The Riviera-Express of the Compagnie des wagons- lits, connecting Berlin to Nice via Frankfurt, served the station from 3 December 1900. It was abandoned when the First World War broke out On 19 June 1919, the station became part of the network of the Administration des chemins de fer d'Alsace et de Lorraine (AL), as a result of the Allied victory in the First World War. The station was extended in 1920; the work included the building of a customs office. On 1 January 1938, the SNCF took control of the railway installations of Lauterbourg. However, after the annexation of Alsace- Lorraine by Germany on 1 July 1940 during the Second World War, Deutsche Reichsbahn controlled the station and held it until the liberation of France (in 1944 –1945). Passenger services towards Wissembourg ended on 1 October 1947. Lauterbourg also had a minor locomotive depot. In 2014, the SNCF estimated the number of passengers using the station at 22,502 passengers.  Passenger services  French and German trains in Lauterbourg station. = Facilities= The station is unstaffed and has open access to the platforms. It is equipped with a ticket machine for the purchase of regional tickets. In addition, there is a Deutsche Bahn ticket machine.

The chronicle was, according to a note in one of the manuscripts, originally written in Latin and then translated by John Shirley.Matheson 12. Background Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester from Talbot Shrewsbury Book c. 1445 =Manuscripts= Three manuscripts have the text, two from the 15th century (BL Additional MSS. 38690 and 5467) and one from the 17th century (National Library of Scotland Advocates MS 17.1.22, likely a copy of BL Add. 38690).Matheson 4. In BL Add. 38690, originally a roll which was later cut into an 18-page manuscript, it occupies fols. 9–15, written in the same hand as the first three items (one a \\"complaint\\" by Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester read in parliament, the other two documents pertaining to the release of Charles, Duke of Orléans).Matheson 4–7. In BL Add. 5467, a 224-page manuscript that includes texts on horticulture and cooking, it occupies fols. 72v-84v.Matheson 7–10. The third is a late 17th-century manuscript, with The Dethe on fols. 13–25, copied from BL Add 38690 (also copied was the complaint by Humphrey).Matheson 11. =Translator= BL Add 5467 claims The Dethe was translated by John Shirley from an unknown Latin poem,Connolly 46. which Lister M. Matheson accepts on evidence of \\"numerous spelling peculiarities\\" with texts known to be done by Shirley. Shirley (ca.1366 – 1456) was a scribe and translator, and possibly a bookseller, who was an important figure in the literary scene of his day. His ascriptions in manuscripts associated with him, for instance, are proof of Chaucer's authorship of some of his lyrics. He was buried at St Bartholomew's Hospital in London.Matheson 11–12. =Publication history= The Dethe was published in 1797 (by John Pinkerton), in 1818 (anonymously, in an \\"obscure journal\\", the Miscellanea Scotica), and in 1837 (by Joseph Stevenson).Matheson 2. All three were based on BL Add 5467, which is defective since \\"a page has been ripped out between the leaves now numbered f. 72\\" and f. 73'\\".Connolly 47. In 1904, George Neilson printed the contents of the 17th-century manuscript, which does contain the text missing from BL Add. 5467. The existence of a text of The Dethe in BL Add. 38690 was first noted in 1925. According to Matheson this manuscript is earlier than BL Add. 5467; it was first edited in 1992 by Margaret Connolly. Matheson also notes that The Dethe entered into popular culture by way of four important works of history/historical fiction from the 19th and 20th centuries: John Galt's The Spaewife (1823); Sir Walter Scott's Tales of a Grandfather (1828); Dante Gabriel Rossetti's \\"The King's Tragedy\\" (in Ballads and Sonnets, 1881); and Nigel Tranter's Lion Let Loose (1967).Matheson 2–3. Contents James I of Scotland While the chronicle covers James I's reign as a king, it focuses on his murder and its aftermath in detail. James was stabbed to death, in a conspiracy led by Sir Robert Graham and the brothers Christopher and Robert Chambers, on the night of February 20–21, 1437, at Blackfriars, Perth.Matheson 1. According to The Dethe, he was murdered while hiding in the priory's privy; it is the only 15th-century chronicle that contains this detail. The rest of the account relates how the murderers were tortured and executed. The chronicle describes how the king hears the noise of armed men outside the door of his bedchamber; he locks the door and unsuccessfully attempts to break through the windows. With metal tongs from the fireplace he breaks open the wooden floor of the privy and finds himself in the stone passage through which the privy drains. The only way out is the hole through which the privy can be emptied, but this very hole he had ordered closed up three days before to stop his tennis balls from rolling into it. The conspirators break down the door, and one of them threatens to kill the queen, Joan Beaufort, Queen of Scots, but is stopped by a son of Sir Robert Graham. When he is discovered, two men go down but the king defeats them, though unarmed; finally Graham descends into the privy and, refusing to let the king have a confessor, stabs him through the body. Graham is overcome by emotion and kills the king, with the help of the other two men, only after being threatened by the other conspirators. They try to find and kill the queen, but she has escaped and alerted the king's retinue, which pursues the conspirators who manage to escape.Matheson 36–46. The rest of the account relates in a very detailed fashion how the murderers were tortured and executed. They are found within a month. Robert Stewart, Master of Atholl and Christopher Chambers are tortured in Edinburgh by being bound on crosses, having their flesh pulled from their bodies with tongs, being dragged by horses, hung up for all to see, decapitated with a rusty axe, and finally quartered. Their heads were displayed on a city gate. Walter Stewart, Earl of Atholl, was given a paper crown with \\"TRAITOUR, TRAITOUR, TRAITOUR\\" written on it. He was given confession; he denied being part of the assassination, though he said he knew of it. He was also beheaded, and his head, now crowned with an iron crown, was put on a pole in the centre of Edinburgh. The torture and death of Graham in Stirling takes up six pages in the manuscript. \\"A mane of grete hart and manhode\\", he is defiant until the end and denounces his accusers. He is then hoisted onto a cart on which a tree is placed, and his hand is nailed to the tree with the very knife he used to kill the king. The executioner is ordered to cut off that hand with the same knife, and then he is drawn through the streets naked and tortured with iron instruments. He continues to defy his tormentors; they take pity on him and throw him back in jail, while more conspirators are drawn and quartered. Graham is retrieved from jail and taken to the execution site, where his son is disemboweled and beheaded before his eyes, after which he himself has his heart and then his bowels torn out.Matheson 46–55. Audience Shirley operated mostly in literary circles, perhaps an unlikely audience for the non-literary chronicle. Archibald Duncan thought it was clearly a \\"sadistic handbill, since it dwells so lovingly on the details of the executions of James's murderers\\",Duncan 23. but Matheson identifies Richard Beauchamp, 13th Earl of Warwick, and Henry VI of England as possible recipients of BL Add. 5467 and thinks, considering the context of BL Add. 38690 and its political and historical texts, that there were more precise political purposes at play.Matheson 12–13. The possible owner of BL Add. 38690, according to Matheson, was likely a member of the Privy Council, and singles out two possibilities, both men who were active participants in the Wars of the Roses. First of all, the Council's interest in MS Add. 38690 is suggested by the two texts that pertain to the release, after 25 years of captivity, of Charles, Duke of Orléans in 1440. The arguments presented for and against his release are similar to those brought up during the captivity of James I of Scotland. Matheson finds two members of the Council who may have had great interests in the documentation of those cases, as well as the two documents later in the manuscript, written in a different hand: the first a defense by Richard of York, 3rd Duke of York, for his claim to the throne (also entered in the Rolls of Parliament), the second the agreement between York and Henry VI of October 1460 that made York's descendants heirs to the English throne.

Rand and Howard Benjamin Rand (June 13, 1889 - October 17, 1991) was a lawyer, inventor, and three-time candidate for Massachusetts state office on the Prohibition Party ticket, He headed the former Anglo-Saxon Federation of America, a British Israelist group. He served from 1937 to 1968 as editor of its affiliate Destiny Publishers, which put out Destiny magazine (distinct from the magazine of the same name about Black culture). Early life and career Rand was born in Haverhill, Massachusetts in 1889. He was raised as a British Israelite, and his father introduced him to J. H. Allen's work Judah's Sceptre and Joseph's Birthright (1902) at an early age. He later graduated from the University of Maine with a bachelor's degree in law, becoming a successful lawyer but also worked as a construction worker and had other business interests. Rand was also a prolific author of books in British Israelism, Bible studies and pyramidology (most published by Destiny Publishers). Rand published The Bulletin, later renamed The Messenger of the Covenant. More recently it has been renamed Destiny and issued by Destiny Publishers. Anglo-Saxon Federation of America In 1928, Rand began organizing for the London-based British-Israel World Federation. He established his own British Israel organization, the Anglo-Saxon Federation of America, in Detroit in 1930. Prior to its foundation, Rand had met with prominent British Israelites such as William Pascoe Goard for advice and meetings. He later acquired C. A. L. Totten's book archive through the Totten Memorial Trust. Influence on Christian Identity Rand is considered the key transitional figure between British Israelism and Christian Identity, but he is not credited as the actual founder of the Christian Identity movement. The Anti-Defamation League also lists Rand as a prominent influential figure behind Christian Identity. He first coined the term \\"Identity\\". Professor Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke has summed up Rand as the catalyst figure behind Christian Identity as follows: While standard British Israelite teaching was that the Jews are descended from the tribe of Judah, Rand claimed that they were instead the descendants of Esau or Canaanites. Eventually, in Christian Identity this would shift even farther to become the belief modern Jews were descendants of Satan. Paradoxically, while early British Israelites such as Edward Hine and John Wilson were philo-semites, Christian Identity emerged in sharp contrast to be strongly anti-semitic. Rand did not teach any violence or hatred towards other races, but these acts would later emerge as the focus of the Christian Identity movement. In fact, Rand was a pacifist and his ideas have been described as a \\"peaceful missionary imperative.\\" Works =Books= * Behold He Cometh * Words of Wisdom * Study in Revelation (1941) * Digest of the Divine Law (1943) * Study in Jeremiah (1947) * Primogensis (1948) * Documentary Studies, Volumes I (1947) * Documentary Studies, Volumes II (1947) * Documentary Studies, Volumes III (1947) * Joel's Prophetic Message and Warning (1956) * Study in Daniel (1962) * Study in Hosea (1963) * The Hour Cometh (1966) * Marvels of Prophecy (1967) * Gems of Truth (1968) * Study in Isaiah (1996, published posthumously)  See also  Reuben H.

At least 28 people were killed; 40 others were injured, including the Senator. The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant claimed responsibility for the attack. The attack was an unsuccessful attempt to assassinate Haideri.  Bombing  The bombing took place as the suicide bomber targeted Haideri's convoy on the N-25 National Highway. The bomber rammed the motorcycle he was riding into the vehicle carrying Haideri. The vehicle was severely damaged in the blast. The attack occurred shortly after Haideri left Jama Masjid Hammadia, after attending a graduation ceremony and offering Friday prayers. Haideri, who was sitting in the front seat, survived but received injuries on his arms, leg and ear. His driver and another aide in the same vehicle were killed. Many vehicles and motorcycles, including a police car, were destroyed in the explosion. Ghazanfar Ali, District Police Officer, Mastung, suggested after an initial probe that \\"a suspected suicide bomber hit Maulana Haideri's car\\". The Chairman of the Senate of Pakistan, Raza Rabbani, said that it was a suicide attack that targeted Haideri. After the attack while talking to the media Haideri said, \\"I am alive, Allah has saved my life… broken pieces of the windscreen hit me. I am injured but safe.\\" = Victims = Maulana Hafiz Qudratullah, Naib emir of JUI (F)'s Quetta district chapter; Iftikhar Mughal, director staff of the Senate; Haideri's driver and Abdul Waheed, an Anti- Terrorism Force official, were among those killed in the bombing. Seven volunteers of the JUI-F who were escorting Haideri as guards, including Mohammad Adil, Mohammad Imran, Abdul Ghaffar, Zahoor Ahmed and Abdul Karim, were also among the victims. Several bodies could not be identified. Dr Faisal Manan, a National journalist, was among the injured, as were a young girl and a child.  Initial response and investigation  Survivors of the blast, several of whom were covered in blood, began picking up body parts that were lying scattered on the road. Immediately after the blast, security forces rushed to the site along with rescue workers. A state of emergency was declared at hospitals in Mastung and Quetta. The injured and the deceased were shifted to the District Hospital and the Nawab Ghous Bakhsh Raisani Memorial Hospital in Mastung. At least 10 seriously injured were shifted to the Trauma Centre of Civil Hospital, Quetta. While, after initial treatment Haideri along with three other injured was moved to the Combined Military Hospital in Quetta. After collecting evidence from the scene, an official of the bomb disposal squad confirmed that it was a suicide attack. He added that around ten kilogrammes of explosives were used for the explosion. Evidence found at the blast site included ball bearings and parts of the motorcycle. A search operation began after Levies personnel cordoned off the entire area.  Reactions  The President of Pakistan, Mamnoon Hussain, condemned the attack and expressed the state's resolve to protect the public by completely eradicating terrorism from the country. The Prime Minister of Pakistan, Nawaz Sharif, strongly condemned the attack and expressed his concern for the well- being of Maulana Haideri. The Chairman of Senate, Raza Rabbani, and the Interior Minister, Nisar Ali Khan, also condemned the attack, with Rabbani saying \\"terrorists cannot deter [the] nation's resolve against militancy through such coward attacks\\". The Speaker and the Deputy speaker of National Assembly also condemned the attack. Chief Minister Balochistan Nawab Sanaullah Zehri, while condemning the attack, directed the IG police to submit a report on the attack within 24 hours. Nobel laureate Malala Yousafzai also condemned the attack. In a message, Malala wrote: \\"I strongly condemn Mastung blast, I and my family are praying for the speedy recovery of Maulana Abdul Ghafoor Haideri and others injured, prayers for the martyrs, terrorists want to weaken Pakistan through their heinous acts but Pakistanis stand united against terrorism and extremism.\\" Speaking to Geo News, JUI (F)'s Emir (chief) Maulana Fazl-ur-Rehman condemned the attack on Haideri before adding that Friday's attack was not the first on the party. \\"Many of our dear companions have been martyred [in this attack],\\" he said further, adding that, \\"We have to continue to work for this country and the stability of Islam.\\" Maulana Fazlur Rehman expressed his condolences to the families of the martyrs terming the attack a very painful incident for the nation and particularly the JUI. He added that \\"such incidents will not stop us in our cause\\". The JUI-F chief also said such incidents occur \\"because we [JUI-F] stand with Pakistan, its law, and its Constitution\\". Chairman of the Pakistan Peoples Party, Bilawal Bhutto Zardari condemned the attack saying, \\"controlling the menace of terrorism was collective responsibility\\". Chairman of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf, Imran Khan condemned the attack calling it \\"worst terrorism incident\\", and added that terrorist want to create unrest. On 13 May, a strike was observed in Quetta to mourn the death of the victims of the blast. JUI-F's party workers and supporters also held a demonstration in Quetta in protest against the suicide attack. The militant group Lashkar-e-Jhangvi Al Alami's spokesman also condemned the suicide attack, adding that the two groups have now split due to \\"policy changes\\". = Local newspapers = The editorial of The News International noted that the attack \\"is a reminder that the internal challenges we face are even greater and cannot be blamed on other countries\\". An editorial in The Nation also mentioned that \\"the narrative will soon turn towards blaming the 'foreign hand' that feed terrorists in Pakistan, it must be remembered that many of our terrorist groups are entities that are very much based in Pakistan\\". The editorial in Dawn also echoed that \\"the country's civil and military leaderships will unite to condemn the attacks and bemoan them as an attempt to sabotage CPEC by outside forces. While there may be some truth to those allegations, the twin attacks in Mastung and Gwadar almost certainly have very local roots\\". = International = * : The Turkish Foreign Office condemned the terrorist attack, and expressed solidarity with the Government and people of Pakistan.

Life  Paul Jahnke was born in Pasewalk, a small town supported by food and tobacco manufacturing, with an important junction on the railway network, a short distance to the west of Stettin in Pomerania. He trained in mechanical engineering but then, in 1916, was conscripted into the army. However, he was released from military services with \\"50% war injuries\\". In 1917 he joined the Independent Social Democratic Party (\\"Unabhängige Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands\\" / USPD) when it broke away from the mainstream Social Democratic Party (SPD), primarily because of disagreement with the SPD party leadership decision to implement what amounted to a parliamentary truce for the duration of the war. As the USPD itself broke apart in the confused aftermath of military defeat, Jahnke was part of the left wing majority that in 1919 moved across to the newly formed Communist Party. In 1920 he joined another breakaway movement, becoming a member of the Communist Workers' Party (\\" Kommunistische Arbeiter-Partei Deutschlands\\" / KAPD), but in 1922, as the KAPD faded from the scene, Jahnke rejoined the Communist Party of Germany, becoming a local party secretary in the \\"Berlin North-east\\" sub-region (\\"Unterbezirk Berlin Nordost\\"). Further party appointments in the Berlin area followed. A source on the end of November 1931 identifies him as \\"Secretary and Policy leader of the Neukölln district Communist Party\\". At the end of 1932 the Party Central Committee appointed him regional policy head for the Munich region,Hartmut Mehringer: Die Parteien KPD, SPD, BVP in Verfolgung und Widerstand p. 91 though it is not clear if there was time for him to move to Munich before the Nazi power seizure in January 1933. The new government lost no time in transforming Germany from a multi-party democracy to a one-party dictatorship. After the Reichstag fire in February 1933 political parties (apart from the Nazi party) were banned, and work for them became illegal. In practical terms not all parties were deemed equally anti-Nazi, however, and the authorities targeted the Communist Party for suppression and its activists for persecution. By May 1933 Jahnke was already working \\"underground\\" not in Munich but in Bremen as regional policy head (\\"politischer Leiter des Bezirks\\"). Available sources are silent about his political underground work, but according to one source it was not a success. In 1934 he was forced to emigrate to France where he joined a growing number of communist political exiles from Nazi Germany. His anti-Nazi activism in Germany had not gone unnoticed, however, and in 1936 a Nazi court condemned him, in absentia, to deathNeues Deutschland, 30 October 1951 in the so-called \\"Richardstrasse- Prozess\\" (\\"Richard Street Trial\\"). In November 1936 he was one of those who moved to Spain in order to fight against the Francoist nationalist forces during the Spanish Civil War. Jahnke remained in Spain till February 1939, fighting as a member of the International Brigades. He also served as a political commissar in Albacete which became the national headquarters of the International Brigades during the Civil War. After that he became \\"technical head\\" of a [Communist] party academy. During 1939, the year in which the invasion of Poland by Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union triggered the outbreak of the Second World War, Jahnke moved to the relative safety of Norway. It was probably in Norway that he first met another high-profile Communist exile from Germany, Hanna Sandtner. In the event Norway, too, was overrun by the German army, and in 1940 the two of them fled to Sweden, supported by the Nansen Hjelp humanitarian organisation. In Sweden he was interned by the government and, for a period, suspended from the exiled German Communist Party group. It was during his period of internment that he entered into what turned out to be a long-term personal partnership with Sandtner. War ended in German defeat in May 1945, with the western two thirds of the country divided into military occupation zones. Jahnke and Sandtner returned in March 1946 to the eastern part of Berlin which was by this time administered as part of the Soviet occupation zone - after October 1949 the Soviet sponsored German Democratic Republic / (\\"East Germany\\")). In April 1946, one month after their arrival in the Soviet zone, a new political party, the Socialist Unity Party (\\"Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands\\" / SED), was launched under contentious circumstances. There was a widespread belief that the Nazi Party had been able to come to power only because of divisions on the political left, and the new party was presented as a way to prevent a recurrence of that. By 1949 the SED would itself have evolved, within the zone under Soviet administration, to become the ruling party in a new kind of German one-party dictatorship. Jahnke evidently was one of the thousands of Communist Party members who lost no time in signing their party membership across to the new party. He became a party official in East Berlin's Prenzlauer Berg quarter. Next he took a position as Human Resources chief with the Berliner Verlag newspaper publishing business. However, following differences with the managing editor of the Berliner Zeitung, Rudolf Herrnstadt, Jahnke resigned from the publishers and joined the country's quasi-military police service. With the police service he rose to become a chief inspector in Prenzlauer Berg before transferring to a job in charge of the East Berlin Police press department for the East Berlin police presidency. However, during a period of rising economic, political and social tension the East German leadership under Walter Ulbricht, almost all of whom had spent the war years in Moscow drawing up plans for what became the German Democratic Republic, became increasingly suspicious of party comrades who had been exposed to \\"the west\\" during the war. A particularly high-profile (and well documented) victim of this development was Paul Merker. Paul Jahnke was one of a number of less well documented highly placed members of the political establishment whose political careers came to an abrupt halt at around the same time. In 1951 Jahnke was relieved of all his politically connected posts and demoted to a positions as works manager at VEB Berliner Aufzugbau, a Berlin-based manufacturer of lifts/elevators. Under circumstances described by at least one source as \\"mysterious\\", on 27 October 1951 Paul Jahnke died in the Police Hospital in East Berlin.

In 1992, Binder discovered the use of Botox to alleviate sufferers of chronic migraine headaches. Binder reported in 2000 that patients who had cosmetic injections around the face reported relief from chronic headache. This was initially thought to be an indirect effect of reduced muscle tension, but it is now known that the toxin inhibits release of peripheral nociceptive neurotransmitters, suppressing the central pain processing systems responsible for migraine headache. In 2010, the FDA approved intramuscular botulinum toxin injections for prophylactic treatment of chronic migraine headache.

Compared to the other group 5 transition metal organometallics, the chemistry of organoniobium compounds most closely resembles that of organotantalum compounds. Organoniobium compounds of oxidation states +5, +4, +3, +2, +1, 0, -1, and -3 have been prepared, with the +5 oxidation state being the most common. Compound classes = Carbonyls = Unlike vanadium, the neutral binary carbonyl of niobium is unstable. The salts of the anionionic binary carbonyls, exemplified by [Nb(CO)6]−, can be obtained by reduction of NbCl5 under an atmosphere of CO. Heteroleptic niobium carbonyls supported by Cp ligands can be prepared at various oxidation states of Nb and serve as useful precursors in niobium carbonyl chemistry. Structure of [Li(OEt2)3]+[NbMe6]−. = Alkyl = A wide variety of alkyl Nb compounds have been prepared. Low coordination number complexes require the absence of any β-hydrogen to prevent rapid β-hydride elimination. The simplest compounds are salts of [Nb(CH3)6]−, which is prepared by alkylation of NbF5 using methyl lithium: : NbF5 \\\\+ 6 LiCH3 → Li[Nb(CH3)6] + 5 LiF = Alkylidenes = Along with the related organotantalum species, niobium alkylidenes were among the first Scrock carbenes studied. The first syntheses of these complexes involved addition of organolithium reagents lacking β-hydrogens into hindered Nb(V) complexes followed by α-proton elimination. As compared to tantalum alkylidenes, niobium alkylidenes are less thermally and hydrolytically stable. = Cyclopentadienyl derivatives = The first organoniobium coumpound fully characterized was Cp2NbBr3, however the paramagnetic Nb(IV) metallocenes such as niobocene dichloride are more prevalent. Complexes are typically prepared by treatment of NbCl5 with NaCp to form the bis(cyclopentadienyl) complex followed by further functionalization. Derivatives of pentamethylcyclopentadiene are also known, such as (C5Me5)2NbH3. = Alkyne complexes = Similar to other d2 transition metals, Nb(III) binds alkynes to produce Nb(V) alkenediyl complexes. The Nb metallocyclopropenes thus formed feature improved thermal stability relative to other organometallics and are more readily characterized and used as synthetic intermediates Oxidative insertion of Nb(III) to form metallocyclopropene  Applications  No commercial applications of organoniobium compounds have been reported. They have found limited use in organic synthesis. = Stoicheometric niobium reagents = A prominent early synthetic application of organoniobium chemistry was the use of NbCl3(DME) as a reagent for the reductive coupling of imines with carbonyl compounds to form amino alcohols. This reagent has found further use in other pinacol-type reductive couplings. NbCl3(DME) mediated reductive coupling Nb(V) alkendiyl complexes have found use as latent dianion equivalents in synthetic reactions. Reduction of alkynes with Nb(III) compounds followed by trapping with suitable electrophiles has allowed the synthesis of various alkenes. = Catalytic reactions = A number of formal [2+2+2] cycloadditions have been realized under Nb catalysis, including alkyne trimerizations and couplings of alkynes with alkenes or nitriles to form cyclohexadienes or pyridines, respectively. Typically a Nb(III) catalyst will form a Nb(V) metallocyclopropene with a terminal alkyne component and then engage in sequential migratory insertions and reductive elimination to furnish the six membered ring and regenerate the Nb(III). Nb(III) catalyzed formal [2+2+2] cycloadditions An organoniobium catalyst has also been developed for (Z)-selective semihydrogenation of alkynes. The mechanistic pathway for this reaction is distinct from other transition metal catalyzed hydrogenations, proceeding through the Nb(V) metallocyclopropene which engages with hydrogen either through direct sigma- bond metathesis or outer sphere 1,2-addition.

On the night of 21 September 1965, Major Asa Ram Tyagi personally led the leading platoon of a company of 3rd Jat Battalion of Indian Army to capture a Pakistani position in Dograi village in Pakistan, which was defended by a troop of tanks, covering pillboxes and recoilless guns. While assaulting the position, Major Tyagi was hit by two bullets in the right shoulder. In spite of his injury, he pressed on against the tanks, personally destroyed the crew with grenades and captured two tanks intact. In this process he was again hit by three more bullets, but still continued to lead his company till he fell unconscious. He was subsequently evacuated to a military hospital where he died. Greatly inspired by his conspicuous bravery, his men captured the objective. Memorial songs Many songs in memory of the Battle of Dograi remain popular in Haryana. One of them narrates the battle in these words: Kahe suney ki baat na bolun ankho dekhi bhai, Teen Jaat ki katha sunaun sun le mere bhai, Paanch Sitambar raat ghaneri hamla Jaton ne maari, Dusman me much gayi khalbali kaanp uthi Dograi.

Following about a year in early access, Dead Cells was released for Linux, macOS, Microsoft Windows, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One on August 7, 2018. A mobile port for iOS was released on August 28, 2019 and an Android port was released on June 3, 2020. In the game, the player takes the role of a slime-like creature that takes control of a corpse in a dungeon, through which they must fight their way out. The player gains various weapons, treasure and other tools through exploration of the procedurally-generated levels to fight undead creatures within it. At times, the player gains \\"cells\\", a type of in- game currency that can be used to purchase permanent upgrades or unlock items. Dead Cells uses a permadeath system, causing the player to lose all cells and other currencies or items upon each instance of death. Motion Twin was inspired by The Binding of Isaac in developing the game. Gameplay Dead Cells is described as a \\"roguevania\\", a combination of procedurally-generated roguelike games and action-exploration-based Metroidvania games. The player controls a mass of cells that occupy and control the body of a deceased prisoner at the start of each game. As they explore a series of dungeons and fight the creatures within, they collect weapons, skins, abilities, power-ups, and money. Enemies will sometimes drop cells when defeated, which can be used to obtain permanent power-ups such as additional health potions or items that can be bought or found in later runs. These cells can only be spent at the end of a dungeon section, though players can choose not to spend them; if a player dies before then, they lose all collected cells. Each level is procedurally generated by merging of predesigned sections in a random configuration along with random placement of enemies and items. The game's combat is compared to the Souls series, with difficult enemies with certain behaviors the player can learn, and where frequent player-character death is a fundamental part of the game. At intervals throughout the game, the player must defeat boss enemies known as \\"Keepers\\". There are six Keepers in the game—The Concierge, Conjunctivius, The Time Keeper, The Giant, The Hand of the King, and The Collector. The game includes Twitch integration, allowing viewers, via the stream's chat, to influence the game, such as voting for which upgrade paths the player should take. Plot =Setting= The plot of Dead Cells is minimalistic, only giving bits of information to the player, as the player character is selectively mute, and lore is fed gradually from area descriptions and background details. Taking place on an unnamed island, the player character is the Prisoner, a greenish blob of an unknown substance capable of possessing executed bodies in the depths of the island. While the \\"head\\" of the Prisoner is immortal, the bodies it possesses are not, and dying will force it to slink back to the Prison Quarters. =Story= The Prisoner awakens in the depths of the Island's prison, next to a giant skeleton with a spear inside of it, a character named \\"The Giant\\". A soldier implies that the Prisoner has been trying to escape for an unspecified period of time. As the Prisoner works their way out of the Prison Quarters, they navigate the Island, and it is revealed that the Island was once a mighty kingdom, until a plague known as \\"The Malaise\\" swept through, reducing most of its citizens to mindless zombies or monstrous husks. The Kingdom's Alchemist worked tirelessly to find a cure, but mysteriously disappeared as the King became reclusive. As the kingdom fell, the remaining citizens began to rebel against the King, only to either die by infection, seclusion, or by their own hands. The Prisoner encounters and fights several entities as they travel across the island: The Concierge, who was once the prison's guard Castaing, before his infection and subsequent transformation into a hulking monster; Conjonctivius, a nameless, faceless bloated corpse that was transformed into a grotesque tentacled Beholder-like monster; and The Time Keeper, a woman with some mastery over time, who continuously resets time each day to prevent her own infection. They also encounter The Collector, a hooded figure who trades items to the Prisoner in exchange for Cells, which drop from defeated enemies and are implied to be a sort of essence of life; and The Blacksmith and his apprentices, who upgrade the Prisoner's weapons and arsenal. Eventually, the Prisoner reaches the castle's throne room, and faces off against the Hand of the King, while the King sits seemingly comatose upon his throne. The Prisoner defeats the Hand of the King, takes his weapon, and uses it to kill the King. The King's body violently explodes, destroying the Prisoner's host body and resetting the game, though giving the Prisoner the ability to act outside of a host body while still possessing the body. As the Prisoner's head returns to the quarters to find a new corpse to possess, it remarks on how even though the king has died, nothing has changed. =Rise of the Giant= The Rise of the Giant downloadable content adds additional content, including new endings. The Prisoner gains access to a new area of the Island, The Cavern, which houses the titanic undead skeletal Giant, who acts as the boss for the area. Upon defeat, The Giant reveals that the Prisoner is actually the King himself, his soul split from his body by consequence of his and the Alchemist's experiments. As the Prisoner continues, The Time Keeper begins actively altering the timeline to prevent her own death. After defeating the Hand of the King again, if the player has all five Boss Cells (modifiers which make the game substantially more difficult, earned by beating the game on each difficulty) active, they are able to gain access to the Astrolab and the Observatory. There, the Prisoner can find the Collector, who is implied to be the King's Alchemist. The Collector reveals that he has been collecting cells to create a Panacea, to cure the Malaise once and for all. The Collector however, upon drinking the Panacea, goes mad with power and attempts to kill the Prisoner to reset the game so they will bring him more cells. While fighting the Collector, the Prisoner drinks some of the Panacea, which, upon the Collector's death, causes the Prisoner's host body to evaporate, resetting the game once more. This time however, the Time Keeper fully resets the timeline. This allows the Prisoner, upon reaching the throne room and defeating the Hand of the King, to possess the King, getting his original body back. However, the body is infected with the Malaise, and so to prevent his own decay, he continues to the Observatory to face the Collector again. This time, upon the Collector's defeat, the Panacea cures the King and binds his body and soul once more. The King returns to his throne, where he remarks over a glass of wine that he was honestly having more fun crawling around the sewers, when, due to the Time Keeper's meddling, a time-displaced Prisoner arrives in the throne room. The King and the Prisoner face off, and begin to duel. Development Dead Cellss developer Motion Twin had been developing games for the browser and mobile gaming market since 2001. The studio found that competition in the mobile market required more investment to make viable games, and decided to switch focus to develop what they considered their \\"passion project\\", a game that was \\"something hardcore, ultra-niche, with pixel art and ridiculous difficulty\\" that they knew would be a potential risk in terms of interested players. Initially, Motion Twin had set out to make a follow-up to their browser game Die2Nite, which was a cooperative tower defense game for up to forty players released in 2008; for most of the game, players would work together to form defenses around a town, and then during a night phase, wait to see if their town survived waves of attacks by zombies. They wanted to have the sequel improved by allowing players to take actions and fight during the night phase, implementing free to play mechanics. While this version worked well with large number of players, Motion Twin found it was not very exciting for single players. In 2014, they stripped down the game to basically a single-player experience between preparation and combat, and took it to an event called the Big Indie Pitch, where the idea came in second place. Inspired by this, they decided to strip away the game's preparation phase and focus it as a combat-based game. The process of figuring out how to keep and work from these combat elements took about a year up through the end of 2015. To tighten the gameplay, Motion Twin took inspiration of the Engineer class from Team Fortress 2, where the use of turrets and other buildable items helps to strengthen the character's abilities, and took Dead Cells into an action platformer where the player used weapons along with a variety of skills (including some elements they had developed for the tower defense approach). They did not want players to get used to having a single weapon/skill combination that they used indefinitely, and arranged the roguelike elements as to require the player to try out new combinations of weapons and skills as they progressed in a given run to defeat newer foes, and keeping what items they would get in a random manner every time they started a new game. Motion Twin's producer, Steve Filby, said that The Binding of Isaac was a significant influence, as there, the way the game proceeds \\"is entirely based on the choice of items that you get. That's the fun of the game.\\" To give the player enough options, the developers crafted about 50 different weapons, avoiding having too much duplication in how each weapon worked so that there would be unique gameplay possibilities with each. The team used an iterative process in gameplay and graphics and art so that each of these weapons also exhibited unique animations or behavior so that the player would get a sense of a tactile response and the special nature of each weapon. Motion Twin opted to use Steam's Early access approach to both gauge interest and to get real-time feedback from players on game features and the balance from procedural generation. They feared the stigma around indie games at the time, fueled by industry speculation of an \\"indiepocalypse\\" where too many indie games would have caused a collapse of the games market around 2015, but which never occurred. They did not want to release too early within early access, and made sure the first version available, while only about 30 to 40% complete, had tight combat and gameplay controls that players would appreciate. This allowed to address balance issues, as the developer did not want to punish players for a specific style of play, and used the feedback to address this. This allowed them to make sure that regular combat encounters should be short, and that maneuvering within the game's levels itself was not a challenge to the player. Motion Twin planned for the game to spend about a year in early access before its full release, during which time the content was fleshed out and incorporated much of the player feedback on both bug reports and feature suggestions into the game. Lead designer Sébastien Bénard estimated that 40 to 50% of the features in the final game were drawn from feedback during early access. =Release= The early access period was launched on May 10, 2017 with support for Microsoft Windows, and released macOS and Linux versions in early access on June 26, 2018. In November 2017 the game was released on GOG.com as part of their drive to provide an alternate way to purchase games that are in development. In January 2018, Motion Twin stated they are planning on console development for the Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One, with a planned release in August 2018 to correspond with the Windows' version leaving early access. Motion Twin does not anticipate creating a sequel, and instead focused on adding a robust modding system for the personal computer versions to allow players to expand the game following release. The studio considered developing downloadable content for Dead Cells and other ways to expand the existing game. Dead Cells was fully released on August 7, 2018 for computers and consoles. Retail editions were released in August 2018. Motion Twin released a free downloadable content update to the game called \\"Rise of the Giant\\" in mid-2019. The developers announced plans to port the title to mobile devices running iOS and Android, modifying the game's interface to support touch controls as well as remote controllers. The iOS version was released on August 28, 2019, the Android version released on June 3, 2020. Around January 2019, Motion Twin wanted to start work on their next title while still developing Dead Cells. While they expanded with more developers, Motion Twin wanted to keep its small eight to ten person size to stay a viable cooperative, and instead created a new studio under them called Evil Empire to take over Dead Cells development. The game's first paid downloadable content, \\"The Bad Seed\\", was released on February 11, 2020 adding two new biomes, Arboretum and Swamp, as well a boss for early game content. New content includes weapons, enemies and game mechanics. On the same day, a new physical package for the game, the \\"Prisoner's Edition\\" was announced for PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch, which in addition to the game and DLC, includes the soundtrack, an art book, and a figurine of the player-character. Reception About a year from its early access release, Dead Cells sold over 730,000 units, and exceeded 850,000 units just prior to its full release. By May 2019, within ten months of its full release, Dead Cells had accumulated sales of two million units. Following the release on the Switch in August 2019, total sales exceed 2.4 million units, with Motion Twin stating that Switch sales were \\"insane\\". The game was nominated for \\"Best Indie Game\\" at the 2017 Ping Awards, and was a runner-up for \\"Best Action Game\\" at IGN's Best of 2017 Awards. It won the award for \\"Best Indie Game\\" at the 2018 Golden Joystick Awards, whereas its other nominations were for \\"Best Visual Design\\" and \\"Ultimate Game of the Year\\". It also won the award for \\"Best Action Game\\" at The Game Awards 2018, whereas its other nomination was for \\"Best Independent Game\\". It was also nominated for \\"Fan Favorite Indie Game\\" at the Gamers' Choice Awards, and for \\"Independent Game of the Year\\" at the Australian Games Awards, and won the Off Broadway Award for Best Indie Game at the New York Game Awards. At the NAVGTR Awards, the game won the award for \\"Control Design, 2D or Limited 3D\\", whereas its other nominations were for \\"Art Direction, Fantasy\\", \\"Control Precision\\", \\"Game, Original Action\\", and \\"Original Light Mix Score, New IP\\"; it was also nominated for \\"Excellence in Gameplay\\" and \\"Most Promising New Intellectual Property\\" at the SXSW Gaming Awards, for \\"Original Property\\" at the 15th British Academy Games Awards, and for \\"Best Indie Game\\" at the Italian Video Game Awards, and won the awards for \\"Best Mobile Game\\" and \\"Best Game-as-a-Service\\" at the Pégases Awards 2020.

It propagated through EternalBlue, an exploit discovered by the United States National Security Agency (NSA) for older Windows systems. EternalBlue was stolen and leaked by a group called The Shadow Brokers at least a year prior to the attack. While Microsoft had released patches previously to close the exploit, much of WannaCry's spread was from organizations that had not applied these, or were using older Windows systems that were past their end-of-life. These patches are imperative to an organization's cyber-security but many were not applied because of needing 24/7 operation, risking having applications that used to work break, inconvenience, or other reasons. The attack was halted within a few days of its discovery due to emergency patches released by Microsoft and the discovery of a kill switch that prevented infected computers from spreading WannaCry further. The attack was estimated to have affected more than 200,000 computers across 150 countries, with total damages ranging from hundreds of millions to billions of dollars. Security experts believed from preliminary evaluation of the worm that the attack originated from North Korea or agencies working for the country. In December 2017, the United States, United Kingdom and Australia formally asserted that North Korea was behind the attack. A new variant of WannaCry forced Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) to temporarily shut down several of its chip-fabrication factories in August 2018. The virus spread to 10,000 machines in TSMC's most advanced facilities. Description WannaCry is a ransomware cryptoworm, which targeted computers running the Microsoft Windows operating system by encrypting data and demanding ransom payments in the Bitcoin cryptocurrency. The worm is also known as WannaCrypt, Wana Decrypt0r 2.0, WanaCrypt0r 2.0, and Wanna Decryptor. It is considered a network worm because it also includes a \\"transport\\" mechanism to automatically spread itself. This transport code scans for vulnerable systems, then uses the EternalBlue exploit to gain access, and the DoublePulsar tool to install and execute a copy of itself. WannaCry versions 0, 1, and 2 were created using Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0. EternalBlue is an exploit of Windows' Server Message Block (SMB) protocol released by The Shadow Brokers. Much of the attention and comment around the event was occasioned by the fact that the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) (from whom the exploit was likely stolen) had already discovered the vulnerability, but used it to create an exploit for its own offensive work, rather than report it to Microsoft. Microsoft eventually discovered the vulnerability, and on Tuesday, 14 March 2017, they issued security bulletin MS17-010, which detailed the flaw and announced that patches had been released for all Windows versions that were currently supported at that time, these being Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8.1, Windows 10, Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2012, and Windows Server 2016. DoublePulsar is a backdoor tool, also released by The Shadow Brokers on 14 April 2017. Starting from 21 April 2017, security researchers reported that there were tens of thousands of computers with the DoublePulsar backdoor installed. By 25 April, reports estimated that the number of infected computers could be up to several hundred thousand, with numbers increasing every day. The WannaCry code can take advantage of any existing DoublePulsar infection, or installs it itself. On 9 May 2017, private cybersecurity company RiskSense released code on the website github.com with the stated purpose of allowing legal “white hat” penetration testers to test the CVE-2017-0144 exploit on unpatched systems. When executed, the WannaCry malware first checks the \\"kill switch\\" domain name; if it is not found, then the ransomware encrypts the computer's data, then attempts to exploit the SMB vulnerability to spread out to random computers on the Internet, and \\"laterally\\" to computers on the same network. As with other modern ransomware, the payload displays a message informing the user that files have been encrypted, and demands a payment of around US$300 in bitcoin within three days, or US$600 within seven days. Three hardcoded bitcoin addresses, or \\"wallets\\", are used to receive the payments of victims. As with all such wallets, their transactions and balances are publicly accessible even though the cryptocurrency wallet owners remain unknown. Several organizations released detailed technical writeups of the malware, including a senior security analyst at RiskSense, Microsoft, Cisco, Malwarebytes, Symantec and McAfee. Attack The attack began on Friday, 12 May 2017, with evidence pointing to an initial infection in Asia at 07:44 UTC. The initial infection was likely through an exposed vulnerable SMB port, rather than email phishing as initially assumed. Within a day the code was reported to have infected more than 230,000 computers in over 150 countries. Organizations that had not installed Microsoft's security update from April 2017 were affected by the attack. Those still running unsupported versions of Microsoft Windows, such as Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 were at particularly high risk because no security patches had been released since April 2014 for Windows XP (with the exception of one emergency patch released in May 2014) and July 2015 for Windows Server 2003. A Kaspersky Lab study reported however, that less than 0.1 percent of the affected computers were running Windows XP, and that 98 percent of the affected computers were running Windows 7. In a controlled testing environment, the cybersecurity firm Kryptos Logic found that it was unable to infect a Windows XP system with WannaCry using just the exploits, as the payload failed to load, or caused the operating system to crash rather than actually execute and encrypt files. However, when executed manually, WannaCry could still operate on Windows XP. = Defensive response = Experts quickly advised affected users against paying the ransom due to no reports of people getting their data back after payment and as high revenues would encourage more of such campaigns. As of 14 June 2017, after the attack had subsided, a total of 327 payments totaling US$130,634.77 (51.62396539 XBT) had been transferred. The day after the initial attack in May, Microsoft released out-of-band security updates for end of life products Windows XP, Windows Server 2003 and Windows 8; these patches had been created in February of that year following a tip off about the vulnerability in January of that year. Organizations were advised to patch Windows and plug the vulnerability in order to protect themselves from the cyber attack. The head of Microsoft's Cyber Defense Operations Center, Adrienne Hall, said that “Due to the elevated risk for destructive cyber-attacks at this time, we made the decision to take this action because applying these updates provides further protection against potential attacks with characteristics similar to WannaCrypt [alternative name to WannaCry]”. Researcher Marcus Hutchins discovered the kill switch domain hardcoded in the malware. Registering a domain name for a DNS sinkhole stopped the attack spreading as a worm, because the ransomware only encrypted the computer's files if it was unable to connect to that domain, which all computers infected with WannaCry before the website's registration had been unable to do. While this did not help already infected systems, it severely slowed the spread of the initial infection and gave time for defensive measures to be deployed worldwide, particularly in North America and Asia, which had not been attacked to the same extent as elsewhere. On 14 May, a first variant of WannaCry appeared with a new and second kill-switch registered by Matt Suiche on the same day. This was followed by a second variant with the third and last kill-switch on 15 May, which was registered by Check Point threat intelligence analysts. A few days later, a new version of WannaCry was detected that lacked the kill switch altogether. On 19 May, it was reported that hackers were trying to use a Mirai botnet variant to effect a distributed attack on WannaCry's kill-switch domain with the intention of knocking it offline. On 22 May, Hutchins protected the domain by switching to a cached version of the site, capable of dealing with much higher traffic loads than the live site. Separately, researchers from University College London and Boston University reported that their PayBreak system could defeat WannaCry and several other families of ransomware by recovering the keys used to encrypt the user's data. It was discovered that Windows encryption APIs used by WannaCry may not completely clear the prime numbers used to generate the payload's private keys from the memory, making it potentially possible to retrieve the required key if they had not yet been overwritten or cleared from resident memory. The key is kept in the memory if the WannaCry process has not been killed and the computer has not been rebooted after being infected. This behaviour was used by a French researcher to develop a tool known as WannaKey, which automates this process on Windows XP systems. This approach was iterated upon by a second tool known as Wanakiwi, which was tested to work on Windows 7 and Server 2008 R2 as well. Within four days of the initial outbreak, new infections had slowed to a trickle due to these responses. Attribution Linguistic analysis of the ransom notes indicated the authors were likely fluent in Chinese and proficient in English, as the versions of the notes in those languages were probably human-written while the rest seemed to be machine-translated. According to an analysis by the FBI's Cyber Behavioral Analysis Center, the computer that created the ransomware language files had Hangul language fonts installed, as evidenced by the presence of the \\"\\\\fcharset129\\" Rich Text Format tag. Metadata in the language files also indicated that the computers that created the ransomware were set to UTC+09:00, used in Korea. A Google security researcher initially posted a tweet referencing code similarities between WannaCry and previous malware. Then cybersecurity companies Kaspersky Lab and Symantec have both said the code has some similarities with that previously used by the Lazarus Group (believed to have carried out the cyberattack on Sony Pictures in 2014 and a Bangladesh bank heist in 2016—and linked to North Korea). This could also be either simple re-use of code by another group or an attempt to shift blame—as in a cyber false flag operation; but a leaked internal NSA memo is alleged to have also linked the creation of the worm to North Korea. Brad Smith, the president of Microsoft, said he believed North Korea was the originator of the WannaCry attack, and the UK's National Cyber Security Centre reached the same conclusion. On 18 December 2017, the United States Government formally announced that it publicly considers North Korea to be the main culprit behind the WannaCry attack. President Trump's Homeland Security Advisor, Tom Bossert, wrote an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal about this charge, saying \\"We do not make this allegation lightly. It is based on evidence.\\" In a press conference the following day, Bossert said that the evidence indicates that Kim Jong-un had given the order to launch the malware attack. Bossert said that Canada, New Zealand and Japan agree with the United States' assessment of the evidence that links the attack to North Korea, while the United Kingdom's Foreign and Commonwealth Office says it also stands behind the United States' assertion. North Korea, however, denied being responsible for the cyberattack. On 6 September 2018, the US Department of Justice (DoJ) announced formal charges against Park Jin-hyok for involvement in the Sony Pictures hack of 2014. The DoJ contended that Park was a North Korean hacker working as part of a team of experts for the North Korean Reconnaissance General Bureau. The Department of Justice asserted this team also had been involved in the WannaCry attack, among other activities.  Impact  Map of the countries initially affected The ransomware campaign was unprecedented in scale according to Europol, which estimates that around 200,000 computers were infected across 150 countries. According to Kaspersky Lab, the four most affected countries were Russia, Ukraine, India and Taiwan. One of the largest agencies struck by the attack was the National Health Service hospitals in England and Scotland, and up to 70,000 devices – including computers, MRI scanners, blood-storage refrigerators and theatre equipment – may have been affected. On 12 May, some NHS services had to turn away non-critical emergencies, and some ambulances were diverted. In 2016, thousands of computers in 42 separate NHS trusts in England were reported to be still running Windows XP. In 2018 a report by Members of Parliament concluded that all 200 NHS hospitals or other organizations checked in the wake of the WannaCry attack still failed cyber security checks.https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201719/cmselect/cmpubacc/787/787.pdf NHS hospitals in Wales and Northern Ireland were unaffected by the attack. Nissan Motor Manufacturing UK in Tyne and Wear, England, halted production after the ransomware infected some of their systems. Renault also stopped production at several sites in an attempt to stop the spread of the ransomware. Spain's Telefónica, FedEx and Deutsche Bahn were hit, along with many other countries and companies worldwide. The attack's impact is said to be relatively low compared to other potential attacks of the same type and could have been much worse had Marcus Hutchins not discovered that a kill- switch had been built in by its creators or if it had been specifically targeted on highly critical infrastructure, like nuclear power plants, dams or railway systems. According to cyber-risk-modeling firm Cyence, economic losses from the cyber attack could reach up to US$4 billion, with other groups estimating the losses to be in the hundreds of millions. = Affected organizations = The following is an alphabetical list of organisations confirmed to have been affected:  Reactions  A number of experts highlighted the NSA's non-disclosure of the underlying vulnerability, and their loss of control over the EternalBlue attack tool that exploited it. Edward Snowden said that if the NSA had \\"privately disclosed the flaw used to attack hospitals when they found it, not when they lost it, the attack may not have happened\\". British cybersecurity expert Graham Cluley also sees \\"some culpability on the part of the U.S. intelligence services\\". According to him and others \\"they could have done something ages ago to get this problem fixed, and they didn't do it\\". He also said that despite obvious uses for such tools to spy on people of interest, they have a duty to protect their countries' citizens. Others have also commented that this attack shows that the practice of intelligence agencies to stockpile exploits for offensive purposes rather than disclosing them for defensive purposes may be problematic. Microsoft president and chief legal officer Brad Smith wrote, \\"Repeatedly, exploits in the hands of governments have leaked into the public domain and caused widespread damage. An equivalent scenario with conventional weapons would be the U.S. military having some of its Tomahawk missiles stolen.\\" Russian President Vladimir Putin placed the responsibility of the attack on U.S. intelligence services, for having created EternalBlue. On 17 May 2017, United States bipartisan lawmakers introduced the PATCH Act that aims to have exploits reviewed by an independent board to \\"balance the need to disclose vulnerabilities with other national security interests while increasing transparency and accountability to maintain public trust in the process\\". On 15 June 2017, the United States Congress was to hold a hearing on the attack. Two subpanels of the House Science Committee were to hear the testimonies from various individuals working in the government and non-governmental sector about how the US can improve its protection mechanisms for its systems against similar attacks in the future. Marcus Hutchins, a cybersecurity researcher, working in loose collaboration with UK's National Cyber Security Centre, researched the malware and discovered a \\"kill switch\\". Later globally dispersed security researchers collaborated online to develop open source tools that allow for decryption without payment under some circumstances. Snowden states that when \\"NSA-enabled ransomware eats the Internet, help comes from researchers, not spy agencies\\" and asks why this is the case. Other experts also used the publicity around the attack as a chance to reiterate the value and importance of having good, regular and secure backups, good cybersecurity including isolating critical systems, using appropriate software, and having the latest security patches installed. Adam Segal, director of the digital and cyberspace policy program at the Council on Foreign Relations, stated that \\"the patching and updating systems are broken, basically, in the private sector and in government agencies\\". In addition, Segal said that governments' apparent inability to secure vulnerabilities \\"opens a lot of questions about backdoors and access to encryption that the government argues it needs from the private sector for security\\". Arne Schönbohm, president of Germany's Federal Office for Information Security (BSI), stated that \\"the current attacks show how vulnerable our digital society is. It's a wake-up call for companies to finally take IT security [seriously]\\". =United Kingdom= The effects of the attack also had political implications; in the United Kingdom, the impact on the National Health Service quickly became political, with claims that the effects were exacerbated by Government underfunding of the NHS; in particular, the NHS ceased its paid Custom Support arrangement to continue receiving support for unsupported Microsoft software used within the organization, including Windows XP. Home Secretary Amber Rudd refused to say whether patient data had been backed up, and Shadow Health Secretary Jon Ashworth accused Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt of refusing to act on a critical note from Microsoft, the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) and the National Crime Agency that had been received two months previously. Others argued that hardware and software vendors often fail to account for future security flaws, selling systems that − due to their technical design and market incentives − eventually won't be able to properly receive and apply patches. The NHS denied that it was still using XP, claiming only 4.7% of devices within the organization ran Windows XP. The cost of the attack to the NHS was estimated as £92 million in disruption to services and IT upgrades. After the attack, NHS Digital refused to finance the estimated £1 billion to meet the Cyber Essentials Plus standard, an information security certification organized by the UK NCSC, saying this would not constitute \\"value for money\\", and that it had invested over £60 million and planned \\"to spend a further £150 [million] over the next two years\\" to address key cyber security weaknesses. 2018 email scam In late June, hundreds of computer users reported being sent an email from someone (or multiple people), claiming to be the developers of WannaCry. The email threatened to destroy the victims' data unless they sent 0.1 BTC to the Bitcoin address of the hackers. This has also happened in 2019.

The Eagles were led by fifth- year head coach Mike Holovak, and played their home games at Alumni Field in Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts and Fenway Park in Boston. Team captain John Miller went on to play four seasons in the National Football League. The team won its first three games and was ranked No. 17 in the AP Poll after those three victories. The team suffered its first loss to Xavier, and one week later lost a close game to Miami by a 14-7 score at the Orange Bowl. In the annual Green Line Rivalry game, Boston College gained 420 yards and defeated Boston University, 40-12, before a crowd of 25,827.

For this second game, due to the lack of professional players in the region, the two coaches Mario Pesquera and Javier Imbroda had called up three foreign players.

Taxonomy and systematics The genus Concinnia belongs to the Australian Sphenomorphid clade that contains other genera such as Ctenotus, Anomalopus and the Eulamprus water skinks. This genus was raised by Skinner et al.(2013) based on molecular phylogenetic analysis of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences, which showed that five sampled species from the Eulamprus tenuis group formed a well supported clade with the then monotypic genera Gnypetoscincus and Nangura. Wells and Wellington (1983) coined the name Concinnia and applied it to the Eulamprus tenuis group delimited by Greer (1989). Although this tenuis group may form a clade it did not receive strong support in molecular phylogenetic analyses, with C. amplus and C. frerei forming deep lineages of uncertain position relative to C. queenslandiae and C. spinosus. Consequently, Skinner et al. (2013) united the well supported broader clade, including Gnypetoscincus and Nangura in Concinnia, including C. frerei and C. sokosoma based on the work of O'Connor and Moritz (2003). Skinner and co-authors (2013) further restricted the genus Eulamprus to the water skinks assigned by Greer (1989) to the Eulamprus quoyii group and created two new genera; Silvascincus for species in Greer's (1989) Eulamprus murrayi group (including E. murrayi and E. tryoni), and Tumbunascincus for Eulamprus luteilateralis. Species There are currently eight recognized species: * Concinnia amplus Covacevich & McDonald, 1980 – lemon-barred forest-skink * Concinnia brachyosoma (Lönnberg and Andersson, 1915) – northern barsided skink * Concinnia frerei Greer, 1992 – stout barsided skink * Concinnia martini Wells & Wellington, 1983 – dark barsided skink * Concinnia queenslandiae (De Vis, 1890) – prickly skink, prickly forest skink * Concinnia sokosoma Greer, 1992 – stout barsided skink * Concinnia tenuis (Gray, 1831) bar-sided forest-skink, barred-sided skink * Concinnia tigrinus (De Vis, 1888) – yellow-blotched forest-skink, rainforest water-skink Hinulia elegans, described by Gray in 1838, is an unidentified lygosomine that may be Concinnia tenuis.Shea & Michels (2008).
