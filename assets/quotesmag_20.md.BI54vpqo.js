The privately owned paper was originally associated with the American Lithuanian Socialist Union, forerunner of the Lithuanian Socialist Federation of the Socialist Party of America. After the 1919 split of that organization into Socialist and Communist wings, Laisvƒó became an organ of the Communist Party of America. The paper was one of the most influential and longest-running radical Lithuanian language newspapers in the US, issued daily from 1919 through 1958. History=Establishment= Laisvƒó was launched in Boston, Massachusetts on April 5, 1911 under the editorship of Antanas Montvydas, a recent immigrant from Lithuania.Algirdas Martin Budreckis, \\"Lithuanians,\\" in Dirk Hoerder with Christiane Hoerder (eds.), The Immigrant Labor Press in North America, 1840s-1970s: An Annotated Bibliography: Volume 2: Migrants from Eastern and Southeastern Europe. Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1987; pg. 167. Produced twice a week at the time of its launch, the paper quickly found a readership among the Lithuanian-American community and achieved a circulation of 5,000 within its first year. Although privately owned, Laisvƒó was closely associated with the Amerikos Lietuvi≈≥ Socialist≈≥ SƒÖjunga (ALSS, American Lithuanian Socialist Union), established in 1904.Tim Davenport, \\"Foreign Language Federations (1890s-1930): Lithuanian Federations,\\" Early American Marxism website, www.marxisthistory.org/ Independent for a decade, this Lithuanian- speaking organization voted to affiliate with the Socialist Party of America (SPA) at the end of December 1914 and formally joined early the next year, becoming the Lithuanian Socialist Federation. =Development= The Lithuanian-American socialist movement showed significant growth during the decade of the 1910s, and Laisvƒó benefited from the expansion. Leonas Pr≈´seika came on board to edit the publication in 1912 and moved the semi-weekly from Boston to Brooklyn, New York in 1914. By 1917 the paper's circulation had nearly tripled from its inaugural year, hitting 14,850. Circulation declined somewhat during the wartime years, but the publication was not destroyed by the draconian actions against anti-war publications taken by Postmaster General Albert S. Burleson and the Woodrow Wilson administration. In 1919, following the end of World War I circulation remained at the 14,000 mark. In the summer of 1919, the Emergency National Convention of the Socialist Party formalized the split of the organization into antagonistic Socialist and Communist wings. The Lithuanian Socialist Federation had already been suspended in June 1919 by the National Executive Committee of the SPA in June as part of the factional war and that group moved en masse into the newly established Communist Party of America (CPA). Laisvƒó also shifted its affiliation, becoming a de facto CPA publication. The paper was moved to a daily publication schedule (except Sunday) and its circulation increased again, hitting 17,800 in 1920‚Äîa figure that would prove to be the high point in its history. Laisvƒó was formally owned by an entity called the Lithuanian Cooperative Publishing Society.Solon DeLeon with Nathan Fine (eds.), American Labor Press Directory. New York: Rand School of Social Science, 1925; pg. 20. The paper maintained its office at 46 Ten Eyck Street in Brooklyn. Laisvƒó would remain a daily from 1919 to 1958, with its circulation gradually declining over time. The paper, typically 4 to 6 pages in length, carried a variety of national and international news and remained strongly supportive of the Soviet Union throughout its entire history, including such controversial events as the Soviet occupation of the Baltic states in the summer of 1940 and the Soviet establishment of permanent control over the Lithuanian nation in 1944. In the period after World War II, Laisvƒó increased its coverage of events in Soviet Lithuania, including reprints from the Soviet Lithuanian press from 1970. =Decline and demise= The continuing decrease in numbers of the Lithuanian-speaking population in America and the general decline of the American Communist movement were decisive in the demise of Laisvƒó. The paper moved from a daily to a weekly publication schedule in 1958. The paper's editor of three decades, Roy Mizara, died in 1967, to be succeeded by longtime Lithuanian-American Communist journalist and historian Anthony Bimba. Bimba himself died in 1982, shortly before the final demise of the publication in 1986.

The presiding deity at this temple is Shiva, known as Kumara Bhimeswara. The most important festival that is celebrated in this temple is Maha Sivarathri. The temple is historically prominent, as it was built by Chalukyas who reigned over this location. Construction of the temple started in 892 and completed around 922. It is similar to the temple in Draksharamam, but is also unique, such as the linga being white. The temple still stands strong, and it was made a National Heritage Site. It resembles a twin of Draksharam, with two staired Mandapa, and notable that it is in excellent condition, without any cracks. Though the temple is not in a populated place, people do visit there. The linga is a limestone, high. The temple was built in Dravidian style, by the King Chalukya Bhima. Hence, the god name is Bhimeswara (between 892-922CE). The Kakatiya rulers (in the period 1340-1466CE) have added and renovated the temple pillars with very fine sharp finishes. The work of Chalukyas and Kakatiyas is very easily distinguished, by the well-decorated and polished pillars in the temple to the rest of the temple, both new and old. The construction of this temple is so solid that it has not changed much through all the years, when compared to the Draksharaam temple. Kala Bhairava is also of importance, and Balatripura sundari is the Goddess. Sasanas between 1147-1494 were scripted into pillars of the temple, which also have lists of gifts given, through the ages, for the temple. Recent excavations in the compound of the temple has yielded many figures dated back 1000 years are now present inside the temple. In Puranas it has been written that it is a Yogakshetram, which means, the person who has the \\"yogam\\" (\\"fated to have\\" or \\"opportunity given by god\\" or \\"boon\\") to visit, will visit the temple. The Andhra Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation (APSRTC), Kakinada Depot runs circular tours covering all the 5 pancharamas (Amaravathi, Bhimavaram, Palakollu, Draksharama, and Samalkota) in a span of 24 hours. The journey starts at 8:00 pm every Sunday and ends at 8:00 pm next day covering approximately. Currently charges are Rs.350/- and are inclusive of darshan charges at the respective places. Nearby this temple, there is one more temple, \\"Mandavya narayana swamy temple\\". This temple is situated on one bank of the canal. Once upon a time, a great saint named Madavya did tapas for Narayanaswamy at this place, and he got the dharshan of Lord Narayana swamy at this place. So this temple is named as Mandavya Narayana Swamy temple. It is said that Indra came to this place to have the saint Mandavya dharshan, with his Pushpaka Vimanam. This temple was built with very good architecture. In Samalkot, there is one more old temple which has more age than above-mentioned temples, i.e. \\"Trimukha lingam temple\\". As the lingam has three faces, this temple is named like that, and the three faces are believed as the Trimurtulu (Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva). This temple was totally buried, and only the upper portion is visible, of the lingam, which is of long.

The population was 4,945 at the 2010 census. Northwestern Oklahoma State University is located in Alva. History Alva was established in 1893 as a General Land Office for the Cherokee Outlet land run, the largest of the land rushes that settled western and central Oklahoma. The site was chosen for its location on the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railway and likely named for a railroad attorney, Alva Adams, who had become governor of Colorado. When the Southern Kansas Railway, began extending its line from Kiowa, Kansas across the Cherokee Outlet in 1886, Alva became the first railroad station southwest of Kiowa. The line was operational in 1887, in time for the opening of the Unassigned Lands. The United States Secretary of the Interior chose Alva as the seat of County M when Oklahoma Territory was organized in 1890. A U.S. government land office opened there before a presidential proclamation on August 19, 1893, opened the Cherokee Outlet for general settlement. The actual land run occurred September 16, 1893. By then, Alva's site had been formally surveyed and platted. In 1896, three years after the land run, George Cromwell and \\"Coal Oil Johnny\\" Broughan created and managed the Alva Giants, the city's first traveling baseball team including pitcher Bill McGill, who went on to join the St. Louis Browns in 1907. Northwestern Territorial Normal School, now Northwestern Oklahoma State University, was established in 1897 in Alva by the Oklahoma Territorial Legislature. During World War II, Alva was the site of a prisoner of war camp for German POWs. On July 19, 1943, the United States Department of War ordered that Camp Alva would be the place for the internment of the most troublesome German prisoners of war ‚Äì \\"Nazi leaders, Gestapo agents, and extremists\\".

Education Northwestern Normal School, 1901 Alva is home to Northwestern Oklahoma State University (NWOSU), founded in 1897 as a 'Northwestern Normal School'. President James E. Ament and two teachers made up the first faculty, with classes meeting in the Congregational Church. The college's main building was built in 1899 and known as the \\"Castle on the Hill,\\" a huge, fanciful brick building, modeled after a Norman castle, that towered over much of the town. The Castle burned down in 1935 and was replaced by Jesse Dunn Hall, which was dedicated in 1937 by Eleanor Roosevelt. By 1939, all of the normal schools, including Northwestern State College, offered bachelor's degrees and were reclassified as state colleges. In the 1950s, Northwestern added a fifth-year program culminating in a master's degree. In 1974, the name changed to its present 'Northwestern Oklahoma State University'. In 1996, branch campuses in Woodward and Enid expanded the university's useful service area. The university also boasts a proud tradition in athletics, competing as the Northwestern Oklahoma State Rangers in the Great American Conference. Formerly residing in the Sooner Athletic Conference in the NAIA, the Rangers made the move to NCAA Division II membership in 2012 under the direction of current university president Dr. Janet Cunningham, and former Director of Athletics Andrew Carter. Northwest Technology Center is based in Alva. The Alva Independent School District oversees the 5 public school facilities and a district office in the Alva area. Economy Agriculture has been the basis of the city's economy since it was founded. Initially, the local farms produced a variety of crops and livestock. The original 160-acre farms have mostly been consolidated into much larger units, concentrating on production of beef and wheat. Aeronautics firm Vantage Plane Plastics, located at the airport, claims the title of \\"the world's largest supplier of FAA Approved interior components for most all general aviation aircraft\\", employing 24 people with 2016 gross sales of $3.8 Million. In 1998 a group of local wheat farmers founded the frozen dough manufacturing facility, Value Added Products, a cooperative that in 2017 employed 83 people with an annual payroll of $2.2 Million. NWOSU is the largest employer in Alva. Currently Alva has a city sales tax of 4.35%, the Woods County tax rate of 0.5% and a State tax rate of 4.5% for a combined tax rate of 9.25% Government Alva has an aldermanic form of government. Transportation U.S. Route 64 runs east‚Äìwest through the center of the city, intersecting U.S. Route 281, which runs north‚Äìsouth. U.S. Route 281 joins U.S. Route 64 for one mile between College Boulevard (west) and Lane Boulevard (east) on Oklahoma Boulevard. Alva Regional Airport, a 650-acre general aviation facility owned and operated by the city, is immediately south of the city on the west side of U.S. Route 281. Alva is located on the Panhandle Subdivision of the Southern Transcon route of the BNSF Railway. This is the main transcontinental route between Los Angeles and Chicago, and carries an average of 90 freight trains per day. In January 2015 BNSF Railway announced an expansion project to add a second track between Wellington, Kansas and Avard, Oklahoma passing through Alva as part of a $175 million expansion in the South Region. Work on the project will start by 2016 and is expected to be completed by 2017.

The routes would have had a width of up to , and be accessed by over 200 ramps throughout the city, subject to a toll of ¬£1. The developers of the project estimated that the cycle paths would accommodate 400,000 riders during rush hour and shave 30 minutes off current travel time. If the project became a reality, its construction was estimated to take over 20 years. The project was the creation of landscape architects Exterior Architecture and Space Syntax, with whom Norman Foster of Foster and Partners had been working since 2012. The proposals were welcomed by Network Rail. History The idea for the project originated in 2011 with Sam Martin, the director of Exterior Architecture, and his employee Oli Clark. Clark had proposed a network of elevated cycle routes around Battersea Power Station for his student dissertation. Following email communication with the office of the Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, Clark and Martin had a meeting with Isabel Dedring, the Deputy Mayor for Transport, incidentally encountering Johnson himself on their way to it, who was enthusiastic upon being told about the project. Dedring then arranged meetings with Dave Ward, the executive director of Network Rail. Dedring and Ward suggested that the group design an initial phase of the network, following the route of the Great Eastern Main Line between Stratford station and Liverpool Street station. Martin approached Foster and Partners for planning assistance. The group estimated the cost of the first phase as ¬£220 million, and the cost of the entire project between ¬£7 and 8 billion. In October 2012, the proposal was rejected by Johnson, following a meeting of representatives of Network Rail and Transport for London, who had expressed concerns that estimated costs for the project had not been fully worked out and that London did not have sufficient railway capacity to build on. In 2014 the developers were said to be seeking funds for a feasibility study. Reception The cycling charity CTC expressed concern over the wind exposure that riders would face when using SkyCycle, as well as the steepness of the ramps. Wired called the project \\"amazing\\". ArchDaily said the project would divert resources away from more important projects and have some negative consequences. BBC News called it a \\"radical solution to protect cyclists\\".

In September 2018, TV Sins was created which focuses on highlighting errors in popular TV shows. As of , the channel has amassed over two billion views and eight million subscribers, and over 700 films (and over 2,000 episodes combined from all channels) were sinned.thecussingchannel - YouTube. Retrieved 20 June 2014. Video series CinemaSins was launched on December 11, 2012 on YouTube, and uploaded their first two-minute long video titled \\"Everything Wrong With The Amazing Spider-Man\\" by Jeremy Scott. Due to the success, CinemaSins have released seven other series. =Everything Wrong With...= CinemaSins' main video series, Everything Wrong With..., explores a certain film's amusing, generally poor writing, acting, direction, production values, deus ex machina examples, cliches, instances that defy logic and physics, factual errors, poor visual effects, derivative premises and other content that they deem \\"sins.\\" Most transgressions are awarded a single sin, but on occasion more sins (as much as 1 billion, as seen in the Home Alone 2: Lost in New York episode) are awarded for effect, and even \\"broke\\" the sin counter on one episode (that occurred on the episode of The Fate of the Furious and 161 sins were instead displayed as R.I.P.; because of the damage, a 2.0 was temporarily replaced until it was fixed again in Scream 2). However, there are times when sins are removed due to the presence of a scene which is considered exceptionally good, which makes up for the original sin (an exception was done during an April Fool's Joke in 2016 for the film Troll 2 by removing a total of 10,000 sins before resetting to zero in the end. On two occasions (The Avengers and Doctor Strange), the sin counter additionally counted sins by mistake or added by the narrator. CinemaSins has been known to show great disdain for certain directors, such as Michael Bay, Roland Emmerich, McG, Joel Schumacher, Zack Snyder and M. Night Shyamalan. Each video begins with two taglines added on the film's title card (\\"In x minutes or less\\" (X was rounded up total minutes of runtime, excluding verdict, intro, bonus round and outtakes), and \\"Spoilers! (Duh)\\" (indicating the film's potential spoiler content)); the video was then played with an on-screen \\"sin count\\" and \\"sin timer\\" (video runtime) throughout (with common expletives and profanities censored), and ends with a \\"verdict\\" for the film. The early videos usually featured generic verdicts like \\"Hell\\", though eventually they came to employ words or phrases that refer to the film's content, such as lines of dialogue or settings, accompanied with audio samples or snippets to narrate the verdict. On rare occasions, a film will start with negative sins because of how good it is or because of a good decision early in the film, such as not overexposing the studios' logos. Frequently, the first sin listed is the total length of the logo sequences of the various production companies involved in the film. Usually all of the sins are written by Scott and Atkinson; in one case, Iron Man 3's sins are described by the subscribers instead (Scott still did the video's narration and the bonus round). Some videos feature a \\"bonus round\\", in which additional sins are added (removed, in the case of Deadpool and Deadpool 2) to the count for repetitive occurrences in the filmThe Huffington Post UK (1 March 2013). \\"The 62 Errors In 'Skyfall'\\". The Huffington Post. Retrieved 18 January 2014.\\"Everything Wrong With 'Star Trek Into Darkness' In 7 Minutes Or Less\\". The Huffington Post UK. 20 August 2013. Retrieved 18 January 2014.\\"Everything Wrong With Jurassic Park In 3 minutes Or Less\\". The Huffington Post UK. 15 May 2013. Retrieved 18 January 2014. The sin count rarely reflects the reviewer's relative overall opinion of the film, so their true opinion is usually made clear in the video descriptions. These videos are almost exclusively narrated by Scott, with the following videos being exceptions, which usually featured special guest narrators: *Atkinson narrated Prometheus on behalf of Scott; *Canadian YouTuber Matthew Santoro narrated Underworld: Evolution; *Nostalgia Critic's host Doug Walker narrated How the Grinch Stole Christmas!; *Screen Junkies host Jon Bailey narrated Iron Man 3 and The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (the latter was a crossover, with Bailey did a \\"Everything Wrong With\\" video, while Scott did a Honest Trailers video); *Astrophysicist and author Neil deGrasse Tyson narrated Gravity, Interstellar and The Martian; *Couch Tomato narrated the bonus round for Finding Dory (\\"20 Reasons Why Finding Nemo and Finding Dory are the Same Movie\\") Each episode consist of one video playing about 15-20 minutes or more, but four episodes (Transformers: Age of Extinction, and the first three episodes of Star Wars) were split into two parts due to video overruns; Furious 7 episode was also split into two videos but had the audio outtakes separated into another video. Certain stock criticisms are used as running gags, a number of which are ironic references to certain films, such as someone/something having \\"gone to the Prometheus school of running away from things\\" and \\"[Insert Character] would be excellent at CinemaSins\\" or \\"No one will be seated during the...\\" suggesting that a given scene is excessively boring or drawn out. Sometimes these criticisms are used in a doubly-ironic fashion within the very films that they reference, such as the alien characters in Signs being sinned for having \\"the same weakness as the aliens in Signs\\". During every movie made by a Comcast company, like Universal or DreamWorks, \\"Comcast\\" sin was always played first. Whenever a film title is mentioned in a movie, \\"Roll Credits\\" (or its similar text) sin is played. Movies made for children tend to be less harshly criticized. For example, Megamind receives its share of sins, but they are delivered in a more lighthearted manner. \\"Everything Wrong With\\" videos are typically added every Tuesday and Thursday of the week (with exception of mid-September 2014 (and every September since), which only uploads on Tuesdays). Videos are selected and sinned, most commonly chosen by popular demand, though usually by at least one of the following reasons: *A prequel film (or a series) to promote an upcoming film, usually sequels, and sometimes film reboots or remakes; *An actor or director's prior film role in relation to the upcoming film; *A seasonal-themed film to celebrate holidays; or any Academy Award-accolade film to promote the annual Academy Awards; *A particular theme, genre or company in relation to an upcoming film; *In rare cases, anniversaries for the film or a particular director/actor; *Other reasons, through special cases if the aforementioned reasons do not fit in the criteria. When doing sins videos that are based on other media, such as books, television series or video games, CinemaSins normally never refers to the source materials on which the films are based, instead believing that the feature should stand or fall on its own merit. Usually, at the end of a sins video, audio from other TV shows, films or songs with similar themes or motifs will be played over clips from the film. At times, they will also advertise other sponsored products like Audible, Nature Box, Crunchyroll, Squarespace and Scott's book The Ables, released on May 1, 2015. Since September 2018, re- uploads of older episodes are found on YouTube, with some of the videos done by reworked sins, while the older uploads are removed. =Spin-off series= CinemaSins success had led to the production of three other spin-off channels under the \\"Everything Wrong With...\\" subtitle. On April 3, 2014, CinemaSins launched their Music Video Sins channel. On October 8, 2014, Brand Sins was launched. On September 4, 2018, a third spin-off channel, TV Sins, featuring reviews of popular drama serials, was launched. =Conversations With Myself About Movies= In the Conversations With Myself About Movies series, Scott has a conversation with an edited-in version of himself about a movie. The \\"Conversations\\" videos also included clues as to the next \\"Sins\\" video, as well as a few red herrings. =Movie Recipes= Movie Recipes is a series that makes food that tastes \\"exactly like the movie\\", usually taking elements from the movie and putting it into the recipe in different ways. The videos were put on hiatus with the final of the original entries being Scott's cameo in the Nostalgia Critic's review of A Christmas Story 2. The behind-the-scenes video showcasing the filming of the cameo featured Scott mentioning that the repulsive and possibly hazardous taste of the resultant foods was the reason he stopped making the videos. Scott retooled the series in March 2016, with dishes prepared by professional chefs instead. =What's the Damage?= What's the Damage is a video series where CinemaSins counts the actual cost of things damaged in a movie, with the prices coinciding with their worth at the time of release.The Huffington Post UK (30 December 2013). \\"Revealed: The Financial Damage Done In 'Die Hard'\\". The Huffington Post. Retrieved 18 January 2014. Podcast On January 9, 2016, the podcast \\"Sincast, presented by CinemaSins\\" was launched. It is hosted by Scott, Atkinson and Music Video Sins writer Barrett Share. Early episodes were about half an hour long, but since late 2016 most of them are around two hours long. The format has changed a few times since launch, but generally the trio discuss a larger topic for the greater part of the episode and then round of the episode by answering a couple of questions from listeners. The topics include discussion about upcoming movies, their favorite movies in different genres, stories from the host trio's time as movie theatre employees and recasting classic movies. On a few occasions the podcast has had a special guest, among them movie critic Aaron Dicer, storyboard artist Jeremy Simser, movie critic Jessie Maltin (daughter of Leonard Maltin) and the people behind the horror movie website Modern Horrors. There is also the occasional \\"MiniPod\\", where the hosts review recently released high-profile movies, such as Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, Get Out and Dunkirk. The first half of the episode is spoiler-free, whereas the other half contains spoilers to allow the hosts to go into deeper discussion about the movie. In September 2017, Scott, Atkinson and Share appeared at the Wizard World Comic Con in Nashville and taped their first podcast in front of a live audience. Jason Mewes and Brian O'Halloran appeared as guests on the episode. On May 16, 2019, CinemaSins announced that the podcast channel along with its archives can be listened and viewed on YouTube. = Special Themes = In addition to the regular content consisting of news, rants, recommendations, warnings, and Q&A;, some episodes will partially or entirely focus on a theme. These include: * Theater Stories: Each regular host has experience working in movie theaters and these episodes focus on funny, bizarre, and entertaining stories from their time in the industry. * Season Previews: Movies from upcoming months are discussed. * Best Movie from Each Year You've Been Alive: Prompted from a question, this multiple episode series included discussion on the difference movies from the years the hosts have been alive, beginning with 1975. The hosts would conclude by voting with what they believe to be the best movie of the year to them resulting in a single movie by consensus. * Movie Bracket: A multiple episode series inspired by the NCAA basketball tournament, the hosts used the winners and solid runners-up from the Best Movie from Each Year You've Been Alive to create a bracket of movies that would be paired with one another and the hosts voting on which movie would advance. No quantitative evidence was used, rather a simple in-the-moment feel from each host was used in their voting. This was not intended to be an all-inclusive list of best movies, but rather intended as entertainment and discussion-inducing. * Mount Rushmore: A multiple episode series intended to identify the top-four of different topics in movies. The final voting often went beyond four and this series ended. * Defining the Decade: A short multiple episode series discussing the characteristics and movies of the past decades beginning with the 1970s. * Cinematic Road Trip: A multiple episode series in which the hosts and guests discuss movies set in and/or filmed in different states of the United States. Controversy and criticisms CinemaSins has attracted criticism from several filmmakers, including Rian Johnson, Damon Lindelof, C. Robert Cargill, David F. Sandberg, and Jordan Vogt-Roberts. The filmmakers assert that the channel largely fails as genuine criticism because of its excessive and trivial nitpicking, lack of understanding of the filmmaking process, and its often mean-spirited, reductive nature; as Vogt-Roberts put it, \\"these guys are just trolling the art form we love and profiting from it while dumbing down the conversation.\\" YouTuber \\"Bobvids\\" created a series of videos criticizing specific videos of the series as well as the motivations for the series itself, ranging from specific rebuttals to sweeping. Jeremy Scott has claimed that the series is not supposed to be entirely serious in terms of criticism and that most of his nitpicks are intended as comedy; in their response on June 7, 2014, Scott uploaded \\"Everything Wrong With CinemaSins\\", a self-parodying sins video that pokes fun at filmmakers and commenters who have disliked the channel as well as poking fun at the hosts themselves explaining that their videos are filled with sarcasm. The video was set as the channel's preview page and, as of January 1, 2019, went on to become their most watched video at 29 million views; a sequel of the video was made and released on May 7, 2019, and replaced the channel preview video on May 17, 2019. On October 10, 2015, Scott created a video on his personal channel, regarding Screen Junkies and their new series \\"The Review Crew\\", alleging plagiarism of his own review format at the time due to similarities. After both CinemaSins and Screen Junkies received backlash from each other's fans, Scott deleted the video and posted an apology on Twitter the following day. Screen Junkies apologized as well and subsequently cancelled the series. In early 2019, CinemaSins launched a new podcast titled \\"Movies Going on 30\\", with the intent of talking about movies that were released 30 years ago on the corresponding week. This sparked controversy with the podcast \\"80's All Over\\", who accused them of copying their format. In the end, CinemaSins decided to cancel the podcast.

They were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1997. History In 1854, running from a violent storm, Buffalo captain George Tifft ran his schooner over a sandbar and into the protection of Lake Betsie. After the storm, while digging back out, Tifft took the opportunity to explore the area and realized it was an ideal location for a harbor. Soon after Tifft brought word of his discovery back home, a number of people began purchasing property around the lake. In 1859, private interests constructed two short piers and dredged out a channel between them, connecting Betsie Lake to Lake Michigan. The harbor quickly became a popular refuge, and in 1867, Congress directed the Army Corps of Engineers to begin improvements on the harbor. A new channel was cut, and by 1873 two new wooden piers had been constructed and a beacon installed at the pierhead. As the harbor became more utilized, the piers were extended in 1884 and again in 1896, and a new lighthouse (the Frankfort Light, also on the National Register of Historic Places) was installed on the north pier in 1912. In 1928, construction began on a pair of concrete breakwaters at the harbor entrance. Construction was complete by 1932. With the earlier piers now rendered obsolete, plans were made to shorten them, and the 1912 lighthouse was removed from the north pier and relocated at the head of the north breakwater. In 1934 the remaining stub piers were capped with concrete. Piecemeal repairs were done on sections of the piers in the 1950s and 60s. Description Frankfort MI harbor map Aerial view The exterior basin of the Frankfort Harbor is formed by two breakwaters, apart at the outer ends.

Two stub piers line the entrance to the harbor within the breakwaters. The piers are stone-filled timber cribs, wide, with the exception of the shoreward portion of the south pier, which is constructed of wooden pilings filled with sand. The original piers were wrapped in sheet piling in the 1950s-60s, and the entire structure capped in concrete; the piers now range from to wide. The lakeward sections of the breakwaters are stone-filled concrete, with riprap piled against the outside. The shoreward sections are wood pilings filled with stone and copped with concrete. The breakwaters range from to wide. The Frankfort North Breakwater Light is located on the head of the north breakwater. It is a square steel pyramidal tower standing atop a tall square steel base.

Design and development Design work on the Club-Spatz began in 1973. With a span, it was intended to suit gliding clubs and inexperienced pilots, strong and easy to fly and maintain. It is of mixed construction, using a combination of steel tubes with fabric glassfibre covering in the fuselage and with a wooden structured, plywood and glassfibre skinned wing. Despite its name, the Club- Spatz was unrelated to the earlier L-Spatz but developed from the Scheibe SF-27A Zugvogel-V. It is a shoulder wing cantilever monoplane, its wing built around a single wooden spar. Its Wortmann airfoil tapers in thickness/chord ratio from 18% at the root to 12% at the tip. The wing is also tapered in plan, with square tips; its leading edge is glassfibre/foam composite covered, with plywood over the remainder of the wing surface. There are all wood, spring trimmed ailerons and upper surface Schempp-Hirth airbrakes. The fuselage of the Club-Spatz used Scheibe's traditional steel tube construction, glassfibre skinned over the nose and tail and fabric covered between. The cockpit, ahead of the wing, is covered by a long, one piece, side hinged Plexiglas canopy which smoothly blends the nose contours into those of the fuselage behind and terminates at the wing leading edge. Its fuselage tapers to a conventional tail; the rear surfaces are wooden structured and ply skinned. A straight edged tailplane is mounted on top of the fuselage, carrying damped elevators fitted with adjustable spring trimming like the ailerons. Fin and rudder together are straight tapered and square topped, with the latter reaching down to the keel. The Club-Spatz lands on a fixed, unsprung monowheel, fitted with a brake and assisted by a tailwheel. The Club- Spatz flew for the first time on 20 May 1974.

In 2000 it ceased to use the Open outcry method and in 2007 the last operative units were closed. The property of exchange's holding company went to the newly established Foundation of the Bremen Stock Exchange (Stiftung Bremer Wertpapierb√∂rse), a non-profit organisation which is intended to benefit scholarship, research, and culture.  Origins  In the late Middle Ages the Bremer Marktplatz and Liebfrauenkirchhof passage were the most important centres of trade and commerce in Bremen. Desire for an exchange arose at the beginning of the seventeenth century. Therefore, in 1613/4, 28 small houses at the south end of Liebfrauenkirchhof passage were torn down. Twenty-one stone vaults for wine storage were constructed over the next six years. The empty space in the vaults was made into an exchange and was soon playing host to most business activities.  The Old Exchange  Church of Our Lady (at right) and St. Ansgarii's (at left in the background) in 1822 On account of the dilapidation of the vaults and the ever-increasing volume of trade, the Senate of Bremen issued the First Exchange Ordinance on 14 March 1682, as a result of which the architect Jean Baptiste Broebes began construction of a single story building in the Baroque style above the cellar in 1687. A second story, designed by Giselher von Warneck was built between 1734 and 1736. This baroque building is known as the Old Exchange (Alte B√∂rse). On the ground floor there was the trading hall and the lottery office. The office was rebuilt towards the end of the eighteenth century as a book store. In the new second story there was a large banquet hall and two smaller halls for concerts, weddings, guest receptions and similar events. At the time the vaulted cellar was probably connected to the Bremen Ratskeller. Activity in the Old Exchange concentrated predominantly on real estate, merchandise, and banking transactions, but stocks were also traded. After Napoleon Bonaparte and his troops occupied Bremen, the Exchange was temporarily closed by the French. This prompted a move to Kramerhaus and the Town Hall, where commerce was able to continue. In October 1813, after the defeat of the French, the Exchange was able to resume its activities in the building on Liebfrauenkirchhof. In 1816 the Merchants' Guild issued the Second Exchange Ordinance with the support of the Senate. The commercial situation of the merchants was not very promising at the time, but it improved in the 1820s and very soon the Old Exchange was found to be inadequate. The Third Exchange Ordinance was published in 1849, which vested oversight of commerce with a Chamber of Commerce. From 1853, this Chamber received support from the newly founded Bremen Exchange Association (Bremer B√∂rsenverein). Additionally, the building became home to the Upper Court, Lower Court, Commercial Court and Civil Chamber of the Bremen District Court. In 1864, trade was shifter to the New Exchange (Neue B√∂rse) in the Marktplatz. The Old Exchange, no longer in use, burnt down in 1888. After the demolition of the ruins, the vaulted cellar was lowered and made part of the modern Bachuskeller in the Bremer Ratskeller.  The New Exchange  The New Exchange (Neue B√∂rse) in the Marktplatz at the end of the 19th century. In 1855 the Bremen Chamber of Commerce and the Exchange Organisation agreed on the construction of a new building. For this purpose they had an area on the east side of the Marktplatz cleared between 1860 and 1863, demolishing seventeen old gabled houses and Wilhadi Chapel. A new commercial hub was erected between 1861 and 1864 under the direction of Heinrich M√ºller and inaugurated on 5 November 1864. The New Exchange (Neue B√∂rse) on the Marktplatz was a large Neo-gothic building with two towers and a passage to the Sch√ºtting (the offices of the Bremen Chamber of Commerce). The interior was decorated by many of the most well-known artists of the time, including the painters Arthur Fitger and P. Janssen and the sculptor Diedrich Samuel Kropp among others. The building included a great hall, several counting rooms, a meeting room, and offices which were also used by the B√ºrgerschaft of Bremen. In addition there was a restaurant in the basement, which is still in operation. When the New Exchange opened, the trade in securities was still a minor part of its business. It was mainly concerned with the exchange of promissory notes and actual goods. This changed in the 1890s. On 1 January 1890 a stock exchange was set up which would trade in shares and other securities, according to new guidelines. Thereafter the Bremen Stock Exchange grew ever more important and soon made connections with other European institutes. With the entry into force of the Imperial Stock Exchange Act on 23 June 1896 it became a publicly funded organisation. With the establishment of the independent Bremen Cotton Exchange (Bremer Baumwollb√∂rse) trade in goods at the New Exchange significantly decreased. In the course of the November Revolution of 1918, the New Exchange was briefly in the political spotlight when the politician Alfred Henke announced the seizure of power by a Worker's council and the dissolution of the Bremen Senate and B√ºrgerschaft in a hall of the building, marking the beginning of the short-lived Bremen Civic Republic. In 1934 the New Exchange was closed and the civic trade in securities was transferred to the Hanseatic Exchange in Hamburg. = Annex of the New Exchange = Exchange Court A (B√∂rsenhof A) Exchange Court A (B√∂rsenhof A), Am Dom No. 5 A, was an annex of the New Exchange. While the main building built by Heinrich M√ºller between 1861 and 1864 had to be demolished by the B√ºrgerschaft after heavy bombing in 1943, the counting house still survives. This is Exchange Court A, which was placed under protection as a cultural monument of Bremen in 1992. Between 2000 and 2001, this semicircular building was restored and expanded by the Bremen architects Schomers and Sch√ºrmann.  Second World War to present  Bremer Bank building was the home of the Exchange between 1980 and 1990. On 20 December 1943, the main building of the New Exchange was burnt down in an air raid. Only the associated buildings to the east survived. The Bremen Stock Exchange was reopened on 16 February 1949, with the consent of the American occupying power. Business was at first conducted in the Savings Bank and then in a room in the Sch√ºtting. The surviving portion of the Old Exchange was restored and expanded. The ruins of the main building of the New Exchange remained in place for twelve years, until their demolition in 1955. Early in 1957 the Chamber of Commerce sold the lot to the city. The house of the B√ºrgerschaft of Bremen, designed by Wassili Luckhardt, was built there in 1965/6. In 1980 the Exchange moved into the Bremer Bank building on the Domshof. Ten years later it moved into the building at 2-12 on Obernstra√üe near the Marktplatz, which had formerly been occupied by Schr√∂der-Bank. The Bremen Exchange early adopted the use of computers in security trading. From 1990 trades were extensively supported by the program BIFOS. In the following years, further programmes were adopted, including BOSS-CUBE, B√ñGA (now XONTRO) and IBIS (succeeded by Xetra). Further measures were taken, especially to make trading attractive to private lenders, such as the reduction of the lower limit on continuous trading and the significant expansion of trading hours. In addition, the Bremer Exchange was active through subsidiaries in emissions trading, securities trading and settlement for third parties, especially small credit institutes and brokerage firms. This collection of measures led to a significant revival of trading activity from 1990. Beginning in 2000, open outcry was conclusively replaced by computer trading, whereupon the institute moved once more on the basis of changed space requirements and settled about thirty securities dealers and brokers in the Beutsche Bundesbank building on Kohlh√∂ker street. In 2002 it acquired a ten percent share in NASDAQ Deutschland AG, together with NASDAQ Europe AG (50%), the Berlin Exchange (10%), comdirect (7.5%), Commerzbank (7.5%) and Dresdner Bank (15%). The goal was the establishment of a new German stock exchange on the model of NASDAQ in the USA. However, expectations were not met. In March 2003 the Bremen Exchange merged with the Berlin Exchange as the Exchange Bremen-Berlin (B√∂rse Berlin-Bremen). In 2005 the operating company of the Bremen Exchange was sold to the Swiss Exchange after the failure of the joint venture with NASDAQ. In 2007, the agreement with the Berlin Exchange was dissolved.Press release of 18 June 2007\\"Die Bremer B√∂rse wird aufgel√∂st\\" in Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung Nr. 163, 17th July 2007.

It registered 7.0 on the Richter magnitude scale and was located at a depth of . Aftershocks continued to be felt until 15 September. Damage and casualties The destructive force of the 1692 Salta earthquake was measured at IX on the Mercalli intensity scale. It completely destroyed the small village of Talavera del Esteco, in the province of Salta. It caused 13 deaths and injuries as well as significant damage to the city of Salta. Aftermath Statue of the Se√±or del Milagro Statue of the Virgen del Milagro Salte√±o tradition has it that the number of victims was not higher because the earthquake occurred during the day and that the villagers were able to take measures to prevent greater damage. It is recounted that, in the middle of the chaos of the earthquake, while the houses were shaking and roofs were falling off, that the image of the Immaculate Conception (then called the Virgen del Milagro), then located in the main cathedral, fell some three meters to the ground. Villagers, who had run to the church to pray, saw that the image was not only undamaged from the fall, but that it had fallen at the feet of the image of Christ. The villages interpreted that the image was interceding to Christ on behalf of the village. The following day the villagers paraded the image through the streets. The Salte√±os began venerating the image and praying for it to stop the earthquake. The tremors continued for two more days. On 8 October 1692 the Salta town council labelled the events of 13‚Äì15 September as miraculous. Nuestra Se√±ora del Milagro was appointed \\"advocate\\" of the city and 13 September declared a national holiday. On 15 October she was recognized as Patroness and Advocate of Salta. The miraculous events of 13‚Äì15 September 1692 was the commencement of what has become the yearly Fiesta del milagro (Feast of the miracle) on 15 September each year. The celebrations commence with festivities as early as 6 September and continue until the 15th when the images of Christ and the Virgen del Milagro, are paraded through the streets in a grand procession. The Fiesta del milagro is the most popular religious festival in Salta and one of the most important in Argentina. Esteco CONICET archaeologists and other investigators undertook excavations at the site where the city of Esteco II (officially called Nuestra Se√±ora de Talavera de Madrid) was destroyed by the 1692 earthquake. The excavations were done within a area. They found a wall and one of the four towers of the fort that protected the city, located in R√≠o Piedras, in the departament of Met√°n.

Rua Fernandes Vi√™ira and Avenida Afr√¢nio Peixoto roughly form a boundary between the peninsula and the city of Salvador. The Church of Our Lady of Penha (), one of the earliest structures, occupies the northern tip of the peninsula.  Etymology  The name \\"Itapagipe\\" comes from the Tupi language and means \\"place of the stone in the river\\" (ita, stone + paba, place + 'y, river + pe, in). History The peninsula was settled soon after the founding of Salvador in the mid-16th century. The historic center of Salvador, which sits a high bluff, was subject to frequent landslides throughout the colonial period. They caused widespread destruction, both the death of residents of the area and the destruction of public building. Marcos de Noronha, Viceroy of Brazil from 1806 to 1808, transferred the administration of Salvador to the peninsula, and called on the architects Jo√£o Silva Muniz and Jos√© da Costa e Silva, both of Rio de Janeiro, to oversee the project.

History Deutenhofen is first mentioned around 926-937 as \\"Titinhoua\\" (Hof des Tito). The settlement may well be older based on its name. The castle was built some time before 1341, when the owner was the knight Ulrich Gruber. Around 1550 it became the seat of the Tewtenhofen hofmark, a form of Bavarian feudal estate, and remained so until 1834. From the 16th century it was the property of the Reitmor (Reitmayer) family, who converted it to approximately its current form. Dr. Johann von M√§ndl was born on 8 January 1588 as a commoner, studied jurisprudence in Ingolstadt and in Perugia, Italy, and then joined the service of Maximilian I, Elector of Bavaria. He rose to a position equivalent to Minister of Finance. He was ennobled in 1623, and bought the hofmark of Deutenhofen in 1624. In 1632 the castle was burned down by Swedes under Bernard of Saxe-Weimar during the Thirty Years' War. After the war Johann von M√§ndl rebuilt and expanded the building. In 1834 it was sold to the Count of Spreti. Recent years After World War II the castle was used as an auxiliary hospital. In 1970 it became a nursing home for old people operated by the Bavarian Red Cross. Starting in 2012 the building became a refugee center. The Dachau District was assigned about 100 refugees by the government of Upper Bavaria at relatively short notice. With no time for renovations, the first refugees would be accommodated in rooms already suitable for occupation by the old people. The old portion of the schloss contains a small chapel, a simple, white-painted room with a vaulted ceiling.

The 17th-century tower consists of sections which become narrower towards the top. While there is little documentary evidence of the history of the church, it is known that its construction was well advanced by the end of the 13th century. Over the years, the building has undergone several transformations. The sacristy is an addition from the early 16th century while plastered ceiling vaults were added in the 18th century, covering the medieval woodwork until they were recently removed. In 1990, the church was seriously damaged by fire. Thereafter it was no longer used as a church and was deconsecrated.

It saw active service during the First World War in the Middle East, notably at Aden and in particular in the Sinai and Palestine Campaign, from 1915 to 1918. A second line battery, 2/1st Berkshire RHA, served on the Western Front in 1917 and 1918 as part of an Army Field Artillery Brigade. After the Armistice, it was reconstituted as a Royal Field Artillery battery of the Territorial Army (TA), later being expanded into a full heavy anti-aircraft (HAA) regiment that served during World War II in the Battle of Britain and Blitz, in the assault landings in North Africa (Operation Torch), Sicily (Operation Husky) and Italy (Operation Avalanche). Postwar, it continued in the TA until 1968. Formation The Territorial Force (TF) was formed on 1 April 1908 following the enactment of the Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907 (7 Edw.7, c.9) which combined and re-organised the old Volunteer Force, the Honourable Artillery Company and the Yeomanry. On formation, the TF contained 14 infantry divisions and 14 mounted yeomanry brigades. Each yeomanry brigade included a horse artillery battery and an ammunition column. On 18 March 1908, Berkshire Royal Horse Artillery (Territorial Force) was proposed as a new unit and it was recognized by the Army Council on 21 July 1908 (and the ammunition column on 11 August 1908). The unit consisted of:Litchfield, p. 21.Monthly Arm List August 1914.Berkshire Artillery at Regiments.org., retrieved 31 March 2018.RHA at Long, Long Trail. * Battery HQ at Yeomanry House, Castle Hill, Reading,Berkshire at Drill Hall Project. with a section at AscotBerkshire Drill Stations at Drill Hall Project. * 2nd South Midland Ammunition Column also at Reading The battery was equipped with four Ehrhardt 15-pounder guns and allocated as artillery support to the 2nd South Midland Mounted Brigade. World War I In accordance with the Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907 (7 Edw.7, c.9) which brought the Territorial Force into being, the TF was intended to be a home defence force for service during wartime and members could not be compelled to serve outside the country. However, on the outbreak of war on 4 August 1914, many members volunteered for Imperial Service. Therefore, TF units were split into 1st Line (liable for overseas service) and 2nd Line (home service for those unable or unwilling to serve overseas) units. 2nd Line units performed the home defence role, although in fact most of these were also posted abroad in due course. = 1/1st Berkshire= The 1st Line battery was embodied with the 2nd South Midland Mounted Brigade on 4 August 1914 at the outbreak of the First World War. Initially, the brigade concentrated in Berkshire and on 5 August 1914 was assigned to the 1st Mounted Division.Becke, Pt 2a, pp. 1‚Äì6. A decision was made to form a new mounted division from the mounted brigades in and around the Churn area of Berkshire. On 2 September 1914, 2nd Mounted Division, with Headquarters at Goring, came into being and 2nd South Midland Mounted Brigade was transferred to the new division. I Brigade and II Brigade, RHA (T.F.) were formed for the division and the battery was assigned to II Brigade, RHA at Churn, along with Nottinghamshire RHA and A Battery and B Battery, Honourable Artillery Company. In November 1914, the division moved to Norfolk on coastal defence duties. Artillery headquarters was established at Cromer, before joining the divisional headquarters at Hanworth in December, and Berkshire RHA was at Little Walsingham (2nd South Midland Mounted Brigade was at Fakenham). Overseas service QF 15 pounder of B Battery, Honourable Artillery Company at Sheik Othman, Aden. In March 1915, the division was put on warning for overseas service. In early April, the division starting leaving Avonmouth and the last elements landed at Alexandria before the end of the month. By the middle of May, the horse artillery batteries were near Isma√Ølia on Suez Canal Defences. On 14 July 1915, Berkshire RHA (along with B Battery, HAC and 28th Indian Brigade) left for Aden. They fought a sharp action at Sheikh Othman on 20 July that removed the Turkish threat to Aden for the rest of the war, before returning to Egypt. The 2nd Mounted Division was dismounted in August 1915 and served at Gallipoli. The artillery batteries and ammunition columns, signal troops, mobile veterinary sections, Mounted Brigade Transport and Supply Columns and two of the Field Ambulances were left behind in Egypt. The division returned from Gallipoli in December 1915 and was reformed and remounted. On 10 December 1915, Berkshire RHA briefly rejoined the division from Ismailia, Suez Canal Defences; on 17 January 1916 it was transferred with 2nd South Midland Mounted Brigade to the Western Frontier Force. Imperial Mounted Division The Imperial Mounted Division was formed in Egypt in January 1917; 2nd South Midland Mounted Brigade (by now numbered as 6th Mounted Brigade) was one of the four cavalry brigades selected to form the division. Berkshire RHA joined the division on formation and was assigned to XIX Brigade, Royal Horse Artillery (T.F.). In practice, the battery remained attached to its mounted brigade. The battery, and its brigade, served with the Imperial Mounted Division in the Sinai and Palestine Campaign as part of the Desert Column. With the division, it took part in the advance across the Sinai. The battery was re-equipped with four 18 pounders in time for the First Battle of Gaza (2627 March 1917). It also took part in the Second Battle of Gaza (1719 April 1917). In June 1917, the Desert Column was reorganised from two mounted divisions of four brigades each (ANZAC and Imperial Mounted Divisions) to three mounted divisions of three brigades each (ANZAC, AustralianImperial Mounted Division renamedand the new Yeomanry Mounted Division).Becke, Pt 2a, pp. 31‚Äì4. Consequently, the 6th Mounted Brigade, along with Berkshire RHA, was transferred from the Imperial to the Yeomanry Mounted Division on 27 June 1917. Yeomanry Mounted / 1st Mounted / 4th Cavalry Divisions Berkshire, RHA (by now re-equipped with four 13 pounders) joined the Yeomanry Mounted Division with 6th Mounted Brigade on 27 June 1917 and transferred to XX Brigade, Royal Horse Artillery (T.F.) when it joined the division on 5 July 1917. The battery remained with the division when it was restructured and indianized as the 1st Mounted Division (from 24 April 1918) and later renamed as 4th Cavalry Division (23 July 1918). During its time with the Yeomanry Mounted Division, the division served as part of the Egyptian Expeditionary Force in Palestine. From 31 October it took part in the Third Battle of Gaza, including the Battle of Beersheba (in GHQ Reserve) and the Capture of the Sheria Position under the Desert Mounted Corps (DMC). Still with the DMC, it took part in the Battle of Mughar Ridge on 13 and 14 November and the Battle of Nebi Samwil from 17 to 24 November. From 27 to 29 November, it withstood the Turkish counter-attacks during the Capture of Jerusalem. Once the division was restructured and renamed, it served with the DMC for the rest of the war, taking part in the Second Transjordan Raid (30 April to 4 May 1918) and the Final Offensive, in particular the Battle of Megiddo (19 to 25 September) and the Capture of Damascus (1 October). The 4th Cavalry Division remained in Palestine on occupation duties after the end of the war. However, demobilization began immediately and most of the British war time units had left by May 1919. The Berkshire battery were reduced to cadre in Egypt on 14 October 1919. = 2/1st Berkshire= Berkshire RHA formed a 2nd line in 1914, initially designated as the Berkshire (Reserve) Battery RHA and later given a fractional designation as 2/1st Berkshire Battery, RHA. The battery joined the 2nd line 2/2nd South Midland Mounted Brigade when it was formed in September 1914. On 6 March 1915, the 2/2nd Mounted Division was formed to replace 2nd Mounted Division which had been warned for overseas service. The brigade joined the division on East Coast Defences in March 1915 and concentrated at King's Lynn with the battery at North Runcton.Becke, Pt 2a, pp. 19‚Äì26 The batteries of the division were quite unready for war. Three had no horses, the fourth had just 23; three batteries had over 200 men on average, but the other just 91. The Berkshire battery was only issued with sights for its Ordnance BL 15 pounders in December 1915, but had no ammunition. On 17 January 1916 it received four slightly more modern Ordnance BLC 15-pounders, eight ammunition wagons and 210 rounds of ammunition per gun. The battery remained with the division when it was redesignated as 3rd Mounted Division in March 1916 and as 1st Mounted Division in July 1916. In September 1916, the battery was attached to the 7th Cyclist Brigade in 2nd Cyclist Division (former 4th Mounted Division) until the division was broken up on 16 November 1916.Becke, Pt 2a, pp. 27‚Äì30. The battery (along with 2/1st Shropshire RHA) joined CLVIII Brigade, RFA when it was reformed. The original CLVIII Brigade, RFA was formed for 35th Division in Accrington and Burnley from December 1914.Becke, Pt 3b, pp. 51‚Äì9. It was broken up in France between 8 January and 28 February 1917. The two RHA batteries provided the manpower for the Brigade Ammunition Column. The battery (personnel only) disembarked at Boulogne on 24 May 1917. It was equipped with 18 pounders and the brigade became an Army Field Brigade. On 6 July 1917, the battery was redesignated as C/CLVIII Battery and 2/1st Shropshire RHA became A/CLVIII Battery. At the Armistice, the battery (by now made up to six 18 pounders) was still with CLVIII Army Brigade, RFA serving as Army Troops with the Fifth Army. Interwar years When the TF was reconstituted on 7 February 1920 the Berkshire RHAt formed a battery (later numbered 264th (Berkshire) Battery) in 1st South Midland Brigade, RFA (later 66th (South Midland) Field Brigade, RA) and ceased to be a Royal Horse Artillery battery. In the late 1930s, particularly at the time of the Munich Crisis in September‚ÄìOctober 1938, the need for improved anti-aircraft (AA) defences became apparent, and a programme of converting existing TA units was pushed forward. On 1 October 1938, 264 Bty was separated from 66th Field Brigade, converted to the heavy anti-aircraft (HAA) role, and expanded into a full brigade as 80th (Berkshire) Anti-Aircraft Brigade, organised as follows:Frederick, pp. 756‚Äì8, 775.Monthly Army List May 1939. * Regimental Headquarters (RHQ) at Yeomanry House, Reading * 249 (Berkshire RHA) AA Battery at Reading * 250 (Reading) AA Battery at Reading, raised 1 October 1938 * 251 (Buckinghamshire) AA Battery at Slough, raised 1 November 1938 * 252 (City of Oxford) AA Battery at Oxford, raised 1 November 1938 (The remainder of 66th Field Brigade at Bristol became 76th (Gloucestershire) AA Brigade.) World War II=Mobilisation= The new regiment (RA brigades were redesignated as regiments from January 1939) formed part of 47 AA Brigade in 5th AA Division, which had the responsibility for defending Southampton.Routledge, Table LX, p. 378.AA Command 3 September 1939 at Patriot Files. In February 1939 the UK's AA defences came under the control of a new Anti-Aircraft Command. In June a partial mobilisation of the TA was begun in a process known as 'couverture', whereby each AA unit did a month's tour of duty in rotation to man selected AA and searchlight positions. On 24 August, ahead of the declaration of war, AA Command was fully mobilised at its war stations.Routledge, pp. 65‚Äì6, 371. The 'Phoney war' that followed was an opportunity for training and equipping the AA defences. In June 1940 the RA's AA regiments were designated Heavy AA (HAA) to distinguish them from the new Light AA (LAA) units being formed. =Battle of Britain= 3.7-inch HAA gun preserved at Imperial War Museum Duxford. After the British army's evacuation from Dunkirk, the South Coast ports such as Southampton and Portsmouth became prime targets for attacks by the German Luftwaffe in the so-called 'Channel Battles' that preceded the Battle of Britain.Collier, Chapter X.Routledge, Table LXII, p. 379. By now, the regiment had been transferred to 35 AA Bde defending Portsmouth.Walker, pp. 38‚Äì40. In July, the regiment was joined by RHQ and 12 HAA Bty of 6th HAA Rgt, which had got away from Dunkirk without its guns and equipment. 12 HAA Bty was split into four sections, with Battery HQ, A and C Sections under 252 HAA Bty at Brownwich, Fareham, B Section at Fort Southwick and D Section at Fort Nelson, both under 250 HAA Bty. The Dunkirk veterans who had lost their old 3-inch guns had the opportunity to become familiar with the modern 3.7-inch guns operated by 80th HAA Rgt, even though these had already been through the hands of several units and their gun stores were incomplete.Farndale, Years of Defeat, p. 98. Shortly after this, RHQ of 6 HAA Rgt was sent, with 250/80 HAA Bty under command, to Kent in a scheme codenamed 'Bovril' to defend roads leading away from the South Coast in case of invasion, and at the same time to reconnoitre and prepare AA gun sites for when guns became available. This was done at Ashford, Canterbury, Edenbridge, Sevenoaks, Tenterden and Tunbridge Wells. By the end of August, 6 HAA Rgt was commanding a group of batteries, including its own 12 HAA Bty and 251/80 HAA Bty, as a mobile force in Kent (for which 12/6 Bty had to borrow vehicles from 251/80).2 AA Bde War Diary, Home Forces 1940, The National Archives (TNA), Kew, file WO 166/2221.Collier, Chapter VIII. The Battle of Britain was now under way, and during late July and throughout August the batteries had fleeting engagements with small numbers of raiders along the South Coast. There were attacks on Southampton and Portsmouth ‚Äì a particularly bad raid on Portsmouth on 24 August ‚Äì and on Lee-on-Solent and Gosport airfields. During early September the pattern of fleeting targets ‚Äì but no 'kills' ‚Äì for all the batteries continued by day and night. Most of the 3-inch guns in the battle area had been replaced by 3.7s, together with the new Sperry Predictor No 2.Pile's despatch.Routledge, p. 49.Walker, pp. 40‚Äì9. Formation sign of 5 AA Division. After its heavy losses so far during the Battle of Britain, the Luftwaffe changed tactics and started bombing London. On 9 September, 12 HAA Bty left 80 HAA Rgt's command and went to strengthen the London Inner Artillery Zone (IAZ). As the raids against London worsened, RHQ of 6 HAA Rgt with two sections of 250/80 HAA Bty were brought from Kent on 14 September to take over more sites in the London IAZ. Large daylight raids against London on 15 September were intercepted by Royal Air Force (RAF) fighters, but there were few spare fighters to deal with the simultaneous attacks on the South Coast, of which the guns of 5 AA Division had to bear the brunt. Collier, Chapter XV.Farndale, Years of Defeat, p. 109.Routledge, pp. 385‚Äì6.Walker, pp. 49‚Äì59. =The Blitz= After the defeat of 15 September the Luftwaffe concentrated on night raids ‚Äì the London Blitz ‚Äì which went on night after night. However, there were also five major raids on Portsmouth and five more on Southampton during the winter of 1940‚Äì41.Farndale, Years of Defeat, p. 110.Routledge, p. 393.Walker, pp. 60‚Äì71.Collier, Chapter XVI.Collier, Appendix XXX. The regiment provided a cadre of experienced officers and other ranks as the basis for a new 412 HAA Bty formed on 16 January 1941 at 209th HAA Training Rgt, Blandford; this battery later joined 124th HAA Rgt In late February 1941, while the Blitz was still continuing, 249 HAA Bty was rostered for overseas service and transferred to the War Office Reserve,Order of Battle of the Field Force in the United Kingdom, Part 3: Royal Artillery, 26 December 1940, with amendments, TNA files WO 212/4 and WO 33/2365. followed a few weeks later by the rest of the regiment, though it temporarily remained part of AA Command.Order of Battle of the Field Force in the United Kingdom, Part 3: Royal Artillery (Non-Divisional Units), 25 March 1941, TNA file WO 212/5. = 249 (Berkshire RHA) HAA Bty = An advanced party of 249 (Berkshire RHA) HAA Bty arrived in Iceland in March 1941, followed by the main body with four 3.7-inch guns. It was there to reinforce the AA coverage for 'Alabaster Force', which had occupied the island since May 1940 to deny it to German forces. There was little action apart from occasional engagements of Junkers Ju 88 or Focke-Wulf Fw 200 Condor long-range reconnaissance aircraft. Later 12th HAA Rgt HQ arrived to take command of the independent HAA batteries on the island. In June 1941 the decision was taken to hand the occupation of Iceland over to the (still neutral) United States, and shortly afterwards all AA positions were handed over and the troops returned to the UK.Routledge, p. 211.Order of Battle of Iceland and Faroe Islands, 3 March 1941, with amendments, TNA WO 212/347. = 251 (Buckinghamshire) HAA Bty = RHQ of 80th HAA Rgt, together with 250 and 252 HAA Btys, left AA Command in July 1941, while 251 HAA Bty remained as an independent battery.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 12 May 1941, with amendments, TNA file WO 212/79. On 4 September the battery joined 131st (Mixed) HAA Rgt to convert to a 'Mixed' establishment in which two-thirds of the posts were filled by women of the Auxiliary Territorial Service (ATS). However, this was rescinded and 251 HAA Bty left again on 7 October to become part of the WO Reserve as an all-male battery.Frederick, p. 785. It left the UK in December 1941 for West Africa Command, where it stayed until 1944. Many men from this battery formed the cadres for units of the West African Artillery, and went with their units on active service to Burma.Order of Battle of the Field Force in the United Kingdom, Part 3: Royal Artillery (Non-Divisional units), 22 October 1941, TNA files WO 212/6 and WO 33/1883.Joslen, p. 490. =Mobile training= In between training for overseas service, AA units in the WO Reserve were regularly loaned back to AA Command. On 10 October 1941, 80th HAA Rgt with 250 and 252 HAA Btys joined the Humber Gun Defence Area under 39 AA Bde. The battery HQs were established at Scunthorpe on the south bank and Halsham on the north bank, and the sixteen 3.7-inch guns the batteries brought were emplaced in four-gun sites. The regiment left (with its guns) on 1 January 1942.39 AA Bde War Diary 1941, TNA file WO 166/2273.91st HAA Rgt War Diary 1942 and Operation Orders 1940‚Äì42, TNA file WO 166/7462.39 AA Bde War Diary 1942, TNA file WO 166/7396. During the summer of 1942 First Army began to assemble for Operation Torch, the Allied landings in North Africa. 80th HAA Regiment was assigned to 22 AA Bde in this army and was brought up to full war establishment when it was joined by the independent 194 HAA Bty (originally part of 60th (City of London) HAA Rgt which had seen action in the Battle of France and the Dunkirk evacuation) and by the ancillary units necessary for mobile warfare:Order of Battle of the Field Force in the United Kingdom, Part 3: Royal Artillery (Non- Divisional Units), 14 August 1942, TNA file WO 212/7.Order of Battle of the Field Force in the United Kingdom, Part 3: Royal Artillery (Non-Divisional Units), 22 November 1942, TNA file WO 212/8. * RHQ, 194, 250, 252 HAA Btys * 80 HAA Rgt Signal Section, Royal Corps of Signals * 80 HAA Workshop Section, Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers (HQ and 252 Section only) * 80 HAA Rgt Platoon, Royal Army Service Corps =Operation Torch= 3-inch AA guns on cruciform travelling carriages. The 'Torch' convoy assembled in the Clyde in October 1942 and set sail through the Straits of Gibraltar. 22 AA Brigade was the only AA formation trained in mobile operations and amphibious warfare, and was tasked with landing early in the operation to provide AA cover for the beaches, ports and airfields. The best-trained regiments were selected for the initial assault, with 80th HAA Rgt supplying one battery (194 HAA Bty) and 58th (Kent) HAA Rgt sending two; 250 HAA Battery was among the follow-up echelons. Advance AA parties landed with the assault troops on beaches outside Algiers on 8 November, to be followed later by their heavy equipment. The HAA batteries were equipped with the older 3-inch gun on a modernised trailer, rather than the newer 3.7-inch, because the lighter 3-inch was easier and quicker to deploy in the rough country anticipated for the campaign. After the initial fighting, in which 194 HAA Bty suffered a number of casualties, 22 AA Bde accompanied the leading elements of First Army on their long march eastwards towards Tunisia, although the whole AA deployment was hampered by congestion at Algiers docks and the fact that AA guns had been given low priority in loading the supply ships. The follow-up elements suffered casualties of men and equipment when their ships were attacked on the way to North Africa: 80th HAA Rgt lost 71 men when HM Transport J-43 was sunk by enemy action. A team from 80th HAA Rgt and the Royal Engineers spent a month unsuccessfully trying to recover 3-inch guns from sunken merchant ships in Bougie harbour.Joslen, p. 465.Playfair & Molony, Vol IV, pp. 130, 137‚Äì43.Routledge, pp. 176‚Äì80.80 HAA Rgt War Diary November 1942‚ÄìJune 1943, TNA file WO 175/392. On 9 November, RHQ under Lt-Col J.A.S. Crum, with regimental Signals and REME and the assault echelons of 252 HAA Bty, moved to Liverpool for embarkation on HM Transport P-29 (RMS Orion) to join a convoy that sailed from the Clyde on 14 November. Also on the Orion under the regiment's command were the rear echelons of 58th HAA Rgt: 264 HAA Bty and the REME workshops. The HAA units disembarked at Algiers on 22 November, where they remained in a transit camp while a party of drivers was sent forward aboard HMS Queen Emma to B√¥ne where the motor transport was unloaded from SS Inventor on 27 November. RHQ, with 252/80 and 264/58 Btys, followed them to B√¥ne on a two-day rail journey, arriving on 4 December, with 252 HAA Bty in action the same night against a heavy air raid. RHQ of 80th HAA Rgt was under 66 AA Bde, and had 207/58, 217/72 and 252/80 HAA Btys under its command, while 194 and 250 HAA Btys remained detached under V Corps.Routledge, Table XXX, p. 188. During December, there were air raids over B√¥ne on most nights and frequent daylight raids by fighter-bombers, the harbour and airfield being primary targets. On 6 January 1943, the regiment went forward to Souk-el-Khemis Airfield to join 22 AA Bde, leaving behind its signals and REME, together with 207 and 217 HAA Btys. 250 HAA Bty was already at Souk-el-Khemis, but in early February it moved forward again to Testour, where it was later joined by the regiment's advanced HQ, camouflaged in an olive grove. On 11 February, the regiment finally had 194 and 250 HAA Btys under its command, operating under 78th Division, though 252 HAA Bty had now moved up from B√¥ne and was detached with 46th Division throughout March.Routledge, pp. 180-2; Table XXXI, p. 189. The regiment was stationed close behind the Allied front line, and 250 HAA Battery's gun-laying radar was the first set sited in the forward areas. On 14 February Testour was attacked by Junkers Ju 87 Stukas, one of which targeted a gunsite of 250 HAA Bty and killed one man. The following day, 194 HAA Bty came under enemy shellfire. When guns of 250 HAA Bty were moved up to support 1 (Guards) Bde on 17 February, they were tasked with anti-tank (A/Tk) as well as AA defence until specialist A/Tk units arrived. This was repeated when German tanks were reported in the vicinity after the Battle of Kasserine Pass, and soon the regiment was running courses in A/Tk gunnery.Routledge, pp. 183-4. 22 AA Brigade reorganised its commitments during April: 194 HAA Bty came under the command of 1st Armoured Division at Souk-el-Arba Airfield, 250 HAA Bty went back to Souk-el-Khemis airfield to support No. 242 Group RAF under the command of 71st (Forth) HAA Rgt, and 252 HAA Bty was under 78th Division, thus leaving RHQ (which moved to Medjez el Bab) with no batteries under its command. There was still considerable Luftwaffe activity, and the batteries scored a number of 'kills'. On 1 May 194 and 252 HAA Btys returned to regimental command, in support of 7th and 6th Armoured Divisions respectively. These formations were involved in Operation Vulcan, the final advance on Tunis, and while liaising with them on 6 May Lt-Col Crum and one of his officers were captured by German troops. They were released when Tunis fell the following day; Lt-Col Crum had been wounded, but soon returned to duty. 80th HAA Regiment claimed 11 'kills' during the Tunisian Campaign.Routledge, pp. 184-7. =Operation Husky= Even before the final surrender of Axis forces in Tunisia, 80th HAA Rgt was withdrawn via Souk-el-Khemis to Bougie, arriving on 16 May. It immediately began training with 62 AA Bde for the forthcoming Allied invasion of Sicily (Operation Husky).Routledge, Table XXXII, p. 190. For the landings on Sicily, eight composite beach groups were formed to defend the landing points as soon as possible after Zero Hour. 194 HAA Battery was assigned to 20 Beach Group and RHQ and 252 HAA Bty to 21 Beach Group. While they were training, 250 HAA Bty was deployed to defend the area, with one Troop at Djidjelli airfield.Molony, Vol V, p. 58. The availability of Landing Ships, Tank (LSTs) made it feasible to land suitably waterproofed 3.7-inch guns and GL radar sets in the first wave of the attack. The HAA Troops were equipped with a new GL radar system, the No 3 Mark III, or 'Baby Maggie'. Devised by 62 AA Bde, this had its transmitter, receiver, aerial array and operating display all carried in a two-wheeled trailer towed by a 3-ton truck. 80th HAA Regiment's 'Maggies' were late arriving for embarkation, which was rushed.Routledge, pp. 101‚Äì2, 259. The assault landings began at 02.45 on 10 July 1943. As in 'Torch', the advance parties of the AA units attached to the beach groups landed from Landing Craft Infantry (LCIs) as infantry prepared for a firefight, but there was only light opposition and they were soon able to move to the sites selected for gun positions when the LCTs arrived about 4 hours later. Unfortunately, 194 HAA Bty lost its guns in a shipboard fire on the way to the beaches. However, it joined in the AA defence of Pachino airfield, which had been captured without difficulty and was being repaired for RAF use despite frequent day and night raids. 252 HAA Battery joined in the defence of XXX Corps' beaches, although the 'Baby Maggies' had failed to stand up to the rough handling of the landings. More importantly, radio communications with the AA HQ ship broke down for the first 48 hours after landing, and defensive fire was reduced to crude 'barrage' methods.Routledge, pp. 258‚Äì63.Routledge, Table XLII, p. 267. After the landings, Eighth Army made rapid progress up the east coast of Sicily and the follow-up AA forces began to land. 62 AA Brigade HQ arrived in Syracuse on 17 July, bringing the rest of 80th HAA Rgt, and took responsibility for Pachino and Cassibile Airfields. =Operation Avalanche= The Allied campaign continued with the invasion of mainland Italy, first across the Strait of Messina (Operation Baytown) on 3 September, where 80th HAA Rgt (194 and 250 HAA Btys) provided AA cover from Messina, followed on 9 September by landings at Salerno (Operation Avalanche). For 'Avalanche', 252 HAA Bty was in No 4 Beach Group under 12 AA Bde. This time there was no surprise, and the LSTs and LCIs came under air attack and then heavy artillery fire as they approached the beaches. However, casualties among the AA troops were light and all the breach groups landed successfully: the first HAA guns were in action 4‚Äì6 hours after landings began. Opposition remained strong, and reinforcements poured into a tightly constricted beachhead while heavy fighting continued nearby. Although early warning and communications again proved a problem, the HAA sites were able to use their GL radar to fire concentrations against raiders. On 17 September the advance from the beachhead towards Naples began: so eager were the AA units that Brigadier Mortimer Wheeler of 12 AA Bde proposed using a column of AA troops to break out towards Pompeii, though the scheme was vetoed by X Corps.Routledge, pp. 270‚Äì4. Once Naples had been captured, 12 AA Bde's units were brought in by road and landing craft and defended the port from 1 October until relieved three weeks later, during which time it faced one serious air raid. It then moved up to rejoin X Corps against the Volturno Line. The rest of 80th HAA Rgt remained on Sicily for the rest of the year, first at Messina and later at Catania airfield, under the command of 73 AA Bde. It joined 12 AA Bde in January 1944, by which time its former CO, James Crum, had been promoted to command 8 AA Bde.Routledge, pp. 274, 279, 289; Table XLIII, p. 268.Routledge, Table XLVII, p. 296. 3.7-inch HAA gun in action in the field artillery role in Italy, December 1943. In January 1944, 12 AA Bde was sent forward to cover the preparations for X Corps' crossing f the Garigliano, protecting assembly areas and ferry sites as well as routes and airfields. By April, 80th HAA Rgt had transferred back to 62 AA Bde, which was engaged in airfield defence for Fifth US Army. Once Fifth Army had captured Rome in June 1944 12 AA Bde deployed its units to defend the bridges over the Tiber and the port of Piombino. Then when relieved it was able to follow close behind Fifth Army. Although the Luftwaffe's losses meant the air threat was lowered, HAA batteries of 62 AA Bde also employed their versatile long-range 3.7-inch guns in a medium artillery role against ground targets. This included counter-battery (CB), defensive fire (DF) and harassing fire (HF) shoots, but also air-burst shoots against entrenched positions, and destruction of hard targets such as buildings.Routledge, pp. 283‚Äì5. Once Fifth Army had crossed the Arno, it faced the Serchio and the defences of the Gothic Line. On 26 December the German forces put in a major counterattack, Unternehmen Wintergewitter (Operation Winter Storm), between Lucca and Pistoia aimed at retaking the port of Livorno (Leghorn). 62 AA Brigade was well to the front in the resulting Battle of Garfagnana, with LAA regiments acting as infantry and anti-tank gunners, while the HAA regiments acted as divisional medium artillery. 80th HAA Regiment answered 166 calls for fire with 5011 rounds fired. Having beaten off the attack, IV US Corps advanced into the mountains accompanied by 80th HAA Rgt, with 194 HAA Bty deploying in icebound conditions at . There was little activity by the Luftwaffe, so the ample stocks of 3.7-inch AA ammunition were used to help IV US Corps take the well-fortified mountain strongpoints. However, the Allied forces in Italy were suffering an acute manpower shortage, and surplus AA units were being disbanded in increasing numbers.

Postwar When the TA was reconstituted on 1 January 1947, the regiment reformed at Reading as 480th (Berkshire) Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment in 73 AA Bde (the wartime 47 AA Bde, based in Reading). AA Command was disbanded on 10 March 1955 and there were wholesale amalgamations amongst its units. 480th HAA Regiment merged with 536th (Surrey) Light Anti-Aircraft/Searchlight Rgt and 645th (Buckinghamshire) LAA Rgt (formerly the 1st Buckinghamshire (TA) Battalion of the Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry) to form P (Berkshire and Oxfordshire) Battery in a new 431st Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, with HQ remaining at Reading.Frederick, pp. 1012, 1017, 1021, 1028.474‚Äì519 Rgts RA at British Army 1945 on.67‚Äì106 AA Bdes at British Army 1945 on.520‚Äì563 Rgts RA at British Army 1945 on.414‚Äì443 Rgts RA at British Army 1945 on.Litchfield, pp. 26, 227, Appendix 5.Watson, TA 1947. Another round of mergers in 1961 saw 431st LAA Rgt absorbed by 299th (Royal Buckinghamshire Yeomanry, Queen's Own Oxfordshire Hussars and Berkshire) Field Regiment, in which R (Berkshire) Battery continued the Berkshire RHA lineage. This lasted until 1967 when the TA was converted into the Territorial and Army Volunteer Reserve and the unit at Reading became B (Berkshire Artillery) Company in the Royal Berkshire Territorials. However, this regiment was reduced to a cadre in 1969, and the Berkshire RHA lineage ended.Frederick, p. 1003.289‚Äì322 Rgts RA at British Army 1945 on.Litchfield, p. 24. Honorary Colonel Col A.T.

It is the seat of the Diocese of Maine. History Cathedral interior St. Luke's Church was begun in 1851 by the Rt. Rev. Horatio Southgate, a Portland native who had served as the Episcopal Missionary Bishop to Constantinople. Its first church building was built on Congress Street near Longfellow Square in the city's West End. By 1866 St. Luke's had grown to be the largest parish in the state and it was chosen to be the cathedral church for the diocese. The cornerstone for the cathedral church was laid on August 15 the following year. The Gothic Revival style structure was designed by New York architect Charles Coolidge Haight. The first services were held on Christmas Day in 1868. The old church building was sold to St. Stephen‚Äôs parish. The cathedral was consecrated on October 18, 1877 after the mortgages had been retired. Two year later the cathedral was incorporated by an act of the Maine legislature. Over the years several additions have been made to the cathedral church. The Augustus R. Wright Memorial Rose Window is installed in 1898. From 1904 to 1905 the Emmanuel Chapel and the cenotaph of Bishop Neely were built. The chapel was designed by Stephen Russell Hurd Codman. The Incarnation Reredos, high altar, silver cross and candlesticks were added in 1925. In 1928 the Skinner pipe organ was built. The deWolfe Belfry, which provided a new entrance for the cathedral, was built in 1957. It was designed by the architectural firm of Cram & Ferguson. The parish house was extensively damaged in a fire in 1985. Repairs were completed two years later. A new free standing altar table was installed in 1990. In 2003 a $1.2 million renovation project was completed.

It has been designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest since January 1968 in an attempt to protect its fragile biological elements, mainly a swamp. The site has an area of 16.37 hectares and is managed by Natural Resources Wales. Description Llyn Bodgylched has been designated as a SSSI for its biological interest. The lake is partially impounded by an embankment along its western shoreline and a dam at its southern end. The lake is set in a shallow basin in Precambrian rock of the Mona complex which has been overlain by boulder clay and there are alluvial deposits along the western shore. Flora and fauna The lake is dominated by tall fen vegetation, especially common reed, although in some areas bottle sedge bogbean, Yellow flag iris and greater pond sedge are locally dominant and there are patches of common club-rush, reed canary-grass, reedmace and greater tussock-sedge. Species which are uncommon on the isdland or in northern Wales include Lesser water-plantain, greater spearwort and lesser tussock-sedge occur locally within the fen. The parts of the site which are dominated by purple moor-grass host a diverse flora including petty whin and large populations of saw-wort. Where lime-rich springs emerge, blunt- flowered rush is common and grass of Parnassus and marsh helleborine are found alongside it. It is one of only three sites on Anglesey where the short-spiked bladder sedge had been recorded according to Hugh Davies 1813 book in the island's botany, however, this species has since been shown to be more widespread. The breeding bird community is of particular importance including such species as mute swan, tufted duck, shoveler, teal, water rail and reed warbler which regularly breed. Over wintering wildfowl occur in small numbers and this site is locally important for shoveler. A small flock of the nominate European subspecies of the greater white-fronted goose is of interest, occurring here well away from the major wintering distribution in southern Britain. The swamp has a roost of common starling while whooper swan and goosander also winter here and rarer visitors have included Cetti's warbler and bittern.

The company's Software-as-a-Service platform provides organizations with a streamlined process to manage contract workflow and execution. It offers a paperless online digital signature solution to access, verify, sign, and certify documents from anywhere in the world. History Signority has its headquarters in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. It was incorporated as a federal and a provincial (Ontario) corporation on November 19, 2010 by two Canadian entrepreneurs: Jane He and Qingbo Jin. At inception, the company name was EPEink (Electronic Pen/Paper Electronic Ink) and the product name was GreenSignatures. In January 2013, the company and the product were re-branded to Signority. Patents and product Besides ease of use, Signority places great emphasis on its intellectual property investment. Two applications have been filed to United States Patent and Trademark Office: #A patent application is a break through in the incorporation complicated digital signature technology, or PKI Public Key Infrastructure into a SaaS offering. PKI is highly secure, and is recognized by global legislative bodies. Conversely, the legal weight of electronic signatures is a matter for debate in many regions outside of North America, and within specific sectors within North America, such as banks and medical institutions. PKI has been around for years, but is very complicated and expensive to operate. It usually requires on-premises software (can be combined with hardware devices) that must be installed at both servers and the clients that utilize PKI. PKI ensures document signing nonrepudiation and document integrity within an organization, but it is not practical when recipients are outside the organization, such as when recipients are external to the organization hosting the PKI servers. Signority invented a method to bring PKI into its SaaS offering, by never generating and storing private keys on its servers. The private key is generated on the fly at the user end each time. The method was invented by University of Ottawa Professors Carlisle Adams, who previously designed CAST algorithm, and Guy- Vincent Jourdan. #A patent application for two signing methods: Real-Time Sign, which incorporates electronic evidence (audio and video) during the signing process to meet global legislation, and Open Sign: a time saver for document administrators that enables large volume public recipients signing template-based forms. The inventors are founders Jane He and Qingbo Jin. Signority is completely web-based and supports multiple mainstream browsers including Firefox, Chrome and IE8+. There is no need for software installation and specialized hardware. It also offers 3rd party integration through API for enterprise customers.

They are characterized by their childlike behavior and unique language, which is almost intelligible at times. They are also the official mascots of Illumination, a division of Universal Pictures, which produces the films. Following Comcast's purchase of NBCUniversal, they have been described as being a corporate icon for Universal and Comcast, on par with Disney's Mickey Mouse and WarnerMedia's Bugs Bunny, although Woody Woodpecker is still considered a mascot for Universal Studios. Kevin, Stuart, and Bob are three of the most familiar minions, who appear as stars in the film Minions. Many other Minions are mentioned by name in the films and other media in the franchise. They also made a cameo appearance in the series finale of Series 15 of Ant & Dec's Saturday Night Takeaway. Characteristics The Minions are small, yellow henchmen shaped like pill capsules. They are depicted as being roughly one-third to one-half the height of humans but they were later revealed to be 3 foot and 7 inches height tall. They have one or two eyes, and their irises are almost always brown (except for Bob, who has one green and one brown eye). There appears to be no other difference between the two types beyond the number of eyes. They have no discernable noses but seem capable of smelling, as they are shown smelling fruit and are affected by the Fart Gun. They are also shown without ears but can hear and respond to sounds. Most minions appear either bald or with a few wispy strands of black hair on their heads. Since their coming to America in the late 1960s, their clothing consists of blue overalls emblazoned with Gru's logo, black rubber gloves, shoes, and goggles. They mostly speak incomprehensible gibberish, which is partly derived from other languages, including French, English, Japanese, Korean, Italian, Spanish, and German. Although seemingly nonsensical, the English-sounding dialogue is dubbed differently for every country, in order to make the sounds somewhat recognizable. They have common English-language names, such as Dave (one of the first known minions in the franchise), Kevin, Stuart, Bob (the lead trio in Minions), and Mel (the leader of the Minions in Despicable Me 3). While showed as somewhat absent-minded and have very mischievous streaks, they are shown to have exceptional engineering abilities, being able to design and construct spaceships and playthings for Gru's adopted daughters, particularly the youngest Agnes. Minions, the 2015 animated feature film, shows that they have existed since the beginning of life on Earth. Minions are biologically wired to seek out and serve the most terrible of villains; when they have no \\"boss\\" to serve they become depressed and listless. They are also shown to have a degree of invulnerability, as Kevin, Stuart and Bob are shown to survive a European torture chamber without any injuries, even playing with the torture devices. In the 2010 short film \\"Banana\\", the Minions are revealed to have an almost uncontrollable craving for fruit, especially bananas. Derivatives Tires recycled as minion garden art in Brodalen, Sweden Since the release of the Despicable Me films, the Minions' popularity has been rising. The Minions have been regularly featured in cross-promotions for other Comcast/NBCUniversal properties, including Universal theme parks, NBC primetime TV series and an Xfinity remote control. \\"Minion versions\\" of the Simpson family appear at the end of The Simpsons episode \\"Treehouse of Horror XXV\\", which aired on October 19, 2014. In 2015, the village of Minions, Cornwall in the United Kingdom built a road sign paid for by Universal Studios featuring Minions. In October of that year, they removed it due to safety concerns that resulted from people stopping their cars to take photos although villagers have campaigned to get the sign put back up in another location. On April Fool's Day 2016, Google created a button on its Gmail service that sent a \\"mic drop\\" along with a GIF image of a Minion. However, the feature received backlash in which many people complained about accidentally sending the image during job searches which resulted in some people being dropped from job consideration or being fired. Google removed the feature not long after, citing those reasons as well as a bug that caused the image to be sent after hitting the regular send button. The Minions appeared in an advertisement for the Cinemark theater chain, in which several Minions try to change a lamp while another Minion mocks them. The mocking Minion drops the replacement lamp during one of his laughing fits so the others stick him in the socket so that his eye can serve as the lamp. The ad promoted the chain's claim that they had the brightest 3D projection system of any theater chain. At first, the clip played before showings of Despicable Me 2, but Cinemark uses the ad freely before any 3D movie. Three statues of Minions appear in the 2018 film Mortal Engines, in which they are assumed to be ancient idols of Old Gods. In Brazil, Minions were used as a reference to nickname the followers of politician Jair Bolsonaro, called by supporters of the left, in an ironic and offensive tone, \\"bolsominions\\". In an April 2016 \\"Extra\\" website article, journalist Felipe Pena compared Bolsonaro fans to Minions, saying that \\"they follow the leader, whom they call myth, and vent narcissistic repression by attacking the differences of groups they elect as rivals.\\" Since then, the term has been widely used by the population in Brazilian and international media, appearing in BBC, The Guardian, and Open Democracy articles.

The title of Lord Dunsinane was taken from Dunsinane Hill, a ruined fort near Collace, Perthshire, the family seat of the Nairne family. Dunsinane Hill is referenced in Shakespeare's play, Macbeth. The alternative Gaelic spelling of the term Dunsinane is Dunsinnan, meaning \\"The hill of ants\\"; likely a reference to the large number of people it took to build the fortress.  Early life  William Nairne was born in Perthshire, Scotland in about 1731.Wikisource:Nairne, William (DNB00) He was the son of Sir William Nairne, 2nd Baronet and his wife, Emilia Graham of Fintry, Forfarshire. The Nairne baronetcy was conferred on Nairne's grandfather by Queen Anne on 31 March 1704.  Legal career  As the younger son of the 2nd Baronet, and under the presumption that ascending to the baronetcy was unlikely, Nairne pursued a career in law. He was admitted as an advocate on 11 March 1755, and in 1758 was appointed joint Commissary Clerk of Edinburgh with Alexander Nairne, a distant relative. He was made Sheriff of Perthshire in 1783. After thirty years as an advocate, Nairne was elevated to a Lord of Session, a position he held from 1786 to 1809. He also was appointed a Commissioner of Justiciary, a position he held from 1792 to 1808. Nairne's ‚ÄòDisputatio Juridica ad tit. 4 Lib. xx. Pand. Qui potiores in pignore vel hypotheca habeantur‚Äô was published in 1755. He also assisted in the collection of the ‚ÄòDecisions of the Court of Session from the end of the year 1756 to the end of the year 1760‚Äô, in 1765. A portrait of Lord Dunsinane, painted by Scottish painter Sir Henry Raeburn (1756-1823), hangs in Parliament Hall, Edinburgh.  Connection to Katherine Ogilvie  Nairne was the uncle of Katherine \\"Kitty\\" Ogilvie, n√©e Nairne. Katherine became a sensation throughout Scotland in 1765 when she and Lieut. Patrick Ogilvie, her brother-in-law and alleged lover, were convicted of incest and of the poisoning of Katherine's much older husband, Thomas Ogilvie of Eastmiln, Forfarshire. The case was salacious even by today's standards, with the main accusers being another Ogilvie brother, Alexander, and his recent bride, Anne Clark. Anne, prior to her marriage was employed as a house-servant in one of Edinburgh's notorious lewd houses, and Alexander may have harbored a desire to succeed to the estate of Thomas Ogilvie over his brother Patrick. Both Katherine and Patrick were found guilty of their crimes. Patrick Ogilvie was hung in the Grassmarket of Edinburgh. Katherine, owing to pregnancy, was given a stay of execution sufficient to allow her to deliver her child. After delivering the child, and still being attended to daily by a midwife, Katherine slipped out of her prison cell clad in the midwife's clothes, including a head wrap the midwife had been wearing to help alleviate the pain of a toothache. Katherine purportedly left Edinburgh bound for Dover in a carriage driven by her uncle's clerk, James Bremmer. Once at Dover she obtained passage to France. A civil reward was offered for Katherine Nairne's capture, but to no avail. Accounts vary as to the final outcome for Katherine, including the fate of her child. One scenario has Katherine entering a convent, a second marrying a Dutch man and having a large family, and yet another has her dying in England at the beginning of the 19th century. Also unknown is whether Lord Dunsinane definitively aided in Katherine's escape. If he did, it would appear his involvement had no effect on his law career.  Personal life  Nairne succeeded to the baronetcy upon the death of his nephew William Nairne, the fourth baronet, in January 1790. Also around this time, Nairne purchased Dunsinane House at Collace, Perthshire for ¬£16,000. Nairne was not a rich man; and in order to pay for its purchase, he had to adopt the most rigid economy. To save the expense of entertaining visitors, he is said to have kept only one bed at Dunsinane, and upon one occasion, after trying every option to get rid of his friend George Dempster, he exclaimed in despair, \\"George, if you stay, you will go to bed at ten and rise at three, and then I shall get the bed after you.\\" Nairne was also a friend of James Boswell, the lawyer, diarist, and author, who is best known for the biography of the English literary figure Samuel Johnson. Nairne accompanied Boswell and Dr. Johnson on the first leg of their famous Scottish Highlands tour in 1773. In 1783 he was a joint founder of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. He served as the Society's Vice President from 1789 to 1796. Sir Walter Scott described Nairne as \\"a man of unscrupulous integrity.\\" When Nairne, who at the time was serving as Sheriff of Perthshire, determined that he had incorrectly found an innocent man guilty of a crime, he privately provided the litigant with the necessary funds to bring the case forward to the Court of Session, where his earlier judgement was reversed. Nairne's dwelling in Edinburgh was Minto House on Chambers Street. After his death the property was subdivided as rental property, and eventually demolished in the 1870s. A new structure, also named Minto House was built on the site in 1878, and in 1927 it was acquired by University of Edinburgh for use at the headquarters for the Department of English and Modern Languages. Sir William Nairne died at Dunsinane House on 23 March 1811 and was buried in the Nairne Mausoleum at the former parish church at Collace. A lifelong bachelor, the Nairne baronetcy became extinct upon his death. The heir to his estate was James Mellis, the son of Nairne's sister, who later assumed the surname of Nairne.

He noted the \\"shocking amount of refurb the group did... most everywhere you look there's something happening sonically that's not happened on a Crystal Stilts record before,\\" after earlier declaring that, \\"Crystal Stilts have staked out a place as perhaps the foremost purveyors of dark psychedelic pop their generation has to offer.\\"https://www.allmusic.com/album/nature-noir-mw0002563715 Impact called it, \\"their most complete effort yet; a stunning combination of 60s psychedelia, 80s post-punk and timeless noise- pop,\\"http://www.impactnottingham.com/2013/09/album-review-crystal-stilts- nature-noir while Doug Mosurock, after pronouncing them \\"the coolest '60s throwback NYC's known in some time,\\" summed up Nature Noir as \\"Truly beautiful stuff from a group that only improves with each move.\\" Even Dean Wareham of Luna and Galaxie 500 fame said after hearing Nature Noir, \\"I‚Äôve loved Crystal Stilts from their first EP and they only get better... at this point they sound only like Crystal Stilts ‚Äî and are themselves objects of imitation by bands from across the pond.\\"https://slyvinyl.com/genres/psychedelic/crystal- stilts-nature-noir-limited-to-200-deluxe-lps The Fly ranked Nature Noir as the No. 44 album of 2013.http://www.albumoftheyear.org/list/257-the-flys- top-50-albums-of-2013/ Track listing # \\"Spirit in Front of Me\\" ‚Äì 4:13 # \\"Star Crawl\\" ‚Äì 3:46 # \\"Future Folklore\\" ‚Äì 2:34 # \\"Sticks & Stones\\" ‚Äì 2:35 # \\"Memory Room\\" ‚Äì 3:37 # \\"Worlds Gone Weird\\" ‚Äì 2:49 # \\"Darken the Door\\" ‚Äì 3:51 # \\"Electrons Rising\\" ‚Äì 3:03 # \\"Nature Noir\\" ‚Äì 2:48 # \\"Phases Forever\\" ‚Äì 4:18 Personnel *Brad Hargett ‚Äì vocals *JB Townsend ‚Äì guitar , producer *Kyle Forester ‚Äì keyboards *Andy Adler ‚Äì bass guitar *Keegan Cooke ‚Äì drums * Al Carlson, Davey Jewell, Josh Bonati ‚Äì recording, mastering, mixing * New Day ‚Äì cover art References Category:2013 albums Category:Crystal Stilts albums Category:Sacred Bones Records albums ","title":"Nature Noir"},{"id":"41540817","text":"Jimmy Ashall (born 13 December 1933) is an English former footballer who played in the Football League for Leeds United.

The 2020 championship is known as the Motorsport UK British Rallycross Championship 5 Nations Trophy. The championship is recognised as an official Championship by Motorsport UK which is the governing body of Motorsport in Great Britain. The current format consists of the Motorsport UK Supercars (600Hp+ Vehicles with 4WD based upon hatchbacks), The Supernational and 1600 class, the BMW Mini Class, the Retro Rallycross, the Swift Sport, Swift Junior championship and RX150s. History The first Rallycross event was organised at Lydden circuit, near Canterbury in Kent, on Saturday 4 February 1967. Originally intended as a one off conceived by Robert Reed, a producer on ABC TV's World of Sport programme and organised for the broadcaster by the Tunbridge Wells centre of the 750 Motor Club under the leadership of Bud Smith, the event was such a huge success that more TV specials soon followed. And it wasn't long before 'clubmans' events were being run for autocross, race and rally drivers who'd become captivated by the new sport. The first event was won by Vic Elford ‚Äì already a successful rally driver and someone who would go on to drive in F1 and have great success as a sports car racer ‚Äì driving a Porsche 911 owned by AFN, at that time the official Porsche importer for Great Britain. It is claimed that the foot and mouth outbreak of 1967, which caused the cancellation of that year's RAC Rally, gave rise to Rallycross. However, Rallycross had been born in February 1967 and the November foot and mouth disease actually prevented some drivers attending the first Rallycross event to be staged at Croft, near Darlington in County Durham, on 30 December 1967. There is a link to the abandoned RAC British Rally of 1967. A televised Rallycross had been organised to take place following the rally. However, following its cancellation, most of the foreign drivers and teams left Britain and the Rallycross lost many of its expected star entries. The event still took place and was won by Rootes Group driver Andrew Cowan. With the bit firmly between its teeth, ITV ran a championship season through the winter of 1967‚Äì68, the winner of which, and the first man ever to win a Rallycross championship was Welshman Tony Chappell. ITV's monopoly on the sport, its man Reed had thought up, was lost in August 1968 when the BBC struck a deal with Lydden owner Bill Chesson giving them virtually exclusive access to events at the Kentish track. ITV moved North, basing itself at Croft and later added events at Cadwell Park, near Louth in Lincolnshire. The television companies first fought over Rallycross then ignored it. ITV was gone by the middle '70s and BBC's coverage had declined to one or two events a year by the time it dropped the British round of the European Rallycross Championship from its roster a decade later. The British Rallycross Grand Prix was the last event to be shown by the national broadcaster but that too ended after the 1994 event ‚Äì the last to be run at Brands Hatch and in the event's traditional winter slot. Rallycross spread to Europe within a couple of years of its creation and in 1973 the 'Embassy European Trophy' was won by Scotsman John Taylor in an Escort RS1600. The first officially sanctioned European Rallycross Championship followed in 1976 ‚Äì won by Austria's Franz Wurz in a Lancia Stratos ‚Äì the same year that Britain got its official British Rallycross Championship, won by Trevor Hopkins in an Escort RS1800.

Description Milecastle 70 is thought to lie between the villages of Kirkandrews-on-Eden and Beaumont to the north of Cowen Bank by the River Eden. The precise location of the milecastle has not yet been found. The measured position is 300 metres north of Braelees towards Monkhill Beck. A geophysical survey in 2000 failed to locate it, and it may have been substantially or completely robbed of stone. The line of Hadrian's Wall is said to have been confirmed in an excavation close to the site of the milecastle. To the south, at Braelees (), many squared dressed stones are said to have been dug out of the garden by the gardener and used for a rockery. To the north, two fragments of what are thought to be the Wall ditch are visible either side of Monkhill Beck (), where it survives to a depth of 2 metres, having been used over time as a farm track. To the southwest, a short section of the Vallum ditch, 110 metres in length ( to ), is visible as a slight earthwork on air photographs. In the early 19th century, part of a Roman cohort stone (RIB 2035) was found in the River Eden, and was placed in a wall at Beaumont (). It commemorates the work of the fifth cohort of the Twentieth Legion. In 1934 a Roman altar was found in the footings of an old cottage being demolished at Beaumont (). The altar was dedicated to Jupiter and the presiding genius of the numerus of Aurelian Moors, Valerianus' and Gallienus' Own. In 1935, a Roman coin was found by a gardener at Braelees ().  Associated Turrets  Each milecastle on Hadrian's Wall had two associated turret structures. These turrets were positioned approximately one-third and two-thirds of a Roman mile to the west of the Milecastle, and would probably have been manned by part of the milecastle's garrison. The turrets associated with Milecastle 70 are known as Turret 70A () and Turret 70B (). None of the turrets between Milecastles 59 and 72 were sought or identified prior to 1961, and the exact locations of turrets 70A and 70B are uncertain. There is no surface trace of Turret 70A. It is believed that Turret 70A is located at a point where Hadrian's Wall changed alignment, and the site is below the motte of the medieval Beaumont motte castle, in the village of Beaumont. Limited excavation in the churchyard extension to the west of the motte in 1928 found evidence of the buried remains of Hadrian's Wall. Turret 70B is expected to be located about 540 metres west of St Mary's Church to the south of Milldikes Lane. In 1858 Henry Maclauchlan noted a \\"green spot\\" near a pond at near this location, and the green spot was still said to be visible in 1961.

King was born in Riga, Russia (now in Latvia), his father, Robert King, was a partner in the Baltic firm of Balfour & Co., of Riga. George received his education and mercantile training in London and in Europe. King emigrated to Australia in July 1839, and settled in Sydney, where he was a director of the Australian Trust Company, of the Commercial Banking Company, and of the London Chartered Bank. He was for fifteen years chairman of the Australian Mutual Provident Society, for some time a member of the Board of Advice of the Australian Agricultural Company, and has acted as a director of the Clarence and Richmond River Steam Navigation Company, and Chairman of the Melbourne Marine Insurance Company. King was elected a member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly for East Sydney on 3 December 1869, and sat until 3 February 1872. King visited England in 1874, but returned and settled permanently in Queensland in the following year, being created a Knight of the Crown of Italy on his retirement from the Sydney consulship for Italy. In 1880 Mr. King accepted the Executive Commissionership for Queensland at the Melbourne International Exhibition, and represented the colony on the steel rails inquiry held in London in 1881. King was nominated to the Queensland Legislative Council on 26 January 1882, a position he held until resigning on 19 March 1890.

It had an estimated magnitude of 6.5 . The earthquake had an estimated hypocentral depth of 30 km. Damage and casualties The Province of Salta is an area of high seismic activity. The last major earthquake to have affected the area prior to the October 1844 event was in 1692. The destructive force of the 1844 Salta earthquake was measured at VII on the Mercalli intensity scale. It impacted several villages in the Province of Salta as well as the capital city. It caused damage and several families were affected but there was no reported loss of life. The earthquake caused damage not only in Salta, but also in Jujuy, Tucum√°n and Santiago del Estero. Several aftershocks were felt after the initial tremor. Cracks opened in the ground creating new channels through which water flowed even up to 26 October. The final aftershock was felt on the 27th. Aftermath On feeling the tremors the villagers rushed to the main square and then towards the Cathedral where they removed the statues of Christ and the Virgen del Milagro to the plaza. There they prostrated before the images and prayed. Although the Fiesta del Milagro has its origins in the 1692 Salta earthquake, in which the images of Christ and the Virgen del Milagro were said to have saved the city from the earthquakes, it was not until 1845, a year the following the 1844 earthquake, that ecclesiastical authorities along with the Government of the Province, signed the so-called Pact of Allegiance (Pacta de Fidelidad). In this pact the village agreed to officiate the acts of the Fiesta de Milagro (Feast of the Miracle), with novena and processions every September 15. The primitive \\"Fiestas del Milagro\\" in Salta were filled with celebration and excess. But it is from 1935, after the severe restrictions imposed by the Archbishop Tavella, that these \\"excesses\\" were banned and the feast took on the character of penance and atonement.

Biography Born in Pushkin, USSR he was educated in Russia, being made Master of Science at Moscow Physical-Technology Institute in 1984 and Doctor of Philosophy at the Landau Institute for Theoretical Physics in 1987. He moved to the United States in 1989 as a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Illinois in 1989-1990 after which he was appointed a research assistant professor position at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign. He then moved to Los Alamos National Laboratory as an Oppenheimer Fellow. As an acting chief scientist and as a theory thrust leader he was actively involved in bringing up the Center of Integrated Nanotechnology (CINT)http://www.cint.lanl.gov/ and building an active theory program at CINT.http://www.cint.lanl.gov/source/orgs/mpa/cint/alexander_balatsky.shtml# In 2011 Balatsky was appointed as a professor of theoretical condensed matter physics at Nordita in Stockholm. In 2014 he returned to the US to become Director of the new Institute for Functional Materials at Los Alamos. Work Balatsky is known for his contributions to the theory of High-temperature superconductivity,http://scitation.aip.org/content/aip/magazine/physicstoday/53/3 and mechanism of superconducting paring known as Spin Fluctuation Theory. According to this theory, the pairing wave function of the cuprate HTS should have a dx2-y2 symmetry. The same spin fluctuation mechanism is likely responsible for the superconducting pairing in Heavy fermion superconductors and in Fe based superconductors. Balatsky recently worked on anomalous mechanical properties of solid He4 as an alternative explanation of supersolidity seen in torsional oscillator experiments, on theory of Heavy Fermions,http://www.bnl.gov/bnlweb/pubaf/pr/photos/2010/05/NRHiddenOrderNatureFINALLANL.pdf and on electronic and structural properties of DNA and Graphene hybrid structures Balatsky and collaborators predicted the existence of the impurity induced resonances in d-wave superconductors that can serve as markers of unconventional superconductivity, and Impurity-induced states in conventional and unconventional superconductors. He also proposed the notion of Dirac Materials as a unifying class of materials that exhibit Dirac like excitations. Honors and awards He was elected as a Fellow of the American Physical Society in 2003, and Los Alamos Fellow in 2005.

In 2015, Cheran took up responsibility of releasing the film through his new straight-to‚ÄîDVD platform of C2H, but the failure of the venture meant that the release of Appavin Meesai was delayed.

The print's first issue of PNM was published in October 2011 by Pure Media, LLC. The magazine joined Metacritic in 2019 with its consistent stream of first-party and third-party video game reviews. Currently, issues of the magazine are released digitally (though physical copies can be purchased), and it is complemented by the company's online website, PureNintendo.com.  Overview  PNM was created with the intent to complement the online news coverage found on PureNintendo.com. PNM focuses on content such as developer interviews, game previews, concept and fan artwork, game tips, interactive puzzles, and gaming history. This content is supplemented with news, reviews, and other game information. Each issue has regularly featured content as well as additional features written by either Pure Nintendo staff members or contributors. The interactive apps, for the digital version of PNM, add links to external website posts, videos, and a touch interface for the pixel puzzles.  History  Founder Justin Sharp created the website, Niwifi.net, in 2007 for users to exchange friend codes (a 12-digit code that allowed users of Nintendo's online service to find and connect with each other). Soon after its founding, Justin Sharp teamed up with Pure Nintendo Magazine co-founder James Higginbotham, and the website eventually turned its focus towards Nintendo-related news. PNM, as it is known now, was founded by Justin Sharp and James Higginbotham and first published October 2011. The magazine was initially conceptualized as a monthly publication until December 2011. PNM switched to a bi-monthly publication schedule beginning with the February 2012 issue. The first 5 issues of PNM were offered in a digital-only format. The sixth issue of PNM was the first print issue and was published August 2012 for the months of August and September 2012. Early issues of PNM were small and only 26 pages by Issue #5. Issue #6 of PNM more than doubled in size and was 62 pages long. On September 11, 2012, Pure Nintendo launched a Kickstarter campaign to help fund the magazine and start a subscription service. The Kickstarter funding goal was set at $20,000 and Pure Nintendo reached said goal on October 12, 2012 after raising $22,386 in funds. The subscription service for the magazine began with the seventh issue for October and November 2012. On January 24, 2013, Pure Media LLC.‚Äîwith the help and work of Ben Stitzer‚Äîreleased an app on Google Play to facilitate an interactive digital version of PNM on Android devices, which is the first of its kind. On February 8, 2013, Pure Media, LLC., with the help and work of Ben Stitzer, released an iOS app on the Apple AppStore to enable the interactive digital version to function on iOS devices. PNM was included in the May 2013 Loot Crate, a subscription box service, which featured the theme \\"Equip.\\" = Name Change to 'PNM' = Starting with Issue 10 (April/May 2013) of Pure Nintendo Magazine, the design of the magazine was updated and the name was shortened to \\"PNM,\\" which stands for Pure Nintendo Magazine, instead of Pure Nintendo. This was partly inspired by the change in design but was also influenced by Nintendo. = Shift To Digital Only Format = As of June 2014 Pure Nintendo officially announced that they have discontinued print subscriptions. Pure Nintendo states that the magazine may bring back print subscriptions in the future but at this point in time they are focusing their time and attention on their digital offerings. PNM is still available in digital format. Current subscribers will still receive print subscription service through the end of their subscriptions. Individual print issues are still available for purchase even though print subscriptions are no longer available. = Today = Beginning with Issue 15 for February/March 2014, PNM the interactive magazine app was made available on iOS and Android mobile phones. This recently added phone compatibility combined with the previous tablet support allows for PNM availability across a full range of iOS and Android mobile devices. = Logo = After establishing their new website in 2008 and creating the name, Pure Nintendo, it was time to find a logo to represent the company. After looking at several different characters and items from Nintendo's past Pure Nintendo settled on the P-Wing logo for PureNintendo.com and ultimately PNM. When launching PureNintendo.com, the company was looking for something that clearly represented Nintendo as well as the newly established site. That is the history behind the P-Wing logo that represents Pure Nintendo today. Below is a short timeline of the evolution of the Pure Nintendo logo over the years. * 1.0 - The first version of the P-Wing logo was inspired from the P-Wing in Super Mario Bros. 3. * 2.0 - The next version of the logo was a large departure from the 8-bit original. It had a unique style but the logo did not work well when placed on darker backgrounds. * 3.0 - The third iteration of the P-Wing logo was produced to fix the contrast issues on dark backgrounds. The font for the 'P' was also updated to match the font used for 'Pure Nintendo' on PureNintendo.com. * 4.0 - The current form of the P-Wing logo is a slight change from the 3.0 version that reduced the outer border and revised the font to match the one used in Pure Nintendo Magazine. Evolution of the Pure Nintendo P-Wing Logo  Current Features = Fan Art Gallery = The Fan Art Gallery is devoted to user submitted Nintendo fan art. Fan art pieces featured in the Fan Art Gallery include paintings, pencil drawings, digital art, crafts, baked goods, and Miiverse art.

His best-known works were on castles and antiquities. Life Born about 1735, was the only son of Edward King of Norwich. He studied for a time at Clare Hall, Cambridge, as a fellow-commoner, matriculating in 1752. On 18 September 1758 he was admitted a member of Lincoln's Inn, and was called to the bar in Michaelmas term 1763. A fortune bequeathed to him by his uncle, Mr. Brown, a wholesale linendraper of Exeter, gave him financial independence, but he regularly attended the Norfolk circuit for some years, and was appointed recorder of King's Lynn. King was elected fellow of the Royal Society on 14 May 1767, and Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London on 3 May 1770. On the death of Jeremiah Milles in February 1784, King was elected his successor in the presidency of the Society of Antiquaries, though on the understanding that Lord De Ferrars would assume the office on the ensuing 23 April. King sought anyway to obtain re-election, by tactical means, but was defeated. King died on 16 April 1807, aged 72, and was buried in the churchyard at Beckenham, Kent, where was his country seat was \\"The Oakery\\", on Clay Hill. His collections of prints and drawings were sold by auction in 1808. Antiquarian works King's treatise Vestiges of Oxford Castle; or, a small fragment of a work intended to be published speedily on the History of Ancient Castles, London, 1796, was followed by his major work entitled Munimenta Antiqua; or, Observations on ancient Castles, including remarks on the ‚Ä¶ progress of Architecture ‚Ä¶ in Great Britain, and on the ‚Ä¶ changes in ‚Ä¶ Laws and Customs (with Appendix), 4 vols. London, 1799‚Äì1806. The book is unreliable, but the content of plans and details was considered significant by antiquaries. Louis Dutens objected to King's theories on the invention of the arch in Recherches sur le tems le plus recul√© de l'usage des vo√ªtes chez les anciens, 1805. King the anticipated his fourth volume by publishing, the same year, an Introduction of 21 pages, in which he defended his views. Dutens continued the controversy in three more tracts; King replied in an Appendix to Munimenta Antiqua issued in 1806. King contributed papers to Arch√¶ologia.Among them were: Remarks on the Abbey Church of Bury St. Edmunds in Suffolk (iii. 311‚Äì14), reprinted separately in 1774, Observations on Antient Castles, with four plates (iv. 364‚Äì413), and A Sequel to Observations, with thirty-one plates (vi. 231‚Äì375), also issued separately in 1782. His speech on quitting the chair of the Society of Antiquaries was printed, and he subsequently printed a letter in vindication of his conduct and reflecting upon the earl, and ceased to communicate with the Society. In 1796 King wrote whimsical Remarks concerning Stones said to have fallen from the clouds, both in these days and in antient times, occasioned by a supposed shower of stones in Tuscany on 16 June of that year. Religious works In 1780 King issued, without his name, Hymns to the Supreme Being, in Imitation of the Eastern Songs, of which two editions were issued in 1795 and 1798. In 1788 he published Morsels of Criticism, tending to illustrate some few passages in the Holy Scriptures, upon philosophical principles and an enlarged view of things. Among other claims, King attempted to prove that John the Baptist was an angel from heaven, and the same who formerly appeared in the person of Elijah. The work was criticised by Richard Gough in the Gentleman's Magazine. A notice of the book in Thomas James Mathias's Pursuits of Literature created some demand for it, and a second edition with a \\"supplemental part\\" was published in 1800 (3 vols.), and also a second part of the quarto edition. In 1793 King published An Imitation of the Prayer of Abel. In 1798 he wrote another tendentious pamphlet, Remarks on the Signs of the Times, in which he demonstrated the genuineness of the second book of Esdras. Irritated by Gough's critique on this tract in the Gentleman's Magazine, he wrote an angry letter to the printer, John Nichols. King added a Supplement to his Remarks in 1799, but this was roughly handled by Bishop Samuel Horsley in Critical Disquisitions on the Eighteenth Chapter of Isaiah, in a letter to E. King, 1799. In 1803 King published anonymously Honest Apprehensions; or, the unbiassed ‚Ä¶ Confession of Faith of a plain honest Lay-man. Other works King's first separate work appeared in 1767 under the title of An Essay on the English Constitution and Government. In 1785 he circulated, also anonymously, Proposals for Establishing at Sea a Marine School, or Seminary for Seamen, in an open letter addressed to John Frere, vice-president of the Marine Society. Jonas Hanway, in a report made to the society in July of that year, had proposed a marine school on land. King brought up objections to this scheme, and suggested the fitting up a man-of-war as a school. Considerations on the Utility of the National Debt: and on the Present Alarming Crisis; with a Short Plan of a Mode of Relief was from 1793. There was a reply by John Acland. Family As a circuit barrister King defended a lady from a faithless lover, and later married her.

It was written and produced by Pharrell Williams, with additional songwriting provided by Cyrus and Nelly. The song is a country rap track that discusses having fun through the metaphor of a 4x4 truck. The song is sampled in British indie rock band Alt-J's 2014 single \\"Hunger of the Pine\\". \\"4x4\\" received generally favorable reviews from contemporary music critics, who appreciated its overall production and individuality compared to the other tracks included on Bangerz. Despite not having been released as a single, it peaked at number 41 on the U.S. Billboard Pop Digital Songs chart. Cyrus first performed the song during her episode of MTV Unplugged in January 2014, and has also performed it during her Bangerz Tour. In August 2014, Ubisoft revealed that the song will appear in Just Dance 2015. Diane Martel also confirmed she would direct Miley's video for \\"4X4\\" later that summer in 2014, but such thing never happened.https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6143268/bangerz-creative- director-miley-cyrus-tv-show-diane-martel?utm_source=twitter Background and composition In 2012, Cyrus announced plans to focus on her film career, effectively putting her musical endeavors on hiatus. That year, she appeared in the films LOL and So Undercover. She was also confirmed as a primary voice actress in the feature film Hotel Transylvania, but dropped out of the project to coordinate a musical comeback. In January 2013, Cyrus ended her recording contract with Hollywood Records, under which she released the studio albums Meet Miley Cyrus (2007), Breakout (2008), Can't Be Tamed (2010), and the extended play (EP) The Time of Our Lives (2009). Later that month, she signed a recording contract with RCA Records. In March, she confirmed that her fourth studio album would be released by the end of 2013. Nelly is featured on \\"4x4\\". It was announced that Nelly would appear on Cyrus' album Bangerz (2013) when its track listing was confirmed on September 10. Their collaboration, \\"4x4\\", was written by Cyrus, Nelly, and Pharrell Williams; it was produced by Williams and engineered by John Hanes. Andrew Coleman arranged, recorded, and edited the song with assistance from Todd Hurtt and Matthew Desrameaux; it was later mixed by Serban Ghenea. Nelly commented that the track blends elements of pop, hip hop, and country music, and elaborated that \\"it's about having fun; kind of how a 4x4 truck symbolizes rebelliousness ... you know, mashing out, wanting to ride with the bad boys.\\" He added that Cyrus \\"does a little rapping and a little singing\\" on the song, which he felt was a way in which she \\"expresses herself\\". Critical reception \\"4x4\\" received generally favorable reviews from contemporary music critics. Writing for AllMusic, Heather Phares described the track as an \\"improbable but entertaining piece of country-rap\\", and distinguished it as a stand-out track from Bangerz. Marah Eakin from The A.V. Club opined that its \\"progressive\\" production was similar to a \\"Scale-era Matthew Herbert\\", and commented that its lyrical content \\"[takes] the song in a silly Bonnie and Clyde direction\\". Nick Catucci from Entertainment Weekly was complimentary towards the \\"winningly nutty Pharrell production\\", while Kyle Fowle from Slant Magazine commented that Cyrus \\"explores ideas of femininity with a sinister, determined edge\\" by assuming the position of the \\"other woman\\" mentioned in \\"Before He Cheats\\" by Carrie Underwood. Writing for PopMatters, Evan Sawdey described \\"4x4\\" as an \\"almost throwaway squaredance of a club song ... complete with some accordion work\\", and suggested that it was the most inventive track from the record because it was \\"absurd, ridiculous, and actually playful in a way in which these other Bangerz aren't.\\" Live performances An episode of MTV Unplugged starring Cyrus premiered through MTV on January 29, 2014; she performed an acoustic version of \\"4x4\\", among several additional tracks from Bangerz. The entire episode followed a theme inspired by country music; during \\"4x4\\" in particular, Cyrus was dressed in red-checkered outfit with a blonde wig, white hat, and light blue purse. She made several provocative gestures throughout the performance, and additionally twerked on performers dressed in a large horse costume. Later that year, Cyrus performed the track during her ongoing Bangerz Tour. The performance received positive reviews from critics. Blake Hannon praised Cyrus' vocals and commented that he loved \\"the knee-slapping, country-inspired 4X4.\\" Cyrus returned to perform the song during the musical festival on June 21, 2014, Summertime Ball at Wembley Stadium of London, in front of 80,000 people.

Biography Hussey was born at Southampton in 1864, the son of George Hussey, by Mary Bush, daughter of Thomas Bush, of Hinton Charterhouse, Somerset.The county families of the United Kingdom, Volume ed. 59, 1919 He was educated at Cranleigh School. In 1881 he entered a firm of brewers, and eight years later he bought a brewery in Southampton. He was elected a councillor of the borough of Southampton in 1892, an Alderman in 1898, and served three terms as Mayor of the city 1899-1901. He later received the Freedom of the borough of Southampton, and continued to be active in local politics, serving as Chairman of the Southampton Conservative Association. His years as mayor coincided with the Second Boer War in South Africa (1899-1902), and he was thus responsible for the city with the port where a major part of the troops would go out or return home. He also raised an Ambulance corps to help in the war.Whitaker¬¥s peerage 1907, page 396 For his services as mayor he was appointed a Knight Bachelor in the November 1901 Birthday Honours list, and received the knighthood from King Edward VII on 10 December 1901. Hussey was an officer in the Volunteer Force, Hampshire Regiment. He was appointed a major of the 2nd Volunteer Battalion of the regiment on 14 February 1900, and lieutenant-colonel commanding the Battalion on 4 February 1907. In April the following year the 2nd Volunteer Battalion was amalgamated into the 5th Battalion when the Volunteer Force became the Territorial Force, and he continued in command of the battalion until 1912. On 13 March 1912 he retired from the Regiment, and the following July he was appointed a lieutenant- colonel of the Territorial Force Reserve. In later life he was a Master of the Worshipful Company of Distillers in 1921. Family Hussey married first, in 1885, Mary Ann Rachel Read (died 29 January 1906), daughter of William Read, of Acoecks Green, Worcestershire.

Background Carnine graduated from Storm Lake High School, and he earned a bachelor's degree from Buena Vista University, both in Storm Lake in Buena Vista County in northwestern Iowa. He procured a master's degree from Central Missouri State University, now the University of Central Missouri in Warrensburg, Missouri, and a Ph.D. in education from the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville. He is a former \\"Arkansas Superintendent of the Year\\" and a former trustee of the Northwest Arkansas Community College in Bentonville. He is affiliated with Rotary International. He and his wife, Linda Jo Carnine (born 1944), attend the Presbyterian Church. The couple has two grown children and as of 2013 six grandchildren. Political life In 2008, Carnine won without opposition the District 94 House seat vacated by Republican Eric Harris. In 2010, he was again unopposed in District 94. In 2012, Carnine, again unopposed, was switched to District 90 for his third and final term in the state House. Incumbent Republican Representative David Branscum was transferred to District 83. In his last legislative term, Carnine served on the Joint Budget and the House Education and Insurance & Commerce committees. Representative Carnine in 2013 co-sponsored the proposed spending cap on the state budget, but the bill failed by a two-vote margin in the House. He voted to override the vetoes of Democratic Governor Mike Beebe to enact legislation to require photo identification for casting a ballot in Arkansas and to ban abortion after twenty weeks of gestation. He also supported legislation to ban abortion whenever fetal heartbeat is detected, to forbid the inclusion of abortion in the state insurance exchange, and to make the death of a fetus a felony in certain cases. He did not vote on to allow leaders of universities to carry concealed weapons of firearms on campus, but he co-sponsored a similar measure to permit officials of religious institutions to allow the carrying of concealed weapons in places of worship. He voted against reducing the application fee for obtaining a concealed carry permit. Carnine voted to prohibit the governor from regulating firearms during an emergency. He voted to permit the closing of schools based on a two-year pupil enrollment analysis. He voted against legislation to make the office of prosecuting attorney in Arkansas nonpartisan. Carnine did not vote on the bill, signed by Governor Beebe, to permit the sale of up to five hundred gallons per month of unpasteurized whole milk directly from the farm to consumers. In 2011, Carnine did not vote on a measure to allow religious instruction in schools but supported a measure authorizing school dress codes. He voted to restrict driver's license tests to be given in the English language. He voted for the Capital Gains Reduction Act and for the reduction of taxes on manufacturers' utilities. He voted first to prohibit cell phone usage in school zones but reversed himself a day later on the measure. He voted for the congressional redistricting act. In 2009, Carnine voted to allow unlicensed medical assistants to perform minor procedures. He co-sponsored the expansion of children's eligibility in the state health insurance program. He voted against a plan to base the electoral vote on a system of direct election of the U.S. President. In the Republican primary held on May 20, 2014, Jana Della Rosa, with 1,194 votes (52 percent), defeated two intra-party rivals, Paul Caldwell, with 816 votes (368 percent), and Mike Whitmore, with the remaining 274 votes (12 percent), to win the party's nomination to succeed Carnine.

It is the seat of the Diocese of Wyoming. The cathedral is a contributing property in the St. Matthew's Cathedral Close, a historic district listed on the National Register of Historic Places. History St. Matthew's was established in 1868. The Rt. Rev. Ethelbert Talbot, the first bishop of the newly created Missionary District of Wyoming and Idaho chose Laramie as his See city. He then led the effort to build St. Matthew's Cathedral from 1892 to 1896. The cathedral cornerstone was laid on September 21, 1892 and it was dedicated on December 17, 1896. The church was consecrated on August 11, 1901. The 1967 General Convention of the Episcopal Church created the Diocese of Wyoming.

The cathedral is a part of the St. Matthew's Cathedral Close historic district placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. The other elements in the district include the Deanery, Hunter Hall (formerly known as Sherwood Hall), and the First World War Memorial Cross. Architecture New York City architect William Halsey Wood designed St. Matthew's Cathedral in the Gothic Revival style. The structure is built of native sandstone that was quarried nine miles northeast of Laramie. The church building is cruciform is shape with the bell tower and spire above the main entrance. The cross at the top of the spire is feet above the ground and feet above sea level, which makes St. Matthew's the highest cathedral in the United States. There are 11 bells in the tower that were cast by Meneely & Co., of Watervliet, New York. The clock on the tower was made by the E. Howard Clock Co. of Boston. Several artists created the cathedrals stained glass windows. They include Heaton, Butler and Bayne of London and New York City, Charles Connick of Boston, and Rowan and Irene LeCompte of New York and Washington, D.C.  Organ  The pipe organ was installed by the E.M. Skinner Organ Co. in 1925, Opus 523. It features four manuals, 51 ranks, and 3,111 pipes.

During the Azuchi‚ÄìMomoyama period, after the death of the Ch≈çsokabe Nobuchika, the eldest son of Kira Chikazane's uncle Ch≈çsokabe Motochika, since he opposed Motochika in supporting Ch≈çsokabe Morichika as the successor, he was ordered to commit seppuku. At that time, several vassals also followed suicide (and thus 7 people in total), but afterwards, various strange events started happening at their graves, and the vengeful spirits of Chikazane and the rest were feared as the shichinin misaki. Motochika, who heard of this, held a memorial for them, but there was no effect, and in order to pacify the vengeful spirits, Kizuka Myoujin (Êú®Â°öÊòéÁ•û) was deified at the gravesite of Nishibun Village, Masui (now K≈çchi).

The adornments have been subject to changes in fashion but some designs have resisted change. History Mapuche people adopted metallurgy around the Spanish arrival era of the 16th century. During the latter half of the 18th century, Mapuche silversmiths began to produce large amounts of silver finery. The surge of silversmithing activity may be related to the 1641 parliament of Quill√≠n and the 1726 parliament of Negrete that decreased hostilities between Spaniards and Mapuches and allowed trade to increase between colonial Chile and the free Mapuches. In this context of increasing trade, Mapuches began in the late 18th century to accept payments in silver coins for their products; usually cattle or horses. These coins and silver coins obtained in political negotiations served as raw material for Mapuche metalsmiths (Mapudungun: r√ºxafe). Old Mapuche silver pendants often included unmelted silver coins, a circumstance which has helped modern researchers to date the objects. The bulk of the Spanish silver coins originated from mining in Potos√≠ in Upper Peru.Painecura 2011, pp. 25-26. The great diversity in silver finery designs is indebted to the fact that designs were done to be identified with different reynma (families), lof mapu (lands) as well as specific lonkos and machis.Painecura 2011, pp. 27-28. Mapuche silver finery was also subject to changes in fashion albeit designs associated with philosophical and spiritual concepts have not undergone major changes. In late 18th century and early 19th century, Mapuche silversmithing activity and artistic diversity reached it climax.Painecura 2011, p. 30. All important Mapuche chiefs of the 19th century are supposed to have had at least one silversmith. The 1869 war between Chile and independent Mapuches provoked a famine among Mapuches in the winter of 1869, with the situation being worsened by a smallpox epidemic.Bengoa 2000, p. 224. This situation led some Mapuches to sell their silver adornments in the towns of La Frontera to obtain food. As of 1984, Mapuche scholar Carlos Aldunate noted that there were no silversmiths alive among contemporary Mapuches. Appearance Although these adornments showed some variation in form, the principal one appears to be a set of three separate columns of flattened silver links joined to each other by square alternating links. At the top of the set of columns, and holding them together, is a flat two-headed bird figure and at the base is a flat semicircle or trapezoid that usually has a series of small disks dangling from its base. The wearer would place the object hanging from his/ her neck and down the chest.

Colonel Summers Park in Portland, Oregon, is named in his honor. Early years Owen Summers was born in Brockville, Canada, on June 13, 1850, to parents John and Elizabeth Ann Summers, with Owen one of five children. The family soon moved to Chicago, Illinois, where John Summers entered the shoe business. In 1856, the parents and one daughter died in a cholera epidemic, leaving the remaining four children orphans. Owen went to a farm in Frankfort, Illinois, near Chicago. Owen worked on the farm, earning his room and board, as well as clothing, and attended school nearby when possible. Civil War service In 1865 Owen, and four of his friends decided to join the Union Army in the American Civil War. They were fourteen years old. The recruiters refused to enlist them, six times. Then a Pennsylvania Dutchman agreed to take on the youngsters as their guardian, and the Army allowed them to join. On February 1, 1865 Owen Summers joined Company H of the 3rd Illinois Cavalry Regiment. Summers immediately shipped out to his unit, in Eastern Mississippi. Based on these dates, young Summers may have seen action in some battles before the end of the war, or perhaps he joined units that were ending their involvement. The Third Illinois Cavalry was reassigned to Missouri, to join battles against the Sioux Indians in Minnesota and the Dakotas. This assignment lasted during the summer of 1865. Summers and the regiment were mustered out in December, 1865. Business and civic Returning to the farm after his stint in the Army, Summers later moved to Chicago in 1871. He was caught in the Great Chicago Fire, rescuing his new family and two others. After the fire, Summers performed contractor work in rebuilding the city. He continued his contractor work on the West Coast, working in San Francisco and San Diego, before arriving in Portland, Oregon in 1879. He founded a crockery business with his brother-in-law, J. C. Olds, called Olds & Summers, and supplying crockery both wholesale and retail. The business flourished, as the two men became prominent local businessmen in Portland, Oregon. In 1896, Summers was selected as the United States Appraiser for the Port of Portland, Oregon. In this role he was responsible for the examination, appraisal, and classification of all merchandise which is liable to customs duties upon importation or exportation from the Port. He continued to serve in this role until his death, with the exception of the period of his military duties in the Philippines. Military service In 1886, serving in the Oregon State Assembly, Summers was instrumental in getting a bill passed that resulted in the state militia becoming the Oregon National Guard. One of the three new guard regiments was one Summers had organized in 1883 from veterans of the Civil War. At the opening of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, the guard was consolidated into the 2nd Oregon Volunteer Infantry Regiment, with Summers as its commanding colonel. In May, 1898, the Oregon Volunteers were the first regiment to sail for the Philippines in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. Arriving in Manila in August they accepted the surrender of the Spanish Army of 15,000 soldiers. The Philippine insurgents who had been fighting the Spanish for several years expected to become the government of the new independent nation. Fighting now began between 11,000 American soldiers and the Philippine insurgents. The Second Oregon Regiment fought in a number of major battles, and provided provost duties in Manila. During its term of service the regiment participated in forty-two engagements. The Second Oregon Regiment returned to the United States in 1899, and was de-commissioned from the Army. Owen Summers was honored with a brevet Brigadier General recognition. Family Owen Summers was married to Clara T. Olds in Portland, Oregon on July 23, 1880. Clara was the daughter of some of the original pioneers in Oregon. They had one child, Owen Summers Jr. Their son also joined the military, serving in World War II as a Major General, and having received multiple honors including the Silver Star and a Purple Heart. Mr. and Mrs. Summers were active in many civic and fraternal organizations in Oregon. Owen Summers died in Portland, Oregon, on January 21, 1911. He and his son are buried in Portland's River View Cemetery, where many Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War veterans are buried.

Franciscus √† Mesgnien Meninski (first name spelled also Francisci, Fran√ßois and Franciszek) (1623‚Äì1698) was the author of a multi-volume Turkish-to-Latin dictionary and grammar of the Turkish language, first published in 1680, which was ground-breaking in its comprehensiveness at the time, and for historians and linguists today it is a valuable reference for the Turkish language of the early modern period. Mesgnien-Meninski was born in Lorraine (duchy) in today's northeastern France. He studied in Rome, where one of his teachers was a theoretical linguist, logician, and Jesuit, Giovanni Battista Giattini. Mesgnien-Meninski moved to Poland around 1647. In 1649, when aged in his late 20s, he published in Latin a grammar and tutorial for learning the Polish language.Grammatica seu Institutio Polonicae Linguae, by Francisco Mesgnien, year 1649. The title translates as \\"Grammar or Tutorial on the Polish Language\\" and the book says on its title page that \\"etymology, syntax and all other aspects are carefully treated for the instruction of non-native-speakers\\". Published at Gdansk (Dantiscum). 140 pages. In 1653 at age 30 he accompanied the Polish ambassador to Istanbul. After two to three years of applying himself to the study of the Turkish language in Istanbul, he became the chief translator to the Polish embassy at Istanbul, and subsequently was appointed as deputy ambassador with full ambassadorial powers. Soon after that promotion, he was awarded Polish citizenship, on which occasion he added the Polish termination of \\"ski\\" to his last name, which had been Mesgnien or Menin previously.Entry for MENINSKI or MENIN in The General Biographical Dictionary Containing an Historical and Critical Account of the Lives and Writings of the Most Eminent Persons, by Alexander Chalmers, volume XXII, year 1815. In 1661 he moved to Vienna in Austria to become interpreter of Oriental languages for the Habsburg monarchy at Vienna. He stayed at that post for the rest of his career, and died at Vienna. His great work, the Thesaurus Linguarum Orientalium, was published at Vienna in 1680 in 4 volumes, consisting of a dictionary of Turkish, Arabic and Persian vocabulary translated to Latin and explained in Latin, plus a grammar and tutorial for learning the Turkish language. For his Arabic and Persian vocabulary Meninski copied much from the Arabic-Latin and Persian-Latin dictionaries of Jacobus Golius (died 1667). The Turkish was largely and essentially from Meninski himself. In 1687, Meninski published a complementary volume entitled Complementum Thesaurus Linguarum Orientalium, in which it is the Latin words that are organized alphabetically and the Latin words are translated into Turkish.

Early life  Kahan was born into an Hasidic Jewish family in Sighet, Romania. Elie Wiesel was among his childhood friends.  World War II and concentration camps  During World War II, when Northern Transylvania was part of Kingdom of Hungary (see Second Vienna Award), Kahan and two siblings were able to obtain \\"Aryan papers\\" in Budapest. After getting reports from his father in Sighet that Jews in the city were gathered into ghettos, he returned home to provide food. In 1944, Kahan was deported to the Auschwitz concentration camp with his father, mother, and a sister. After arriving in the camp, his mother and sister were murdered in the gas chambers; Kahan and his father were selected as workers. After a couple of weeks, they were transported to the Wolfsberg camp near Breslau, and later to the Mauthausen- Gusen concentration camp and Ebensee concentration camp. Kahan experienced torture in all three camps; his father was also tortured. At the end of his time at Ebensee, Kahan lost consciousness and was thrown into a pile of corpses. American forces liberated the camp the same day, and while transporting the corpses to a mass grave, one of the American soldiers saw Kahan's hand move and pulled him out of the pile. Kahan's father died 10 days after liberation.  Postwar  After the war Kahan moved to Paris and planned to go to the United States. He supported himself by selling knitwear he produced with knitting machines. In 1947, he traveled to Norway to visit his sister and her husband. He decided to stay and was granted permission to settle as part of the Jewish refugee quota established to replace the number of Norwegian Jews murdered in the Holocaust.

The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2009 for its architectural significance as a modern corporate office building in Omaha, as well as Omaha's status as a regional center of communication and commerce at the time. The twelve-story building was originally built in 1957 on the northeast corner of the block bounded by Dodge Street on the north, Douglas Street on the south, 19th Street on the east, and 20th Street on the west. In 1964, an addition was built on the northwest corner of the block, also twelve stories high. The southeast corner of the block was the original company headquarters and switching center, built in 1918. The 1918 building has been altered by additional equipment installation and removal of the ornamental fa√ßade, so it is not listed on the National Register. Finally, the southwest corner of the block was built in 1970, making it too new for listing. The company was formed by the merger of the Nebraska Telephone Company, the Iowa Telephone Company, and the Northwestern Telephone Exchange. They were effectively operated by one general office and its staff by 1909, but they were not officially merged until 1921. The company grew during the 1920s, but then faced financial difficulties during the Great Depression in the 1930s. During World War II, most telephone company resources were being applied toward military and government jobs, so by the end of the war, there were about 59,000 outstanding requests for residential and business service. Northwestern Bell realized that after the war, the development of new jobs and new homes would result in a demand for more telephone service. By 1953, the company had 1,750,000 telephones and was spending $50 million in construction costs. This growth in service produced a sizable economic effect on the region's economy. The company also recognized the importance of hiring and retaining skilled telephone employees in order to provide outstanding telephone service. Other growth at Northwestern Bell during this time included work with the Strategic Air Command, with its headquarters south of Omaha at Offutt Air Force Base. The Strategic Air Command spent millions of dollars on communication equipment, including the \\"red telephone\\" system that connected 200 SAC locations to the command post at Offutt. The need for instant communication made SAC the Bell System's first customer for Touch-Tone dialing. Residential customers also benefited from faster service via coaxial cable and crossbar switching equipment. Since a large amount of equipment had been added to the original Douglas Street building, many of the telephone company's employees were working in leased office space. Design of the building began in the mid-1950s, following newly developed standards within the Bell System for building design. These standards were influenced by modern architecture, particularly with respect to building mass, site selection, and materials. The 1955 administration building in New Haven, Connecticut, the 1958 regional headquarters in Des Moines, Iowa, and the 1960 administration building in Denver, Colorado followed similar trends in architectural design. These buildings were built with simpler, solid planes instead of Art Deco setbacks, such as had been used in the Northwestern Bell Building in Minneapolis built in 1931. The building was designed by Leo A. Daly, which is now one of the largest architectural, engineering, planning, and interior design firms in the United States. In 1962, an addition was built due to enlarged departmental needs, as well as the need to house more equipment.

Produced by KP Ramakrishnan Nair, the film features Nandha, Nikesh Ram, and Ananya in the leading roles, while Yuvina Parthavi, Varsha Ashwathi, Thambi Ramaiah, and Sendrayan play pivotal roles. The film is a remake of the 2010 Malayalam film Cocktail (2010), which was the actual remake of Butterfly on a Wheel.Rediff ReviewSify Review The film was released on 27 June 2014. Athithi is an edge-of-the seat, realistic thriller about a life-changing - or ruining - day in the picture-perfect life of a successful and determined young man. In the world today, the list of necessities begins with a satisfying job and ends with wealth, and luxury is a happy family along with the package. When life is complete with all that, how bizarre can a normal day get, toppling the niceties altogether? Plot Madhiazhagan (Nandha) is a successful project manager at a leading property promoters firm. He is happily wedded to Vasuki (Ananya), and they have a five- year-old daughter named Pavi (Yuvina Parthavi). A posh house, a heftily paying job, a highly appreciative and supportive boss, and a happy family - Madhi's life is a far-fetched dream to most people in this era. However, all changes one day, when a man requests to be dropped en route, when Madhi and Vasu set out on a pleasant weekend. The mysterious stranger pulls out a pistol and begins to threaten the couple to bend to his wishes, holding Pavi as a hostage. The day sets off with the stranger making the couple draw out all the money that Madhi has to the last penny and then setting it all on fire. Next, he makes Madhi lose his career by leaking the top secrets of his company, trusted to him, to their competitor. The day goes on with further with more gimmicks by the stranger, while the couple are cornered to do it all for their daughter's life. For the same reason, they also refrain from making a complaint to the police, although they are tantalizingly near their target. While this seems endless, how they figure a way out of the mess, with a completely unexpected twist to the whole story in the end forms the rest of the story.

The nonprofit organization boasts a membership of approximately 2,500 physicians and other health care practitioners. The Academy serves as a strong advocate for physicians and patients, supports the needs of physicians and their families, and offers a vibrant and informative forum for Central Virginia‚Äôs growing medical community. The Academy traces its beginnings to December 15, 1820, when a group of 17 physicians met at Richmond‚Äôs Eagle Hotel. Their purpose was ‚Äúpromotion of medical knowledge‚Äù through case studies and scholarly essays focused on topics such as bilious fever, bloodletting, consumption and duties of the physician. The group, which originally called itself the Medical Society of Virginia, elected James McClurg as its first president. McClurg, who received his medical education in Edinburgh, served as Richmond‚Äôs mayor and was a delegate to the United States Constitutional Convention. James McClurg, RAM's first president In 1824, the organization was granted a state charter by the Virginia General Assembly, allowing it authority to speak for organized medicine and regulate its practice in the Commonwealth. Though it was chartered as the medical society for the state, it was common knowledge that the group was controlled by Richmond-area physicians. Later in the century, those physicians renamed themselves the Richmond Academy of Medicine, while a new state society was organized under RAM‚Äôs former name, the Medical Society of Virginia. RAM was originally founded by white males. The first female member, Emily Chenault Runyon, an 1888 graduate of the Women‚Äôs Medical College of Chicago, passed the Virginia medical board in 1895, but was not admitted into RAM until 1910. It wasn‚Äôt until 1964 that RAM voted to strike restrictive language from its bylaws and allow physicians of color to join. For the first century of its existence, RAM held meetings at various venues across the city. But in 1932, Dr. Joseph Lyon Miller, a graduate of Richmond‚Äôs second medical school, the University College of Medicine, proposed donating his valuable library of medical literature to RAM if it built a permanent home that would house the collection. RAM rose to the challenge, building is a historic medical library building in Richmond, Virginia. It was built in 1931‚Äì32, and is a two-story, five bay square, brick and concrete Georgian Revival style building. The building features an elaborately-designed entry with a large broken pediment and a cartouche bearing a caduceus. The building housed a library, dining room, auditorium and offices. The Academy moved from that building in the mid-2000s to rented office space. Through the decades, RAM members fought for both the medical profession and for their patients. On several occasions, disagreements over medical care turned violent, with at least one duel and one knife fight. But more often, RAM was discussing the business of medicine, debating the best health care delivery, pushing for oversight of medicine, debating the pros and cons of health insurance, universal health care, advertising in medicine, and various legislative issues. The Academy took the lead and supported major efforts to obtain clean water, pure milk, recreational facilities and even a city library in Richmond. During the influenza pandemic of 1918, RAM members staffed a makeshift hospital in John Marshall High School to care for those with the deadly disease. RAM was largely responsible for creating a community blood bank. Over the years, RAM fostered a close working relationship with the Richmond City Health Department and the Virginia Department of Health. Throughout its history, the Academy has developed ways and means to provide care for the poor, the homeless and the disabled. During the 19th century, many members provided charity care wherever they could or supported the work of other institutions. In the past 50 years, RAM made its mark working to improve care for the underserved, with members serving as the backbone of organizations such as the Fan Free Clinic (now Health Brigade), Crossover Healthcare Ministry and the Richmond AIDS Ministry. Currently under RAM‚Äôs umbrella is the Access Now program, which provides specialty care to uninsured patients in Central Virginia. Another RAM program, Honoring Choices Virginia, offers education about making health care decisions and advance care planning support to all Virginians. RAM also offers a scholarship each year to a student in Virginia Commonwealth University‚Äôs School of Medicine. In 2020, the Academy was honored by Virginia's General Assembly for its 200 years of service to physicians and patients.

A protected cultural monument, it is one of the oldest of its kind in Hesse.  Description  The cemetery is located north of Jest√§dt, on the east side of the Motzenroder Stra√üe [ \\"Motzenrod Road\\" ], about 547 yards ( 500 meters ) from the outskirts of the village. It runs along the slope to the edge of the forest. There are 170 graves in the cemetery.  History  Jest√§dt Jewish Cemetery The cemetery was occupied at least from 1642 and until 1855, as long as the Jews had lived in Jest√§dt, but it might have already been used as early as 1501. The village, with an average population of 550 Christians, was barely big enough to support even a minyan. In the middle of the 17th Century, for example, there were only two Jewish families. One of them was headed by the overseer of the cemetery, who had to pay protection money to the Herren [ Lords ] von Boyneburg-Hohenstein, and the other, under the protection of the local authorities, was a woman \\"who earned her daily bread with dirty work\\". In those days, the Jews were not allowed to own land. But, between 1724 and 1800, they managed to buy 27 Ruthen ( rods ) of arable land from the Herren von Boysenburg-Hohenstein to officially establish their own cemetery, which had already been in use for more than 75 years. They still had to pay them a quit-rent of three florins a year and the Schulthei√ü [ village mayor ] the protection money but the Jews had a cemetery that can be properly called Jewish. The cemetery was used as the burial ground for the Jews of nearby Abterode ( until 1660 ), Reichensachsen ( until 1700 ) and Sontra ( until 1710 ), which all later established their own cemeteries, and also for Netra and Eschwege. The oldest of the surviving tombstones dates from 1642 and the last of them marked the grave of Salomon Kugelmann, who died on 11 April 1855 ( 23 Nisan 5615, according to the Jewish calendar ). Two years later, in 1857, the cemetery was closed when the Jews of Eschwege opened their own cemetery but it opened for one more time on 28 April 1861 ( 18 Iyar 5621, according to the Jewish calendar ) for the burial of the last remaining Jew of Jest√§dt, a penniless old man who had died childless at the age of 73.

It mixes science fiction, supernatural and espionage themes in a story about a government agency that attempts to use \\"revenants\\", or ghosts of recently dead people, as agents in a conflict with an organization known as \\"The Nablovsky Colony\\", which apparently already has the ability to penetrate secret installations with their own ghosts. It is written by Jenny Stephens. Plot summary Agent Finch works for an organization known as MI-7, apparently a branch of British Intelligence, that is trying to create and capture revenants for use in spying. As the first episode begins, her colleague Raphael is trying to summon the courage to kill himself to become a revenant. Once it becomes apparent he cannot, Finch shoots him. Finding only a weak revenant from Raphael, Finch and her new boss, Agent Evans, try to recruit a local psychic, Malcolm Holmes, who lives in a small Yorkshire town near the MI-7 installation. MI-7 has been monitoring Malcolm since he was a child, after he showed signs of ability at his school. Malcolm lives with his mother, who runs a vegetarian food shop. He thinks he is being followed, and has lost his job at the local library after assaulting one of the people he believes is following him. The person he attacked is actually an MI-7 agent. Finch and Evans test Malcolm at a local inn whose cellar is said to be haunted. It is really a front for the agency, and the cellar has much equipment in it that can detect psychic activity. The response is alarming. The ghost, a young girl, appears more strongly than they have ever seen it. Malcolm actually seems to amplify revenant activity. However Malcolm is accompanied by a local journalist, Polly Williams, and is falling in love with her. Before they can use Malcolm to recover Raphael, the agents have to separate them and make sure her story about the incident is not published. Malcolm is taken to the MI-7 installation and told to find Raphael. He is able to communicate with Raphael, but in doing so reveals that Finch killed him. Finch had told her superiors that Raphael killed himself. Raphael is still too weak to be any use, however. Polly tries to get inside the facility, triggering an alarm. Finch realizes that they can create a powerful revenant by first terrifying her, then killing her, using Malcolm to amplify the results. They release the guard dogs and prepare to shoot her. However Malcolm is psychically linked to Polly, and communicates his fears to Raphael, who becomes angry and powerful, disabling all the electrical systems. Malcolm and Polly escape to the inn, where they are cornered by Finch and Evans. The ghost tells Malcolm that Finch was her best friend when they both were young, but left her behind to die after a pile of barrels collapsed on her in the cellar. Finch gets ready to shoot Polly, but is herself shot by Evans. Finch is left behind in the cellar as a revenant herself, trapped with the friend she once abandoned.

Her father, Thomas Dorsett, also pled guilty to the murder, and Dorsett's mother, Lesley Dorsett, a former member of the Ocean Township Board of Education, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit murder in 2013. The case made headlines across New Jersey and throughout the United States. Background Kathleen Dorsett, a kindergarten and third grade teacher at the Gables School in Neptune Township, New Jersey, and Stephen Moore, a salesman at a local Honda dealership, and former speed skater, married in June 2007. The following year, Kathleen gave birth to the couple's only daughter. Shortly after though, the couple began disagreeing about how to best care for their daughter. Eventually the couple began divorce proceedings and a custody battle ensued. The divorce was later finalized in June 2010, with Kathleen receiving primary physical custody. After the divorce, Kathleen's parents, Thomas and Lesley Dorsett, planned to move to Florida with their daughter Kathleen and her daughter. However, the couple would have had to help Stephen Moore move there too, so he could have access to their daughter. This would require Thomas Dorsett providing financial assistance to Moore for the first six months following the move. Murder On August 16, 2010, Stephen Moore was dropping off his daughter at Kathleen's parent's home in Oakhurst, New Jersey. Following the exchange, Stephen was beaten to death by Kathleen's father, Thomas Dorsett, in the driveway of their home, while Kathleen was allegedly changing the child's diaper. Later that day, when he failed to show up to work at the Honda dealership, Stephen was reported as a missing person by his employer. Two days later, on August 18, 2010, Stephen's body was found in the back of his mother's burning 2001 Nissan Altima in Long Branch, New Jersey. Investigation Shortly after the murder on August 23, Kathleen Dorsett was arrested and charged with one count of first-degree murder and one count of fourth-degree tampering with evidence. Following his daughter's arrest, Thomas Dorsett attempted suicide by ingesting refrigerant outside his attorney's office. He survived and was charged with one count of first-degree murder, two counts of fourth-degree tampering with evidence, and one count of third-degree witness tampering. Another man, Anthony Morris, was charged with arson and desecration of human remains; he had allegedly been paid $3,000 by Thomas Dorsett to burn Stephen Moore's mother's car with his body in the trunk. Kathleen and Thomas Dorsett were held at the Monmouth County jail on $1.5 million and $2.5 million cash bail, respectively. While in jail awaiting trial, Kathleen Dorsett and her mother Lesley were charged with conspiracy to commit murder and attempted murder for attempting to arrange and solicit a hit man to kill Stephen Moore's mother, Evlyn, who received custody of his daughter after Kathleen's arrest. During this investigation, it was also discovered that the Dorsett family was involved in money laundering, as they had attempted to conceal $96,000 worth of assets. In November 2010, all three Dorsetts were charged with money laundering. Convictions In April 2011, Anthony Morris pled guilty to conspiracy to disturb or desecrate human remains. Under his plea agreement, he was sentenced to less than seven years in prison. In May 2013, Kathleen, Thomas, and Lesley Dorsett pled guilty to all charges against them. Kathleen Dorsett was sentenced to 30 years in prison for murder, 20 years for attempted murder, and 8 years for conspiracy. She is serving her sentences, running consecutively, at the Edna Mahan Correctional Facility for Women in Union Township, New Jersey. She is eligible for parole in August 2057, when she will be 83 years old. Since her incarceration, the New Jersey Department of Education has stripped Kathleen of her teaching certificates.

North Tyrone returned one Member of Parliament to the House of Commons of the United Kingdom, elected by the first past the post voting system. The election was held on 6 October 1911. Vacancy The by-election was held due to the incumbent Liberal MP, Redmond Barry, becoming Lord Chancellor of Ireland, requiring him to cease membership of the House of Commons. Barry had been Liberal MP for the seat of since the 1907 North Tyrone by-election when he successfully defended the seat for the Liberals. Electoral history Unlike most Irish seats, the Liberals rather than the Irish Nationalists, were the standard bearers for Irish Home Rule. Close results were part of the seat's tradition with the Unionists winning three times and the Liberals six times. Barry's hold on the seat had always been tenuous; His three successful defences were all in two-party contests with an Irish Unionist, where he had never polled higher than the 51.1% of the vote he polled last time: Redmond Barry Candidates * The Liberals chose 60-year-old Tyronian Thomas Russell as their candidate. He had sat in the House as member for neighbouring Tyrone South from 1886 to January 1910 when he had been defeated. Russell had always been a Liberal, but he had not always supported Irish Home Rule. In 1886, he joined the Liberal Unionists as he disagreed with William Gladstone over Home Rule. However he found himself at odds with mainstream Unionism and by 1906, though still describing himself as a Unionist, had reached an understanding with the Liberal party. He eventually changed his mind on Home Rule and contested the January 1910 election as a Liberal. * The Unionist challenger was 39-year-old Emerson Herdman. He had contested the seat in January 1910 but not in December 1910. Campaign The issue of Irish Home Rule was not prominent in the campaign, even though the Liberal Government, supported by the Irish Nationalists, was about to embark on the 3rd Irish Home Rule Bill. This was because in Tyrone, the electorate had long since made up its mind on this issue. Instead, the Unionist campaign sought to weaken the ties between the Liberal candidate and his would be supporters. A number of the Unionist influenced newspapers attempted to undermine Russell's campaign, by attacking him personally. They referred to the Liberal candidate as a 'Nationalist' and a turncoat. He was even referred to as a political Carpet-bagger, despite the fact that he was a local man.OUR CORRESPONDENT. \\"Election Intelligence.\\" Times [London, England] 9 Oct. 1911: 8. The Times Digital Archive. Web. 22 Apr. 2014.

The series was developed by Graham Yost based on Elmore Leonard's novels Pronto and Riding the Rap and his short story \\"Fire in the Hole\\". Its main character is Raylan Givens, a deputy U.S. Marshal. Timothy Olyphant portrays Givens, a tough federal lawman, enforcing his own brand of justice in his Kentucky hometown. The series is set in the city of Lexington, Kentucky, and the hill country of eastern Kentucky, specifically in and around Harlan. Plot Season one arc concentrates on the crimes of the Crowder family and relationship of Crowder and Givens families. After Raylan Givens (Timothy Olyphant) kills a Miami gun thug in a questionable manner he's sent to his home state of Kentucky. When he hears that Ava Crowder (Joelle Carter) had killed her abusive husband Bowman, Raylan seeks to protect her from revenge by the Crowder clan. The initial threat comes from Boyd Crowder (Walton Goggins), a local criminal masquerading as a white supremacist whom Raylan once dug coal with. Raylan shoots Boyd in the chest but Boyd survives and claims its a sign from God that he should change his ways. The Crowder family patriarch Bo (M. C. Gainey) is released from prison after Raylan arrests the Harlan county sheriff who has ties to the Miami cartel that has put a price on Raylan's head. Bo seeks to rebuild his criminal empire and settle old scores. Boyd is released after AUSA Vazquez, who is investigating Raylan's questionable shootings, discovers Ava and Raylan have been sleeping together. While Bo works on gaining dominance over the meth trade, Boyd collects a camp of spiritually reformed criminals to clean up Harlan's meth problem. When this kills a criminal informant, Raylan promises to send Boyd back to jail. In the meantime Raylan is dealing with his own personal dilemmas, including working in the same building as his ex-wife (Natalie Zea), for whom he continues to harbor feelings. Dealing with his criminal father, Arlo (Raymond J. Barry), who Bo believes cheated him out of protection money. Figuring out how to handle his relationship with Ava. Also avoiding Gio's, a Miami cartel boss, hitmen. Raylan's continuing visits to Harlan are peppered with small crimes and big shootings, and his success in dealing with these matters draws Bo's attention leading to Bo making a deal with Gio to be his meth cooker. A plan which Boyd derails by blowing up a shipment from Miami. After Bo finds out he exiles Boyd from his camp and kills all of Boyd's followers causing Boyd to question his mission and offers to help Raylan to stop Bo permanently. Bo takes Ava hostage to the Crowder cabin where he demands Raylan's life for Ava in order to appease the Miami cartel. Raylan and Boyd manage to kill Bo's guards and shoot Bo in the leg but Gio's niece and nephew arrive and they attack the house with machine guns. Bo is killed, while Boyd, Ava, and Raylan are trapped; the niece and nephew demand Raylan be turned over to them. After Boyd attempts to pass himself off as Raylan, Raylan tells him and Ava to leave out the back way, and he walks forward, hands in the air. As the niece and nephew step out to shoot him, Boyd shoots the nephew and the niece runs away. Boyd wants to go after her but Raylan stops him, saying it's against the law. However, Boyd absconds with Raylan's car, while neither using or facing violence. As Boyd rides off Raylan pulls his gun and pretends to shoot, essentially suggesting they'll always be allies and enemies.

Episodes Reception For the first season, the series received very positive reviews. TV Guide critic Matt Roush praised the show, particularly the acting of Olyphant, stating: \\"The show is grounded in Olyphant's low-key but high-impact star-making performance, the work of a confident and cunning leading man who's always good company.\\" Chicago Tribune critic Maureen Ryan also praised the series, writing: \\"The shaggily delightful dialogue, the deft pacing, the authentic sense of place, the rock-solid supporting cast and the feeling that you are in the hands of writers, actors and directors who really know what they're doing‚Äîall of these are worthy reasons to watch Justified.\\" Mike Hale of The New York Times praised the shows \\"modest virtues\\", but was critical of the first season's pace and characterisation, writing: \\"Justified can feel so low-key that even the crisis points drift past without making much of an impression... It feels as if the attention that should have gone to the storytelling all went to the atmosphere and the repartee.\\" =Awards= Justified received a 2010 Peabody Award.

The reliquary is part of the treasure kept in the Aachen Cathedral Treasury. Made in the Mosan region (the valley of the River Meuse), long a centre of high-quality metalwork, the bust is a masterpiece both of late Gothic metalwork and of figural sculpture. The Bust of Charlemagne, as a masterpiece of Mosan goldwork, initiated a height of silver-gilt naturalistic reliquary busts.Klaus Gereon Beuckers: Der Essener Marsusschrein. Aschendorff, M√ºnster 2006, , p. 30.  Description  Created 500 years after the death of Charlemagne, the bust is an idealized representation, the facial structure, hair style and fleur-de-lys crown of which reflect 14thc., not 9thc. tastes. The skin is chased with silver and partially gilt; hair and beard are gilt. Damascened silver Reichsadler, the heraldic charge of the Holy Roman Empire signifying Charlemagne's imperial dignity, decorate the tunic. The eagles are surrounded by a border of filigree and precious stones, some of which are ancient intaglios. The bust stands on an octagonal pedestal equipped with an opening on either side for a wooden carrying frame and is decorated with fleurs-de-lis.  History  According to the Aachen tradition, the Bust of Charlemagne was a donation from Charles IV, who was crowned king in Aachen Cathedral on 25 July 1349. This donation is not mentioned in documentary evidence, but it is considered probable, given Charles IV's deep veneration for Charlemagne. The reliquary is a part of the thirteenth-century French tradition of royal images and depicts an idealised portrait of the Frankish King, although it also has some rather individualised features. These are noticeably similar to a portrait of King John II of France. It is possible that the creator of the reliquary bust, a goldsmith in Aachen, had been trained in his art in France. The reliquary was carried in processions and placed opposite the king at coronations, who was spiritually affirmed in this way as a legitimate successor of Charlemagne. The use of ancient intaglios and cameos on the reliquary indicates the special significance of Ancient Rome to the medieval imperial ideology ‚Äì both Charlemagne and Charles IV saw their rule as part of that tradition. Recent historical research holds that it is very probable that Charles IV was crowned with the same crown which is worn by the reliquary ‚Äì since the Imperial Crown was then in the possession of Charles' rival Louis IV. It is probable that the hoop with its cross was added on the occasion of his coronation. Sigismund of Luxemburg was crowned with the same crown in 1414. A parallel to this crown is seen in the Crown of Saint Wenceslas in Prague, which decorated the reliquary containing the skullcap of St. Wenceslas and was used at Charles IV's coronation as King of Bohemia in 1347.  Symbolic significance and use  On account of its wide recognition value for the City of Aachen and its ideological and artistic significance, a stylised version of the Bust of Charlemagne serves as the central element in the signet of the Foundation of the International Charlemagne Prize of Aachen  Bibliography  * Birgitta Falk.

He is the lead rugby commentator for SKY Network Television and called his 300th test match between the All Blacks and France at Westpac Stadium on 16 June 2018. His career spans over 40 plus years. Nisbett was educated at Rongotai College in Wellington and captained the 1st XV in 1968. He played No.8 then moved in to prop while playing for his club Poneke in his later years. Nisbett played one first-class match for the Wellington Colts against Horowhenua in 1970. Nisbett also played club cricket to a 'modest level'. His radio career started in 1968 when he chose the NZBC over a physical education degree at Otago University. He frequently tells stories about playing sport on a Saturday, then rushing back to the radio studio to broadcast the weekend's results. Nisbett only played four matches of senior rugby before a clash with Saturday sports reporting became too much with his radio career and decided to give his playing days away. He continued his radio work and his first television commentary was a match between the All Blacks and France at Lancaster Park, Christchurch on 16 June 1984 and the shift to television then signaled a tricky period in his career as the doyen, Keith Quinn, was still on the scene, and in the early 1990s John McBeth also made the switch from radio. Three into one didn't go, even if TVNZ initially tried a two-commentator routine, when Quinn and Nisbett called the 1991 World Cup final. Quinn and Nisbett shared matches as the years went on with McBeth more going into a presenting role along with calling a handful of provincial matches. Nisbett became the lead commentator for rugby and cricket coverage when TVNZ had broadcast rights. When Sky Network Television claimed rights for both sports (rugby in 1996 and cricket in 1998), he then moved to Sky to continue his broadcasting and has been with them ever since. Nisbett is now a weekly commentator for Super Rugby and Mitre 10 Cup matches, All Blacks tests along with domestic and international cricket matches and occasionally softball, bowls and golf over the summer months. Nisbett was the lead commentator for Sky Sport during the 2011 Rugby World Cup and called the final with former All Black Grant Fox and former New Zealand cricketer Ian Smith, who was on the sideline. He was one of the Sky Sport commentators at the 2015 Rugby World Cup calling matches for New Zealand viewers along with Smith and former All Blacks Justin Marshall, Jeff Wilson and Andrew Mehrtens. He has been to five Rugby World Cups as a broadcaster. He also attends the All Black End of Year Tours and provides commentary for New Zealand audiences along with Justin Marshall, Tony Johnson or Ian Smith. Nisbett can be heard on Radio Trackside's Saturday morning sports programme with fellow TAB bookmaker Mark Stafford. He also provides the English commentary on all four Rugby Challenge video games beside Justin Marshall. He resides in Wellington and is the vice president of the Seatoun Bowling Club. In the 2018 Queen's Birthday Honours, Nisbett was appointed a Member of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to sports broadcasting.

The series was developed by Graham Yost based on Elmore Leonard's novels Pronto and Riding the Rap and his short story \\"Fire in the Hole\\". Its main character is Raylan Givens, a deputy U.S. Marshal. Timothy Olyphant portrays Givens, a tough federal lawman, enforcing his own brand of justice in his Kentucky hometown. The series is set in the city of Lexington, Kentucky, and the hill country of eastern Kentucky, specifically in and around Harlan. Plot Season two arc deals primarily with the criminal dealings of the Bennett clan. The season begins where the first left off. Raylan chases Boyd who is chasing Gio's niece who murdered Boyd's father Bo. Raylan catches up to both and he delivers Gio's critically wounded niece to Gio where a truce is struck between Gio and Raylan with Raylan's former boss threatening to kill Gio himself if Raylan dies. The Bennett family matriarch Mags Bennett (Margo Martindale) and her three sons Dickie (Jeremy Davies), Coover (Brad William Henke), and Bennett Police Chief Doyle (Joseph Lyle Taylor) run the criminal enterprises of Bennett County. However while Mags is secretly attempting to legitimize her family and give her grandchildren a ‚Äúlegacy deal‚Äù, Dickie and Coover attempt to expand, thus catching the ire of the Marshal Service and Raylan. Due to a long-standing feud between the Givens and Bennett families centering on an incident long ago and reignited in the current generation between Raylan and Dickie in their youth (an incident which left the latter with a lame leg), things begin to become very complicated, with their pasts catching up with them. Meanwhile, a depressed Boyd goes back to mining and attempts to legitimize himself, even informing on some crimes to Raylan. However, when a group threatens Ava, Boyd's reluctantly drawn back in to the criminal life. However he turns the tables on his partners, who were planning on killing him, by outsmarting them. Boyd steals some the heist money for Ava so she can save her house and he explains to her being a criminal; is just who he is. Mags's plan is revealed that she's using Dickie and Coover to buy land from the citizens of Bennett County who believe she's attempting to stop a mining conglomerate. The land is key for the conglomerate. Boyd figures out her plan and he helps Mags close her deal giving the Bennett family a portion of the mining conglomerate. In exchange Mags gives Boyd control of running crime in Harlan and Bennett County but only if Boyd stays out of the marijuana business. Angered by this, Dickie attempts to start his own criminal empire and threatens Boyd. Boyd recruits some of his friends and Arlo Givens and takes the weed business from Dickie. Dickie recognizes Arlo and kills Arlo's wife Helen in retaliation sparking Raylan's own desire for revenge and a further rift between father and son. After threatening to destroy Mags's deal, Raylan gets Dickie but is unable to kill him and sends him to jail instead. After Mags's deal is complete she gets someone else to confess to Dickie's crimes and tells Dickie that Doyle's children's future is safe and now she was again in charge in Bennett County. As the Bennetts and the Crowders go to war, Raylan attempts to keep the peace. Other stories include Raylan and Winona attempting a new relationship, Winona stealing money from the Marshal's evidence locker forcing Raylan to help her, Raylan discovering Winona's new husband put a hit out on them, and Art's growing lack of trust in Raylan. One other major component involves Mags murdering the father of Loretta McCready, a teenage girl that Mags sees a surrogate daughter. As the season progresses Raylan becomes determined to protect Loretta as she slowly finds out the truth.

Its Head Office is located in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, with regional offices in Dubai, Kuwait and the United Kingdom. Wilson Parasiuk was a director from 1994 to 2002. Kuwait The company designed, built, commissioned and initially operated the Royale Hayat Hospital which opened in November 2006. Turks and Caicos Islands FirstCaribbean International Bank arranged US$124 million financing for the Turks and Caicos Islands Hospitals Public Private Partnership Project. The company has a 25-year contract to run a hospital from April 2010 as part of the National Health System on the Turks and Caicos Islands. It built two surgical centres ‚Äî one in Provo with 20 beds and the other in Grand Turk with 10 beds ‚Äî under a public-private partnership for which they are paid $80 million annually. In January 2014, it was reported that a supplementary allocation of $6.2 million was required by the Ministry of Health to meet further cost of services delivery by the company. Their operation, which enables Canadians to travel to the Islands for treatment, has been criticised in Canada by Sandra Azocar, executive director of Friends of Medicare, who says: \\"Private clinics, whether in Canada or Turks and Caicos Island, distort the public system. They don‚Äôt save money; they fix no problem that the public system itself can‚Äôt fix; and they introduce a whole world of new problems.\\" United Arab Emirates The company runs a Trauma Centre at Rashid Hospital in Dubai. It developed the Shaikh Khalifa Medical City hospital in Abu Dhabi. United Kingdom The subsidiary company Interhealth Care Services (UK) Ltd ran the Kidderminster Independent Sector NHS Treatment Centre and the Cheshire & Merseyside NHS Treatment Centre in Halton from 2006 to 2011, which delivered over 30,000 orthopaedic procedures during that period. This was one of a number of Independent sector treatment centres established by the Labour Government to reduce waiting lists for elective surgery about which there was considerable controversy and an enquiry by the House of Commons Health Committee. Wyre Forest‚Äôs independent MP Richard Taylor reluctantly conceded in 2009 that the InterHealth centre located in an empty ward at Kidderminster Hospital (which he fought to keep open as an acute centre) had done a \\"very good job\\" replacing hips and knees, fast and well, without the high failure rate experienced elsewhere. The Merseyside centre was notable for the speed of construction. The first patients were admitted only 17 months from the start of design work on the ¬£44m construction project. Pressure was put on local GPs to refer patients to the centre, rather than to NHS hospitals, because the primary care trust had to pay for this activity whether or not it is used and, the contract was worth c¬£30million pa and generated operating profits for the company in excess of ¬£9m pa. When the contract finished the facility was taken over by Warrington & Halton Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust. This was in spite of the centre achieving the highest patient satisfaction ratings of all NHS providres, zero MRSA or C-diff in over 20,000 procedures, and a petition signed by over 10,000 to retain Interhealth Canada as the operator. Having paid around ¬£32 million to repurchase the building at the end of the five-year contract, the centre sat empty for several years. It has a contract to run Braintree Community Hospital from 2010 until 2015 with options to extend to 2017. This contract was sold to Serco.

It is the seat of the Diocese of the Rio Grande. In 2018 the cathedral church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.  History  St. John's was established in 1882. Land was purchased at the southeast corner of Fourth Street and Silver Avenue for $5,000 and the first church building was built that same year. It was a modest Gothic Revival building built from red Arizona sandstone and brick with a corner bell tower. The first service, led by Bishop George Kelly Dunlop, was held in November 1882 with 33 people in attendance. The Vestry of St. John's passed a resolution and the Convocation of 1920 approved the designation of St. John's as the cathedral church of the Missionary District of New Mexico and Southwest Texas for a one-year trial. Three years later new canons were adopted and the designation became official. The Very. Rev. Henry R.A. O‚ÄôMalley became dean and raised $25,000 for the Cathedral House, which was to house offices for the parish and the Missionary District. It was designed by Santa Fe architect John Gaw Meem and its cornerstone was placed on Easter Sunday, 1930. Meem was retained again in 1950 to design the new cathedral to replace the old church. Meem's design preserved the front and side entrances and bell tower from the old church while adding a much larger nave, executed in a modern Gothic style using brick and reclaimed stone. The groundbreaking was held the day after Easter in 1951 and the first services in the new cathedral were held on October 5, 1952. It was dedicated on November 11, 1952.

Known primarily for a trio of works about the Great Basin which mix folktales, fiction, sketches, and nature writing: In Miners' Mirage-Land (1904), The Loom of the Desert (1907) and The Land of Purple Shadows (1909). Biography Born in Moraga Valley, California in June 1855. She was the only daughter of Phebe and George Meacham. Idah Meacham moved as a child with her parents to Nevada in the 1860s. The family homesteaded a ranch in Lassen Meadows between Lovelock and Winnemucca (near present-day Rye Patch Reservoir in Pershing County). Her father established the Humboldt House hotel, hoping to capitalize on the newly completed Central Pacific Railroad line nearby. During her years at the Humboldt House, Idah was exposed to people from different backgrounds who later influenced the characters in her writings. As Anthony Amaral wrote, \\"What she wrote about she had seen through long tenure of living in the desert during the late 1860s to the turn of the century. Even more, she deeply felt what she had seen; the desperation of emigrants facing the most miserable part of their trek to Californian the barren face of Forty Mile Desert or Black Rock Desert; the fruitless wandering of prospectors in the hills; and Chinese and Indians livings as second-place people in the egocentricity of the white man's ways.\\" She moved back to California to attend Mills Seminary College, now known as Mills College, in Oakland California. After completing a degree at Mills Seminary in Oakland, California, Idah married James H. Strobridge. The young couple returned to Nevada and began ranching, but the life was hard on the Strobridge family. All three of their sons died at young ages. James also died, leaving Idah widowed and childless. She continued to ranch on also took up mining on her property. During this time in her life she took up writing and taught herself bookbinding as well. She left Nevada and moved to the Garvanaza neighborhood in Los Angeles, California. Her bungalow on 231 East Avenue 41 also housed her bindery, Artemesia Bindery, and her \\"Little Corner\\" gallery. Her residence became a popular place for writers, artists, and craftsmen.

The text reads: bid diri \\"peace and unity\\" Sarna sthals are sacred groves in the religious traditions of the Chota Nagpur Plateau region in the states of Jharkhand, Odisha, Assam, Chhattisgarh, Bihar and West Bengal. Followers of these rituals primarily belong to the Baiga, Kudumi Mahato, Ho, Kurukh, Munda and Santal. According to local belief, a Gram deoti or village deity resides in the sarna, where sacrifice is offered twice a year. In recent years many tribal and Kudumi Mahato organization have demanded a religious code for Sarna as Sarnaism, separate from Hinduism, as many tribals and Kudumi Mahato believe that they are nature worshippers. Etymology Sarna means \\"grove\\" and it is etymologically related to the name of the sal tree. Theology Adherents of Sarnaism believe in, worship, and revere a village deity as protector of village, who is called as Gaon khunt, Gram deoti, Dharmes, Marang Buru, Singbonga, or by other names by different tribes. Adherents also believe in, worship, and revere Dharti ayo or Chalapachho Devi, the mother goddess identified as the earth or nature. Worship places and rites Sarna worshippers Sarna is place of worship which is sacred grove. It is also called gram than, Jaher than or Jaher gar, and can be found in villages. Sal trees are in the sacred grove. The ceremonies are performed by the whole village community at a public gathering with the active participation of village priests, pahan. The chief assistant of village priest is called Naike. The sthal typically has multiple trees like sal, mahua, neem, and banyan. The main festival of Sarnaism is Sarhul, a festival in which devotees worship their ancestors. A legend among the Munda says a lion once ran after a man, who escaped by hiding in a bush. After the incident, he promised he would offer sakua flowers and leaves as well as a living animal. During the festival, the pahan brings three water pots to the sarna. If the water pots reduce in level, they believe the monsoon will fail, but if it stays the same the monsoon will come as normal. Men then offer sakua flowers and leaves.

He was elected four consecutive times in 2002, 2007, 2011 and 2015 as a Republican People's Party (CHP) MP for his hometown. He served as the CHP's parliamentary group deputy chairman for two terms. ƒ∞nce has stood for election as CHP chairman twice against current chairman Kemal Kƒ±lƒ±√ßdaroƒülu: first in September 2014 following the party's loss in the Turkish presidential election on 18 August 2014, and later in February 2018. As the presidential candidate of the CHP in the 2018 Turkish presidential election, Ince received just over 30 percent of the votes, placing second behind outright first-round winner Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan, with 53 percent. Biography ƒ∞nce was born in the village of Elmalƒ±k in the province of Yalova as the son of ≈ûerif and Zekiye ƒ∞nce. His paternal grandparents originated from modern-day Drama in Greek Macedonia, his maternal grandparents originated from Rize on the Black Sea coast of Anatolia. He graduated from Balƒ±kesir University, Necatibey Faculty of Education, Physics- Chemistry and later worked as a physics teacher and a school principal. Later, he worked as the Head of Press for football club Yalovaspor. He was elected as president of the Atat√ºrkist Thought Association, a secular organization that espouses the ideas of Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk, the founder of modern Turkey. He is married to √úlk√º with whom he has a son named Salih Arda. Politics ƒ∞nce has been known in Turkish politics as one of the fiercest voices of the main opposition since 2002, against the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) of Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan. He became well known through his speeches which were widely shared on the internet . Following the election of CHP parliamentary group leaders Kemal Kƒ±lƒ±√ßdaroƒülu and as party leader and deputy leader respectively, ƒ∞nce ran for group leadership and was elected with 58 votes. He was re-elected in 2011 and 2013 and before resigning in August 2014.http://www.ntv.com.tr/arsiv/id/25451438http://www.aa.com.tr/tr/rss/197725 --chp-grup-baskanvekilleri-belli-oldu He was replaced by Levent G√∂k. On 30 March 2014, Turkey held local elections, and the elections in Yalova were won narrowly by ƒ∞nce's party, the CHP. However, the elections in Yalova were to be contested again. ƒ∞nce played a crucial role in the process and the CHP's candidate, Vefa Salman, won the second election as well. On 18 August 2014, ƒ∞nce declared his candidacy for CHP chairmanship but lost the scrutiny during the 18th Republican People's Party Extraordinary Convention in September 2014. He once again stood against Kƒ±lƒ±√ßdaroƒülu for party leadership in the 36th CHP Ordinary Convention in February 2018, but his bid once again was unsuccessful. He received 447 votes from delegates, as opposed to Kƒ±lƒ±√ßdaroƒülu's 790 votes. ƒ∞nce was revealed to be the presidential candidate of the Republican People's Party (CHP) on 3 May 2018. The following day, party leader Kemal Kƒ±lƒ±√ßdaroƒülu formally proclaimed the CHP's support for ƒ∞nce and his candidacy was formally announced. Shortly thereafter, the CHP began preparations for the campaign season, launching the production of campaign materials and merchandise. It was revealed in early May that ƒ∞nce's campaign would adopt the slogan ‚ÄúT√ºrkiye‚Äôye g√ºvence Muharrem ƒ∞nce‚Äù, roughly translating to \\"Muharrem ƒ∞nce, an assurance to Turkey\\", and that it would be kicked off with an election rally in his home city of Yalova on 5 May. President Erdoƒüan subsequently beat ƒ∞nce in the first round of the presidential election, receiving 52.6% of votes. ƒ∞nce received 30.64% of votes. After the 37th CHP Ordinary Convention, it was claimed that ƒ∞nce would be founding a new political party, called the National Party, in September. He founded his political platform named \\"Country Movement in a Thousand Days\\" in september, while still being a member of the Republican People's Party.

Education After initially dropping out of university to work for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, Couture went back to school later in life. He received his Bachelor of Arts degree in Sociology in 2010, and a Bachelor of Arts degree in Criminology in 2016, both from Western University. Early career Couture began working for the CBC‚Äôs radio program IDEAS in 1994. His first assignment was to investigate a police investigation into the gay community in his hometown of London, Ontario. His work on the project was the subject of a feature-length \\"analysis\\" piece called the \\"Kiddie Porn Ring That Wasn‚Äôt\\" in The Globe and Mail on March 11, 1995 by then Ryerson journalism instructor Gerald Hannon. The piece reported on how Couture had uncovered the fact that the London police were using the guise of a child pornography ring to harass the gay community in London and throughout the province of Ontario. Hannon‚Äôs piece also reported on the extensive harassment of Couture by the local constabulary. Such persecution of a Canadian journalist was unprecedented and Couture was granted the Hellman- Hammett Award from the group Human Rights Watch in New York in 1996.The Guelph Mercury, May 12, 2004 http://www.stephenwilliamsbooks.com/html/hellman- hammett.html http://www.ifex.org/canada/1995/03/13/journalist_joseph_couture_threatened/ At the time, Couture was the only journalist in Canada to have won the award. Hannon‚Äôs piece in the Globe provoked such a public outcry on both sides, that both Hannon and Couture were named amongst the top newsmakers of the year. Couture eventually went on to work for CBC television as an investigative reporter for their flagship program \\"the fifth estate\\". While there he specialized in forensic pathology and unsolved homicide cases. He also worked for the programs Witness and Newsworld before leaving for a freelance career as a writer in 1998. Later career Couture published his first book, \\"Peek: Inside the Private World of Public Sex\\" in 2008 under the imprint of New York publisher Haworth Press. The book was surprisingly successful for the subject matter and made it onto the Amazon best-seller list in Canada, the United States, Australia and the U.K. He offers regular commentary on the issue of public sex whenever called upon by the media to do so and has appeared in Esquire Magazine, The Advocate, The New York Post and the National Post,The National Post, \\"Larry Craig‚Äôs Problem is Not Unique\\" by Joseph Couture, Sept 1, 2007. amongst others. In press interviews promoting the release of \\"Peek\\", Couture set off a firestorm of controversy and criticism in New York after calling gays pushing for same-sex marriage \\"Borg Homosexuals\\" who wanted to assimilate everyone and turn gays into boring and indistinguishable drones. The popular gay website JoeMyGod highlighted his remarks and the comments lit up with vicious personal attacks on Couture ranging from petty remarks about his appearance to more vitriolic statements that Couture was going to enjoy being raped in prison.http://www.joemygod.com/2008/06/13/homoquotable-joseph- couture/ In late 2019, he requested the publishing house that currently carried the ttile, Routledge, to revert rights back to him. His request was granted and he pulled \\"Peek\\" from sale across all platforms. He wrote in the National Post gay marriage didn't simply mean equal, it meant the same and that was just boring National Post, July 9, 2015, Joseph Couture, \\"Gays don't know what they've lost by winning same-sex marriage ruling.\\" He said gays had lost touch with all sense of their historical roots and did not understand changing attitudes about the role of \\"real men\\" and masculinity and were basically bad knock-offs of what they thought straight men acted like. Couture continued his cultural analysis of trends in the gay community by writing in a Toronto magazine that the Internet was the worst thing to ever happen to gay men. He argued that they now lived essentially nothing but empty virtual sex lives because men seemed to only feel safe hidden behind a computer screen and an anonymous profile Now Magazine, July 17, 2017, Joseph Couture, \\"Why the internet is the worst thing to ever happen to gay lib\\". He declared the \\"post- gay-lib world\\" an increasingly sexual desert and cultural wasteland Now Magazine, July 17, 2017, Joseph Couture, \\"Why the internet is the worst thing to ever happen to gay lib\\". In the same article he argued there is no such thing as a \\"gay community.\\" He said they had nothing in common with each other except with whom they sometimes slept and no bond or special allegiance to each other. He said in 1995 he no longer cared to work with many gay activists because collectively they had turned their backs on runaway and throwaway gay youth. While some people seemed to take particular note of his \\"radical\\" views on the gay movement, he found himself repeatedly caught in controversies over what he thought were simple issues. The decade of 2000 to 2010 proved somewhat baffling to him.Eye Weekly, Toronto, February 6, 2003, page 12 He wrote on many issues ranging from the environment, poverty, mental health, criminal justice, censorship and whatever else struck him as important and it began to look like no matter what he wrote about or said, it seemed to anger just about everyone. He said they were not correctly called controversies because a controversy requires two or more sides, and there seemed to only be one side, those who disagreed with him. He grew increasingly confused as time went on because even when he wrote in support or defense of some issue in calm and conventional ways, the very people he was trying help were the first to target him with extreme criticism Eye Weekly, Toronto, July 15, \\"You Can't Eat Awareness\\", Joseph Couture Couture has publicly discussed the fact that he has completed two other books and has large sections of third manuscript in draft form. The first two books are about his early life which is known to have been difficult. Plans were in the works to publish the first book a few times, but publication by a traditional publishing house never happened for a variety of reasons. He released it briefly in early 2013 as an e-book, only to remove it weeks later. It was reviewed rather extensively during its short life, sometimes favorably, sometimes not. Paul Bellini of Fab Magazine loved the book and said it was a must-read for all journalism students and gay activists alike. He described the book as \\"Dickensian in its scope and squalor\\" and said it \\"burns every bridge Couture ever walked across.Fab Magazine Cut-Throat Confessions January 30, 2013, by Paul Bellini Couture says in the book that he ultimately never could decide whether he found it \\"harder to be lonely at the top, or lonely at the bottom.\\" Personal life In his book \\"Peek: Inside the Private World of Public Sex\\" he describes himself as \\"definitely gay\\" but also with \\"some curiosity about women.\\" He writes that he previously believed himself to be \\"one hundred percent gay\\", but he realized his attraction to both men and women after viewing heterosexual pornography. Couture told a reporter from a Boston magazine in 2015 that he had finally concluded that labels were for soup cans, not human sexuality.The Guide Magazine, Boston, May issue 2015, by Will Knott, page 16 He then mentioned in passing that he recently had a brief polyamorous group relationship with two other bisexual men and a heterosexual woman.

The series was developed by Graham Yost based on Elmore Leonard's novels Pronto and Riding the Rap and his short story \\"Fire in the Hole\\". Its main character is Raylan Givens, a deputy U.S. Marshal. Timothy Olyphant portrays Givens, a tough federal lawman, enforcing his own brand of justice in his Kentucky hometown. The series is set in the city of Lexington, Kentucky, and the hill country of eastern Kentucky, specifically in and around Harlan. Plot Season three introduces Robert Quarles (Neal McDonough), an exiled Detroit Mob player with plans to control the Oxycontin trade in Kentucky. The season begins with Raylan recovering from being shot in the standoff with the Bennetts. Boyd gets himself arrested in order to murder Dickie but stops when he learns Ellstin Limehouse (Mykelti Williamson), the protector of Noble's Holler, is holding Dickie‚Äôs inheritance. Quarles allies himself with local enforcer for the Dixie Mafia Wynn Duffy (Jere Burns) and begins to muscle in on the local criminals, successfully supplanting them until Raylan begins investigating. Quarles' efforts also bring him into conflict with Boyd's group resulting in the deaths of several local individuals. The conflict between Boyd and Quarles heats up when Errol, Limehouse‚Äôs lieutenant, makes it appear that Quarles attacked Boyd‚Äôs own attempt to take over the Oxycontin trade. Limehouse discovers this and reluctantly agrees to make sure Boyd and Quarles destroy each other by pretending to work with both sides. Meanwhile Raylan and Winona‚Äôs relationship comes to a sudden end when Winona runs off saying Raylan cared more about the job. Raylan focuses his efforts on taking down Quarles especially after Quarles attempts to frame Raylan for the murder of Winona‚Äôs ex-husband. Quarles attempts to gain the upper hand by buying off Harlan County Sheriff Napier but Boyd retaliates by running Shelby Parlow (Jim Beaver), a man who owes Boyd his life, in the election. Even though Napier wins the election, Shelby becomes Sheriff because Boyd essential rigged the outcome to disqualify Napier. With Napier out, Quarles is ruined and goes to Limehouse for protection. Limehouse agrees and attempts to play his end game to get Quarles killed and Boyd arrested by Raylan. However Boyd sees through the plan, which results in State Trooper Tom Bergen, a friend of Raylan‚Äôs, getting killed. Boyd, angry at Limehouse, threatens him only for Limehouse to reveal to Raylan about a murder Boyd committed. Quarles makes a desperation deal with Theo Tonin (Adam Arkin), the head of the Detroit Mob, to come home and attempts to rob Limehouse but Limehouse slices his arm off. Raylan accuses Quarles of killing Bergen only for Quarles to laugh and reveal Arlo killed Bergen. Arlo confesses to his crimes and confesses to the crimes Boyd is accused of which sets Boyd free. The season ends with Raylan confiding in Winona that he‚Äôs not sure if Arlo shot the Trooper to protect Boyd or because he simply saw a cop in a hat. Other stories include Dickie‚Äôs own attempts claim his inheritance from Limehouse only to eventually learn Loretta McCready was given the money as part of Mags‚Äôs final wishes and Ava becomes a larger part of Boyd‚Äôs empire by taking over a local brothel after killing an abusive pimp.

In 1866, after a disagreement with the Eberhardts, Magirus founded his own fire equipment company. In 1887, Magirus passed control of the company to his sons Heinrich, Otto and Hermann. He died in 1895. There are streets named after him in Ulm, Stuttgart and Berlin. In 1911, the company became \\"C. D. Magirus AG\\". This company later became \\"Magirus-Deutz\\" and, today, is part of Iveco Magirus.

It is sometimes called a cottonwood. This hybrid is also sometimes planted as a shade tree, and occasionally escapes from cultivation. This hybrid is also known by the synonyms Populus √ó andrewsii Sargent, P. √ó bernardii Boivin, Populus candicans W. Aiton, P. √ó dutillyi Lepage, P. √ó generosa Henry, P. √ó gileadensis Rouleau, and P. manitobensis Dode. The parental balsam poplar, P. balsamifera, is also known as P. tacamahaca and P. trichocarpa, and is widespread in boreal North America. The name Populus candicans has been variously used for either P. balsamifera or P. √ó jackii; it is currently considered a synonym of P. balsamifera.  Fragrant resin  The tree is named after the unrelated biblical Balm of Gilead, a Commiphora resin. Its leaf buds are coated with a resinous sap with a strong, pleasant turpentine or balsam odor that is most evident as the leaves unfold in the spring. For purposes of commerce, the buds are collected before they open, and can be cut up for pot-pourri or used in herbal medicine. Like other poplars, balm-of-Gilead is expected to contain salicin in its bark, and in relation to traditional herbal treatment have been regarded as antiscorbutic, antiseptic, balsamic, diuretic, expectorant, stimulant and tonic.  Other considerations  As a hybrid, the tree does not breed true; it will also hybridize with other poplars in the area. Seeds must be sown within days of ripening in the spring or lose viability. It is sown on the surface or lightly covered in trays on a cold frame. Despite the tree's fragrance, the wood is \\"soft, rather woolly in texture\\", and lacks odor or taste, and is of relatively low flammability. A rooting hormone has been collected by soaking its chopped up shoots in water for a day.

Wynn Duffy is ordered by the Detroit Mob to find Thompson and in turn he offers Boyd a partnership in the heroin trade which leads to a showdown between Crowder's gang and the Marshals. At the same time, cousin Johnny (David Meunier) grows ever more resentful of Boyd's success and plans to betray him by promising Duffy he'd find Thompson himself. Boyd, after proposing to Ava, is brought to an unexpected crossroads that threatens his personal or professional destruction.

Tom Gliatto of People Weekly praised this season, writing: \\"What gives the show its kick is the gleefully childish lack of repentance shown by most of these rascals‚Äîcountered by Olyphant's coolly amused control.\\" Verne Gay of Newsday praised this season also, writing: \\"Character‚Äîas the old saying goes‚Äîis a long-standing habit, and their habits remain very much intact. The same could be said of Justified.\\", and Chuck Bowen of Slant Magazine praised this season, writing: \\"Justified is the strongest, liveliest, and most tonally accurate adaptation of the writer's work to date, and the latest season bracingly suggests that isn't likely to change anytime soon.\\" =Ratings= The fourth season averaged 2.434 million viewers and a 0.9 rating in the 18‚Äì49 demographic.

In a racing career which lasted from October 1978 until September 1980 he won five of his seventeen races. After showing promising form as a two-year-old he emerged as a top-class middle- distance performer in 1979, winning the Prix de la C√¥te Normande in France but showing his best form in England, where he finished third in both The Derby and the Eclipse Stakes before recording his most important victory in the Champion Stakes. He remained in training as a four-year-old with mixed success, running several moderate races but defeating the outstanding filly Three Troikas in the Prix Dollar. He was retired to stud and became a very successful sire of steeplechasers. He died in 2007 at the advanced age (for a Thoroughbred) of thirty-one. Background Northern Baby was a small, lightly-built chestnut horse with a narrow white blaze, two white socks and one white coronet, bred by the Kinghaven Farm Stud in Ontario. He was one of many important winners sired by the Canadian-bred Northern Dancer, who won the Kentucky Derby in 1964 before becoming one of the most successful breeding stallions in Thoroughbred history. He was the first foal of Two Rings, a tough and consistent racemare who won nine of her thirty-one races including the Nassau Stakes. Two Rings was great-granddaughter of the broodmare Gallita, whose other descendants included Nadir, Mashaallah and Mark of Esteem. As a yearling, the colt was offered for sale at Keeneland and was bought for $120,000 by representatives of Anne-Marie d'Estainville. He was sent to race in Europe where he was trained by Fran√ßois Boutin at Chantilly and ridden in most of his major races by Philippe Paquet. Racing career=1978: two- year-old season= Northern Baby did not appear on the racecourse until October 1978 when he was one of eighteen two-year-olds to contest a maiden race over 1600 metres at Saint-Cloud Racecourse and won by one and a half lengths. Later that month he was moved up sharply in class when he was sent to England for the Group One William Hill Futurity over one mile at Doncaster Racecourse. He started third favourite, but was never in contention and finished eighth behind the Irish-trained Sandy Creek. =1979: three-year-old season= Northern Baby began his three-year-old season by winning a minor race over 2100m at Saint-Cloud and was then beaten one length by the Alec Head-trained Wolverton in the Prix de Suresnes over 2000m at Longchamp Racecourse. On 20 May, Northern Baby started the 17/4 second favourite for the Group Three Prix La Force, but was again beaten by a runner from the Head stable, finishing second by a head to Fabulous Dancer. On 6 June, Northern Baby started at 66/1 outsider for the 200th running of the Derby Stakes over one and a half miles at Epsom Downs Racecourse. He raced just behind the leader before turning into the straight in third place before moving up to dispute the lead with two furlongs left to run. He was quickly overtaken by Troy and Dickens Hill but stayed on to finish third, beaten seven lengths and three lengths. Northern Baby returned to England for one of Britain's most prestigious weight-for-age races, the Eclipse Stakes over ten furlongs at Sandown Park Racecourse and finished third behind Dickens Hill and Crimson Beau. In August, the colt was dropped in class for the Group Three Prix de la C√¥te Normande at Deauville Racecourse in which he started second favourite behind Wolverton. Northern Baby won the race easily by two and a half lengths from Lord Zara, with Wolverton in fourth. Northern Baby began his autumn campaign in the Prix du Prince d'Orange over 2000m at Longchamp in September, in which he was beaten half a length and a head by the four-year-old colt Rusticaro and the five-year-old mare Trillion. On 7 October Northern Baby started a 90/1 outsider for the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. Ridden by the Irish jockey Pat Eddery he briefly took the lead in the straight before fading to finish sixth of the twenty-two runners behind Three Troikas, Le Marmot, Troy, Pevero and Trillion. Two weeks after his run in the Arc, Northern Baby was sent to England for the third time to contest the Group One Champion Stakes over ten furlongs at Newmarket Racecourse. Paquet resumed his partnership with the colt, who started at odds of 9/1 in a field of fourteen runners which included Ela-Mana-Mou, Lyphard's Wish and the French-trained filly Producer (winner of the Prix de l'Op√©ra and the Prix de la For√™t) who started favourite. Northern Baby moved up to dispute the lead two furlongs and always looked the likely winner. In the closing stages he held off a challenge from the five-year-old Town And Country to win by one and a half lengths, with Haul Knight a neck away in third and Lyphard's Wish in fourth place. =1980: four- year-old season= Northern Baby began his third season in the Group One Prix Ganay and Longchamp on 4 May in which he was ridden by Eddery and finished third behind Le Marmot and Three Troikas. On 1 June he met Three Troikas again in the Prix Dollar over 1950m at the same course. Ridden by Paquet, he started the 5.3/1 favourite and won by a length from Strong Gale, with the Arc winner two and a half lengths away in third place. In the Prix d'Ispahan at the end of the month he finished fourth after setting the pace for the winner Nadjar, who raced in the same ownership. In August, the colt was sent to England again, but failed to reproduce his form of 1979, finishing unplaced behind Master Willie in the Benson and Hedges Gold Cup at York. A month later, Northern Baby was brought back in distance for the Prix du Moulin over 1600m at Longchamp and finished fifth behind Kilijaro. Two weeks later, Northern Baby showed something of a return to form as he finished third behind Dunette and Three Troikas in the Prix du Prince d'Orange, but did not race again. Assessment In 1978 the independent Timeform organisation gave Northern Baby a rating of 109, twenty-five pounds below their top-rated two-year-old Tromos. In the following year he was rated 127 by Timeform, ten pounds below the top-rated racehorse Troy. In the official International Classification he was rated thirteen pounds below the top-rated Three Troikas. As a four-year- old, Northern Baby was rated 119 by Timeform, eighteen pounds below the top- rated Moorestyle. In the International Classification he was rated eight pounds behind Moorestyle and seven pounds inferior to the top-rated older horse Ela-Mana-Mou. Stud record Northern Baby was retired to stud to begin his career as a breeding stallion at the Grangewilliam Stud near Maynooth in County Kildare. In 1982, he was moved to Stone Farm in Kentucky, where he became \\"buddies\\" with the Kentucky Derby winner Gato Del Sol. He sired several top-class flat race performances, but had his greatest success as a sire of steeplechasers. His best winners included: *Baby Turk, 1982, won Grand Prix de Deauville *Highland Bud, 1985 American Champion Steeplechase Horse, won two runnings of the Breeders' Cup Steeplechase *Michelozzo, 1986, won St Leger *Warm Spell, 1988, American Champion Steeplechase Horse *Possibly Perfect, 1990, American Champion Female Turf Horse, won Yellow Ribbon Invitational Stakes, Santa Ana Handicap, Gamely Handicap, Ramona Handicap, Beverly D.

She was not only known as a physician but also as a politician and an author. She and her husband Cornelius McKane contributed an important part in medical history. She opened the first school of nurse training for black people in Savannah. She also helped her husband to make his dream which was opening the Hospital in Liberia come true. After returning from Liberia, they established the MCKane Hospital for Women and Children and later was known as Charity Hospital to treat for all people in Savannah, especially for African American people.  Childhood and education  McKane was born February 12, 1865 Bridgewater, Pennsylvania. Her parents, who were Charles and Elizabeth Fraiser Woodby, died before she reached the age of seven and she lost her vision for three years. Alice attended to the public Schools and Hampton Institute in Virginia. As an undergraduate student of the Institute for Colored Youth, which later became Cheyney University of Pennsylvania, she was a secretary of the principal Fannie Coppin. She graduated from the Institute for Colored Youth in Philadelphia and entered to the Woman's Medical College of Pennsylvania in 1889. In 1892, she graduated and received a medical degree with high honors.  Career =Medical practice= Alice moved to Augusta, Georgia where she taught at the Haines Normal and Industrial Institute, now the Lucy Craft Laney High School. She met her husband, Cornelius McKane who was the grandson of a Liberian King, and moved with him to his physician's practice in Savannah. She was the only black female physician in Georgia in 1892. In 1893, the couple opened the McKane Training School for Nurses, a school for black nurses and the first one of its kind in Southeast Georgia. The first two-year course of the school was begun on September 1, 1893. She worked as a principal of the school. Students who wanted to apply to this course were required to pass a test about English, mathematic, and geography. This course provided all necessary knowledges about anatomy, physiology, hygiene, midwifery, therapeutic, and chemistry to prepared students to be nurses. The course was completed in May 1895. After finishing the first course, her husband decided to go back to Africa. The McKane Training School for Nurses were taken by William Christopher Blackman. They went to New York to prepare food and medical supplies to their trip to Liberia on June 5, 1895. In August 1895, they opened the first hospital along with a drugstore and a nurse training school in Monrovia, Liberia. By requiring of U.S. Government, Alice was chosen to do health examination for black Civil War veterans who came to Liberia from America. In 1896, she contracted African fever. She and her husband were forced to return to America. They came back to Savannah in February 1896. She continued to develop the MCKane Training School for Nurses and establish the MCKane Hospital for Women and Children. In 1901, the hospital was changed the name to the Charity Hospital. = Writing and political practice = In 1909, Alice and her husband moved to Boston for better educational opportunities for their children. After her husband‚ÄîCornelius McKane died at age fifty in 1912, Alice continued her medical career and also engaged to political activities and writing. She participated in the women's suffrage movement. She was a Republican committee woman and a member of the National Associate for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). She published two books.

Craftley has never met her before, but his side partner Jack McGoff (Santschi) has a photograph of Muriel from her previous life in Alaska under the name Cora Lamont. McGoff had deceived her by marrying her although he already had a living wife. He then forced her into the job as a dance hall girl. She escaped by shooting him in self-defense and then fleeing Alaska. Without knowing these details but guessing some general circumstances, Craftley works on her fears until she induces her husband to go out West to inspect the salted claim. McGoff stays behind and visits Muriel's home at night, and she permits him to enter her boudoir.

The early CCNV community relied heavily on George Washington University for people and resources. After the Paulist Fathers approved the community, Guinan was joined by six people from GWU. The community met at the Newman Center on GWU's campus and planned numerous protests. Guinan's statement of purpose at this time was \\"to resist the violent; to gather the gentle; to help free compassion and mercy and truth from the stockades of our empire.\\" Shortly after its founding, in 1972, the CCNV turned to running a soup kitchen near the White House, Zacchaeus Community Kitchen.Sutton, Robert P.

CCNV says they fed 200 to 300 homeless people a day, seven days a week.http://www.theccnv.org/history.htm In 1982, CCNV staged a protest in Lafayette Park across from the White House. The Department of Interior refused CCNV a permit to occupy Lafayette Park. The CCNV took it to court and lost on appeal. CCNV activists staged a homeless campy anyway and dubbed it \\"Reaganville.\\" On Thanksgiving, 1982, six hundred homeless individuals arrived for a traditional dinner. CCNV continues to sponsor an annual Thanksgiving dinner for the homeless. The meal was first served in Lafayette Park, across from the White House, and later moved to the grounds of the U.S. Capitol. Later, CCNV activists, headed by Mitch Snyder, entered and occupied an abandoned federal building and housed hundreds overnight while demanding that the government renovate the building. The Reagan administration agreed to lease the federal property to CCNV for $1 a year. On November 4, 1984, after Snyder fasted to draw attention to the plight of the homeless, President Ronald Reagan ordered the renovation of CCNV‚Äôs shelter. A $14 million renovation was completed in 1988. References Category:Charities based in Washington, D.C.

Linck (born November 10, 1963) is employed as a lobbyist and consultant with Mullenix and Associates, LLC in Little Rock, Arkansas. He was formerly the chief of legislative and governmental affairs for the Arkansas Department of Human Services in the capital city of Little Rock, Arkansas. Before this, Linck was a tourism official in Yellville in Marion County in northern Arkansas and a Republican former member of the Arkansas House of Representatives. He represented District 99, encompassing parts of Marion, Searcy, Boone, and Baxter counties, from 2013 to June 3, 2016. Linck previously represented District 86, held by Democrat Greg Leding of Fayetteville, from 2011 to 2013. Background A resident of Flippin in Marion County, Linck is the son of Ike and Velma Linck. His grandfather operated the White River ferry crossing near Cotter in Baxter County before the building of the R.M. Ruthvin Rainbow Arch Bridge. Linck graduated c. 1981 from Yellville‚ÄìSummit High School in Yellville. In 1986, he procured a bachelor's degree in business administration from Arkansas Tech University in Russellville in Pope County. He is the executive director of the Ozark Mountain Region Tourism Association, Inc., having been affiliated with the organization since 2001. From 1992 to 2005, he operated Rivercliff Cabins and Fishing Service. He has also been a manager for J. B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc. He has served on the North Central Arkansas Regional Economic Development Committee. Linck was formerly the president of the White/Norfork Rivers Outfitters Association and the Chamber of Commerce in Bull Shoals. He is United Methodist and affiliated with Rotary International. Political life Linck lost a bid for the District 86's House seat in 2006. He ran again for that seat in 2010 and defeated the Democrat Wesley Smith 6,835 votes to 3,510 votes for the right to succeed the term-limited Democrat Monty Davenport. In 2012, Linck was redistricted to District 99 for his second legislative term. He defeated the Independent candidate, Anton Such, 8,892 votes to 2,528 votes. No Democrat contested the seat in 2012. Linck served on the Arkansas Legislative Council and the House committees on (1) Public Health, Welfare and Labor, (2) State Agencies, and (3) Rules. In 2013, then-Representative Linck co-sponsored the proposed spending cap on the state budget, but the bill failed by a two-vote margin in the House. He joined the majority to override the vetoes of Democratic Governor Mike Beebe to enact legislation to require photo identification for casting a ballot in Arkansas and to ban abortion after twenty weeks of gestation. He was a co-sponsor of both of these measures. Linck also supported legislation to outlaw abortion whenever fetal heartbeat is detected and to forbid the inclusion of abortion in the state insurance exchange. He did not vote on the measure to make the death of a fetus a felony in certain cases. He co-sponsored allowing university officials to carry concealed weapons on campus. He supported a law permitting religious institutions to allow the carrying of concealed weapons in places of worship. He voted against reducing the application fee for obtaining a concealed carry permit. Linck voted to prohibit the governor from regulating firearms during an emergency. He voted to prohibit the closing of schools based on a two-year pupil enrollment analysis. He voted to establish a tiered system of lottery scholarships. Linck voted for legislation to make the office of prosecuting attorney in Arkansas nonpartisan. He voted for the bill, signed by Governor Beebe, to permit the sale of up to five hundred gallons per month of unpasteurized whole milk directly from the farm to consumers. Linck resigned from the Arkansas House of Representatives on June 3, 2016 to join the Arkansas Department of Health and Human Services. In September 2019, Linck announced that he would be stepping down from his post at Arkansas Department of Health and Human Services effective October 4, 2019 to allow him to take a position with Little Rock lobbying firm Mullenix & Associates. Mullenix & Associates are based in Little Rock and assist corporate clients (e.g. Blue Cross & Blue Shield) who serve Medicaid recipients in Arkansas. It was not immediately clear whether Linck's new position with the lobbying firm Mullenix & Associates would represent a conflict of interest in view of his previous position with the state's Department of Human Services. Chief Counsel David Sterling suggests that Linck should avoid all involvement with cases involving clients of Mullenix & Associates during his remaining tenure with the state (through October 4, 2019). Further, 2015 Arkansas Code ¬ß 19-11-709 places restrictions on the employment of former employees and has been cited in this case as well as another concurrent case of another Arkansas DHS official who is leaving for private sector employment. ¬ß 19-11-709 prohibits a state employee from acting \\"as a principal or as an agent for anyone other than the state\\" in connection with any matter in which the employee participates \\"personally and substantially.\\" The law also prohibits former employees and partners of former employees from being involved as a \\"principal or agent for anyone other than the state\\" regarding any state contract in which that employee provided \\"decision, approval, disapproval, recommendation, rendering of advice, investigation, or otherwise while an employee.\\" The law also bars former state employees for one year from acting for a private company in connection with contracts that were within the person's \\"official responsibility\\" while employed by the state. It is unclear whether Linck is quoted as promising to \\"have that discussion\\" with his new employers once he begins his tenure with them. Legislators in Arkansas face a two-year cooling off period before becoming lobbyists. Linck left his previous position as a Legislator in June 2016 to work for the Department of Human Services until October 2019, when he will become a lobbyist.

He settled in Atlanta and married there. Her mother, Mary Jane Thompson, was involved in social clubs and outreach in Atlanta, where Nellie grew up. During the Civil War, Nellie helped her mother provide aid to wounded soldiers at various local hospitals.  Activism  After graduating from Brooke Hall in Pennsylvania, Nellie Peters returned to Atlanta. She soon convinced city officials to build drinking fountains for horses exhausted from the summer heat; it was one of her first examples of civic activism. Nellie Peters Black, from an 1895 publication. In 1877, Nellie married George Robinson Black who served as a state senator and later in Congress. Soon after he died of a stroke, Nellie Black became more active in civic reform in Atlanta. Stemming from her interest in public health, Black helped create the King's Daughters Hospital, the first free hospital in Atlanta. Black also served as the Vice President of the Atlanta Anti-Tuberculosis and Visiting Nurse Association, which provided free treatment to both black and white people in the highly segregated society established after the Reconstruction era. She worked to increase educational opportunities, especially for women. Black was an active member of the Atlanta Woman's Club as well as the Woman's Auxiliary of the Episcopal Diocese of Georgia.

The district will consist of eight venues: the Grand Texas Theme Park, Big Rivers Water Park, a retail center called Grove Factory Outlet, Downtown Texas, Speedsportz Racing Park, Grand Texas Sportsplex, Gator Bayou Adventure Park, and Grand Texas RV Resort. Background and history Leaders of the Grand Texas project hoped the district and park would fill a void left by Six Flags AstroWorld's closure in 2005. Original plans focused on the amusement and water parks, but in November 2013 project leaders announced an expanded entertainment district called the Grand Texas Sports and Entertainment District. Land for the district was closed on during the summer of 2013. The first phase of construction, scheduled to begin in early 2014, was to include clearing land and building infrastructure. Big Rivers Water Park was scheduled to open in April 2015. Grand Texas Theme Park was scheduled to open in December 2015. However, plans for the opening were delayed to 2020. The site of Grand Texas was cleared out in 2015 to begin construction. Construction on the RV Resort began in 2015 and was finished on August 6, 2016, while construction on Speedsportz finished in winter 2016. Construction on Big Rivers is expected to begin in August 2017 and finish in spring 2018 while Grand Texas Sportsplex is expected to be finished in winter 2018.

Comprising millions of DEA reports and records on individuals, NADDIS is a system by which intelligence analysts, investigators and others in law enforcement retrieve reports from the DEA's Investigative Filing and Reporting System (IFRS). NADDIS is thought to have become the most widely used, if least known, tool in drug law enforcement. The database has been described by DEA as a \\"pointer index\\" by which records on millions of individuals, many with no criminal history, can be reviewed quickly to locate complete reports on a subject of interest, their address or phone number. NADDIS checks and individuals A NADDIS check is the first step in any criminal drug inquiry and reveals the existence of any prior reports of investigation or mention in any file of an individual, business, airfield, plane, vessel or phone number. The existence of a NADDIS record on an individual has been employed to provide probable cause for airport searches, surveillance and home entries. By contrast, the absence of a NADDIS record has been grounds for permitting bond for criminal defendants. NADDIS also is routinely used by DEA and other agencies to conduct background checks on prospective employees, contractors and informants, with a NADDIS check in one instance revealing a DEA database contractor's prior involvement in drug trafficking. The NADDIS access log NADDIS logs the access of NADDIS by any authorized DEA employee and records the time, date, location and identity of the employee who requested access to a particular file. These access logs or \\"detail reports\\" have been utilized by DEA Headquarters to identify DEA employees who provided NADDIS records to criminal organizations or who have improperly accessed NADDIS21. Agencies' access logs have also been considered by district courts in resolving legal issues over the timing of agents' and prosecutors' awareness of investigative records on a subject. Thus, the use of NADDIS detail reports to detect government improprieties is similar to the use of other law enforcement database access logs in demonstrating police misconduct. For example, in Kansas the FBI's Interstate Identification Index (III) access log confirmed improper access by a sheriff who conducted criminal history checks against political opponents. Lack of public information Efforts through the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) to obtain a sample NADDIS record have often been rejected by DEA. The Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals has indicated its concerns about the \\"scanty\\" secondary literature on NADDIS, further noting that although it would be helpful \\"to know something about NADDIS\\", \\"the government has successfully opposed efforts to obtain discovery aimed at determining the character and reliability\\" of the system. There are few news articles discussing NADDIS, and only one criminology journal article discussing a failed request for NADDIS information. However, a few recent web-based documents involving DEA contractors have provided insight into the structure of NADDIS. In response to a FOIA request for NADDIS data by a criminologist for research purposes, DEA previously has provided only a sealed, non-public \\"'live' (simulated) NADDIS printout\\" for review by the district court in camera. =The First NADDIS record released by DEA through FOIA= In 2010, after a decision by the Department of Justice Office of Information Policy (OIP) and mediation by the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) Office of Government Information Services (OGIS), DEA, in a change of policy, released for the first time an actual NADDIS record on an individual. This FOIA release, which was requested and litigated by an incarcerated researcher for records on an unrelated and deceased third party in an effort to characterize NADDIS, now permits any individual to obtain their NADDIS record, or that of any deceased third party, or any living third party (with a signed, original DOJ-361 release authorization). The DEA FOIA release demonstrates that NADDIS includes a \\"Remarks\\" section (p. 7-10 of the FOIA release, Id.) which contains the date and file number of each DEA report on a subject, and which abstracts and summarizes the content of the complete report. Hence, this recent FOIA release by DEA may be employed as an exhibit in pre-trial discovery requests for NADDIS records, or as an exhibit by other FOIA requestors seeking NADDIS records. The future of NADDIS NADDIS has increasingly been employed and shared by multiple federal agencies post-9/11. NADDIS is likely to be included in the datasets of the more than 53 government agencies now contributing records to FBI's Investigative Data Warehouse (IDW) and the DHS Immigration and Customs Enforcement Pattern Analysis and Information Collection (ICEPIC) system. As an effective tool in the detection of terrorism-related heroin trafficking, NADDIS may be used to link Taliban- influenced Afghan government officials and heroin sources in Afghanistan for purposes of selective enforcement, more efficient allocation of federal agencies' resources, reduction of corruption, and for study and analysis of the terrorism-narcotics nexus. NADDIS is becoming an even more significant contributor to the intelligence community's (IC) datamarts for federal and international agencies' characterization of nascent and existing major violent narcotics organizations linked to terrorism. NADDIS through FOIA now is accessible to criminal justice policy researchers concerned with selective enforcement methods, violent crime demographics, drug epidemics and the impact of information-sharing on personal privacy and civil liberties.

In 2010 China shut down 60,000 pornographic websites according to the news agency Reuters, arresting almost 5,000 suspects in the process. =Hong Kong= In Hong Kong, pornography is illegal if sold or shown to children under 18 years of age, if it is publicly displayed (except within the confines of and only visible from inside a \\"bona fide art gallery or museum\\"), or if it is sold without being wrapped completely with an \\"easily noticeable\\" warning stating that the material may be offensive and may not be distributed to minors. = Japan = Pornography in Japan includes pornography ranging from well-known sex acts such as bukkake to sexual fetish pornography such as tamakeri. As in Europe, photographs of nudes are not uncommon in the mainstream media. In the 1970s and 1980s, the strongest prohibition was against showing pubic hair or adult genitalia. Imported magazines would have the pubic hair scratched out, and even the most explicit videos could not portray it. Starting around 1991, photobook publishers began challenging this ban to the point where pubic hair is now fairly well accepted. Close-ups of genitalia remain proscribed. In 1999, the government enacted a law banning photos and videos of naked children. Manga and anime remain largely unregulated, although large publishers tend to self-censor or specify that characters are at least 18 years of age. The 1960s, in Japanese pornography, was the era of the independent Pink film. In the years since the end of World War II, eroticism had been gradually making its way into Japanese cinema. The first kiss to be seen in Japanese film‚Äîdiscreetly half-hidden by an umbrella‚Äîcaused a national sensation in 1946. Nevertheless, until the early 1960s, graphic depictions of nudity and sex in Japanese film could only be seen in single-reel \\"stag films\\", made illegally by underground film producers such as those depicted in Imamura's film The Pornographers (1966). Nudity and sex would officially enter the Japanese cinema with the independent, low-budget softcore pornographic films which would come to dominate domestically produced films in the 1960s and 1970s. These films were called eroductions during the early 1960s, but are now more commonly referred to as pink films. The first true pink film, and the first Japanese movie with nude scenes, was Satoru Kobayashi's controversial and popular independent production, Flesh Market (Nikutai no Ichiba, 1962), starring Tamaki Katori. Katori would go on to star in over 600 pink films throughout the 1960s, earning the nickname the \\"Pink Princess\\". In 1964 Tetsuji Takechi made the first big-budget, mainstream pink film, Daydream. Takechi would remake Daydream as Japan's first theatrical hardcore film in 1981, starring Kyoko Aizome. = North Korea = In 2007 the online newspaper Daily NK reported that pornographic literature was produced in North Korea for high-ranking officials during the late 1990s. Some pornographic films showing nude or scantily-clad women dancing to music were also made. In the 2000s these were superseded by imported pornographic films, for which a public rental market developed. Imported works of pornography have been available in North Korea in recent decades, mainly in the capital Pyongyang and typically in the form of CD-R copies bought secretly at markets. There is very little domestic production. Producing, distributing, importing and watching pornography is illegal. Importing pornography to North Korea is harshly punished. Pornography is sold openly on the China‚ÄìNorth Korea border regardless of regulations. Despite attempts to curtail circulation of imported pornography, most of the pornography watched in North Korea is currently made abroad. A significant part of pornographic media in circulation consists of Chinese bootleg recordings of poor quality. There is no access to foreign pornographic websites from within North Korea. North Korea has ratified the Optional Protocol on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. However, there are currently no specific laws to combat child pornography. = South Korea = Pornographic websites, books, writings, films, magazines, photographs or other materials of a pornographic nature are illegal in South Korea, although the law is not regularly enforced. Distribution of pornography can result in a fine or a two-year prison sentence. Since 2009, pornographic websites have been blocked by the South Korean government. In 2012 the Ministry of Public Administration and Security released statistics that cited 39.5% of South Korean children having experienced watching online pornography, with 14.2% of those who have viewed online pornography reportedly \\"wanting to imitate\\" it. =Taiwan= In Taiwan pornographic films can be legally traded and pornography is available via a number of routes, including DVD, television and the Internet. The level of piracy of pornographic films in Taiwan is high because authorities have not traditionally recognised their copyrights. Copyright protection is usually strictly applied in Taiwan, but pornography has been seen as an exception. The public display of adult material is strictly prohibited. The National Communications Commission (NCC), the Taiwanese media regulator, monitors and categorizes the level of media and public material into four levels. Thus adult material is not seen for sale in authorized shops, but only in small and hidden places. Due to the lack of copyright, adult content produced in Taiwan has stayed in the form of \\"webcam chat\\". Prostitution is illegal in Taiwan. The Taiwanese government has planned to set up a zone for prostitution.  Southeast Asia = Brunei = Possession of pornographic material is illegal in Brunei. Due to the high number of expatriates in this country, pornography from various regions such as the Americas, Africa and Europe are easily available in retail shops known as \\"kedai runcit\\". It is illegal to sell to minors, and it is illegal to produce pornography unless for personal use. = Indonesia = The Indonesian criminal code (Kitab Undang-undang Hukum Pidana, KUHP), in conjunction with the Roman-Dutch law-based Indonesian legal system, strictly prohibits pornographic material. The creation, distribution, sale and rental of explicit materials is banned in the country. On 30 October 2008, the People's Representative Council (DPR) passed the Bill against Pornography and Pornoaction, but it was deemed controversial. The broadness of the law has concerned practitioners of regional traditions such as the nightclubs in Bali, West Javan jaipong dance, and New Guinean penis gourd wearing. In 2010 the anti-pornography law was challenged but Indonesia's Constitutional Court upheld the ban and stated that the law's definition of pornography was clear and did not violate the constitution. A revised criminal code (RUU KUHP) has been drafted and is currently being discussed by the DPR. There is controversy over the RUU (Law Proposal) because child abuse is already recognized by the KUHP and the RUU is deemed to meddle too much in domestic affairs. = Malaysia = Pornography is illegal in Malaysia. Possession of pornographic material is punished by Malaysian criminal law and results in fine and up to 5 years' imprisonment. The Printing Presses and Publications Act of 1984 subjects all offline media (such as newspapers, television, and radio stations) to licensing regimes granted at the discretion of ministers. However, the Communications and Multimedia Act of 1998 pledged the Malaysian government to refraining from Internet censorship in Malaysia. Nevertheless, the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission, the main regulatory authority of information technology and communications industries, prohibits online content that is \\"indecent\\" or \\"obscene\\". In July 2018, the Malaysian police announced the creation of the Malaysian Internet Crime Against Children Investigation Unit (MICAC) that is equipped with real-time mass Internet surveillance software developed in the United States. It is tasked with the monitoring of all Malaysian Internet users even on mobile phones, with a focus on pornography especially child pornography. The system creates a \\"data library\\" of users which includes details such as IP addresses, websites, locations, duration and frequency of use and files uploaded and downloaded. Visiting these websites are subject to either questioning by police or imprisonment. The national government blocks many pornographic websites, with more than 3,000 blocked as of 2018. Condom shops selling sex toys and many sex-related products in Malaysia are illegal. There are shops selling them in towns and cities such as Kuala Lumpur, Penang, Ipoh, Kuching and Kota Kinabalu. = Myanmar = Pornographic material is prohibited in Myanmar. Many users of the Internet in Myanmar cannot access content outside the country, and a significant number of pornographic websites are blocked using content- control software. = Philippines = Any kind of pornography is illegal in the Philippines. This is due to the influence of conservative Christian groups, such as the Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines, and churches, mainly the Roman Catholic Church, among other institutions. The current law does not specifically outlaw webcam-sex websites based in the Philippines. Law enforcement is light, and pornography is available often through black markets and the Internet. There are some urban areas that are known to publicly various kinds of pornographic films. Despite the existing laws, some reports claimed that the pornography industry in the country earned around US$1 billion annually in 2006, making it the 8th largest pornography industry in the world and the 4th in Asia. This also meant that it held the top rank in the whole Southeast Asia, despite the fact that almost every month, the country's Optical Media Board (OMB) was confiscating hundreds of thousands of counterfeit VCDs and DVDs. From January to September 2008, the OMB confiscated 4,807,012 CDs costing ‚Ç±1.4 billion ($29,400,000; based on the prevailing peso-dollar exchange rate on 17 September 2008).Report: Philippines' Porn Industry 8th Largest in the World - PinoyExchange Since 14 January 2017, several pornographic websites including Pornhub and XVideos have been blocked in the Philippines upon the order of President Rodrigo Duterte as part of his Republic Act 9775 or Anti-Child Pornography Law. However, there are a few Internet service providers in the country which still allow access to these websites. = Singapore = In Singapore the government agency responsible for regulating media content is the Info-communications Media Development Authority (prior to 2016 the Media Development Authority). It is not a crime or offence to visit pornographic websites and view their content. However, downloading pornographic content is prohibited. It is deemed illegal to provide and/or supply any form of pornography from within the country. It is also an offence to be in possession of pornographic material. The 39-year- old Yangtze Cinema, which was probably the only theatre on the island to primarily screen softcore films in the city-state, also closed its doors on February 29, 2016. = Thailand = The 287th section of the Thai Penal Code makes it a criminal offence to produce, distribute or possess obscene materials for the purpose of trade. The maximum penalty is up to 3 years' imprisonment. Many types of pornography are prohibited in Thailand, but the law enforcement is relaxed and poorly enforces the prohibition. Some religious minorities may possess pornography for personal use legally because possession for personal use is legal. Other forms of pornography such as yaoi and hentai are illegal but are common over the Internet. The popular Thai actor, model and singer Penpak Sirikul has been a pioneer in Thai pornography. = Vietnam = Production, distribution, broadcasting, transport, import and advertisement of pornography, is strictly illegal in Vietnam. According to legislatures, pornography harms Vietnamese standard values.  Caucasia = Azerbaijan = In Azerbaijan in accordance with article 3 of the Media Act of 7 December 1999, \\"pornographic materials\\" are defined as works of art, photographic reproductions of paintings, information and other materials the main content of which is the crude and undignified depiction of the anatomical and physiological aspects of sexual relations. Pornography in Azerbaijan is easily and cheaply obtainable in Baku, although not in most other places. There are reports of bribes being charged for taking hardcore pornography across the country's borders. Meanwhile, the legal activity to combat child pornography is governed by 1998 Rights of the Child Act, 1999 Media Act, the Plan of Measures to Solve the Problem of Homeless and Street Children and the National Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking in Persons. Central Asia=Kazakhstan= The legal status of pornography in Kazakhstan was changed in 2013 with the introduction of the law: \\"On Ratification of the International Convention for Suppression of the Circulation and Traffic of Obscene Publications\\". This made it illegal to produce, possess or advertise pornography for the purpose of sale, circulation or public display. Additionally, the law made it a criminal offence to import or export pornography or run a pornography business. It is not an offence to access Internet pornography at home and Kazakhstan does block popular pornographic sites, such as Pornhub, XVideos and xHamster. However accessing Internet pornography at corporations, businesses, or any workplace is prohibited in Kazakhstan. =Turkmenistan= Even though the legal status of pornography in Turkmenistan is unknown, a law, passed on 1 January 2015, banning citizens to access pornography on the Internet suggests that pornography is definitely illegal in Turkmenistan.  South Asia = Bangladesh = In 2012, the government in Bangladesh attempted to outlaw pornography as a result of the passing of the Pornography Control Act. Information and telecommunication minister of 11th parliamentary government of Bangladesh, Mostafa Zabbar blocked nearly 20,000 porn websites access in Bangladesh from November 2018 to February 2019. = Bhutan = Pornography in Bhutan is strictly forbidden. It is defined in Section 476 (A) of the Bhutan Penal Code of 2004, which states, ‚ÄúA defendant shall be guilty of the offence of computer pornography if the defendant publishes and distributes an obscene photography or picture on the computer or over the internet.\\" = India = *The publishing or transmission of pornographic material is illegal in India under section 292 *The distribution, sale, or circulation of obscene materials and the selling of pornographic content to any person under age 20 years are illegal under section 293 and IT Act-67B. *Child pornography is illegal and strictly prohibited across the country under section 67B of the Information Technology Act, 2000 *The manufacturing, publishing and distribution of pornography is illegal in India under section 292, 293. In July 2015 the Supreme Court of India refused to allow the blocking of pornographic websites and said that watching pornography indoors in the privacy of ones own home was not a crime. The court rejected an interim order blocking pornographic websites in the country. In August 2015 the Government of India issued an order to Indian ISPs to block at least 857 websites that it considered to be pornographic. In 2015 the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) had asked internet service providers to take down 857 websites in a bid to control cyber crime, but after receiving criticism from the authorities it partially rescinded the ban. The ban from the government came after a lawyer filed a petition in the Supreme Court arguing that online pornography encourages sex crimes and rapes. In February 2016 the Supreme Court asked the Indian Government to suggest ways of banning all forms of child pornography. In October 2018 the government directed Internet service providers to block 827 websites that host pornographic content following an order by the Uttarakhand High Court, according to official sources. Although the Uttarakhand High Court had asked for the blocking of 857 websites, the Ministry of Electronics and IT (Meity) discovered that 30 of these had no pornographic content and removed them from the list. The court asked the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) to ban pornographic websites in India, citing an incident in Dehradun where a 10th standard girl was raped by four of her seniors. The accused later told police that they did so after watching pornographic content on the Internet. Following the order from the Uttarakhand High Court and the regulations of the DoT, Internet Service Providers in India banned pornographic websites across the country. = Maldives = The production, possession, sale, dissemination, distribution, or importation of pornography or pornographic material (including sex toys) is illegal in Maldives. There were attempts by the government to block pornographic websites. However, it is still accessible in the country as long it is viewed at home. = Nepal = Nepali law identifies pornography as illegal. The sharing, distribution and broadcasting of pornographic content through any medium is prohibited. In 2010 it was reported that the Home Ministry had banned access to a list of websites including explicitly adult websites. In September 2018, concerns about violence against women led the Government of Nepal to announce its intention to ban online pornography. From 24 September, the Nepal Telecommunications Authority (NTA) began to put a block on all websites providing pornographic content on the orders of the Nepal Government Ministry of Communication and Information Technology (MOCIT). By 12 October more than 21,000 pornographic websites had been blocked. = Pakistan = Pornography is illegal. It is not easily accessible, and the Government has put an all-time ban on websites containing such material since November 2011. The list of banned pornographic websites is updated on an ongoing basis. = Sri Lanka = The laws against pornography in Sri Lanka are strict. Under the Explicit Literature Ordinance, sale or possession of pornographic material can be classified as illegal. The production of local pornography is strictly illegal. Child pornography is considered to be illegal under the National Child Protection act and the punishments are very severe. Child pornography possession, production and distribution is punishable by up to 20 years' imprisonment, severe fines and in some cases, even forfeiture of property. This act covers the rights of children, but not pornography per se. Therefore, the same act cannot be used as an anti-pornographic law. In the year of 2009, The government banned more than 100 local and international porn sites and nearly 80 Sri Lankan porn stars were arrested by the local authorities. They were all sentenced to fines, community service and prison sentences up to 2 years.  Middle East = Iran = In Iran pornography is illegal. However, due to widespread Internet access (in particular, downloading programs) and the existence of a large-scale black market in Western films, pornography is called \\"super film.\\" In Iran, a law was passed in mid-2007 by parliament but still required approval of the Guardian Council, producers of pornographic films face execution if found guilty. = Israel = Pornography is legal in Israel. Pornographic films in Israel began to be produced in the 1990s, but most of the films were shot in the early 2000s. Any kind of child pornography is strictly forbidden (under the age of 18). = Jordan = Distribution of pornography is illegal in Jordan. = Lebanon = In Lebanon, the production and distribution of pornography films are illegal. Regulation of Internet pornography is relatively light. In September 2011, four members of a criminal ring involved in the sale of pornographic films were arrested by Lebanese authorities. The men, of Lebanese and Syrian nationality, had been promoting the sale of unlicensed copies of pornographic DVDs in different areas of the country, particularly Byblos, north of Beirut, where they were apprehended. The men were referred to the relevant authorities, with the case investigated to uncover the remaining members of the ring and anyone else involved in the distribution of the pornographic films. = Palestine = In 2008, Hamas attempted to implement Internet filters to block access to pornography in the Gaza Strip.AFP: Hamas takes aim at Internet porn in Gaza = Saudi Arabia = Saudi Arabia prohibits all forms of pornography due to Islam's opposition to it. In 2000 Saudi authorities said that they were \\"winning the war against pornography on the internet\\".

Early years Summers was born in Portland, Oregon, the son of Brev. Brigadier General Owen Summers Sr. and Clara Summers. His father had commanded all Oregon military forces serving in the Philippines during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. Educated locally in Oregon, Owen Summers Jr. received officers training and joined the 91st Infantry Division in 1917 as a second lieutenant. After training at Camp Lewis in Washington, the Division shipped off for France. Summers fought in several key battles in World War I, including the St. Mihiel Offensive in France, and the Meuse-Argonne Offensive in the final major offensive of the war. Summers was promoted to captain, and made an aide-de-camp of the division commander, General William H. Johnston. When the Division returned to the Northwest, Summers served at Vancouver Barracks in 1919. In 1920, Summers was commissioned a captain in the regular Army. After his commissioning, Summers served with several infantry divisions, received various levels of officer training, and had a tour of duty in the Philippines. In 1923 he attended the military's Infantry School, Commissioned Officers Course. In 1935, Summers attended the U.S. Army's Command and General Staff School.

In April, 1945, the general was assigned to command Task Force \\"A\\", which was to go to the Oslo Zone in Norway to disarm Germans and repatriate them to Germany. As the center of German and Norwegian administration, the Oslo command assisted in many of the arrests, imprisonments, and in some cases executions of German sympathizers and German occupational government officials. Summers returned to the United States in December, 1946, and retired from the U.S. Army in June, 1947. After retiring, Summers and his wife moved to Vancouver, Washington.

He was one of the leaders and the founder of Los √Åntrax, an armed squadron that protects Ismael \\"El Mayo\\" Zambada, a top cartel leader. He was arrested on December 30, 2013 at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol in the Netherlands at the request of the United States, which contacted Interpol to arrest him for charges relating to drug trafficking. He was extradited to the US on 10 July 2014. After being sentenced to house arrest, on 9 May 2020, he was reported missing along with all of his belongings. He soon returned to Culiacan, Sinaloa where he was killed alongside his sister, and brother-in-law on 15 May 2020. Early life Jos√© Rodrigo Ar√©chiga Gamboa, often referred to by his alias 'El Chino √Åntrax', was born in Culiac√°n, Sinaloa, Mexico on 15 June 1980. Ar√©chiga Gamboa began to work for the Sinaloa Cartel as a bodyguard of Vicente Zambada Niebla (alias \\"El Vicentillo\\"), son of Ismael \\"El Mayo\\" Zambada, until 2008. Following the separation of the Sinaloa organization and the Beltr√°n Leyva Cartel that year, he went on to form Los √Åntrax, an armed squadron of the Sinaloa Cartel for providing armed security services to \\"El Mayo\\" Zambada. He was nearly killed on 4 November 2008 when an armed commando opened fire at a car wash in Culiac√°n. In the attack, Los √Åntrax lost one of its members, Alfredo Vizcarra Vega (alias \\"El Fello √Åntrax\\"), son of a Sinaloa police commander. Ar√©chiga Gamboa reportedly managed to escape uninjured during the shootout. Following the arrest of Zambada Niebla in March 2009, the drug lord ascended in the apex of the Sinaloa Cartel given his friendship with one of \\"El Mayo\\" Zambada's sons. He was then called to oversee the plaza (turf) of Culiac√°n, the center of operations of Los √Åntrax and the city where the Zambada family reportedly resided. Tenure in Los √Åntrax In 2008, he founded Los √Åntrax with another drug lord known as Ren√© Vel√°zquez Valenzuela (alias Sergeant \\"Phoenix √Åntrax\\",Vladi portillo [the Russian] \\"El Gato Negro\\"http://www.milenio.com/estados/operadores-fuga-el_chapo-penal- culiacan_0_306569514.html (Black cat) and \\"El Taliban\\"http://laparednoticias.com/chino-antrax-historia-de-un-sicario/), who was arrested by the Mexican Army that year and sent to jail in Aguaruto, Sinaloa. Among the first gang leaders to die was Redel Castro (alias \\"El Pocho √Åntrax\\"), who was killed in a massive shootout in June 2010 with rival members of the Beltr√°n Leyva Cartel in Tubutama, Sonora. In May 2011, the Mexican Army arrested, tortured, and killed three members of Los √Åntrax after they mistook them for kidnappers: the members were Franklin Olgu√≠n Vel√°zquez (alias \\"El Franki\\" and/or \\"El Dos\\"), Jes√∫s Humberto Corona Guill√©n (alias \\"El Chuve\\"), and Pedro Valenzuela Meza (alias \\"El Pedr√≥n\\"). In November of that year, Francisco Arce Rubio (alias \\"Pancho Arce\\"), another high-ranking gang leader close to El Chino √Åntrax, was killed during an indoor soccer game in Culiac√°n by rival gangsters of Los Mazatlecos. Following the death of Arce Rubio, \\"El Mayo\\" Zambada withdrew El Chino √Åntrax from the day-to-day activities of Los √Åntrax until he sorted things out. However, the attacks against the gang continued; in February 2012, Roque Landeros (alias \\"Roque √Åntrax\\") was killed with three other men in Culiac√°n. Local media outlets alleged that the killings stemmed from an internal power struggle within the Sinaloa Cartel, specifically from a group commanded by \\"El Chapo\\" Guzm√°n. Mexico's Office of the General Prosecutor (PGR) and Secretariat of Public Security (SSP) have identified various other leaders under the hierarchy of El Chino √Åntrax. Jes√∫s Pe√±a (alias \\"El 20\\") is believed to be a close associate of the drug lord; others include a man known as Melesio (alias \\"El Mele\\"); \\"El Traka √Åntrax\\", identified by authorities as the gang's recruiter; Eusebio Imperial or Eliseo Castro (alias \\"El Cheyo √Åntrax\\"), a supposed nephew of \\"El Mayo\\" Zambada; a man known as \\"El Monkey\\"; and \\"El Changuito\\", the former alleged financial head of Los √Åntrax, both arrested on 16 April 2012. Ar√©chiga Gamboa was wanted by the United States government and faced charges in a San Diego, California federal court for trafficking methamphetamines, cocaine and marijuana. The charge alleged that he conspired with other people to import 500 grams of methamphetamines and 5 kilograms of cocaine to the U.S. The indictment, started by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) in late 2011, was part of an investigation known as Operation Narco Polo, where federal agents intercepted several phone calls from March and October 2012 between Ar√©chiga Gamboa and drug traffickers from the San Diego‚ÄìTijuana area. The investigation also included the testimony of arrested smugglers, seized drugs and money, and photographs that inculpate them. From 2011 and 2013, the drug lord lived in Los Cabos, Baja California Sur and led Los √Åntrax against the criminal group Los Zetas in the area. While in Los Cabos, Ar√©chiga Gamboa reportedly ordered the murder of Francisco Rafael Arellano F√©lix, a former leader of the Tijuana Cartel, on 18 October 2013. The PGR revealed that the motive possibly stemmed from Arellano F√©lix's involvement in money laundering activities and as a message from the Los √Åntrax to show that they were in charge of organized crime in Los Cabos. The Baja California state authorities identified the possible murders of the drug lord: No√© Castro (alias \\"R1\\"), Ar√©chiga Gamboa's right-hand man in Los Cabos; and a man known by his alias \\"R13\\". Social media activities His most common alias is Chino Anthrax, but the drug lord is also known as El Comandante √Åntrax (\\"Commander Anthrax\\"), R-57, El Oriental (\\"The Oriental\\"), El Quinto Elemento (\\"The Fifth Element\\"), Scarface Renacido (\\"Reborn Scarface\\"), among others. On his Facebook, Twitter (@comandante57_) and Instagram (miauuuu5_7 and jamesbond5_7) accounts, Ar√©chiga Gamboa uploaded pictures and videos of his ostentatious lifestyle, which included trips to Europe, Las Vegas (where he attended the Manny Pacquiao vs. Brandon Rios fight), Japan, and parts of Africa and the Middle East. In one of his pictures, the drug lord appears alongside Paris Hilton. The drug lord also has pictures with Ismael Zambada Imperial (alias \\"El Mayito Gordo\\"), son of \\"El Mayo\\" Zambada and a high-ranking enforcer within the cartel. He also has pictures with Seraf√≠n Zambada Ortiz (alias \\"El Sera\\"), also son of \\"El Mayo\\" Zambada who was arrested by U.S. authorities in November 2013 while attempting to cross the U.S.-Mexico border in Arizona. He also uploaded pictures of his sport cars, yachts, weapons, jewelry, money, and extravagant parties with famous narcocorrido bands. On social media, he raffled cellphones, sunglasses, cars, and other gifts with his followers. He frequently appeared on his Instagram feed sporting his muscular physique, protein intakes, and workout routines. Ar√©chiga Gamboa also has several narcocorrido ballads about him, some which describe him as an \\"elegant and fit man\\" who enjoys his sport cars, yachts, and drinking champagne. He was part of the younger generation of Mexican drug traffickers that enjoy displaying their luxurious lifestyle online. Although he always blurred his face in his social media pictures, in most of them he was shown wearing the skull shaped diamond ring, in reference to Los √Åntrax, as a form of signature. Despite attempting to be discreet by blurring his face, U.S. authorities were able to track him down thanks to his photos. They learned that Ar√©chiga Gamboa liked to travel across the world; his ring also helped them identify him when he landed in the Netherlands from Mexico on 31 December 2013 and was arrested. Arrest On 3 January 2014, the Netherlands Ministry of Security and Justice and the Mexican Embassy in the country confirmed that a 33-year-old Mexican citizen had been arrested by the Dutch police as he arrived from Latin America to Amsterdam Airport Schiphol in the Netherlands using a false name on 30 December 2013. Initially, the authorities did not give any details on the identity of the detainee, but an anonymous U.S. federal agent and Mexican local newspapers leaked information to the media that the man was in fact Ar√©chiga Gamboa. The arrest of the drug lord was officially confirmed later that day by the U.S. government. According to officials, Ar√©chiga Gamboa travelled with the fake name of Norberto Sicairos Garc√≠a; at the time of his arrest, he was carrying an iPhone 5, a Blackberry Bold, three airplane tickets, credit cards from Visa and MasterCard from Banamex, and a Mexican driver's license. Upon his arrest, he was sent to the Vught maximum-security prison. U.S. law enforcement managed to identify Ar√©chiga Gamboa through unspecified forensic methods despite the fact that the drug lord had used a fake name to travel, undergone plastic surgery to change his appearance, and altered his finger prints. On 2 January 2014, he appeared before a judge, who spoke about his situation and the motives behind his arrest. The Dutch authorities confirmed that the drug lord had been arrested at the request of the U.S. government, which had contacted Interpol to assist them in the arrest of the drug lord for charges relating to drug trafficking. They did not contact Mexican officials. The following day, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California solicited an extradition request to bring the drug lord to trial in the U.S. =Kingpin Act sanction= On 8 January 2014, the U.S. Department of the Treasury sanctioned the drug lord under the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act (Kingpin Act), which froze assets he may have had in the U.S. and virtually prohibited U.S. citizens from carrying out financial or commercial deals with him. The document alleged that, besides working for the drug lord \\"El Mayo\\" Zambada, Ar√©chiga Gamboa coordinated logistics and drug transportations for \\"El Chapo\\" Guzm√°n and worked alongside Gonzalo Inzunza Inzunza (alias \\"El Macho Prieto\\"), another Sinaloa Cartel high-ranking enforcer who was killed in Sonora in December 2013. The drug lords he worked for had already been sanctioned by the U.S. government under the Kingpin Act in 2001, 2002, 2009, and 2011. Extradition and trial On 14 May 2014, an official spokesperson of a court in Haarlem stated to the press that the request of the U.S. to extradite Ar√©chiga Gamboa was planned to be defined by 29 May 2014. On 28 May 2014, a Dutch court approved the extradition to the U.S. The defense of El Chino √Åntrax, who was not present during the hearing, was allowed by law to appeal the decision, a process that could have taken months. On 10 July 2014, he was extradited from Amsterdam to the U.S., where he arrived at the San Diego International Airport at around 2:00 p.m. under tight security by the DEA and the U.S. Marshal Service. Upon his arrival, he was taken into custody and booked for his drug- related charges. He was expected to be arraigned on such charges the next day. The following day, he pleaded not guilty to the drug charges against him and was held without bail after the U.S. Magistrate Mitchell D. Dembin deemed him a public threat and capable of fleeing to Mexico if released. Those present in the courtroom had to pass a secondary metal detector and pat-down before entering the hearing site. According to one of the case's attorneys, a group of women who were supposedly family members of Ar√©chiga Gamboa sat in one of the middle rows of the courtroom. They declined to comment about the case, just like Ar√©chiga Gamboa's defense Frank Ragen. After his court appearance, Ar√©chiga Gamboa was imprisoned at the Metropolitan Correctional Center, San Diego and was scheduled to appear in court again for a motion hearing conducted by federal judge Dana Makoto Sabraw on 22 August 2014. On the morning of 21 August 2014, he reappeared in court for a twenty-minute hearing. The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California declared it a \\"complex case\\" after the defense asked for a time extension given the overwhelming amount of evidences presented by the prosecution. According to the court archives, the DEA has under its possession documents that prove that Ar√©chiga Gamboa participated in at least fifty drug trafficking shipments between Mexico and the United States. His next court appearance was scheduled for 21 November 2014. On that date, however, the hearing was postponed to 6 March 2015 after his attorney asked in court for more time to evaluate the evidence against his client. Unlike in other court sessions, Ar√©chiga Gamboa's family members were not present in the courtroom. He pleaded guilty on 20 March 2015 and admitted that he had participated in cocaine and marijuana shipments from Mexico to the U.S., and that he had facilitated violent activities for the Sinaloa Cartel. After being in custody in the United States for six years, Archeiga was sentenced to seven years and three months in US federal prison.https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/courts/story/2019-12-12/he- grew-up-with-the-sinaloa-cartel-next-door-and-became-el-chino-antrax On March 3, 2020, he was released and placed into house arrest.

The next day police in the town of Ayune, Sinaloa, discovered a black SUV with what appeared to be 3 dead bodies inside, one of the bodies was later identified as Jos√© Rodrigo Ar√©chiga Gamboa, he was shot dead and wrapped in a cloth, his head was covered with a black plastic bag. The other 2 bodies belonged to his sister and brother in law. It was later reported that his murder was not the result of retaliation from a rival cartel and was likely carried out by senior leaders of the Sinaloa Cartel.https://www.insightcrime.org/news/brief/mexico-chino-antrax- sinaloa/ Family His romantic partner Yuriana Castillo Torres was reportedly kidnapped by armed men while heading to her vehicle after leaving a gym in Culiac√°n, Sinaloa on 6 May 2014 Her corpse was discovered on 06:45 the next day by Mexican law enforcement at a vacant lot in Lomas de Guadalupe neighborhood in Culiac√°n, and confirmed to be hers by her family members at the forensic installations. Post-mortem reports showed that Castillo Torres had been tortured, received several blows to the head, and that her hands and legs were tied with an electric cable. At the funeral home where the wake took place, members of Los √Åntrax reportedly paid their condolences by leaving a floral ornament in honor of her.  In popular culture  There are several narcocorridos (drug ballads) that narrate some of the exploits of Ar√©chiga Gamboa and his assassin squad Los √Åntrax. Most of the songs belong to the trend of narcocorridos known as movimiento alterado (\\"the altered movement\\"), which promotes violence in reference to the physiological effect of cocaine consumption.

The game was released exclusively in Japan on December 22, 1995, and is the fourth installment in the Tengai Maky≈ç series.  Gameplay  A screenshot of Lost Templar's work-in-progress translation of the game. Tengai Maky≈ç Zero is a turn-based role-playing game, featuring random battles. Battles are fought from an over-the-shoulder perspective, similar to games like Phantasy Star II and Phantasy Star IV: The End of the Millennium. The battle system itself is more akin to the Dragon Quest series of games, with a special twist: unlike previous games in the series, the player does not learn new techniques via leveling up, but must instead seek out the hidden \\"hermits\\", which teach new techniques or elemental abilities. Tengai Maky≈ç Zero was one of the few Super Famicom games to make use of the SPC7110, a data decompression chip that allows for more data to be stored on a cartridge than a typical Super Famicom game. As a result, the game includes a large variation in music, a large amount of text dialogue, and no repetition of enemy sprites whatsoever. The game also makes use of a real-time clock accessed via the SPC7110, which, much like recent games in the Animal Crossing and Pok√©mon series, results in different special events in the game taking place depending on the time of day, and even the time of year.  Synopsis = Plot = In the feudal Japan-like world of Jipang, an evil prince releases the demon lord Ninigi, who in turn seals the gods of Jipang and suppresses the people of six kingdoms with his demon henchmen. After one of the henchmen attack his village and slay his grandfather, the main character, Higan, learns he is the legendary \\"Fire Hero\\" and must set off to save the kingdoms. Along the way, Higan meets several characters, such as Subaru, a fairy and Tenjin, a swordsman. = Characters =Heroes * Higan („Éí„Ç¨„É≥) : The hero of the game and is a descendant of the Fire Clan.

Development and Release = Tengai Maky≈ç Zero: Sh≈çnen Jump no Shou = is a special promotional version of the game, tied in with the Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump magazine. Though it seemingly has very few differences from the original game (such as the title screen), the game is extremely rare and is quite possibly the most expensive Super Famicom game. Equally rare is the promotional clock in the style of the game cartridge to promote the use of the Real Time Clock (RTC) in-game. They removed one building and event from the original game. In one of the towns, they replaced it with the Kodansha office. This version adds an additional character and item that doesn't exist in the original. = Translations = Tengai Maky≈ç Zero was never officially localized into western languages and attempts at fan-translation were stalled due to difficulties caused by the game's script size and bugs in the hardware graphics decompressor. On October 22, 2017, a complete translation patch was finally released.http://www.romhacking.net/translations/3243/  References  External links  * Tengai Maky≈ç Zero at MobyGames * Tengai Maky≈ç Zero Review at Hardcore Gaming 101 Category:1995 video games Category:Japan-exclusive video games Category:Oji Hiroi Category:Red Entertainment games Category:Role- playing video games Category:Super Nintendo Entertainment System games Category:Super Nintendo Entertainment System-only games Category:Video games developed in Japan Zero ","title":"Tengai Maky≈ç Zero"},{"id":"41543385","text":"The Juke Joint Gamblers are an American rock and roll band founded in Portland, Oregon in 2005.

This led to a bioethical debate engendered by her family's rejection of the medicolegal findings of death in the case, and their efforts to maintain her body using mechanical ventilation and other measures. Her parents considered these measures to constitute life support, while her doctors considered this to be futile treatment of a deceased person. In October 2014, the McMath family attorney made the unprecedented request that Jahi McMath's brain death declaration be overturned. The attorney later withdrew this request, saying he wanted time for the court-appointed medical expert and his own medical experts to confer. In March 2015, McMath's family filed a malpractice lawsuit against Children's Hospital Oakland and against the surgeon who performed McMath's surgery, indicating they were prepared to argue as part of the lawsuit that McMath is not dead, but profoundly disabled. The family lawyer stated that a preliminary second death certificate was issued on June 22, 2018, listing extensive bleeding relating to liver failure as the cause of death. Background According to court documents, McMath was admitted to Children's Hospital Oakland on December 9, 2013, for an adenotonsillectomy, uvulopalatopharyngoplasty and submucous resection of bilateral inferior turbinates. It was hoped these procedures would provide improved airflow during her sleep at night. The hospital described these procedures as complicated. The family described the surgery as a routine tonsillectomy in media reports. After the surgeries were performed, McMath was conscious and according to her mother, Latasha \\"Nailah\\" Winkfield, asked for a Popsicle while in the recovery room. On December 9, 2013, McMath suffered massive blood loss and consequent cardiac arrest. According to McMath's doctors at Children's Hospital Oakland, the loss of blood circulation caused whole brain death. On December 12, 2013, her doctors declared her brain-dead. Her family was informed that she was legally dead, and that as a result, life support systems would be discontinued. Her family refused to accept the medical declaration of death by neurological criteria, said that McMath was not dead, and initiated legal proceedings in an effort to require the hospital to continue treatment.  Legal action  On December 20, 2013, McMath's family filed a lawsuit in Alameda County Superior Court, petitioning the court to require Children's Hospital Oakland to keep McMath on life support. In a pretrial conference on December 23, Judge Evelio Grillo appointed Paul Graham Fisher, the chief of Child Neurology at Stanford University School of Medicine, to provide an independent medical opinion regarding the declaration of brain death. McMath's family also requested to have Paul A. Byrne, conduct a separate evaluation. Byrne, a neonatologist, has campaigned against the medical consensus of accepting brain death as death. The court denied that request. Fisher examined McMath and affirmed the diagnosis of brain death, reporting that she had no activity on an electroencephalogram, no blood flow to the brain and did not breathe when removed from mechanical ventilation, all of which are standard clinical indications of total brain death. On December 24, 2013, Judge Grillo ruled that McMath was legally dead, basing his decision on the medical evidence presented by physicians from Children's Hospital Oakland and from independent expert Paul Fisher, but ruled to require the hospital to continue mechanical ventilation until December 30, 2013, later extending this order until January 7, 2014. Grillo told the family \\"This has been very, very hard on you. No one anywhere would wish this to happen to anyone.\\" On December 30, 2013, the family appealed the decision to the Second District, California Courts of Appeal and the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, calling for the hospital to continue life support measures until other arrangements could be made by the family for the girl's care. McMath's mother argued that applying the Uniform Determination of Death Act to the case was a violation of constitutional religious and privacy rights and that because Jahi's heart was still beating, she was still alive. Byrne stated in court documents that he witnessed McMath moving in the hospital and that he considered her to be alive. The hospital stated that it would be unethical and \\"grotesque\\" to require the hospital and its doctors to provide further medical care to a dead body and said that Byrne was \\"a crusader with an ideology-based bias\\" The hospital also said that Lazarus signs are not uncommon in cases of brain death. After the hospital and McMath's family engaged in settlement talks, an agreement was facilitated in which McMath could be released from Children's Hospital, with the ventilator and her intravenous fluid lines, to the custody of her mother, but the United States District Court for the Northern District of California denied the family's petition to require hospital staff to perform a tracheostomy and insert a feeding tube.  Transfer  On January 5, 2014, Children's Hospital released McMath's body to the Alameda County coroner. The coroner's office had issued an official death certificate for McMath on January 3, 2014, with the date of death listed as December 12, 2013. The death certificate was incomplete, pending an autopsy to determine cause of death. After receiving custody of her body from Children's Hospital, the Coroner then released her to the custody of her mother, who was warned of and assumed all risk regarding cardiac arrest during the transfer. The family moved the girl to an undisclosed location where a tracheostomy was performed and a feeding tube was inserted. Commentary This case has prompted some commentators to discuss the futility of life support in such cases and even refer to it as \\"death support\\". Other questions that have been raised include how California law treats brain death and whether McMath's case could change existing laws and practices. McMath's attorney, Christopher Dolan said, \\"There would have been no legal battle if Jahi had had her tonsils out in New Jersey‚Äù, referring to a New Jersey state law allowing religious objection to a declaration of death on the basis of neurological criteria. Public confusion surrounding differences between brain death and cardiac death raised by this case led some doctors to voice concern about how the case could affect live organ recovery from brain dead patients. The impact of this case on medical negligence awards in California has also been discussed, as there is no compensation limit if the patient is alive, while compensation is capped at $250,000 if the patient has died.  Aftermath  In March 2014, the Terri Schiavo Life and Hope Network awarded McMath's family an annual award. The award recognizes \\"the unconditional love they have for Jahi, and their courage as they continue the fight for their daughter against overwhelming odds.\\" McMath's mother stated she was honored to receive the award and referred to her daughter as ‚Äústill asleep,‚Äù clarifying that she does not use the phrase \\"brain dead\\" to refer to her daughter. According to media reports, McMath was at a Catholic hospital in New Jersey until August 2014, after which she was moved to a New Jersey apartment. In October 2014, McMath's attorney, Christopher Dolan, held a press conference where he said that recent medical tests had detected blood flow and electrical activity in McMath's brain and where he released videos which he said showed the girl moving on command. At that time, Dolan also filed documents asking that the Alameda County Superior Court reverse their finding of brain death in the case. Paul Fisher, M.D., the court-appointed independent expert who had confirmed McMath's diagnosis of brain death in December 2013, said that the new evidence presented did not refute his earlier determination of brain death. Dolan then withdrew the petition for the October 2014 court hearing and requested that the involved doctors collaborate, stating that \\"with an open and transparent dialogue between health care professionals, only one conclusion can remain: that Jahi McMath is not brain dead.\\" In March 2015, McMath's family filed a malpractice lawsuit against Children's Hospital Oakland and Frederick Rosen, the surgeon who performed McMath's surgery. The lawsuit alleges that the surgeon noted an abnormal artery in McMath's throat but did not notify the nurses that this placed the girl at increased risk for serious hemorrhaging. Additionally, the lawsuit alleges that McMath bled from approximately 7:30 p.m. to 12:35 a.m., that a doctor said ‚Äú[expletive], her heart stopped‚Äù when he arrived hours after the family said they requested a doctor, and that the family was given conflicting information from nurses regarding how to care for McMath's bleeding. The family also claims that the hospital pressured them to donate McMath's organs. McMath's family and Bruce Brusavich, the family's malpractice attorney, have indicated that they are prepared to argue that McMath is not brain dead, so that the California state limit of $250,000 on medical malpractice lawsuits involving children who die does not apply in her case. After viewing over four dozen independent videos of McMath, Alan Shewmon, a UCLA pediatric neurologist, declared her technically alive in a June 29, 2017, court filing, stating that the girl follows movement commands and exhibits other proof of life. Children's Hospital Oakland maintained that the original diagnosis of brain death was correct and that the videos do not meet the diagnostic criteria for brain death. Dolan issued a statement in June 2018 that McMath had died on June 22, 2018. She was having internal bleeding due to kidney and liver failure, so her doctors removed her from life support, allowing her to die. Court cases are ongoing; Dolan stated that he intends to continue his pro-bono case to have McMath's California death certificate revoked and her date of death established as June 22, 2018.

It consists of government and non-governmental agencies and organizations in Canada and the United States. Its geographical scope is the Canadian provinces of Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, and Newfoundland and Labrador, and the 23 U.S. states in the Atlantic and Mississippi Flyways. It was the first of the three species joint ventures operating within the North American Waterfowl Management Plan to be established. Structure and funding The joint venture has a management board consisting of eleven members \\"with representation from Canadian and U.S. wildlife agencies\\". It is advised by a technical board composed of waterfowl biologists, which is responsible for project implementation and progress evaluation. Members are also organized into working groups representing each program in its scope. Its current coordinator is Brigitte Collins. The management board reports to the North American Waterfowl Management Plan, and is responsible for \\"overall program coordination, and for developing funding and delivery mechanisms\\". The Black Duck Joint Venture receives some of its funding from research grants. From 1989 to 1994, it had an operational budget of about CAD $870,000. Programs An American black duck in flight The efforts of American black duck researchers in Canada and the United States is coordinated via the Black Duck Joint Venture, including research related to \\"monitoring, population dynamics, harvest management and ecological requirements\\". The current science coordinator is Patrick Devers. The joint venture has conducted banding and survey programs in cooperation with other organizations, for which data collected is used in harvest management. The program led to more restrictive harvest regulations in the 1980s, which has led to the stabilization of American black duck populations in some areas and recovery in others. In 1990, the venture began \\"large-scale aerial surveys of breeding populations\\" of all species of eastern ducks and some other species to identify trends in breeding populations of those species. This consisted of helicopter surveys in southern Quebec and throughout the Maritime Provinces. Breeding ground surveys have also been conducted. from the mid-1990s to 2002, the number of breeding pairs in Quebec had more than doubled to 396,000. It was a participant in the American Black Duck Mapping Project conducted at Mount Allison University in conjunction with Ducks Unlimited Canada, the Canadian Wildlife Service, and other government organizations. This research collected data about black duck populations in Atlantic Canada to complement previous research by the Eastern Habitat Joint Venture. Other research partners include the Patuxent Wildlife Research Center. In the United States, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service has purchased wintering, staging and breeding habitats of the American black duck (and other species), which it manages to encourage population recovery. This includes over of wetlands at Montezuma National Wildlife Refuge.

From the inner cavity of the gut (the lumen) outwards, these are: *Mucosa *Submucosa *Muscular layer *Serosa or adventitia The mucosa is the innermost layer of the gastrointestinal tract. It surrounds the lumen of the tract, and comes into direct contact with digested food (chyme). The mucosa itself is made up of three layers: the epithelium, where most digestive, absorptive and secretory processes occur; the lamina propria, a layer of connective tissue, and the muscularis mucosae, a thin layer of smooth muscle. The submucosa contains nerves including the submucous plexus (also called Meissner's plexus), blood vessels and elastic fibres with collagen, that stretches with increased capacity but maintains the shape of the intestine. The muscular layer surrounds the submucosa. It comprises layers of smooth muscle in longitudinal and circular orientation that also helps with continued bowel movements (peristalsis) and the movement of digested material out of and along the gut. In between the two layers of muscle lies the myenteric plexus (also called Auerbach's plexus). The serosa/adventitia are the final layers. These are made up of loose connective tissue and coated in mucus so as to prevent any friction damage from the intestine rubbing against other tissue. The serosa is present if the tissue is within the peritoneum, and the adventitia if the tissue is retroperitoneal. Structure The general structure of the intestinal wall When viewed under the microscope, the gastrointestinal wall has a consistent general form, but with certain parts differing along its course. =Mucosa= The mucosa is the innermost layer of the gastrointestinal tract. It surrounds the cavity (lumen) of the tract, and comes into direct contact with digested food (chyme). The mucosa is made up of three layers: * The epithelium is the innermost layer. It is where most digestive, absorptive and secretory processes occur. * The lamina propria, a layer of connective tissue within the mucosa. * The muscularis mucosae, a thin layer of smooth muscle. The epithelium, the most exposed part of the mucosa, is a glandular epithelium with many goblet cells. Goblet cells secrete mucus, which lubricates the passage of food along and protects the intestinal wall from digestive enzymes. In the small intestine, villi are folds of the mucosa that increase the surface area of the intestine. The villi contain a lacteal, a vessel connected to the lymph system that aids in the removal of lipids and tissue fluids. Microvilli are present on the epithelium of a villus and further increase the surface area over which absorption can take place. Numerous intestinal glands as pocket-like invaginations are present in the underlying tissue. In the large intestines, villi are absent and a flat surface with thousands of glands is observed. Underlying the epithelium is the lamina propria, which contains myofibroblasts, blood vessels, nerves, and several different immune cells, and the muscularis mucosa which is a layer of smooth muscle that aids in the action of continued peristalsis and catastalsis along the gut. Epithelium Image of the mucosa of the alt= The lining of the mucosa, called the epithelium, differs along the gastrointestinal tract. The epithelium is described as stratified if it consists of multiple layers of cells, and simple if it is made up of one layer of cells. Terms used to describe the shape of the cells in it - columnar if column-shaped, and squamous if flat. * In the oesophagus, pharynx and external anal canal the epithelium is stratified, squamous and non-keratinising, for protective purposes. * In the stomach, the epithelium is simple columnar, and is organised into gastric pits and glands to deal with secretion. * In the small intestine, epithelium is simple columnar and specialised for absorption. The epithelium is arranged into villi, creating a brush border and increasing the area for absorption. Each cell also has microvilli. it is organised into plicae circulares and villi, and the enterocytes have microvilli. This creates a brush border which greatly increases the surface area for absorption. The epithelium is simple columnar with microvilli. In the ileum there are occasionally Peyer's patches in the lamina propria. Brunner's glands are found in the duodenum but not in other parts of the small intestine. * In the colon, epithelium is simple columnar and without villi. Goblet cells, which secrete mucous, are also present. * The appendix has a mucosa resembling the colon but is heavily infiltrated with lymphocytes. Transition between the different types of epithelium occurs at the junction between the oesophagus and stomach; between the stomach and duodenum, between the ileum and caecum, and at the pectinate line of the anus. =Submucosa= The submucosa consists of a dense and irregular layer of connective tissue with blood vessels, lymphatics, and nerves branching into the mucosa and muscular layer. It contains the submucous plexus, and enteric nervous plexus, situated on the inner surface of the muscular layer. =Muscular layer= Muscular layers of the stomach wall. The muscular layer (also known as the muscularis propria ) consists of two layers of muscle, the inner and outer layer. The muscle of the inner layer is arranged in circular rings around the tract, whereas the muscle of the outer layer is arranged longitudinally. The stomach has an extra layer, an inner oblique muscular layer. Between the two muscle layers are the myenteric or Auerbach's plexus. This controls peristalsis. Activity is initiated by the pacemaker cells (interstitial cells of Cajal). The gut has intrinsic peristaltic activity (basal electrical rhythm) due to its self-contained enteric nervous system. The rate can of course be modulated by the rest of the autonomic nervous system. The layers are not truly longitudinal or circular, rather the layers of muscle are helical with different pitches. The inner circular is helical with a steep pitch and the outer longitudinal is helical with a much shallower pitch. The coordinated contractions of these layers is called peristalsis and propels the food through the tract. Food in the GI tract is called a bolus (ball of food) from the mouth down to the stomach. After the stomach, the food is partially digested and semi-liquid, and is referred to as chyme. In the large intestine the remaining semi-solid substance is referred to as faeces. The circular muscle layer prevents food from travelling backward and the longitudinal layer shortens the tract. The thickness of the muscular layer varies in each part of the tract: * In the colon, for example, the muscular layer is much thicker because the faeces are large and heavy, and require more force to push along. The outer longitudinal layer of the colon thins out into 3 discontinuous longitudinal bands, known as taeniae coli (bands of the colon). This is one of the 3 features helping to distinguish between the large and small intestine. * Occasionally in the large intestine (2-3 times a day) there will be mass contraction of certain segments, moving a lot of faeces along. This is generally when one gets the urge to defecate. * The pylorus of the stomach has a thickened portion of the inner circular layer: the pyloric sphincter. Alone among the GI tract, the stomach has a third layer of muscular layer. This is the inner oblique layer, and helps churn the chyme in the stomach. =Serosa and adventitia= The outermost layer of the gastrointestinal wall consists of several layers of connective tissue and is either adventitia or serosa. Regions of the gastrointestinal tract within the peritoneum (called Intraperitoneal) are covered with serosa. This structure consists of connective tissue covered by a simple squamous epithelium, called the mesothelium, which reduces frictional forces during digestive movements. The intraperitoneal regions include most of the stomach, first part of the duodenum, all of the small intestine, caecum and appendix, transverse colon, sigmoid colon and rectum. In these sections of the gut there is clear boundary between the gut and the surrounding tissue. These parts of the tract have a mesentery. Regions of the gastrointestinal tract behind the peritoneum (called retroperitoneal) are covered with adventitia. They blend into the surrounding tissue and are fixed in position (for example, the retroperitoneal section of the duodenum usually passes through the transpyloric plane). The retroperitoneal regions include the oral cavity, esophagus, pylorus of the stomach, distal duodenum, ascending colon, descending colon and anal canal. Clinical significance The gastrointestinal wall can be affected in a number of conditions. An ulcer is something that's eroded through the epithelium of the wall. Ulcers that affect the tract include peptic ulcers and perforated ulcer is one that has eroded completely through the layers. The gastrointestinal wall is inflamed in a number of conditions. This is called esophagitis, gastritis, duodenitis, ileitis, and colitis depending on the parts affected. It can be due to infections or other conditions, including coeliac disease, and inflammatory bowel disease affects the layers of the gastrointestinal tract in different ways. Ulcerative colitis involves the colonic mucosa. Crohn's disease may produce inflammation in all layers in any part of the gastrointestinal tract and so can result in transmural fistulae. Invasion of tumours through the layers of the gastrointestinal wall is used in staging of tumour spread. This affects treatment and prognosis. The normal thickness of the small intestinal wall is 3‚Äì5 mm, Updated: Sep 22, 2016 and 1‚Äì5 mm in the large intestine. Focal, irregular and asymmetrical gastrointestinal wall thickening suggests a malignancy. Segmental or diffuse gastrointestinal wall thickening is most often due to ischemic, inflammatory or infectious disease.

He played college football at Bowling Green. He was signed by the Minnesota Vikings as an undrafted free agent in 2012. He has also played for the Spokane Shock of the Arena Football League. Bowling Green State University Jorden transferred to BG after playing two years at Hudson Valley Community College, where he set school records receptions and yards.http://www.bgsufalcons.com/roster.aspx?rp_id=3538 In 2010, he earned First-Team All-MAC in his first season with the Falcons while leading the MAC with 96 receptions and chipped in with 1,109 receiving yards and four touchdowns (both third-best in school history). Set a career-high 14 catches for 168 yards at Tulsa in Week 3. Had big games against Temple (12 balls for 143 yards), Ohio (8 catches for 129 yards and 2 touchdowns) and Western Michigan (8 catches for 114 yards and a score). In 2011, he continued his success his senior year earning First-Team All-MAC honors again becoming the first BGSU player since Kory Lichtensteiger in 2004 to be a back-to-back 1st Team All-MAC performer. Finished the year with 78 receptions for 1,089 yards and 12 touchdowns which was fourth-best in school history and made him the first Bowling Green receiver with multiple 1000 yard receiving seasons. Set a career-high 203 yards to go along with 12 catches at Kent State. Had 100-yard games versus Western Michigan (4‚Äì103), Toledo (7‚Äì106), Wyoming (9‚Äì101) and Northern Illinois (8‚Äì152). Caught touchdowns in nine different games and had at least four catches in 11 contests.http://bgsufalcons.com/roster.aspx?rp_id=3538 Concluding his senior season he ended 8th All-Time on Bowling Green's Receptions leaders list in only two seasons. Professional career=Minnesota Vikings= After going undrafted in the 2012 NFL Draft Jorden signed with the Minnesota Vikings on April 29, 2012. However, he was unable to make the final roster after suffering an injury in training camp. He was released by the Vikings on August 27. = Spokane Shock = Jorden opted to play for the Spokane Shock of the Arena Football League for their 2013 season (March‚ÄìJuly). In one season in the AFL he caught 95 passes for 1,082 yards with 26 touchdowns. = Calgary Stampeders = Following the conclusion of the 2013 AFL season, nearing the close of the CFL season Jorden signed onto the practice roster of the Calgary Stampeders of the Canadian Football League. Following the season Jorden was released so he could pursue NFL opportunities. = Minnesota Vikings (II) = Jorden signed a future/reserve contract with the Minnesota Vikings on January 4, 2014, and a full contract on March 1, 2014.http://www.twincities.com/vikings/ci_24840200/vikings-sign-free-agents- kamar-jorden-josh-samuda He was released prior to final roster cut down on August 25, 2014. = Calgary Stampeders (II) = Similar to a year prior Jorden once again signed on with the Calgary Stampeders late in the 2014 CFL season. Jorden played in one game during the season, catching one pass for 7 yards. In his second season in the league Jorden only played in two games, catching 2 passes for 6 yards. He was however a contributor in the Stamps pre- season games. Jorden and the Stamps agreed to a contract extension on January 12, 2016. The 2016 season would prove to be a breakout year for Jorden as he played in 9 games catching 42 passes for 580 yards with 3 touchdowns. In two post-season contests, Jorden had a total of 10 receptions for 127 yards and a catch for a two-point convert. Set to become a free-agent he was re-signed by the Stamps again in early January 2017. Jorden followed up his breakout 2016 season with a strong 2017 campaign, despite missing eight games with injury: He caught 52 passes for 717 yards with six touchdowns. He had a very strong performance in the playoffs as well, catching 12 passes for 228 yards and one touchdown in two games. However, Jorden's fumble late in the 105th Grey Cup game, returned 109 yards for an Argonaut touchdown, was arguably the turning point in a contest that found the Stampeders once again on the losing side. On December 15, 2017 the Stamps announced they had agreed to a contract extension with Jorden. On August 25, 2018 Jordan set the Stampeders record for most receiving yards in a single game with 249, surpassing the previous record of 237 by Herm Harrison. Jordan had another exceptional season in 2018 and was second in the league in receiving yards (944) in early September when it was announced he would miss the remainder of the season with a torn ACL. Following the season the Stamps and Jorden agreed to a two-year contract extension; which prevented him from becoming a free agent the following month.

History Yorkville, Illinois was founded in 1833 when Earl Adams built a log cabin on the south side of the Fox River. As the area developed, the river split the population into Bristol, north of the river, and Yorkville to the south. Yorkville and Bristol remained separate communities through the 1880s. During that decade, however, Yorkville and Bristol officials agreed to form a single school district.http://gis.hpa.state.il.us/pdfs/201182.pdf The Yorkville School was the first large school building in the area and held classes from first grade through high school. Grade school students were largely drawn from the two communities, but high school students would attend from as far as away. Despite the name, the school was built in what was then still called Bristol. Yorkville residents filed a lawsuit to stop construction, but the district was able to construct the building before the case went to court. It replaced an 1830s one-room schoolhouse on the south side of the river and an 1850s four- room school building on the north side. Bristol was later merged into Yorkville. A large addition on the east side was built in 1907. Yorkville High School was built in 1959. The old Yorkville School continued to house grade and middle schools for another nine years. In 1968, the school building became home to Waubonsee Community College, who renamed the structure Parkview School. Waubonsee later moved to Sugar Grove, Illinois. The building was still used for grade school classes until 1991. The building is now used by Parkview Christian Academy as its main campus and houses grade levels Preschool through 5th grade.

History  In the early 1990s, the BTR-90 was developed as a replacement for the BTR-80 in the Russian Army. While it was a moderate improvement in armament, protection, mobility, and internal space over its predecessor, it all came at the cost of greatly increased unit price. It wasn't accepted into service (except in small numbers) as the modest increase in performance wasn't seen as enough justification for its cost and complexity. Purchases of the BTR-80 stopped in 2010 and the improved BTR-82 was obtained as a stop-gap measure. In mid-2011, the Russian Ministry of Defense issued a requirement for a new modular wheeled family of armored vehicles instead of buying the BTR-90. Development of a new wheeled APC is being done alongside the new and similarly armed and armored but tracked Kurganets-25 infantry fighting vehicle and heavy T-15 Armata IFV.Bumerang ‚Äì Military-Today.comBumerang [Boomerang] ‚Äì Globalsecurity.org In November 2011, media reports said the new project had been approved. On 21 February 2012, Colonel General Alexander Postnikov said that the Russian Army would be taking the first deliveries of the Bumerang prototype in 2013. Large- scale deliveries are to begin in 2015. At least 2,000 Bumerang vehicles are to replace the BTR-80 and BTR-82/A in Russian service.Russian Army to Get Boomerangs in 2013 ‚Äì En.Ria.ru, 21 February 2012 The Bumerang was first seen in public (initially with its turret and cannon shrouded) during rehearsals for the 2015 Moscow Victory Day Parade.  Design  Rear view of the Bumerang with the two waterjets visible MIC, claims it ‚Äúwill be nothing like any of the modern APCs.‚Äù The Bumerang vehicle will be based on Armata Universal Combat Platform. It'll be amphibious and be able to negotiate and overcome water obstacles using two waterjets. In a departure with the previous BTR (Like BTR-70) series of vehicles, the engine will be located in the front instead of the rear. Engine location was a significant drawback of BTR vehicles, where soldiers had to exit the vehicles through cramped side doors. The Bumerang has rear doors and roof hatches for troop entry and exit. It will likely have a crew of three consisting of the driver, gunner, and commander and hold seven troops. Protection will come from ceramic armor and technologies to prevent shell splinters. Like BTRs, the Bumerang will be an 8√ó8 wheeled vehicle, and will be equipped with a 750 hp turbocharged diesel engine.  Armament  Several components and subsystems will be interchangeable between the Bumerang APC and Kurganets-25 IFV, and both vehicles will be powered by the same engine.First prototype of the Russian wheeled armoured personnel carrier Boomerang will be ready for 2013 ‚Äì Armyrecognition.com, 7 July 2012 There are two versions of the Bumerang 8√ó8 vehicle: the K-16 armored personnel carrier (APC), lightly armed with a 12.7 mm machine gun in a small remote turret; and the K-17 infantry fighting vehicle (IFV), heavily armed with the Bumerang-BM RWS with a 30 mm cannon and Kornet-EM anti-tank missiles or AU-220M with 57 mm BM-57 autocannon and 7.62mm PKMT machine gun.New version of Russian K-16 and K-17 Bumerang were unveiled during military parade in Smolino ‚Äì Armyrecognition.com, 2 August 2016  Variants  The VPK-7829 Bumerang is referred to as \\"a combat wheeled vehicle\\" because it will serve several different roles, similar to America's Strykers.

He is most widely remembered as the husband of \\"Shaheed Janani\\" (Mother of Martyrs) Jahanara Imam and as the father of Guerrilla fighter Shafi Imam Rumi. He is a character in Jahanara Imam's famous memoir Ekattorer Dingulee (, ). Biography Sharif Imam was a Civil engineer. In 1948 he married Jahanara Imam, whom he met in Rangpur while studying at Carmichael College. They settled in Dhaka.  Role in War of Liberation  In 1971, following the Pakistan army crackdown on 25 March, the Bangladesh Liberation War broke out. Many joined the liberation struggle, including Imam's elder son Shafi Imam Rumi, who joined the Mukti Bahini to become a Mukti Joddha (Freedom Fighter). During the war, Imam's wife Jahanara Imam wrote a diary on her feelings about the struggle. This later became one of the most important publications about the War of Liberation. Sharif and his friend Sajedur Rahman collected and sent money to the freedom fighters. At the end of June, 1971, Shahadat Chowdhury and Habibul Alam came to Sharif's house with a letter from Sector-2 commander Major Khaled Mosharraf. Mosharraf asked Sharif information about bridges and culverts of Bangladesh in order to hamper Pakistani occupation army's movement. Patriot Sharif used to provide detail information of the exact points where to set explosives so that the bridge will be damaged but also there will be less damage so that it can be repaired easily after the country is liberated. His son, Rumi took part in many daring actions against Pakistan army. Unfortunately, he was to be picked up by the Pakistani army, never to be seen again. Imam and his younger son Jami, and Jami's cousin were also picked up for interrogation and were tortured. Imam returned home a broken man only to die three days before Bangladesh became free on 16 December 1971. As Yahya Khan was set to announce mass mercy on September 5, 1971 many family relatives instated to ask mercy petition for Rumi to the government. Rumi's parents took the suggestion and thought over it but later decided to not do so because they considered it to be a dishonor to Rumi's views and ideology. Sharif underwent a massive heart-attack on 13 December 1971, was rushed to IPGMR (popularly known as PG hospital, later renamed to BSMMU), where he died at late night because the defibrillator couldn't be used due to a blackout being carried out as an official Indo-Pak war had started a week ago.

Blind from the age of 14, she was one of Bolivia's first Romantic poets and is considered the country's first woman writer following its independence. Her poetry was lauded for its sincerity and lyricism, while its dark and sorrowful content earned her the moniker \\"la Alondra del dolor\\" (the \\"Lark of pain\\"). Biography Mar√≠a Josefa Catalina Estrada Muj√≠a was born in Sucre in 1812Some sources give her year of birth as 1820. See La Raz√≥n to Miguel Muj√≠a and Andrea Estrada. She grew up during the Bolivian War of Independence (1809‚Äì1825) and was the eldest of six brothers. Her early education included Spanish literary classics and the writings of Pedro Calder√≥n de la Barca. Following the death of her father, she became blind at the age of 14. She later underwent eye surgery, to no avail. Her brother Augustus spent afternoons reading religious and literary works to her. He also wrote letters for her and transcribed her poetry. Though she made him promise to keep her works secret, he taught her poem \\"La ciega\\" (\\"Blind Woman\\") to a friend. It was then published in the Eco de la Opini√≥n newspaper in 1850 and became one of Muj√≠a's most celebrated poems. According to Gabriel Ren√© Moreno, after this she participated in a national competition to compose an inscription for the tomb of Sim√≥n Bol√≠var. Muj√≠a suffered from depression following the death of Augustus in 1854. Her mother and two of her other brothers died as well. She ceased composing poetry for a time until her nephew Ricardo Muj√≠a took on the role of transcribing and disseminating her verse. He later remarked on the improvisational nature of her poems, recounting that they were never revised or corrected. Muj√≠a died in Sucre on 30 July 1888. Works Muj√≠a authored over 320 poems and wrote a novel. She translated Italian and French works, including those by Alphonse de Lamartine and Victor Hugo. Her compositions were printed in magazines and newspapers such as El Cruzado. She is considered the first woman writer of Bolivia after its independence and was one of the country's first Romantic poets. Alongside minor poets N√©stor Galindo, Ricardo Jos√© Bustamante, and Manuel Jos√© Tovar, she formed the foundation of Bolivian romanticism. Muj√≠a's personal and sorrowful style of poetry draws on her own blindness. Her melancholic verses betray a deep pessimism and due to the tragic character of her verse, she was referred to as \\"la Alondra del dolor\\" (the \\"Lark of pain\\"). Enrique Finot, in his Historia de la Literatura Boliviana, described her work as being impregnated with a profound sincerity and having a charming simplicity of form. In praise of her poem \\"Arbol de la esperanza\\", Spanish literary critic Marcelino Men√©ndez y Pelayo wrote that her verses had more intimacy of lyrical feeling than anything else in the Parnasso Boliviano.In Historia de la poes√≠a Hispanoamericana Marcelino Men√©ndez y Pelayo wrote \\"De esta infeliz se√±ora (‚Ä¶) a quien su inmenso infortunio presta de todos modos la majestad solemne de la muerte, hay unos sencillos e inspirados versos que quiero poner aqu√≠, porque su forma casi infantil tiene m√°s intimidad de sentimiento l√≠rico que todo lo que he visto del Parnaso boliviano\\". Her body of work was collected by Gustavo Jord√°n R√≠os in 2009 into Mar√≠a Josefa Muj√≠a: Obra Completa.

Its design was considered innovative and the aircraft was viewed as part of a trend of producing safe and economical airplanes, which would appeal especially to automobile drivers. The Swanson Coupe was also designed to function as trainer aircraft. Design and development Swanson's design of the Kari-Keen Coupe monoplane incorporated his trademark seating design of two people in side-by-side configuration which was unusual at the time. Following the first version of the Kari Keen Coupe, Swanson designed the Kari-Keen 90, an improved version. But the Kari-Keen factory fell victim to the Great Depression and by early 1930 it closed its doors. Swanson did not wait for long and left Kari-Keen to devote his time to the design of his Swanson Coupe W-15. The cockpit of W-15 In 1931, after he left Kari-Keen, Swanson established the Swanson Aircraft Co. Inc. with headquarters at Hopewell, Virginia, and built the Swanson Coupe W-15 whose design incorporated new breakthroughs such as a new type of patented wing mounting structure which enabled unobstructed view from the cockpit to both pilot and passenger even from above their heads. The new wing mounting technique also increased the peripheral field of view of the cabin. This was accomplished by eliminating an extra wing span which used to enter the cabin area and obstruct the ceiling of the cockpit thus limiting the overhead field of vision. The Swanson Coupe Model W-15 has been described as \\"beautiful\\", and its cantilever wing design has been called \\"ingenious\\". The plane was certified by the United States Department of Commerce and was powered by the Warner Scarab engine, which produced 85 h.p. at 1950 rpm. The Kari-Keen Coupe and the Swanson Coupe featured the characteristic Swanson cantilever wing design. The Swanson planes also shared a similar seating configuration; the two-passengers were seated beside each other. Model W-15 featured detachable passenger-side controls which could be mounted or removed depending on whether a student pilot was present. This design feature made the plane suitable for use in flight schools. The cabin windshield was made using safety glass and the door window panes were retractable. The plane had two variants: Standard and Deluxe. Both variants had dual flight controls, low pressure tires and mohair interior. Both models featured dual engine throttle controls: the main throttle control and a secondary throttle control button installed on the brake lever. The Deluxe came with an electric starter and more elaborate instrumentation. The prices were $4,450 for the Standard model and $4,985 for the Deluxe. Impact Swanson did not have any commercial success with his Swanson Coupe. He subsequently decided to dissolve his aircraft company and went to the midwest to join the aircraft company of his friend Ole Fahlin. The Swanson Coupe became the basis of the first airplane produced jointly by them, the Fahlin SF-1. The Swanson Coupe was mentioned in a 1931 article of The Tuscaloosa News as an example of a closed-cabin, safe and economical airplane which was intended for use by \\"average men\\" who also drive cars.

Tilles was the older brother to Cap Tilles, a St. Louis capitalist and philanthropist. During his career, Tilles became a prolific entrepreneur and established a variety of businesses in manufacturing, insurance, brokerage, telephone communications, local theatrical production, and commercial property. He was also involved in charitable activities, most notably supportive of tuberculosis care, in memory of his younger brother Manny who died of the disease as a teenager.  Early life  Tilles was born in St. Louis, Missouri; the eldest of five children to Melech \\"Louis\\" Tilles (February 13, 1829 ‚Äì September 11, 1875) and Rosalie Peck (1837 ‚Äì August 10, 1872) His parents met and married in Kansas before moving to St. Louis. His father was an immigrant from the Austro-Hungarian Empire and his mother an immigrant from neighboring Prussia. The couple moved to St. Louis where Louis worked for a tobacco manufacturing company. Tilles and his two brothers were born in the city during this period. The family subsequently moved to Fort Smith, Arkansas where Tilles' sisters were born. At the age of 13, Tilles' mother died of illness. Three years later, Tilles and his five siblings were orphaned with the death of their father. The four siblings were separated and housed in different residences in Fort Smith. The exception was Andrew and Manny, who were taken in by their Aunt's family, where Manny later died of tuberculosis. As the oldest, George was emancipated at 16 and began his business career on becoming an orphan.  Career  Tilles' father died on his 16th birthday. He inherited the family cigar and manufacturing business in 1875. In 1880, Tilles also created the first telephone exchange in Fort Smith. Two years later, he sold the exchange to the Bell Telephone Company. He subsequently became secretary-treasurer and newspaper editor of the Fort Smith Tribune. Tilles also invested in a number of properties. During his career, he owned a hotel and the Tilles theater. He also founded a box company, a grain and stock brokerage, and an insurance agency. The insurance agency was known as The Equitable Life Insurance Company and its reputation became well enough established that the post office delivered a letter to the office marked: \\"George Tilles, Arkansas.\\"St. Louis Post Dispatch (Friday, February 19, 1897) \\"News\\" St. Louis: St. Louis Post Dispatch, p. 4. Tilles had other career interests than business. In 1906, he ran for a seat in the Arkansas State Senate as a Republican but was unsuccessful. Tilles also became an author, writing the history of Fort Smith from the Civil War to the early 20th century.  Philanthropy  Tilles supported charitable work as a member of the Freemasons. He was one of a committee of seven Masons who worked to create the Arkansas State Tuberculosis Sanatarium at Booneville, Arkansas. Although the institution was to be state owned, the money to create the project was generated through private donations of the Masons. Within three years, the necessary funds were raised and allocated to the state government, where Tilles would regularly visit the children.

Throughout the Edo period, Yonezawa Castle was home to the Uesugi clan, daimy≈ç of Yonezawa Domain.  History  The first castle on this site dates to the middle of the Kamakura period. ≈åe Tokihiro, the younger son of ≈åe no Hiromoto, a senior retainer of the Kamakura shogunate was granted lands in Dewa Province, and in 1238 changed his name to Nagai Tokihiro. The Nagai continued to rule for about 150 years. The Nagai were supplanted in the Sengoku period by the Date clan, and the famed warlord Date Masamune was born at Yonezawa Castle. After Date Masamune defeated the Ashina clan in 1589, he moved his main castle to Kurokawa Castle in Aizu and put Date Munekiyo in charge of Yonezawa. However, Toyotomi Hideyoshi did not agree, and forced Masamune move back to Yonezawa. In 1591, Masamune relocated to Iwadeyama Castle by orders of Hideyoshi, surrendering Yonezawa Castle to Gam≈ç Ujisato. When Ujisato‚Äôs son, Gam≈ç Hideyuki was moved to Utsunomiya in 1597, the castle was turned over to Uesugi Kagekatsu, as part of their vast 1,200,000 koku holdings based in Aizu. The castellan at this time was Naoe Kanetsugu. However, after the Battle of Sekigahara, the Uesugi were stripped of most of their holdings by Tokugawa Ieyasu, and were reduced to a 300,000 koku domain centered on Yonezawa. From 1608-1613, the Uesugi completely renovated the castle. However, due to the reduction in size of their holdings as compared with Aizu and the suspicion with which the clan was viewed by the Tokugawa shogunate, the defensive earthen works were not faced with stone, and donjon was kept to a modest three-stories. The Uesugi also relocated the grave of their founder, Uesugi Kenshin from Echigo Province to within the walls of Yonezawa Castle. In 1664, the clan revenues were halved to 150,000 koku, forcing it to lay off many samurai, and for many others to take up part-time farming. However, the castle remained in the hands of the Uesugi clan until the Meiji restoration. With the Abolition of the han system in 1871, Yonezawa Domain became Yonezawa Prefecture, and in 1872 Uesugi Shrine, honoring the ancestors of the Uesugi clan, was established within the grounds of the castle. All remaining structures were demolished in 1873 and in the second bailey, the present-day Yonezawa city hall was constructed. The main bailey was transformed into a public park in 1874. The Uesugi Shrine was transferred to its present location on top of the site of the donjon in 1876.

The adaptation process generally continues throughout the trial, as prescribed in the trial protocol. Modifications may include dosage, sample size, drug undergoing trial, patient selection criteria and \\"cocktail\\" mix. In some cases, trials have become an ongoing process that regularly adds and drops therapies and patient groups as more information is gained. Importantly, the trial protocol is set before the trial begins; the protocol pre-specifies the adaptation schedule and processes. The aim of an adaptive trial is to more quickly identify drugs or devices that have a therapeutic effect, and to zero in on patient populations for whom the drug is appropriate. A key modification is to adjust dosing levels. Traditionally, non-adverse patient reactions are not considered until a trial is completed.  History  In 2004, a Strategic Path Initiative was introduced by the United States‚Äô Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to modify the way drugs travel from lab to market. This initiative aimed at dealing with the high attrition levels observed in the clinical phase. It also attempted to offer flexibility to investigators to find the optimal clinical benefit without affecting the study's validity. Adaptive clinical trials initially came under this regime. The FDA issued draft guidance on adaptive trial design in 2010. In 2012, the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) recommended that FDA \\"run pilot projects to explore adaptive approval mechanisms to generate evidence across the lifecycle of a drug from the premarket through the postmarket phase.\\" While not specifically related to clinical trials, the Council also recommended that FDA \\"make full use of accelerated approval for all drugs meeting the statutory standard of addressing an unmet need for a serious or lifethreatening disease, and demonstrating an impact on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity, or on a surrogate endpoint, likely to predict clinical benefit.\\" In the 2007‚Äì2009 period, the Department of Biostatistics at the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center was running 89 Bayesian adaptive trials, 36% of the total designed by the faculty. FDA Adaptive Trial Design Guidance The FDA adaptive trial design guidance is a 50-page document covering wide-ranging and important topics ‚Äúsuch as ... what aspects of adaptive design trials (i.e., clinical, statistical, regulatory) call for special consideration, ...when to interact with FDA while planning and conducting adaptive design studies, ... what information to include in the adaptive design for FDA review, and ... issues to consider in the evaluation of a completed adaptive design study.‚Äù Attempts have been made to excerpt the guidance and make it more accessible . Bayesian designs According to FDA guidelines, an adaptive Bayesian clinical trial can involve: * Interim looks to stop or to adjust patient accrual * Interim looks to assess stopping the trial early either for success, futility or harm * Reversing the hypothesis of non-inferiority to superiority or vice versa * Dropping arms or doses or adjusting doses * Modification of the randomization rate to increase the probability that a patient is allocated to the most appropriate treatment (or Arm in the Multi-Armed Bandit model) The Bayesian framework Continuous Individualized Risk Index which is based on dynamic measurements from cancer patients can be effectively used for adaptive trial designs.  Logistics  The logistics of managing traditional, fixed format clinical trials are quite complex. Adapting the design as results arrive adds to the complexity of design, monitoring, drug supply, data capture and randomization. However, according to PCAST \\"One approach is to focus studies on specific subsets of patients most likely to benefit, identified based on validated biomarkers. In some cases, using appropriate biomarkers can make it possible to dramatically decrease the sample size required to achieve statistical significance‚Äîfor example, from 1500 to 50 patients.\\"  Disease targets = Breast cancer = An adaptive trial design enabled two experimental breast cancer drugs to deliver promising results after just six months of testing, far shorter than usual. Researchers assessed the results while the trial was in process and found that cancer had been eradicated in more than half of one group of patients. The trial, known as I-Spy 2, tested 12 experimental drugs. I-SPY 1 For its predecessor I-SPY 1, 10 cancer centers and the National Cancer Institute (NCI SPORE program and the NCI Cooperative groups) collaborated to identify response indicators that would best predict survival for women with high-risk breast cancer. During 2002‚Äì2006, the study monitored 237 patients undergoing neoadjuvant therapy before surgery. Iterative MRI and tissue samples monitored the biology of patients to chemotherapy given in a neoadjuvant setting, or presurgical setting. Evaluating chemotherapy's direct impact on tumor tissue took much less time than monitoring outcomes in thousands of patients over long time periods. The approach helped to standardize the imaging and tumor sampling processes, and led to miniaturized assays. Key findings included that tumor response was a good predictor of patient survival, and that tumor shrinkage during treatment was a good predictor of long-term outcome. Importantly, the vast majority of tumors identified as high risk by molecular signature. However, heterogeneity within this group of women and measuring response within tumor subtypes was more informative than viewing the group as a whole. Within genetic signatures, level of response to treatment appears to be a reasonable predictor of outcome. Additionally, its shared database has furthered the understanding of drug response and generated new targets and agents for subsequent testing. I-SPY 2 I-SPY 2 is an adaptive clinical trial of multiple Phase 2 treatment regimens combined with standard chemotherapy. I-SPY 2 linked 19 academic cancer centers, two community centers, the FDA, the NCI, pharmaceutical and biotech companies, patient advocates and philanthropic partners. The trial is sponsored by the Biomarker Consortium of the Foundation for the NIH (FNIH), and is co-managed by the FNIH and QuantumLeap Healthcare Collaborative. I-SPY 2 was designed to explore the hypothesis that different combinations of cancer therapies have varying degrees of success for different patients. Conventional clinical trials that evaluate post-surgical tumor response require a separate trial with long intervals and large populations to test each combination. Instead, I-SPY 2 is organized as a continuous process. It efficiently evaluates multiple therapy regimes by relying on the predictors developed in I-SPY 1 that help quickly determine whether patients with a particular genetic signature will respond to a given treatment regime. The trial is adaptive in that the investigators learn as they go, and do not continue treatments that appear to be ineffective. All patients are categorized based on tissue and imaging markers collected early and iteratively (a patient's markers may change over time) throughout the trial, so that early insights can guide treatments for later patients. Treatments that show positive effects for a patient group can be ushered to confirmatory clinical trials, while those that do not can be rapidly sidelined. Importantly, confirmatory trials can serve as a pathway for FDA Accelerated Approval. I-SPY 2 can simultaneously evaluate candidates developed by multiple companies, escalating or eliminating drugs based on immediate results. Using a single standard arm for comparison for all candidates in the trial saves significant costs over individual Phase 3 trials. All data are shared across the industry. I-SPY 2 is comparing 11 new treatments against 'standard therapy', and is estimated to complete in Sept 2017.I-SPY 2 TRIAL: Neoadjuvant and Personalized Adaptive Novel Agents to Treat Breast Cancer By mid 2016 several treatments had been selected for later stage trials.Novel Agents are Targeting Drivers of TNBC - Several drug candidates in I-SPY2 have 'graduated' to later-phase studies. June 2016 = Alzheimer's = Researchers plan to use an adaptive trial design to help speed development of Alzheimer's disease treatments, with a budget of 53 million euros. The first trial under the initiative was expected to begin in 2015 and to involve about a dozen companies.  Risks  Shorter trials may not reveal longer term risks, such as a cancer's return.

Today, the it is a surname used also by Swedish commoners. The founder of the noble family was Matthias or Theis Eden (1568‚Äì1636), a citizen and brewer of Bremen, whose wife was also called Eden. Their son Claus Eden belonged to the cavalry in L√ºneburg. He then moved to Stockholm, and later to Uppsala, where he became a merchant (handlande), a citizen of Sweden and a city councilor. In that capacity, Claus Eden was knighted with the name of Edenberg in 1654 and enrolled in Riddarhuset (\\"House of Nobility\\"), with the registration number 617. He thereafter bought the manors of Kiplingeberg and K√§ttslinge in Uppland and Brunnby in Sk√•ne. He was married twice. His first wife was Gertrude Sulchen, a daughter of a German citizen in Stockholm. In 1652, Claus Edenberg married Anna Schrodera, daughter of a \\"castle secretary\\" (slottssekreterar) Ericus Benedicti Schroderus (Erik Benedict Schroder), a brother of Lars Bengtsson Skytte and Johan Skytte. His new wife had previously been married to Sveno Jonae Westrogothus, a professor at Uppsala University. All the children of the second marriage died in infancy but the first marriage bore fifteen children, including daughters married to the Leijel, Gyldenbring and Silfverstr√∂m families. A son, Jacob, was smothered to death by his nurse. Three other sons were married. The son Claes Edenberg was a shipyard master (holmmajor), who married to Ms. Rosenfelt, with whom he had two daughters, who married to the Mentzer and St√•lhandske families. Mathias Edenberg (1640‚Äì1709) was a legation secretary in England and the Netherlands. His first marriage was with Ms. Lilljemarck, but his only children came from his second marriage with Ms. Clo, whose mother's family was Bj√∂rnklou. Mathias Edenberg's only son died in infancy, but he also had two daughters. The daughter Catharina was married to Mathias' relative on the mother's side, Jakob Benzelius, the Archbishop of Uppsala. Catharina's younger sister was engaged to marry the archbishop's brother Gustaf Benzelstierna, but ‚Äì according to Gabriel Anrep ‚Äì \\"allowed herself to be laid by a rider\\" (l√§t under tiden l√§gra sig af en Ryttare) for which she was however pardoned by the King of Sweden, Frederick I. Claes and Mathias Edenberg's brother Herman Edenberg was a district judge who died childless. The dynasty therefore ended in 1715 with the death of Herman Edenberg, without any male heirs left. In modern times, the surname has resurfaced, however, by 50 persons in Sweden as of 2014, with no known connection to the afore-described noble family.

Based in the universe of Hussie's MS Paint Adventures webcomic Homestuck, it focuses on a girl who is accidentally transported to the planet of Alternia‚Äîhome of the troll species seen in Homestuck. It is the first of two games, with a planned second, future installment titled Hauntswitch featuring a male troll who was swapped onto Earth in her place. The game was the subject of a crowdfunding campaign on Kickstarter, raising over in funding. While development initially began with developers The Odd Gentlemen, it was eventually moved back in-house under What Pumpkin's own newly formed game development studio. Act 1 was slated for release in mid-2015; however, this release date was postponed until January 2017. It was further delayed in January to an unspecified date. On September 14, 2017, What Pumpkin Studios released Act 1. This was the release date previously announced on August 29, 2017, accompanied by a new trailer.  Story  Hiveswap tells the story of a human girl named Joey Claire, who gets swapped with a troll boy named Dammek from the planet Alternia, as she tries to get back to Earth. A second game, Hauntswitch, will feature Dammek's adventures on Earth. While set in the same universe as the Homestuck comic, Hiveswap and the sequel exist in a separate storyline with only \\"loose relation\\" to the comic, and involve a new cast of characters.  Development  On September 4, 2012, Andrew Hussie announced a Kickstarter to raise funds for a video game based on his MS Paint Adventures webcomic Homestuck. Development was to begin in 2013, with the finished product expected in 2014. Kotaku noted that the project had raised \\"more than $275,000 in hours\\". More than 80% of the $700,000 goal was pledged in the first day. At the time the article went to print, the Kickstarter had been running for just over one day. The game reached the full $700,000 of funding in fewer than 32 hours. The campaign also reached certain \\"stretch goal\\" amounts, whereupon Hussie added Mac and Linux support onto the proposed game. Digital Trends writer Graeme McMillan commented that the campaign was approaching, at the time, the record for most successful comics-related Kickstarter campaign, whose previous record was held by the Order of the Stick campaign with $1,254,120. The Kickstarter eventually raised $2,485,506, making it the \\"fifth game on Kickstarter to pull in a full seven figures\\" and the third highest funded video game in Kickstarter history at the time. An additional PayPal-based fundraiser was created to accommodate those who could not donate via Kickstarter's available methods. In December 2013, new details, a projected release date of June 2014, and concept art were posted on the game's Kickstarter blog. In the post, Hussie revealed that the game would effectively be a spin-off from the comic, with a new plot and characters that will only have loose ties to the original storyline, making it more accessible to those who are unfamiliar with the original story. Hussie also indicated that the game will not include any voice acting; he considered voice acting \\"too easy to do badly\\", and stated that he was \\"personally not that big on VA in games like this anyway\\". On June 21, 2014, it was publicly announced that the game would be developed by The Odd Gentlemen‚Äîknown for their game The Misadventures of P.B. Winterbottom. New concept art, including that of another new character, were also revealed. In an interview with Game Informer show, Undertale developer Toby Fox, who has worked with Hussie in the past, announced that he was contacted to write music for \\"the Homestuck video game\\". On October 30, 2014, it was announced that the game's official title would be Hiveswap, and that production of the game had been taken back in-house \\"alarmingly well\\" under Hussie's What Pumpkin studio. It was also announced that the game would be the first of two distinct stories: each will be an episodic story, but there will be parallels between them, and they can be played in either order. On December 26, 2015, updates were posted on the project's Kickstarter page stating that the game was going to be using a 2D system rather than using the 3D graphics shown in the teaser trailer, asset reel, and other footage. It is stated that this is \\"to make things a little more cost-efficient, and more rapidly producible over the full span of the series\\". On October 6, 2016, a teaser trailer was released showcasing the game's changes to the 2D system and other various elements of the game, including combat and interactive objects. A release date for the first act was set to January 2017, but was delayed for a non-specific number of weeks. The game was greenlit on Steam on December 15, 2016, and showcased a number of in-game screenshots. On April 13, 2017 (Homestucks 8th anniversary), another trailer for the game was released, this time showing parts of Alternia as well as more gameplay. On September 14, 2017, Act 1 of Hiveswap was released for Windows and Mac. A patch added Linux support on October 16, 2017. Promotion for Act 2 includes the \\"Troll Call,\\" a feature of troll characters slated to appear in the installment, and the \\"Extended Zodiac\\", a feature of 288 symbols, including the original astrological signs as used by Homestuck characters, as well as symbols used by Hiveswap characters, complemented by a personality quiz to determine the quiz taker's Extended Zodiac sign. The characters from the Troll Call were later featured in a spinoff video game called Hiveswap Friendship Simulator. Starting on September 4, 2019, a sequel to Hiveswap Friendship Simulator called Pesterquest began. The story picks up where Hiveswap Friendship Simulator ended and it follows MSPA Reader (the playable character) as they interact with the kids and the trolls from the original webcomic Homestuck, such as John Egbert and Karkat Vantas. On October 31, 2019, the first teaser trailer for Hiveswap: Act 2 was unveiled, with a targeted release date in 2020.

Origin and design The L class were designed to provide improved performance over the successful F class on faster passenger services and were built by the Avonside Engine Co.. All entered service in 1878 and were used on important passenger trains on the Auckland and Wellington Sections. Although the G class, designed with a similar purpose in mind suffered from poor adhesion, the L was more successful in terms of performance. They were used intensively and provided solid service, although they were not used on passenger services for long due to their small size.  Modifications  NZR began an intensive programme of rebuilding older tank locomotives to attempt to extract improved performance. Parts from seven locomotives were used in this programme, being initially fitted with a leading bogie turning them into LA Class 4-4-0T's then later with larger coal bunkers to 4-4-2T's. The remaining three unmodified locomotives were sold to the Public Works Department (PWD) in the early 1900s. Sales and disposals While all of the rebuilt L class had been officially withdrawn by 1939, the three unmodified locomotives sold to the PWD went on to have much longer careers. No. 507 (formerly 207 in NZR service) was sold to the Taranaki Harbour Board in 1931, and numbers 508 and 509 (formerly 208 and 219) were sold to Wilson's Portland Cement, an industrial plant south of Whangarei. All three ended up working at Portland until the 1970s, when they were around 95 years old. They were then all donated for preservation where all three remain operational.

History and architecture Prior to the construction of the church, a 16th-century wooden church used to stand on the same point of the modern-day church. According to a description left on a stone in one of the internal walls of the church, Holy Mother of God was built in 1767 with the initiation of Catholicos Simeon I of Yerevan. The church belongs to the type of single nave basilicas with no dome. Many khachkars (cross stones) composed during the 18th century, were placed in the external walls of the church. The churchyard was home to a religious school. During the Soviet period, the church remained active and witnessed a major renovation in 1986 through the efforts of Catholicos Vazgen I, when a belfry was built at the entrance as it never had a belfry prior to this renovation. With the establishment of the Diocese of Armavir in 1996, the church has served as the seat of the diocese until 2014, when it was moved to the newly built Saint Gregory of Narek Church in the town of Armavir.

Popular demonstrations in Phnom Penh have taken place against the government of Prime Minister Hun Sen, triggered by widespread allegations of electoral fraud during the Cambodian general election of 2013. Demands to raise the minimum wage to $160 a month and resentment at Vietnamese influence in Cambodia have also contributed to the protests. The main opposition party refused to participate in parliament after the elections, and major demonstrations took place throughout December 2013. A government crackdown in January 2014 led to the deaths of 4 people and the clearing of the main protest camp. Cambodian protests may have been partly precipitated by the perception of corruption, lack of freedom and poor quality of life in the country. Cambodia is near the bottom of international rankings in the measurement of those factors. Inequality in the distribution of wealth is a recognized problem, as is the statistic that a third of children are malnourished, and the difficulty that government critics are rounded up and detained on dubious charges.https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/07/opinion/cambodias-subservient- judiciary.html?_r=0 Retrieved June-07-2014 Cambodia's strongman Hun Sen has affirmed his 'pre-eminence' by closing Freedom Park, an opposition protest site in central Phnom Penh that is now strictly off limits to the public and appears to be like a 'fortified military base'. Cambodians are 'riled by incessant land grabs, official corruption and labor disputes in a country tightly controlled by one man for nearly three decades.' Freedom Park, is closed now indefinitely. Protests have now \\"fizzled out after a crackdown on factory strikes in January that killed at least four people and alarmed major clothing brands with interests in Cambodia, like Adidas, Nike and Gap. \\"Since then, anti-government protests intended to draw hundreds of thousands of people have attracted just a few hundred. Freedom Park was shut down in April. \\"In general, people I've seen and talked to in villages, just want change of national leadership,\\" said Kem Ley, an independent political analyst. \\"But what the CNRP has been doing is the same thing, again and again,\\" Ley said, referring to the calls for protests. \\"People are just tired and afraid because of the government's shameless use of violence.\\"  Garment Workers  Most of the protesters were women working in garment factories as they strongly believed the wages paid are unacceptable. The workers were demanding for higher wages and better working conditions such as basic health care, protection etc. There are approximately 700,000 workers in the garment sector with 90% of the workers are female. The female are not only protesting from a workers‚Äô perspective, but also from the role of women as gender Inequality is a huge issue in Cambodia. Cambodian women workers play a huge role in supporting the economy for Cambodia at 67.72% of the GDP is from exports of goods and services and 87% are manufactured goods. Background=2013 general election= On 28 July 2013 general elections were held in Cambodia, with the ruling Cambodian People's Party (CPP) claiming victory with 68 seats. The Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP), the main opposition party with 55 seats, rejected the results and boycotted the opening of parliament, claiming there had been irregularities with the voting. The E.U. and U.S. also expressed concern about possible fraud, and the international non-governmental organisation Human Rights Watch called for an 'independent commission' to investigate allegations of election fraud. The opposition party organised large protests in Phnom Penh during December, including motorbike rallies. The government called the protests illegal and stated that they were 'inciting anarchy'. =Historical and economic resentment= The protest also had the aim against Vietnam, in part due to historical role of Vietnam in Cambodian affairs. Vietnamese influence began to spread to Cambodia at the 13th century, but it did not come directly until 19th century. However, Vietnam has begun to intervene to Cambodia since 17th century, notably with the overthrown of Cambodia's only Muslim ruler, Ramathipadi I.Kiernan 2008, p. 158. Continuing Vietnamese influence also met with strong Siamese response, but in 19th century, Vietnam finally consolidated influence in Cambodia and annexed entire of Mekong Delta. Attempt by Vietnam to assimilate Khmers into the country often met with strong hostility, but Vietnamese influence continued to remain in Cambodia, even during the French colonization. Then, in 1949, French President Vincent Auriol confirmed Mekong Delta to be part of Vietnam, and this was the source for eventual tensions. In 20th century, both Vietnamese and Cambodian nationalists cooperated together to overthrow the French rule, however the Cambodian nationalists were distrustful of Vietnamese counterparts, thinking that it was an attempt by Vietnam to create the greater Indochina under Vietnamese influence. This led to eventual hostility launched by Lon Nol and Pol Pot, with the latter being the most severe one due to his open hatred on Vietnam. Khmer Krom nationalists also sought to free Mekong Delta from Vietnamese influence, complicated with the ongoing Vietnam War. Following the defeat of South Vietnam at 1975, the communist movements in both two countries dominated political affairs, but the Khmer Rouge and Vietnamese communists became increasingly hostile to each other, leading to the Cambodian‚ÄìVietnamese War in which Vietnam occupied Cambodia for ten years. For this reason, the fear against Vietnam is permanent in Cambodia.https://thediplomat.com/2018/12/vietnams-invasion-of-cambodia- revisited/ Similar to historical reason, economics is also another reason. Since the demise of Khmer Empire, Vietnam has been economically dominant. Even when both countries were equally destroyed by the end of Vietnam War, but Vietnamese reforms of 1986 quickly redeveloped the country. As for the result, the Vietnamese economy became increasingly globalized and expands, thus has reasserted its dominance in Cambodia, and Vietnamese economic domination often brought resentment to Cambodians, who always thought Vietnam to be the sin of Cambodian nation. Culturally, Vietnam also has a greater reputation and is increasingly more open, while Cambodia has fluctuated over the Khmer Empire's historical pride and economic inferiority, and the lack of cultural common between two countries, since Cambodia is an Indianized nation while Vietnam is part of the Sinosphere, further escalated the hostility. Protests and violence On Friday 3 January, military police fired at protesting garment workers on Veng Sreng Street, Por Senchey District, in the outskirts on Phnom Penh, killing at least 4 people and injuring more than 20. The protesters blocked the road and had thrown bottles and rocks at the police in retaliation for violence towards other protesters and priests earlier during the day. The workers were on strike over the government's refusal to raise the minimum wage to $160 a month. There was also violence towards Vietnamese Cambodians by protesters, leading to the destruction of a Vietnamese-owned coffee shop. Just days before the crackdown took place, Prime Minister Hun Sen made a state visit to the Socialist Republic of Vietnam. The opposition has accused the premier of seeking military aid from Vietnam. CNRP Vice President Kem Sokha said Hun Sen might use the trip to seek Vietnam's support to hold on to power, adding that the premier should discuss the country's problems with Cambodians instead of foreign leaders. On Saturday 4 January, Cambodian authorities entered the main protest camp and used violence to disperse protesters. Further protests were also banned. Opposition leaders were summoned to the Phnom Penh Municipal Court for questioning for having allegedly incited striking workers to 'disrupt social order'. In February 2014, the ban on demonstrations was lifted but Prime Minister Hun Sen warned that any future anti-government demonstrations by the opposition party would be met by rallies of his own supporters. On 8 July 2014, protesters gathered in front of the Vietnamese embassy in Phnom Penh to protest against the disputed Khmer Krom territory loss to Vietnam in 1949 and calling for Vietnam to apologize. The embassy issued a statement on 9 July, calling for Cambodia to respect Vietnam's sovereignty and independence and refused to apologize. The protest was later dispersed by local authorities, leaving 10 injured. On 15 July 2014, approximately 200 opposition protesters marched at Phnom Penh's Freedom Park when another violence erupted, only with the tables turned. This time, Daun Penh District security forces were beaten severely by protesters, resulting in at least 8 guards injured. The hospitalized security guards called for justice and condemned the opposition for the violence. Six opposition MPs-elect were arrested, including protest leader Mu Sochua. On 17 July, CNRP vice president Kem Sokha was summoned to the Phnom Penh Municipal Court. On 19 July, opposition leader Sam Rainsy returned to Cambodia from his month-long trip to Europe due to the political crisis. He met with prime minister Hun Sen on 22 July, where the CNRP agreed to enter parliament, ending the longest political crisis in Cambodian history. Aftermath and agreement The Cambodia National Rescue Party agreed to enter parliament after meeting with government officials at the Senate Palace on 22 July 2014. An agreement was signed between both sides to share leadership roles in the National Assembly. The seat of the First Vice President of the National Assembly will be held by a member from the CNRP, and the Second Vice President of the National Assembly will be held by a member from the CPP. The opposition will also chair 5 of the 10 commissions, including the newly established Anti-Corruption Commission. In addition, Sam Rainsy, who was barred from running in the election, was accepted as Member of Parliament. Opposition MPs were then sworn in at the Royal Palace on 5 August 2014. International condemnation and criticism The United Nations and U.S. State Department have condemned the violence. U.S. Congressman Ed Royce called for Prime Minister Hun Sen to step down, saying 'It's time for Hun Sen to end his three-decade grip on power and step down'. In front of the White House, more than 500 Cambodian Americans gather to stage protest, seeking aid from the United States government. They have also demanded the release of the 23 imprisoned on January 3 during the police crackdown. UN rights envoy to Cambodia Surya Subedi visited Cambodia and met with Prime Minister Hun Sen. On 29 January, opposition leader Sam Rainsy went to Geneva where the UN Human Rights Council was reviewing Cambodia's rights record during the second cycle of the Universal Periodic Review of Cambodia. The European Union, Australia, Germany, Poland, Japan, and Thailand have all expressed concerns and worries about human rights in Cambodia. Human Rights Watch called for UN to pressure the Cambodian government.  Gallery  File:Cambodian police.jpgArmed Cambodian riot police.

After four years of college basketball for Saint Louis University, Ellis had a five-year stint in the NBL with the Sydney Kings and Illawarra Hawks. Early life and career Ellis was born and raised in Perth, Western Australia. In 2008 and 2009, he attended the Australian Institute of Sport in Canberra and played for the program's SEABL team. He was also a member of the Under 19 Australian Emus team that finished fourth at the 2009 FIBA Under-19 World Championship. College career Ellis moved to the United States for the 2009‚Äì10 college season to play for the Saint Louis Billikens. He missed the first 14 games of the season before being cleared by the NCAA and joined the team in January 2010. He played in 22 games with 19 starts and averaged 10.5 points and 4.9 rebounds per game. He subsequently earned Atlantic 10 All-Rookie Team honours. As a sophomore in 2010‚Äì11, Ellis played in 21 games for the Billikens before suffering a season- ending dislocated shoulder in February 2011. For the season, he averaged 6.5 points and 3.7 rebounds per game. As a junior in 2011‚Äì12, Ellis managed his first full season while serving as a key sixth man for the Billikens, appearing in every game (34) and coming off the bench in all but one. He averaged 10.1 points per game and led the team with 69 three-pointers made, which tied for the eighth most in a single season at SLU. As a senior in 2012‚Äì13, Ellis earned Atlantic 10 Sixth Man of the Year honours. He appeared in all 35 games off the bench, averaging 10.1 points and 3.5 rebounds per game. He led the team with 62 three-point field goals and was seventh in the A-10 with a .829 free-throw percentage. Ellis ended his career at SLU as one of 27 1,000-point scorers (1,062) in school history, and ranked sixth all-time at SLU in three-pointers made (194) and fourth in attempts (580). Professional career=NBL=Sydney Kings (2013‚Äì2015) On 13 July 2013, Ellis signed a two-year deal with the Sydney Kings of the National Basketball League. However, his arrival in Sydney was delayed until December 2013 while he completed his studies in business at Saint Louis. He made his debut for the Kings on 3 January 2014 against the Cairns Taipans, and in 16 games during the 2013‚Äì14 NBL season, Ellis averaged 5.1 points and 3.1 rebounds per game. On 25 March 2014, the Kings took up the second-year option on Ellis two-year contract, re-signing him for the 2014‚Äì15 season. He scored a career-high 18 points on 17 January 2015 in an 80‚Äì76 loss to the Cairns Taipans. He appeared in all 28 games for the Kings in 2014‚Äì15, averaging 6.9 points and 3.4 rebounds per game. Illawarra Hawks (2015‚Äì2018) On 10 August 2015, Ellis signed with the Illawarra Hawks for the 2015‚Äì16 NBL season. On 17 January 2016, he scored 18 points in the Hawks' 103‚Äì96 double-overtime win over the New Zealand Breakers. In 29 games for the Hawks in 2015‚Äì16, Ellis averaged 6.0 points, 2.6 rebounds and 1.1 assists per game. On 20 April 2016, Ellis re-signed with the Hawks on a two-year deal. He helped the Hawks reach the 2017 NBL Grand Final, where they faced the Perth Wildcats. In game one of the series, Ellis scored a team- and season-high 12 points in an 89‚Äì77 loss. The Hawks went on to lose the best-of-five series in three games. Ellis appeared in all 34 games for the Hawks in 2016‚Äì17, averaging 4.6 points, 1.5 rebounds and 1.1 assists per game. Ellis entered the 2017‚Äì18 NBL season eight kilos lighter. However, a bout of chicken pox kept him out of the NBL pre- season blitz. Ellis started the 2017‚Äì18 season out of the rotation after management at the Hawks sent down the edict to the coaching staff that he wasn't to play. Eventually he hit the floor and finished the season strongly. In 20 games for the Hawks in 2017‚Äì18, he averaged 6.7 points, 1.4 rebounds and 1.0 assists per game. In September 2018, Ellis joined the Cairns Taipans as a pre-season injury replacement for Lucas Walker. =SBL=Stirling/Warwick Senators (2014‚Äìpresent) Every year since 2014, Ellis has played in the State Basketball League (SBL) for the Warwick Senators. Known as the Stirling Senators when he first joined the club, Ellis played in the SBL during the NBL off-seasons before continuing in the league following his NBL tenure. Ellis' first three seasons in the SBL saw him average over 22 points per game. With the league's change from 48-minute games to 40-minute games in 2017, his scoring average dropped to 17 per game, which then dropped to 14.5 and 13.4 in 2018 and 2019 respectively. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020 SBL season was cancelled. Ellis later joined the Senators in July 2020 for the West Coast Classic. He helped Warwick reach the grand final of the West Coast Classic, where they defeated the Perry Lakes Hawks 96‚Äì81 to earn the Senators their first ever title. National team career In June 2013, Ellis was selected in the Australian squad for the Stankoviƒá Cup in China and the Universiade in Russia, where he won gold and silver respectively. Personal Ellis is the son of retired Perth Wildcats legend, Mike Ellis. Ellis and his wife, Lauren, have a son.

She made numerous drawings on rice paper, but was also active as a painter, a poet, and a sculptor. Her work drew upon the art of language and poetry, and what appears to have driven her was the ability to reinvent it.  Early life  Mira Schendel was born Myrrha Dagmar Dub in 1919 in Zurich, Switzerland.Laura Cumming, Mira Schendel ‚Äì review, The Guardian, September 29, 2013Laura Barnett, Mira Schendel: the refugee from Nazi Europe who settled in S√£o Paulo, The Guardian, September 13, 2013 Her father, Karl Leo Dub, was a fabric merchant, and her mother, Ada Saveria B√ºttner, was a milliner. Although she had Jewish heritage, Schendel was baptized at her mother's request at the Kirche St. Peter and Paul, a Catholic church in Zurich, on October 20, 1920 and was raised as a Roman Catholic. Schendel's parents divorced in September 1922, and her mother married Count Tommaso Gnoli in 1937. In the late 1930s, Schendel began to study philosophy at the Universita Cattolica del Sacro Cuore in Milan. During her time in Milan Schendel also attended an art class. Because of racial laws introduced in Fascist Italy in 1938, she was designated as Jewish, stripped of her Italian citizenship and forced to leave university, and so decided to flee Italy in 1939. After travelling through Switzerland and Austria, she joined a group of refugees heading to Sarajevo. After spending the war in Sarajevo, she returned to Italy, with her first husband Josep Hargesheimer, and worked for the International Refugee Organisation in Rome. Having applied to various countries in the Americas, in August of 1949 she emigrated and settled with Josep in Brazil. Mira Schendel's arrival in Brazil ended a tortuous journey. Her significant background perhaps explains the theme of emancipation from the body/mind dialect and the metaphysical experience coinciding found throughout her work. Carvajal, Rina, Alma Ruiz, and Susan Martin. The Experimental Exercise of Freedom: Lygia Clark, Gego, Mathias Goeritz, H√©lio Oiticica, Mira Schendel. Los Angeles: Museum of Contemporary Art, 1999.  Career  When she arrived in S√£o Paulo in 1953, Brazilian modernism was dominated by a debate between figuration and abstraction. During the 1930s and 1940s figurative 'modernismo' had been dominant, but in the late 1940s and early 1950s abstract-geometric art began to be shown in Brazil and led to the founding of the Concrete art movement Ruptura in 1952. In S√£o Paulo, an immigrant city that was industrial and undergoing rapid growth, Schendel found a circle of emigre intellectuals from different disciplines with whom she could discuss ideas about aesthetics and philosophy; this included the Czech-born philosopher Vilem Flusser, the physicist M√°rio Schenberg and the psychoanalyst Theon Spanudis among others. She became a prolific modernist painter and sculptor. She used paint with talc and brick dust, and made many drawings on rice paper. According to Laura Cumming her art has its sources in phenomenology, in the idea of being and nothingness, in mystical thinking and her deep reading of Wittgenstein. But the impact of these works does not depend upon the viewer sharing either that knowledge or those interests. Schendel‚Äôs work features mixtures of calligraphy, phrases, letters, and encrypted traces of language. The graphic output in Schendel‚Äôs paintings explore the relations between language and art, and the inquiry into that relationship reveals itself in the totality of her workButler, Cornelia H., and Alexandra Schwartz. Modern Women: Women Artists at the Museum of Modern Art. New York: Museum of Modern Art, 2010.. Schendel‚Äôs paintings from the mid-1950s depict shallow surfaces, simplified figuartion, and muted tones, and the textures and materials stand out more than the values of the color. These early works suggest a play of opposition between visual elements and the hand of the artist. In the early 1960s, the corporeal component of Schendel‚Äôs paintings began to change as she moved toward a more imprecise and all- embracing involvement with space. In the early 1960s, Schendel received a gift of rice paper from M√°rio Schenberg and in 1964 began to use this to make monotype drawings. Between 1964 and 1966, Schendel produced almost two thousand drawings in oil paintings on fine rice paper, as well as the Monotypes series. The central subject Schendel explored in these notebooks was time, the dimension of language. In Monotypes, Schendel dealt with the desire to dismantle the teleology of language. Schendel‚Äôs technique for these works was to apply paint to a glass laminate, apply a light layer of talcum powder over it to prevent paper from picking it up on contact, then used her fingernails and other points instrumented to draw on paper she would lay on the glass. This technique makes the drawing seem to emerge from within the paper and transforms the text she draws to antitext.P√©rez Oramas, Luis, Le√≥n Ferrari, Mira Schendel, Andrea Giunta, and Rodrigo Naves. Le√≥n Ferrari and Mira Schendel: Tangled Alphabets. New York, N.Y.: Museum of Modern Art, 2009. The lines of Schendel‚Äôs drawings are driven toward writing. The precise inscriptions are linked to letters and words and the gesture of her hand is linked to more general meanings. Her works explore the universality of language. However, later in her career lines lost association with the movement of her hand and gained the generality of concepts as she began to place them in ambiguous situations. She worked rapidly and in little over a year she had made the majority of approximately 2,000 drawings. In these works she also first combined multiple languages, using words and phrases from her principle spoken languages - Italian, German and Portuguese but also adding words in French, English, Croat and Czech. One important group of monotypes was inspired by Karlheinz Stockhausen's Gesang der J√ºnglinge (1955‚Äì1956), an early piece of electronic music that employed vocals drawn from the biblical Book of Daniel. A number of these were included in the 1965 S√£o Paulo Bienal. These drawings included Droguinhas (Little Nothings), c. 1965-68, Trenzinho (Little Train), 1965, and the Objetos graficos (Graphic objects), 1967. After using rice paper in Monotypes and discovering the quality of the material, Schendel began to use it as an autonomous medium itself in her works Droguinhas and Trenzinho. By 1966 Schendel put a hold on painting to create sculptures made from rice paper rolled up into strings that were woven into knots. This technique resulted in shapeless forms. Schendel‚Äôs Trenzinhos and Droguinhas refuse any objecthood as they are sculptures that are humorously without volume or interiority. For the 1969 Bienal de S√£o Paulo, Schendel created Ondas paradas de probabilidade‚ÄîAntigo Testamento, Livro dos Reis, I, 19 (Still waves of probability‚ÄîOld Testament, I Kings 19), an installation consisting of nylon thread and wall text on acrylic sheet which was Schendel's only work of an environmental nature. Mira Schendel also plays against the grain of language. In works such as Droguinhas, Trenzinhos, and Still Waves of Probability, despite the overall repetition and accumulation, Schendel explores language as action, faltering to absolute resistance. According to Sonia Salzstein, in Schendel‚Äôs experience, the subjectivity emerges in the course of a process and therefore, can‚Äôt be reduced to a psychology. Between 1963 and 1969 in Latin America there was a movement aimed at transforming nonobjective abstraction into penetrable forms. A key concept in this repertoire was an experience of density as a penetrable experience. However, penetrable works by Schendel, among others, displace density, transforming it and using it to transcend purely sensory perception and therefore suggesting new dimensions according to Perez-Oramas. Penetrable works by Schendel at the end of the 1960s contributed heavily to the conversion of abstract form into a specific place that began demanding participation from the viewer. Schendel‚Äôs Perfurados creates constellations, clusters, and spiderwebs of light, walls, or undersurfaces shining through their pinpricked surfaces. Although these works are small scale they evoke cosmic dimensions and ethereal distances, but at the same time call attention to the materials in which they are made. Between the late 1960s and the early 1990s, Schendel began making works out of acrylic and hung them from the ceiling, like in her works Discos and Objetos Graficos (Graphic Objects.) These works depict constellations of letters, numbers, and graphic symbols and give the impression of symbols floating in immediate space. In her work Graphic Objects, Schendel pressed graphic letters and symbols on rice paper between sheets of acrylic laminate and displayed them in space. Superimposition, transparency and space were all important to this work, narrating the interplay of chaos and meaning. By the early 1970s, the essential character of Schendel‚Äôs work had emerged with an aesthetic that didn‚Äôt attempt any classification or justification which lead to the most original expressions of contemporary art. In one of Schendel‚Äôs last series, Monochromatics (1986-87,) she coated wooden surfaces with gently modulated plaster and painted in white and black tempera. This produced soft shadows and optical lines that differentiated themselves from the other lines that were drawn in oilstick. Her assistant at the time, Fernando Bento, said that to illustrate where Schendel wanted the lines, she would point to white lines left by passing airplanes in the sky. The contrasting quality of the two lines in this work created doubt about the position of the surface, therefore forcing the viewer to focus on one line at a time.  Personal life  On April 19, 1941, Schendel married Josep Hargesheimer, a Catholic Croatian whom she met in Sarajevo. Schendel received a Croatian passport in 1944. In 1949, she and Hargesheimer emigrated to Brazil together. They lived in Porto Alegre but in 1953 Schendel separated from Josep and moved alone to S√£o Paulo, where she settled. In 1954, she met Knut Schendel, a German emigre and owner of an important bookshop, Canuto, which was a hub for S√£o Paulo's intellectuals. In 1957, Schendel and Knut had a daughter, Ada Clara Schendel. Mira Schendel married Knut on March 17, 1960. She died at the age of sixty-nine in 1988 from lung cancer, in S√£o Paulo.  Artwork  Schendel was in communication with other artists in Brazil, but she was not heavily influenced by any of them. She had no ties to any specific school or movement, and she was constantly evolving her work and techniques throughout her life. When Schendel arrived in Brazil she had an experimental and reflective attitude towards things. These traits reveal themselves in her work, as well as her previous experience in art and philosophy during her time in Milan. Schendel‚Äôs experimental nature produced heterogeneous works that are not easy to confine to a consistent style. She explored multiple directions in her work which allowed her to enjoy the freedom of fluid form of thought and play with the limits of form and work itself. Schendel‚Äôs work drew upon the art of language and poetry, and what appears to have driven her was the ability to reinvent it. Schendel neither attempted to order reality or to impose meaning on it in her art. Through her art she examined the possibilities of our presence in the world with the recognition of both our limitations and relating achievements. Interpretations of Schendel‚Äôs work often mention an opposition between gentleness and force. This quality is believed to result from her singular approach to reality. Her material attained intensity through gentle interventions and her works' meaning depends on preserving this tension.

Throughout the Edo period, Yamagata Castle was the headquarters for the daimy≈ç of Yamagata Domain. The castle was also known as . The castle grounds are protected as a National Historic Site by the Japanese governmentYamagata Castle Ruins Agency for Cultural Affairs Overview The Yamagata Basin is a long and narrow inland valley of the Mogami River bounded by the ≈åu Mountains to the east. It is an important communications center for the southeastern portion of the T≈çhoku region of Japan. connecting the Sh≈çnai Plains and the Sea of Japan to the west with the Yonezawa Basin to the south, and the Sendai Plains and the Pacific Ocean across the ≈åu Mountains. In addition to riverine traffic, the route of the Ush≈´ Kaid≈ç highway also passes through the area. Yamagata Castle is located at the southern end of the Yamagata Basin.  History =Early history= The first castle on this site dates to the middle of the Muromachi period, when Shiba Kaneyori established himself as lord of the surrounding area of Dewa Province and built a fortified residence on the site of what is now the inner bailey of Yamagata Castle. The Shiba clan was a strong supporter of the Ashikaga shogunate and the Northern Court. Shiba Kaneyori later changed his surname to \\"Mogami\\", and the Mogami clan continued to rule for about 275 years. However, by the Sengoku period, the Mogami had lost much of heir power due to a succession of internal conflicts and short- lived leaders. The aggressive Date clan invaded Mogami territory and after a series of battles, reduced the Mogami to a subordinate position. However, the Date clan itself then fell victim to internal political conflicts. Taking advantage of the situation, Mogami Yoshimori regained his independence, and married his daughter to Date Terumune. Their son was Date Masamune, and this relationship provided security for the Mogami clan. Mogami Yoshimori's eldest son, Mogami Yoshiaki fought many battle against various cadet branches of his own clan as well as the local warlords of many strongholds across Dewa Province from his base at Yamagata, with the Date clan sometimes assisting, but more often hindering his efforts to unit the province. However, following an invasion by Uesugi Kagekatsu, who captured the Sh≈çnai region, Yoshiaki was forced to submit to Toyotomi Hideyoshi. Yoshiaki rebuilt Yamagata Castle in 1592, adding a second bailey and third bailey, and a number of two-story and three-story yagura watchtowers. The castle never had a tenshu. He also laid out the j≈çkamachi for what later became the city of Yamagata. However, his relations with the Toyotomi were always strained, as the Toyotomi favored the Uesugi clan, and Mogami Yoshiaki's daughter Komahime was killed by Hideyoshi when he purged Toyotomi Hidetsugu and his household. At the time of the Sekigahara campaign, Mogami Yoshiaki sided with Tokugawa Ieyasu. The forces of the Uesugi clan under Naoe Kanetsugu invaded the Yonezawa basin. Despite being severely outnumbered, the Mogami were able to repulse the invasion. The Mogami were rewarded after the establishment of the Tokugawa shogunate with an increase in territory to 570,000 koku with the recovery of the Sh≈çnai region. This led to a further expansion of Yamagata Castle. However, after the death of Yoshiaki in 1614, an internal conflict erupted between his major retainers, providing an excuse for attainder of the domain by the shogunate in 1622. =Later history= The Tokugawa shogunate broke up the Mogami domain into many smaller territories. In 1622, Yamagata Caste was awarded to Torii Tadamune, the son of Torii Mototada who had heroically died at the Battle of Fushimi Castle near Kyoto at the time of the Battle of Sekigahara. However, he was relocated to Takat≈ç Castle in Echigo Province in 1636, and the castle and Yamagata Domain passed through a large number of daimy≈ç clans, often for less than a single generation, and its revenues were severely reduced. With their reduced revenues, these daimy≈ç could not afford to maintain this huge a castle and the by the middle of the Edo period, the main bailey was allowed to fall into ruins, the second bailey was used as the residence of the daimy≈ç , and the western half of the third bailey was plowed up for farmland. The castle was in the hands of a cadet branch the Mizuno clan at the time of the Meiji restoration. With the abolition of the han system in 1871, Yamagata Domain became Yamagata Prefecture, and in 1872 the castle grounds were sold to the government, and were used as a base for the Imperial Japanese Army‚Äôs IJA 32nd Infantry Regiment. Many sakura were planted around the castle grounds in 1906 to commemorate the Russo-Japanese War. After World War II the site of the castle became Kaj≈ç Park, containing the Yamagata Prefectural Museum. The East Gate of the castle and the site of castle keep were restored in 1986, and the Higashi Otemon Gate of the second bailey was restored in 1991. In 2004 the stonework of the Inchimon Gate was restored, and a bridge leading to main bailey was reconstructed in 2006. Renovations and archaeological investigations are ongoing, and Yamagata City plans to restore as much of the castle as possible to its early Edo-period condition by the year 2033. The castle was listed as one of the 100 Fine Castles of Japan by the in 2006. Structure Yamagata Castle consists of three concentric square areas. The inner bailey is 200 meters square, was protected by clay walls and wet moats, and had gates at the southeast and north sides and a corner yagura. Within the enclosure was the foundation for a tenshu, which was never actually constructed. The second bailey measured 500 meters on each side, and completely surrounded the inner bailey. Its outer walls were folded in placed to able flanking fire against an attacking enemy. This enclosure had large Masugata-gates on the south and east, and a smaller gate in the north. The third area was about 2 kilometer on each side, and enclosed the semi-fortified residences of important retainers. The size of original castle thus exceeded Aoba Castle in Sendai and Aizuwakamatsu Castle, making it by far the largest castle in the T≈çhoku region. However, without a massive tenshu or stone walls, it was deceptively plain.

The main causes of these protests are the pollution of groundwater and environment, but also the threat of generating earthquakes. The protesters claim the resignation of Prime Minister Victor Ponta, because he suddenly changed his position on the project. Before the electoral campaign of 2012, he opposed shale drilling, and today he supports it with any risks, on the grounds that Romania's energy independence is a national project. The protests began with peaceful movements against shale drilling organized on social networking websites. The protests degenerated in fierce clashes between law enforcers and demonstrators, with dozens of people injured on both sides. According to different sources, these are the most violent events in Romania since the 2012 anti-presidential protests.  Background = Potential reserves of shale gas = The U.S. Energy Information Administration estimates that Romania has technically recoverable shale gas reserves (undiscovered, that could be accessed with existing technology) of 51,000 cubic feet, namely 1,444 billion cubic meters. According to the EIA report, Romania ranks third in EU shale gas reserves, after Poland (4,190 billion cubic meters) and France (3,879 billion cubic meters). This quantity could cover the national consumption of gas for 100 years. A study by the Romanian National Committee of World Energy Council shows that Romania has a high potential for shale gas discoveries in the Eastern Carpathians, the Moldavian Platform, the B√¢rlad Plateau and the Romanian Plain, with its expansion of Southern Dobruja. = Changing positions of Prime Minister = Ponta had numerous positions on shale gas exploitation. Before the 2012 legislative elections, he was a fervid opponent of shale gas. On 5 June 2012, he even received the \\"Young ecologist hope\\" prize during the 2012 Green Awards Gala that took place at Green Hours, Bucharest. After being confirmed as prime minister, he suddenly changed his position on shale drilling in Romania, stating in a TV show that \\"Now I'm fighting for shale gas, and I think I'm doing a good thing. I'm not anti-Russian [...], but I would like to stop importing from Gazprom\\". This change of heart of the Prime Minister sparked the indignation of environmentalists and activists. After that, many of his former supporters started to request his resignation. = Effects of shale drilling = The Chevron Corporation has been fined several times for environmental pollution. Schematic depiction of hydraulic fracturing, showing main possible environmental effects Mass demonstrations in B√¢rlad, Vaslui County, were mainly triggered by the harmful effects of hydraulic fractionation used in shale drilling. The hydraulic fractionation is a method of shale gas extraction, that involves pumping water, sand and additives deep in the lithosphere, to break the layer of rock and release the gas. The additives used include about 750 compounds, some of which are carcinogenic. Environmentalists claim that the exploitation through hydraulic fractionation pollute groundwater. Moreover, it is possible that earthquake activity increases, after destabilization of rock layers. In this way, American director Josh Fox created in 2010 the documentary \\"Gasland\\".\\"Sinteza zilei: Documentar despre efectele nocive ale frac»õionƒÉrii hidraulice folositƒÉ √Æn exploatarea gazelor de »ôist\\", Antena3.ro, 29 March 2012 The film, nominated for Oscars and screened at Sundance Film Festival, shows the size of shale drilling danger to the community and the environment. The film sparked thousands of negative reactions from the public. In several European countries, including Bulgaria,\\"Bulgaria bans shale gas drilling with 'fracking' method\\", BBC News, 19 January 2012 France,\\"French lawmakers ban controversial shale gas drilling\\", France24, 11 May 2011 Netherlands, Luxembourg and Czech Republic, this method of gas extraction was prohibited.\\"Unconventional gas in Europe: Frack to the future\\", The Economist, 2 February 2013 In 2011, a court in Ecuador fined Chevron $8.6 billion for pollution of the Amazon rainforest.\\"Chevron fined for Amazon pollution by Ecuador court\\", BBC News, 15 February 2011\\"Chevron fined $8bn over Amazon 'contamination'\\", The Guardian, 14 February 2011 Chevron has also violated foreign governments environmental laws in Brazil, Angola and Bangladesh.\\"Chevron, Oil Pollution, and Human Rights\\", AfricaResource.com, 6 November 2005  2012 protests = B√¢rlad demonstrations = The protests in B√¢rlad started with a 5,000-large manifestation in Central Square, on 22 March 2012. The protest was preceded by a march that started on two fronts. The event was attended by students, teachers, employees of factories in the city, local authorities and priests, some of them taking the word at the rostrum placed in front of the City Hall. Four days after the protest, Chevron Corporation representatives expressed their official position regarding the techniques they will use in exploration and exploitation of shale gas in northeastern Romania. \\"We understand the concerns about shale gas production in Romania and we believe that after Chevron will present accurate information resulting from research, Romanians will understand that natural shale gas is a clean energy source, which can be produced responsibly and safely\\", said in a press release Tom Holst, Chevron Romania country manager. The protests continued in the following months. Thus, on 26 April, thousands of people gathered in B√¢rlad Civic Center to protest against Chevron presence in the country. During protest, priests sang the Paschal greeting, and people sang the anthem of Romania. The protesters were mobilised on social networking websites. On 8 September, 2,000 people marched peacefully with lit candles and lamps, led by priests in the area.  Proclamation of B√¢rlad  On 22 March 2012, residents of B√¢rlad municipality drew up a proclamation that includes an elaborate list of harmful effects of shale gas exploitation through hydraulic fracturing, but also a series of strict claims. They ask the Government of Romania to impose the National Agency for Mineral Resources the immediate cancellation or suspension of concession petroleum agreements for exploration/exploitation of liquid or gaseous hydrocarbons through hydraulic fracturing method of rocks. Another claims include prohibiting the use of this method in Romania and completing environmental legislation with necessary measures to avoid the risk of pollution resulted from exploitation.  2013 protests  On 27 February 2013, at the call of the Civil Society Initiative Group of B√¢rlad, about 8,700 people took to the streets to shout \\"No to exploitation of shale gas\\". The event was attended by people of all ages from all Vaslui County, but also from Constan»õa, Gala»õi, BuzƒÉu and Bucharest. Those attending the event shouted slogans against the current government and cataloged local politicians as traitors. To avoid any incidents, 80 gendarmes, which were joined by local police crews, assured the public policy measures. On 4 April, with the occasion of \\"Global Anti-Fracking Day\\", in 28 localities in the country were held protests and demonstrations against exploitation of shale gas through hydraulic fracturing. Likewise, the Romanians in Strasbourg and Copenhagen have joined the protests, as well as activists from the Czech Republic, from four cities in Bulgaria and Australia. A similar protest took place in 2014. This was larger and was attended by thousands of people in 100 localities in Romania and 10 abroad. On 27 May, at least 10,000 locals protested in B√¢rlad, dissatisfied that the Environment Ministry has issued permits for gas exploration in B√¢rlad, Costine»ôti and Vama Veche. They also expressed anger against Prime Minister Victor Ponta, accusing him of flip- flopping on his position regarding the shale gas. On Facebook were created dozens of pages against exploitation of shale gas, joined by tens of thousands of people. On 1 September, B√¢rlad Initiative Group of Civil Society organized a meeting against starting the exploration of shale in EV2 area, attended by more than 4,000 people. The gendarmes intervened to release traffic in St. Elias Square, blocked by protesters. All those present chanted messages against the current government, but also against mayor Constantin Constaninescu, who was accused that refused to approve certain routes for the protest march and agreed to conduct this meeting in an isolated area. = Revolt of Punge»ôti = Location of Punge»ôti within the Vaslui County The Revolt of Punge»ôti () erupted a few days after Chevron obtained a building permit for the location of first derrick for shale drilling in Vaslui County. More than that, the company has received all necessary approvals from state authorities for soil exploration in a perimeter within the Sili≈ütea village in Punge»ôti.  14‚Äì16 October 2013  The manifestations started with 150 protesters, on 14 October 2013, blocking the access of Chevron machineries to install the derrick. Protests have escalated in the next three days. Thus, on 16 October, more than 500 villagers of Punge»ôti and surrounding localities, joined by activists from B√¢rlad, Ia»ôi and Bucharest, formed a human shield in front of the bulldozers. On the spot were mobilised over 200 gendarmes, because the Vaslui‚ÄìG√¢rceni county road was blocked by angry protesters. Likewise, the gendarmes formed a cordon meant to release the traffic. The protesters tried to break the cordon, but the gendarmes intervened in force. In fierce clashes between protesters and gendarmes 10 people were injured, including an 81 years old man that suffered a panic attack. According to journalists from Realitatea TV, the old man died a few hours later at Vaslui County Emergency Hospital. The protesters installed tents and gathered food and warm clothes, as they continued their protest overnight. They also created an Internet TV channel, TV Punge»ôti, that covers 24 hours of 24 the events on the protest camping site. Even if it doesn't appear on the TV program grid, TV Punge»ôti amassed up to 75,000 views in a month and a half.  2‚Äì31 December 2013  After Chevron representatives announced the suspension of works in the area, civil conflicts have subsided. This period of lull lasted only a month. On 2 December, when Chevron decided to resume exploration operations, an impressive convoy of gendarmes, police and firefighters went to the area before the break of dawn to secure the movement of Chevron machineries. Gendarmes occupied the village, blocking all access points, preventing entry or exit from the perimeter for 24 hours. Early in the morning, about 100 villagers blocked the road, trying to obstruct the access of Chevron equipment on the concessioned land. Hundreds of gendarmes were mobilised on the spot and ordered the protesters to clear the way. While activists claim that around 1,000 law enforcers were taking part in the operation, police put the number at 300. Journalists were reportedly not permitted to get to the scene. Witnesses said the gendarmes used excessive force to restain some protesters. In the ensuing clashes, two people were injured and 30 were loaded into vans and transported to the police station. Victor Ponta congratulated the gendarmes for the way they acted, saying that energy independence is a major national project. \\"We won't accept for 20, 30, 50, 70 people to break the law!\\", transmitted the Premier. But others are demanding investigation. Maria- Nicoleta Andreescu, executive director of the Helsinki Committee Association for the defence of human rights in Romania, said: \\"There are important signs that indicate that the gendarmes' actions were at least abusive if not illegal. It is very clear is that by restricting the access of the press in the area the authorities did not allow the public to be informed\\". Graffiti on a wall in Bucharest depicting a man tearing down a gas well, symbol of resistance against shale gas The protests continued in the following days. On 7 December, despite very low temperatures, nearly 600 people from several cities of the country protested against Chevron and its intention to exploit the potential reserves of shale gas. At the spot were sent intervention troops of the Gendarmerie, fact that angered the protesters. People posed in front of them and shouted \\"Revolution\\". Protests escalated, and elders, women and children rushed to fight against the gendarmes, throwing firecrackers. Security forces used tear gas and formed a human shield around the plot of land where Chevron would install the first derrick in Romania. Protesters broke the cordon of gendarmes and penetrated into the land concessioned to Chevron. Angry people threw stones at gendarmes and knocked down the entire perimeter fence installed by the U.S. company workers. Gendarmes regrouped and responded in force. A young man of about 25 years was hit in the head during clashes between law enforcers and demonstrators. He was transported to the Vaslui Emergency Hospital by a SMURD ambulance. The vans with the 22 people arrested during altercations were stopped by 50 protesters that laid on the roadway. On 8 December, Chevron announced that it has resumed work in the commune of Punge»ôti, after, the day before, they suspended operations because of violent demonstrations. As a result, activists tried to recoil and protest in neighboring localities, but their demarches have been hampered by the gendarmes. They studded the area, patrolled and organized filters from 100 to 100 meters, legitimating everyone trying to get out of Punge»ôti. Moreover, gendarmes raided the impromptu camp of protesters, because of some pyrotechnic materials they found there. A team of public television journalists was assaulted by gendarmes and was banned from filming in the area. Villagers say they were aggressed by law enforcers. The leadership of Vaslui Police issued a disposition according to which the commune of Punge»ôti becomes \\"special area of public safety\\" (comparable to a state of emergency), fact that requires strict control of people and vehicles crossing the locality. Former Minister of the Environment, Sulfina Barbu, pointed out that the actions of authorities against protests in Punge»ôti are anti-democratic. \\"Since the Government makes such extreme and anti-democratic measures (setting up a special safety area in Sili»ôtea-Punge»ôti ‚Äì n.r.), I think that we're discussing about restrictions of civil rights\\", she said. On 26 March 2014, the Ombudsman sent a recommendation to the Minister of Internal Affairs on the respecting of citizen rights and freedoms, in the context of establishing a \\"special area of public safety\\". IA showed that tensions in Punge»ôti and attempts of unauthorized demonstrations continue, prerequisites for the establishment of special area of public safety remaining valid. On 24 December, 40 villagers of Punge»ôti and activists went on hunger strike. Locals have raised more tents and announced that they go on an indefinitely-long hunger strike, stating that they were tired of aggressive monitoring and surveillance of gendarmes that continually harass them and question them every time they leave the house and go through the village. Their action is a gesture of solidarity with Alexandru Popescu, a 45-year-old antiquarian from BƒÉrcƒÉne»ôti, Prahova County, who is on a hunger strike in Bucharest's University Square since 21 December. Two strikers needed medical attention and called an ambulance. The perimeter was surrounded by gendarmes, protesters accusing aggression by law enforcers. After 10 days of hunger strike, protesters were forced to renounce to this form of protest, because, they say, were banished by the gendarmes.  1 January ‚Äì 1 May 2014  On 2 January, hundreds of villagers from Sili»ôtea organized a rally and then a protest march to the Punge»ôti Town Hall to demand the resignation of Mayor Mircia VlasƒÉ and the stoppage of shale gas exploration in the area. Citizens were joined by Vaslui MP Tudor Ciuhodaru, local councilors from several communes in the county and the Mayor of »òuletea, Ciprian Tama»ô. Ten people received warning for participating in an unauthorized protest. On 5 January, around 100 protesters gathered at an anti-Chevron encampment near Punge»ôti, to pray and perform religious rituals in an attempt to drive out Chevron. Priest Gheorghe Tomozei described Chevron's operations as \\"a Satanic invasion\\". After a short religious service, protesters walked to a police checkpoint that separates the village from the Chevron site but were stopped by riot police as they attempted to enter the area. Protesters shouted \\"Thieves\\" and \\"Down with Chevron\\", and later demonstrated near the town hall calling for the mayor's resignation. On 8 April, up to 200 villagers from Punge»ôti and neighboring communes gathered near the Chevron site to protest against company's intention to begin shale gas exploration. Protesters threw eggs and apples at Chevron coach and thrust with law enforcers. The same month, on 25, another incident occurred in Punge»ôti. Then, the mayor of the commune was hiding in his office in the city hall, while an angry crowd demanded his resignation. During the rustic celebration of 1 May, a child was beaten by gendarmes after a group of protesters approached the land owned by Chevron. He was taken by ambulance to Vaslui County Hospital with a fracture of the right arm.  Reactions  Protests of solidarity took place in Bucharest, Cluj-Napoca, Timi»ôoara, and Sibiu. In Bucharest, more than 4,000 people gathered in University Square, from where they marched to the Government headquarters in Victory Square. During the manifestation, the traffic was blocked and directed on detour routes. Column of demonstrators was accompanied at all times by gendarmes. In an attempt to release the Victory Square, things were precipitated. The protesters clashed with gendarmes, and a woman fainted. They demanded the resignation of Prime Minister Victor Ponta, accusing him of treason and falsehood. They threatened to radicalize the rallies using the Greek model and chanted slogans like \\"Last resort, another revolution\\" and \\"Ponta and BƒÉsescu near Ceau»ôescu\\". In a document signed and initialed by Director of School no. 1 of Punge»ôti, it appears that the leadership of Vaslui County School Inspectorate prohibits teachers and students from leaving classes to attend the protest against shale gas. During a meeting of local councilors it was agreed to hold a local referendum about the use or banning of shale gas exploration and exploitation in the commune. Furthermore, one of the councilors demanded the resignation of the mayor be added to that referendum. The prime minister called for a report from the Minister of Internal Affairs Radu Stroe about how the gendarmes acted in Punge»ôti. Representatives of the Chevron company announced, on 17 October, that they will suspend work on shale gas exploration in Sili»ôtea, Punge»ôti commune. The statement mentions that the company's priority is to \\"conduct these activities in a safe and environmentally responsible manner\\". But the company also said it plans to pursue other exploration operations, and did not rule out the possibility of returning to Punge»ôti. The Royal House of Romania issued a press release in which it deplores the situation of Punge»ôti locals and condemns the violence against \\"citizens of the Romanian state\\". The communiqu√© also notes, \\"Sovereignty belongs to the people, and the citizens must be consulted and listened to for any decision that may affect their right to health and future\\". On 14 December, the Romanian Ombudsman took a stand about the situation in Punge»ôti. Institution representatives went to the area to talk to local officials, Gendarmerie representatives and participants in the protests. A group of eleven Green MEPs from six countries (France, Germany, United Kingdom, Spain, Belgium and Luxembourg) sent an open letter to the President of the European Parliament, Martin Schulz, notifying on and condemning the manner in which the Government from Bucharest acts abusively against citizens of a community in Romania (Punge»ôti), because of the interests of a private company. They claim violation of the rule of law and violation of rights and freedoms of European citizens including: right to physical integrity, right to private property, freedom of movement, freedom of expression and right to be informed. = Resistance of Mo»ôna = Several villagers from Mo»ôna, Sibiu County, revolted against the intention of Prospec»õiuni S.A. employees to drill for potential shale gas reserves without the approval of the landowners. The company belongs to Ovidiu Tender, an influential Romanian businessman. Willy Schuster, a German resident from Mo»ôna, accused company employees that violated his household, trespassed and destroyed his goods. In May‚ÄìJune 2012, the dairy producer from Mo»ôna, one of the leaders of the ecological farming movement in Romania, gathered tens of meters of cable on land he owns, all assembled by employees of the company that makes prospections in the region. On 16 November, more than 100 activists from the counties of Ia»ôi, Harghita, Sibiu, Bra»ôov and Hunedoara joined the revolted villagers and protested against abuse of private property of residents. People also said that substances used in exploitation affect bio cultures. An SUV of Prospec»õiuni was surrounded by protesters, after the vehicle tried to enter the property of Willy Schuster. Police intervened and settled the conflict. The villagers removed cables from their lands. The director of seismic works, Gheorghe DƒÉianu, threatened with violence and insulted protesters. DƒÉianu attempted to recover the cables from the Cultural House of Alma Vii, but barely escaped the fury of the crowd. Local television station Nova TV from Media»ô reported that 17 cars of Prospec»õiuni company were found with cut tires, in front of the hotel where the employees were staying. The activists denied involvement in the incident, showing that their protest was peaceful and aimed solely against abuse of private property of residents from Mo»ôna and Alma Vii. There were even some who have suggested that company employees could have cut their own tires, in an attempt to \\"victimize\\". Mihail Mitroi, vice-president of Prospec»õiuni S.A., said that the company decided to stop work in the Mo»ôna area after the protests of residents. Mitroi asserted that the company had suffered damages of 50,000 euros after actions of activists and mentioned that Prospec»õiuni S.A. will act judicially for the recovery of damages. Prospec»õiuni S.A. is now prosecuted by Sibiu County Police Inspectorate for trespassing, because of stretched cables with sensors for exploration on Willy Schuster's lands, without his consent. Tender's company is accused of violating several normative acts, including the Constitution, which guarantees the right to property. : = Protests for saving BƒÉile Felix = BƒÉile Felix is a thermal spa resort of national interest. It risks to be closed after the Ponta Government approved the exploitation of shale gas in the area. According to the decision taken on 26 November 2013, the Government approved oil concession agreement for exploration, development and exploitation in the 3 BƒÉile Felix perimeter by the East West Petroleum Corporation, a Canadian company with operations in United States, India, New Zealand and Morocco. On 21 December, nearly 1,000 people protested in the Central Park of the commune of S√Ænmartin for fear that, after the installation of derricks, the BƒÉile Felix resort will be destroyed. The meeting was held under the supervision of police and gendarmes. In the commune of S√Ænmartin, authorities started a campaign to collect signatures against shale drilling, with over 4,000 signatures having been collected so far.  2014 protests = Arad County demonstrations = On 1 February 2014, over 1,500 residents of Curtici and other 11 nearby localities attended a public meeting of protest against shale gas exploration in the area. The meeting was attended, among others, by Dimitrie MuscƒÉ, Director of the Curtici Agroindustrial Complex, Nicolae A. Ani»õei, Mayor of Curtici, mayors of other localities in the area, Orthodox priests and pastors of neo-Protestant churches in the area. To avoid the eventual occurrence of unwanted events, in the area were deployed forces of gendarmes and policemen ready to intervene. A similar protest took place in Macea, on 16 February, and was attended by more than 1,000 people. The protests are a reaction to the decision of Hungarian company Panfora Oil to start the search of petroleum and natural gas in the area. Contrary to those declared by the Hungarian company, locals say that the searches are actually targeting the shale gas. = Other protests = On 28 April, over 400 people from the villages of , BƒÉce»ôti and attended a protest march against Chevron's intention to install new wells for shale gas exploration. During the march, a fight between locals and supporters of the mayor occurred. Around 100 gendarmes intervened in 3‚Äì4 minutes after the onset of the incident ‚Äì led to some exchanges of punches ‚Äì and arrested one of the demonstrators in the column, subsequently released at the request of the crowd.  Consequences  In April 2012, less than three months after it took office, Romania's Ungureanu government has fallen. The centre-right administration, led by Mihai RƒÉzvan Ungureanu, a former foreign-intelligence chief, lost a no-confidence vote filed by the left-wing opposition. \\"Today there was justice\\", said Victor Ponta, after securing 235 votes in favour of his motion, four more than he needed. \\"We don't want any more dubious firms, no more selling under the market price and huge bribes\\", he said in a five-hour-long debate that preceded the vote. He was referring, in part, to the government's granting of shale gas concessions to Chevron. In the motion of censure that overthrew the Ungureanu Government, Ponta and USL MPs accused the power of signing contracts only with the U.S. company, although \\"there were other companies that would have wanted to enter into such agreements with the Romanian authorities\\".  Reaction of authorities  Former Environment Minister Sulfina Barbu accused the government of \\"lying\\" about shale gas.\\"Protestele de la B√¢rlad privind gazele de »ôist sunt 'o reac»õie la minciunile USL'\\" , RFI Rom√¢nia, 1 March 2013 She said that protests in B√¢rlad on shale gas are \\"people's reaction to babbling and lies of USL Government\\". According to protesters, Liviu Dragnea and Victor Ponta provide misinformation about the risks of shale drilling, and the Environment Minister Rovana Plumb argues that environmental permits are not even required in order to start exploration.\\"Vara asta mergem pe litoral la Vaslui\\", Vox Publica, 27 May 2013 In a television broadcast, the Economy Minister Varujan Vosganian said that \\"the shale gas can not be exploited without huge risks\\". In another train of thoughts, Prime Minister Victor Ponta supports shale gas exploration, but in compliance with European and international standards for environmental protection.\\"Victor Ponta: ¬´Da, sus»õin explorarea gazelor de »ôist¬ª, HotNews.ro, 25 January 2013 PNL senator for Bra»ôov, Sebastian Grapa, called for the establishment of a parliamentary commission of inquiry about the effects of shale drilling, given that Prime Minister Victor Ponta said he would \\"beat\\" for the use of these resources.\\"Noi TENSIUNI √Æn USL: PNL face comisie de anchetƒÉ privind gazele de »ôist\\" , Realitatea.net, 15 June 2013 In the United States of America, the most important center for strategic studies in Washington, CSIS, released a report entitled \\"Hidden war against the exploitation of shale gas\\".\\"ANALIZƒÇ.

In this way, the communes were urged to revoke bans on shale gas exploitation. More than that, Vaslui County Prefecture brought to court 11 decisions made by local councils, that disagree with the exploitations. The Prefecture invokes an article of the Constitution, according to which deposits are owned by the state and local council approval is not required. In reply, mayors of the communes where derricks will be installed say they will not abandon the idea of banning the Canadian company's presence in the areas they lead.\\"VASLUI.

While working with (ÂäâÈÅìÂéü) and others to compile a never-published Zizhi Tongjian Houji (Ë≥áÊ≤ªÈÄöÈëëÂæåË®ò), a book on the Song Dynasty history, Sima Guang collected many miscellaneous anecdotes.

It is an American television production that first premiered in Canada on the History network on January 5, 2014. The show features what is known as the Oak Island mystery, showing efforts to search for historical artifacts and treasure. Overview The Curse of Oak Island follows brothers Marty and Rick Lagina, originally from Kingsford, Michigan, through their efforts to find the speculated treasure or historical artifacts believed to be on Oak Island. The series discusses the history of the island, recent discoveries, theories, and prior attempts to investigate the site. Areas of interest include the \\"Money Pit\\", Borehole 10-X, Smith's Cove, Site 2, \\"Nolan's Cross\\", the \\"Hatch\\", and the \\"Swamp\\". =Background= The Lagina brothers became fascinated with the island after reading the January 1965 issue of Reader's Digest magazine that features an article on the Restall family's work to investigate the so-called \\"Money Pit\\". Marty and his brother Rick obtained a controlling interest in Oak Island Tours, which reportedly owns most of the island. The brothers were later approached by Prometheus Entertainment to do a reality show. Rick and Marty have engaged the assistance of father-and-son Dan and Dave Blankenship, permanent residents of the island who have likewise been searching for treasure since the 1960s. Dan Blankenship died on March 17, 2019, at age 95. =Theories= The series explores various Oak Island theories and conjectures through conversations with independent researchers. Persons featured have included Zena Halpern discussing her theory about North African gold and sharing copies of a French map of the island which she claims is dated 1347; J. Hutton Pulitzer discussing his theory of ancient mariner visitations; Petter Amundsen discussing his theory about codes hidden in Shakespearean literature and a secret project involving Sir Francis Bacon and the Rosicrucians; Daniel Ronnstam discussing his theory about the 90 foot stone being a dual cypher containing instructions as how to defeat the money pit flood tunnels with corn; authors Kathleen McGowen and Alen Butler discussing their theory involving the fabled Knights Templar treasure and an alleged relocation of historical religious artifacts to the island; and John O'Brien discussing his theory that the island contains treasures of the Aztec Empire. It has also been suggested by Zena Halpern, without evidence, that the Templars worshipped the Phoenician goddess Tanit.  Cast = The Oak Island team = Initially, the cast consisted of a core group including Rick, Marty and Alex Lagina, Dan and Dave Blankenship, Craig Tester, Jack Begley, Dan Henskee, Charles Barkhouse and Peter Fornetti. Over time, the Oak Island team has expanded. Some specialists who have been brought to the island for specific purposes, such as Terry Matheson, Laird Niven and Gary Drayton, have joined the team as full time members. * ‚Äì Brother of Marty, Rick is a retired postal worker who is the main driving force behind the project. At the age of eleven, he read an article about the Oak Island money pit in the January 1965 edition of Reader's Digest and got Marty, his younger brother, interested in the Oak Island mystery. In 2004, he and Marty purchased most of Oak Island. * ‚Äì Rick Lagina's younger brother who funds a large proportion of the project. He owns a vineyard in his home town of Traverse City, Michigan. He is a certified diver and features prominently in the spin-off The Curse of Civil War Gold. * Dan Blankenship (seasons 1‚Äì6) ‚Äì A treasure seeker on Oak Island for nearly 50 years, he was responsible for drilling borehole 10‚ÄìX and has dived to the bottom of the deep shaft, which is the deepest shaft on the island. In season 1, Dan is 90-years-old and does not take an active part in the search but is often sought out by team members due to his extensive knowledge. He died in 2019, prior to filming of season 7, at age 95. Dan was first attracted to the island after reading the same Reader's Digest article that was read by Rick and Marty Lagina. * ‚Äì Son of Dan Blankenship who has been helping his father on the island since the 1970s. Dave is one of only three permanent inhabitants of Oak Island. He is partially paralysed on the left side due to an industrial accident. * ‚Äì The business partner of Marty Lagina, father of Drake Tester and stepfather of Jack Begley, he is an engineer. * ‚Äì Stepson of Craig Tester, Jack tends to take on the more dirty jobs on the island, such as manually searching the spoils from various shafts, manual digging and even walking through the swamp. * ‚Äì Son of Marty, he is a qualified diver and features prominently in season 2 of the spin-off The Curse of Civil War Gold. * ‚Äì One of only three Oak Island treasure hunters who have been searching the island for several decades.

For much of that time he was involved in a feud with Dan Blankenship until he was convinced to join the team in season 3. Like Blankenship, his advanced age prevented him from taking a more active role in the hunt but he still provided a wealth of information to the team and his maps continued to assist the team after his death.

It is situated in the Santa Province, Nepe√±a District, on the right bank of the Nepe√±a River. An aspect of this archaeological site that is not well known is that this site is home to many artifacts that link back to the Incan Empire. This site is also linked with the Moche culture and together, this site was occupied by two civilizations, the Inca and the Moche, which is significant because the archaeology that is present at the site shows that the site was important in the eyes of multiple cultures. While Pa√±amarka may at one time have once been quite aesthetically pleasing and grand, it is but a small collection of ruined walls, rock, and sand today. However, future excavations at the site may uncover more of the city buried beneath the Earth, and could perhaps provide archaeologists with enough information so that they might create an artistic reconstruction of what the city looked like during the height of its occupation.  Pa√±amarca and the Moche = Shields, war clubs, and weapon bundles = The Moche culture (100 AD ‚Äì 700 AD) occupied the site of Pa√±amarca during the late period of the Moche, from 600 AD to the end of the Moche. During that period of acquisition the Moche left behind valuable artifacts that were a window into what the Moche were like. The artifacts they left behind were handmade shields woven with fibrous plants. These shields had a burlap-like material with decorations on the front facing side of the shield. \\"The shield seems to have been left as an offering that preceded a renovation of the painted temple during the late Moche period (c.600‚Äì850 C.E.).\\" Presumably these shields would have been used in religious and or militaristic ceremonies, yet this does not discount the concept that they were exclusively employed in displays of pageantry. Even in the most devastating of military campaigns the formalities of battlefield action, official dress and regalia, and the brandishing of national colors and symbols were ritualized. The shield implies that an object of its kind could transcend its defensive function and become an abstract symbol, potent within Moche ritual. Moche shields and war clubs were primary elements of the weapon bundle motif which was ubiquitous in Moche arts, especially during the Middle Moche (c. 400 C.E.) and beyond. The panoply was oft to also incorporate spear throwers, darts, and at times the garments of fallen warriors. By the Late Moche period, the weapon bundle became one of the most important symbols in Moche art. The club and shield motif was so important that it became a kind of logo for the Moche culture, and the trophy bundles of the defeated warriors' weapons and clothes became an \\"iconic, summarizing symbol\\" for the military focused Moche ideology. The discovery of the Moche feathered shield makes clear that, despite great loss from centuries of extensive looting, neglect, and environmental catastrophe, all has not been lost at Pa√±amarca. = Mural paintings = In addition, several important mural paintings (ca. 500‚Äì900 CE) were excavated at the site, which possess mimetic images that participated in the performance and perpetuation of Moche religious and political identity on the region‚Äôs southern margin. The paintings were modeled on images found on portable objects, such as ceramic vases and or tapestries, and were most likely not created by teams of mural painters who would have been dispatched form other sites. Furthermore, it is theorized that these newly discovered Moche mural paintings possess phenomenological effects and performance capabilities that connect with the site‚Äôs Ceremonial Plaza, Platform II, and newly discovered Recinto de los Pilares Pintados (Enclosure of the Painted Pillars). These temple paintings would have served to model ritual behavior and embody religious doctrine as they effectively participated in the substantiation of the late Moche presence at the southern frontier. In addition, a few of the murals uncovered at the site are indicative of Inca design. According to the individuals who participated in the excavation of these murals, the understanding of the memory and reception of these important early paintings will be enhanced by ongoing technical studies of an organic residue splashed upon them in antiquity within the coming years.

It is now a ghost town. History Mount Cuthbert was one of a string of mining towns created in north-west Queensland (other examples being Duchess and Selwyn) by Melbourne investors eager to profit from high copper prices in the early 20th century. A railway had been opened to the town and copper smelters were operating by 1917, and by 1918 the population was recorded as 750 people. Some of the workers in Mount Cuthbert at the time were Russian and affiliated with the Industrial Workers of the World. A fall in the world price of copper in 1920 badly affected the local economy, and by 1921 only 267 people remained. By 1927 the settlement was a ghost town, and the railway line was closed in 1949.

Design and development In 1949, the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) began assessing replacements for its locally-built Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation (CAC) Mustangs, Gloster Meteors and De Havilland Australia (DHA) Vampires.RAAF Museum, 2009, A94 CAC Sabre (14 December 2012). A series of designs were considered, including the Grumman Panther and an unconventional, twin-jet all- weather fighter: the CAC CA-23. The Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation (CAC) had developed an extensive in-house design office and capability stemming from Australian Government funding during World War 2. On the basis of the CAC track record and a detailed proposal, the Department of Defence Production granted funds to develop the CAC CA-23 concept. The CAC CA-23 delta wing design concept was a two-seat all-weather fighter with a low set tail. It was originally planned to be powered by two Rolls-Royce Tay engines; the final version was however designed for the more powerful Rolls-Royce Avon turbojet engines. The aircraft was to be fitted with the most up to date radar and electronic equipment. Its anticipated performance was to be in the region of Mach 1.5 which would have been much faster than any contemporary aircraft.Deeb 2006, pp. 14‚Äì15. Over the life of the project dozens of mock-up models were made at different scales, with hundreds of detailed drawings, plus wind tunnel tests proving the delta wing was more than satisfactory. The program was described by the British visiting CAC at the time as \\"the company's project was a most ambitious design for a fighter and as advanced as anything yet seen in any other part of the world.\\"RAAF Museum, 2009, A94 CAC Sabre The four-year project was cancelled in 1953 after the expenditure of ¬£163,195 with extensive aeronautical R&D; testing in wind tunnels in Australia and at the Royal Aircraft Establishment. The testing results were so promising and ground breaking for a delta wing design that the Royal Aircraft Establishment requested permission to distribute the results to the major UK aircraft manufacturers and Avro Canada.Australian Archives, CRS A705/1, File 9/1/1891 Controversy and cancellation The decision to cancel the CAC CA-23 project was controversial at the time among the Australian political elite and aircraft industry insiders. The official reason given for the cancellation for the project was that it had failed to meet key design criteria as an all- weather jet fighter, in failing to incorporate a working radar design into the nose cone.Australian Archives, CRS A705/1, File 9/1/1891 However, the change of the Federal Australian Government had brought about a significant change in policy and priorities around indigenous aircraft design and production. This new policy arose from the November 1951 British mission to Australia on developing aircraft (Aircraft Development Mission) design and cooperation.Report on the visit to Australia of First Aircraft Development Mission, Australian Archives, CRS MP1472/13, File 51 Further, the appointment of a British officer, Sir James Donald Hardman, as Chief of the Air Staff for the Royal Australian Air Force in 14 January 1952, with supervision of aircraft procurement, saw a fundamental policy shift occur. Hardman deemed that aircraft design costs were prohibitive and advanced aeronautical R&D; design work should be centralised and resources pooled with Britain, in Britain. From this point forward the policy was to adapt proven aircraft for Australian conditions, not start from scratch. Along with this decision, a series of negative reports by the U.K. Ministry of Supply were cited about the CA-23, which contained false assumptions and data comparisons, that led to terse rebuttal letter from Sir Lawrence J Wackett to U.K. Govt.Australian Archives, CRS A705/1, File 9/1/1891 However, in time, the preference for British designed aircraft was subsequently overturned by the following Australian Chief of Air Staff John McCauley, who once again switched back to American designed and Australian built aircraft. The CA-23 design work was abandoned in the early 1950s by the Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation, after the government asked CAC to produce an up-engined variant of the North American F-86 Sabre: the CAC Sabre was also powered by the Rolls-Royce Avon. In correspondence CAC stated \\"It is not possible to make significant changes to the Sabre for installation Avon engine area without a team of engineers that has been extended to work on a long-range fighter aircraft\\".Australian Archives, CRS A705/1, File 9/1/1891 The CAC Sabre used a British jet engine that require extensive redesign work beyond what had been originally expected. Similarities with other aircraft The decision by the Australian Department of Defence Production to grant permission for the distribution of the detailed design drawings and wind tunnel tests of the CA-23 by the U.K. Swept Wing Advisory Committee to 15 British Aircraft manufacturers and Avro Canada has always raised questions and theories around the similarities with the English Electric Lightning and especially the Sukhoi Su-7. The wind tunnel tests carried out by the Royal Aircraft Establishment on the CA-23 and the history of Soviet Agents (Wilfred Vernon and others) associated with the Royal Aircraft Establishment prior to 1953 have led to this conjecture on the similarities.Lomas, Daniel, Intelligence, Security and the Attlee Governments, 1945‚Äì51: An Uneasy Relationship?, Oxford Uni Press However, no firm conclusions have been made about the design similarities or links.
