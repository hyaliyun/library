He played for Bayern Munich for seven years, winning four German titles and three cups. He retired due to an injury in 1993. Career Mathy joined Bayern Munich's youth team in 1979, and made his first-team debut a year later, as a substitute for Norbert Janzon in a 3–1 win over VfL Bochum. He made two more substitute appearances in the 1980–81 season, replacing Dieter Hoeneß and scoring both times, as Bayern ended the season as German champions. The following season he made seventeen appearances without getting on the scoresheet, the last of which was the European Cup Final – he started the match, which Bayern lost 1–0 against Aston Villa, being replaced by Günter Güttler after 51 minutes. Bayern had more luck in the DFB-Pokal, beating 1. FC Nürnberg in the final, which Mathy didn't play in. By the 1983–84 season Mathy had established himself in Bayern's first team, making 22 league appearances as he won a second Bundesliga title, and a second cup win – he came on as a substitute for Wolfgang Kraus in the final, in which Bayern beat Borussia Mönchengladbach on penalties. 1984–85 was Mathy's prolific season with Bayern – he scored seven goals on the way to another league title, and another cup final, a defeat to Bayer Uerdingen which Mathy missed. 1985–86 brought another league and cup double – this time Mathy started the cup final, a 5–2 win over VfB Stuttgart, and a personal highlight was a hattrick in a 4–2 win over Austria Vienna in the Cup Winners' Cup, helping Bayern on the way to the semi- final. The following season brought early European success for Mathy, too – he scored two goals to settle a European Cup first round win against PSV Eindhoven, and won a third consecutive German title, but missed the entire second half of the season, including the 1987 European Cup Final, which Bayern lost against FC Porto. Mathy left Bayern in at the end of the 1986–87 season having made exactly 100 Bundesliga appearances for the club, signing for Bayer Uerdingen. He spent three years with the Krefeld club, forming a successful attacking line-up with Stefan Kuntz and Marcel Witeczek, and achieving mostly mid-table finishes. In 1990, he moved to Switzerland to sign for FC Wettingen, where he spent two years, before returning to Germany to sign for Hannover 96. After injuries restricted him to eleven appearances in his first season with Hannover, he retired from football in 1993.

It was dissolved in 1949. History of The Peniel Mission =Origins and early days (1886–1894)= Manie Payne Ferguson, along with her husband, Theodore, founded the Los Angeles Mission on November 11, 1886 at the Masonic Hall on Spring Street (near 416 North Main Street) in downtown Los Angeles.Ferguson, Love Slave, 221–222. .The 1858 Masonic Hall, which housed the First Masonic Temple, Lodge No. 42, is the oldest building south of the Plaza, and displays Masonic artifacts. See modern photo: However, after three months they were forced to move to the basement of the Nadeau Hotel (opened 5 July 1886), located on the southwest corner of Spring and First Streets.Ferguson, Love Slave, 223. The hotel was named in honour of its owner, a wealthy French Canadian named Remi Nadeau. See photographs of the hotel in Hinshilwood, p.14. ; \\"A Visit to Old Los Angeles: Spring Street (Part 1) by Brent C. Dickerson: ; and also at: The hotel was a \\"four-story business block, with a passenger elevator, the first of its kind in Los Angeles. … Los Angeles gossiped of \\"Nadeau's Folly\\". Nadeau's folly, and original plans for stores, professional offices and private residences, however, turned into the Nadeau Hotel, when a local hotelier leased the entire building in May 1886. On July 5th, the hotel opened with a magnificent banquet and ball. Through the turn of the century, Nadeau's hotel was the place to be for Los Angelinos. The Nadeau Hotel stood at the site of the present day Los Angeles Times building.\\" (Cecile Page Vargo, \\"From Freight Wagons to Fine Hotels\\".) After a year, they were forced to rent the burnt-out Methodist Episcopal Church, South for six months until it could be demolished. The Mission then relocated to rented rooms at 107 North Main Street. In the first eight years, the Mission relocated six times, before establishing a permanent location. The Mission was eventually renamed the Peniel Mission. Peniel means \\"Face of God\\",Frankiel, 107. and \\"was chosen from Genesis 32: 24–30, and is meant to connote spiritual triumph.\\"Piepkorn 27. =Peniel Hall (1894)= From the outset, the Peniel Mission was non-denominational and nonsectarian. In 1894, the Fergusons received a significant anonymous financial donation (from former English cricketer George Studd). With this funding the Fergusons were able to plan to expand the ministry of the Peniel Mission. They invited former Methodist presiding elder Dr Phineas Bresee to join them in their endeavour, and planned to construct a 900-seat auditorium and ministry centre at 227 South Main Street, Los Angeles. It was decided that there would be four superintendents: Theodore and Manie Ferguson, George Studd and Phineas F. Bresee. On Sunday 21 October 1894 the 900-seat Peniel Hall was dedicated. University of Southern California president Dr. Joseph Pomeroy Widney led the 9.30am Praise Service, while Bresee preached in the 11.00am service \\"from the text, \\"And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.\\"(Smith, 40). In the initial issue of the Peniel Herald, the mission's official newspaper, it was announced > \\"Our first work is to try to reach the unchurched. The people from the homes > and the street where the light from the churches does not reach, or > penetrates but little. Especially to gather the poor to the cross, by > bringing to bear upon them Christian sympathy and helpfulness.... It is also > our work to preach and teach the gospel of full salvation; to show forth the > blessed privilege of believers in Jesus Christ, to be made holy and thus > perfect in love.\\"Smith, 40. As Timothy Smith explains: > Here were holiness and humanitarianism working hand in hand, as in the days > of Wesley. And sectarian feeling was rejected: \\"Peniel Mission is thoroughly > evangelical but entirely undenominational,\\" the Herald declared. Its > superintendents would welcome help from all \\"earnest souls . . . who have > any time over and above the work in their churches that they desire to > give.\\" In October 1894 at the dedication of the Peniel Hall, Widney announced his intention to organize a Training Institute, in which Bible and practical nursing were to be the principal studies.Smith, 40; History LA County 201. By December 1894 Bresee had urged in the Peniel Herald the creation of an organization to screen out undesirable workers, and to create a group for \\"those that are being gathered in, who have no church affiliation, who need care and fellowship, and a place to find a home and work.\\" Bresee and the other three superintendents created a printed statement of belief to be required of all who wished to associate themselves with Peniel Hall. It was a broad one, \\"embracing in simplest statement… a few of those essential things which are the common inheritance of the children of God.\\": > \\"The Peniel Mission is an organization for Christian service and fellowship. > It will be required that those who seek to become members of the Peniel > Mission be sound in the faith on all the main points of Christian doctrine, > which may be particularized as follows: > \\"1. The Divine inspiration of the Scriptures, the Old and New Testaments. > \\"2. The Trinity of the Godhead, Father, Son and Holy Ghost. > \\"3. The Fall of man, and his consequent need of Regeneration. > \\"4. The Atonement of the Lord Jesus Christ for all men. > \\"5. Justification by Faith in Him. > \\"6. Sanctification by Faith in the cleansing blood of Jesus Christ, and the > Baptism of the Holy Ghost. > \\"7. The Resurrection of the dead. > \\"8. The eternity of Reward and Punishment.\\"Peniel Herald (December 1894). According to Smith, \\"What Bresee intended, apparently, was a combination of the interdenominational mission idea with that of an independent church, the former for the workers and sponsors who had no thought of forsaking their old allegiances, the latter for the converts and others who had no church home.\\"Smith, 41. =Leadership difficulties (1895)= However, by early October 1895, Widney and Bresee were \\"frozen out\\" of the Peniel Mission. Frankiel indicates: \\"At first Bresee joined with the Fergusons at the Peniel Mission in Los Angeles, where he tried to persuade them to open a school and organize to receive members like a church. They refused, however, and other difficulties led to his parting with them after one year.\\" According to Smith, > [t]he immediate cause for the organization of the Church of the Nazarene … > is not so much to be found in Bresee's differences with the Methodists as in > those which developed between him and the proprietors of Peniel Hall. > Certainly J. P. Widney must have been disillusioned when A. B. Simpson, > leader of the Christian and Missionary Alliance and reportedly an extremist > on divine healing, appeared as a special worker at the mission in May > [1895]. Bresee on his part disagreed with Mr. and Mrs. Fergusons' insistence > upon the use of young women in rescue work, and their growing interest in > foreign missionary schemes.Smith, Called, 84. Another cause of disagreement was that Bresee became convinced that the best ministry for the urban poor was to create strong churches that ministered to entire families, whereas the Fergusons believed that the Peniel Mission should focus instead on the \\"down and outer\\" and remain non-denominational. =Subsequent developments and expansion (1895–1906)= From the home base in Los Angeles, other missions were established as Peniel Missions, primarily on the west coast of the United States of America, but also in Memphis, New York, Alaska and Hawaii. \\"With a United States membership destined never to exceed a thousand (in 1906 a government report said 703), the ministry…had an impact on the larger [holiness] movement far in excess of that implied by numbers.\\"Jones, WHM 1:734. By the turn of the twentieth century, more than 25 missions and rescue homes had been started. Among the Peniel Missions established were those located at: * 1.

Among those defecting from Peniel Hall was an Owen \\"Irish\\" Lee, a former Irish-American Catholic converted through Peniel Hall, who hosted William Seymour in 1906 and allowed meetings in his home. The Lees informed other members of Peniel about the meetings (later held at 214 North Bonnie Brae Street). On 9 April 1906 Lee received the Baptism of the Holy Spirit and spoke in tongues in his home when Seymour laid hands on him and prayed. This precipitated other manifestations of tongues-speaking (including Seymour for the first time) later that day. Among those affected were Jennie Moore and Ruth Asberry who went to the Peniel Mission and spoke in tongues there. This resulted in the entire congregation of the Peniel Mission following them to the Azusa Street Mission.Owens, 66. \\"Most of the churches, mission and tent meetings in the area were effected immediately. Some lost so many people to the Azusa Street Mission that they closed.\\" Among those who also defected to the Pentecostal movement was their primary financial supporter, George Studd, former English cricketer and one of the primary benefactors of the Peniel Mission since its inception in 1886, who defected to the Apostolic Faith Mission in September 1907;Wacker, 204. and Frank Bartleman (1871–1936), pioneer Pentecostal preacher and the chronicler of the Azusa Street Revival, who was appointed director of the Peniel Mission in Stockton, California in early 1904,Bartleman, 170. and later preached regularly at the Peniel Mission in Pasadena, California immediately prior to his involvement in the nascent Pentecostal movement. Highlights About 15 October 1906 there was a fire at the Peniel Hall in Los Angeles which caused the death of one elderly female worker, injury to two male workers, and the total destruction of the building.\\"FIRE ENDS LIFE OF AGED WOMAN.

Deaths of Theodore and Manie Ferguson After her husband's death in 1920, “Mother Ferguson” continued to direct the work until her own death. Upon the death of Manie Ferguson on 8 June 1932,\\"CO-FOUNDER OF PENIEL MISSIONS DIES OF ILLNESS\\", Los Angeles Times (9 June 1932):a16. control of the Peniel Mission passed to an all-female self-perpetuating board. Changes In 1947 the Peniel Mission became a part of the present-day World Gospel Mission. In 1998, all but two of the former West Coast USA Peniel Missions missionaries resigned from Peniel Missions, Inc. / World Gospel Missions and went to work for CityTeam Ministries. Peniel Missions in Seattle, Portland, San Francisco and Oakland were closed and the buildings and small fixed assets were sold to the ministry of CityTeam in a transaction that allowed those being ministered to continue receiving the services they needed. Missionaries and Pastor's Bob and Lisa Margaron continue the work at Peniel Missions, Inc. at 1500 and 1508 S. Sutter Street, Stockton, California today. This is the only remaining American Peniel Missions affiliated with World Gospel Mission.  Methods  \\"The Peniel Mission used some of the same methods as the Salvation Army, including street-corner meetings followed by parades back to the mission hall\\".Taiz, 185. According to Schwanz, > \\"Manie Ferguson was more outgoing than Theodore and was the guiding force > for the expansion of the ministry. … Under Manie’s direction, the Peniel > Missions sought to provide a ministry for single women. This appears to have > been a primary motivation in the growth of the movement. The women usually > lived in rented rooms near the rented hall where they conducted evangelistic > services. They boldly testified on street corners and in bars and houses of > prostitution. All workers were unsalaried, but the local mission paid for > most of their expenses. Even the Fergusons were not paid by the mission, but > lived on the rental income from three small houses they owned.\\"Keith > Schwanz, Satisfied, http://www.whwomenclergy.org/booklets/satisfied.php According to Sandra Frankiel, > \\"Together with his wife Manie, he offered street-corner meetings in the > afternoons and evangelistic services nightly, with a meal afterwards. Their > entire work, like that of most of the city holiness missions, was oriented > toward soul saving and the promotion of holiness. The mission was not a > church, however; converts were supposed to join one of the regular > denominations. It was, rather, a holiness revival station spreading the > message of Christian perfection\\".Frankiel, 106–107. The Peniel Missionary Society (1895–1949) In addition to the expansion of the Peniel Mission in the United States of America, and its overseas territories: Alaska and Hawaii, eventually Peniel Missions were established overseas in Africa, Bolivia (1911); China (1909); Egypt, Guatemala, India, Mexico, and the Philippines. A separate organisation, The Peniel Missionary Society, under the control of Manie and Theodore Ferguson, was formed in 1895. The objective of the organisation was: \\"Mission work, as God shall lead, and as means shall be provided.\\" (Dennis). The Mission operated on the faith mission model, with workers unsalaried, and guaranteed no financial support. Despite this, by 1911, the Peniel Missionary Society was operating in the following fields: India, North Africa (Egypt), Mexico, Central America (Guatemala), South America (Argentine Republic, and Bolivia), West Indies (Puerto Rico), Alaska, and Hawaii. (Dennis) Prominent members and supporters Prominent members of the Peniel Mission included * Haldor Lillenas (1885–1959), \\"the most influential Wesleyan/ Holiness songwriter and publisher in the 20th century\\",Schwanz. who was converted at the Peniel Mission in Astoria, Oregon, in 1906;Osbeck, 314–315. and * R.G.

Among those defecting was a former Irish-American Catholic converted through Peniel Hall, Owen \\"Irish\\" Lee who hosted William Seymour and allowed meetings in his home. The Lees advised other members of Peniel about the meetings (now being held at 214 North Bonnie Brae Street). On 9 April 1906 Lee received the Baptism of the Holy Spirit in his home when Seymour laid hands on him and prayed. This precipitated other manifestations of tongues-speaking (including Seymour for the first time). Among those affected were Jennie Moore and Ruth Asberry who went to the Peniel Mission and spoke in tongues there. This resulted in the entire congregation of the Peniel Mission following them to the Asuza Street Mission (66). \\"Most of the churches, mission and tent meetings in the area were effected immediately. Some lost so many people to the Azusa Street Mission that they closed.\\" (Owens, 66). *Phillips, Jim and Rosemary Gartner. Murdering Holiness: The Trials of Franz Creffield and George Mitchell.

It is one of the Bocas Islands (also referred to as Dragons' Teeth), which lie in the Bocas del Dragón (Spanish for Dragons' Mouth) between the main island of Trinidad and Venezuela. The island is currently uninhabited.  Characteristics  Gasparillo is actually made up of two islands separated by several metres of rocks. However the second island is very small and is not independently named. The main island a little over 200 metres in length but is very narrow, less than 50 metres at its widest point, approximately 8,000 m2 in area. It is, as with most islands around the Paria Peninsular, covered with dry forest vegetation, and composed of a limestone bedrock with caves. Several species of birds nest at the island, including the short-tailed swift that nest on the eastern side of the island.  History  The Gasparillo name has been derived because of its small size relative to the much larger Gaspar Grande Island, located just to the south of it. It has also been called Scorpion Island and Centipede Island due to the nature of its fauna. Sometime in the 19th century, it was also referred to as Gopee, based on one of its owners \\"Guppy\\", a Trinidad naturalist. He did not retain possession of the island due to a failure of paying land tax.de Verteuil 2006, pg. 68 In the 20th century it was bought or leased by a businessman, C.C. Stollmeyer, with the intent of quarrying limestone from the island. However he found the makeup of the island was not conducive to the venture due to its hollowness. He subsequently leased the smaller island to the Gransaull family who built a holiday home. The government regained possession of the island when the United States was leased areas in Trinidad under the Destroyers for Bases Agreement in 1940 during World War II.

The current location dates to 1747. Today, the presidio is probably most famous for the part it played the Texas Revolution: namely the Battle of Goliad in October 1835, and the Goliad Massacre in March 1836. It was restored in the 1960s and became a National Historic Landmark in 1967. While several adjacent historical sites in Goliad are now part of the Texas state parks system, La Bahía is owned by the Catholic Diocese of Victoria, Texas but operates as public museum. It continues to be the subject of noted archaeological research. Overview Founded in 1721 on the ruins of the failed French Fort Saint Louis, the presidio was moved to a location on the Guadalupe River in 1726. In 1747, the presidio and its mission were moved to their current location on the San Antonio River. By 1771, the presidio had been rebuilt in stone and had become \\"the only Spanish fortress for the entire Gulf Coast from the mouth of the Rio Grande to the Mississippi River\\".Roell (1994), p. 15. The civilian settlement, later named Goliad, sprang up around the presidio in the late 18th century; the area was one of the three most important in Spanish Texas. The presidio was captured by insurgents twice during the Mexican War of Independence, by the Republican Army of the North in 1813 and by the Long Expedition in 1821. Each time the insurgents were later defeated by Spanish troops. By the end of 1821, Texas became part of the newly formed United Mexican States. La Bahía was one of the two major garrisons in Mexican Texas and lay halfway between San Antonio de Béxar (the political center of Spanish Texas) and Copano, the then major port in Texas. In October 1835, days after the beginning of the Texas Revolution, a group of Texian insurgents marched on La Bahía. After a 30-minute battle, the Mexican garrison surrendered and the Texians gained control of the presidio, which they soon renamed Fort Defiance. During the siege of the Alamo, Texian commander William B. Travis several times asked La Bahía commander James Fannin to bring reinforcements. Although Fannin and his men attempted a relief mission, they abandoned the attempt the following day. After the fall of the Alamo, General Sam Houston ordered Fannin to abandon La Bahía. He did so on March 19, 1836, but took a leisurely path. Following the Battle of Coleto, the La Bahía garrison was captured and imprisoned in the Presidio. On March 27, 1836, the Texian captives were marched outside the presidio walls and executed, an event known as the Goliad Massacre. Today, the location is a restored historical site, considered among the most attractive Spanish presidio sites in the United States. Directly adjacent, though technically a separate property, is the Fannin Memorial Monument commemorating the massacre. Origins Spain claimed control over the area now known as Texas, yet in the late 17th century the area between Mexico and Florida, within the domain of New Spain, increasingly became a lesser priority.Chipman (1992), p. 26. Taking advantage of Spain's disinterest, France in 1685 authorized Robert de La Salle to organize a colony in northern New Spain. La Salle intended to put his colony along the Mississippi River, but poor maps and improper navigation decisions led La Salle's expedition to the west shore of Matagorda Bay in Spanish Texas.Weber (1992), p. 149. Believing the French colony was a threat to Spanish mining interests and shipping routes, Spanish King Carlos II's Council of War recommended that \\"Spain needed swift action 'to remove this thorn which has been thrust into the heart of America. The greater the delay the greater the difficulty of attainment.'\\" After several years of searching, in early 1689 a Spanish expedition led by Alonso de León located the site of Fort Saint Louis. Several months earlier, Karankawa Indians had destroyed the fort and killed most of the colonists.Chipman (1992), p. 83. The returning Spaniards burned the fort and buried the French cannons.Weber (1992), p. 153. Map of Fort Saint Louis drawn by a member of the Spanish expedition which discovered the French colony in 1689. It marks the river, the colony's structures, and location of cannons. Carlos de Sigüenza y Góngora created this map of Matagorda Bay (known to the Spanish as San Bernardo Bay) based on sketches from Alonso De León's 1689 expedition. Fort Saint Louis is marked as \\"F\\", and La Belle is identified as \\"Navío Quebrado\\", or \\"broken ship\\". Alonso de León recommended that Spanish authorities establish presidios at the Rio Grande, the Frio River, and the Guadalupe River. Due to a shortage of funds the Spanish government chose not to establish any presidios.Chipman (1992), p. 88. Consequently, several Spanish missions in East Texas struggled from 1691 to 1693, until they failed, leaving Texas again unprotected by Spain.Weber (1992), p. 155. France during the subsequent decades established a presence in Louisiana, causing the Spanish to see their claimed territories threatened with French exploitation and colonization.Weber (1992), pp. 159-160. Spain re- established the East Texas missions in 1716, this time accompanied by a garrisoned presidio.Chipman (1992), p. 111.Chipman (1992), p. 112. After difficulties with France during the 1719-1720 War of the Quadruple Alliance the Spanish determined to increase their military presence in TexasWeber (1992), pp. 165–166. and in 1721 the Marquis de San Miguel de Aguayo, governor of Texas and Coahuila, founded Presidio La Bahía on the site of La Salle's former fort.Weber (1992), p. 168. When Espíritu Santo de Zúñiga (also known as La Bahía) in 1722 was established nearby for the Coco, Karankawa, and Cujane Indians, a military garrison of 99 men were stationed at the Presidio.Chipman (1992), p. 126. Priests at the nearby mission were unable to find an effective means of enticing the Karankawa into mission life or Catholic teachings. In April 1725 the friars requested that the mission be moved to a more favorable location. The next year both the presidio—retaining the name \\"Presidio La Bahía\\"—and Mission Espíritu Santo were relocated inland, along the Guadalupe River in what is now Victoria County.Roell (1994), p. 11. The presidio and the mission remained at these sites for the next 23 years.Roell (1994), p. 12. Establishment on the San Antonio River In 1747, the Spanish government sent José de Escandón to inspect the northern frontier of the North American colonies. Escandón assigned La Bahía's captain, Joaquín Prudencio de Orobio y Basterra, to evaluate South Texas. On reading Orobio's report, Escandón recommended that La Bahía be moved from its Guadalupe River location to the banks of the San Antonio River, so that it would be more capable of assisting settlements along the Rio Grande.Roell (1994), p. 13. Both the presidio and the mission likely moved in October 1749. Escandón proposed that 25 Mexican families be relocated near the presidio to form a civilian settlement but was unable to find enough willing settlers.Roell (1994), p. 14. In February 1750, the new presidio was under the command of Captain Manuel Ramírez de la Piszena. Piszena had personally paid for a stone house to be built for himself, and the 50 soldiers in the garrison lived either in a large barracks or in one of 40 temporary wood homes that had been built for those with families. A chapel had also been built for the presidio. The presidio was fortified with six 8-lb cannon. Soldiers alternated guard duty at the presidio and the mission; others were assigned to guard the presidio horses or to protect supply trains coming from the Rio Grande or San Antonio de Béxar from attacks by Lipan Apache raiding parties. 1769 map depicting Presidio La BahiaUrrutia, Lafora and Ruby, 1769 Map of the Frontier, US Library of Congress With the conclusion of the Seven Years' War in 1767, France ceded Louisiana, and French claims to Texas, to Spain.Weber (1992), p. 198. With France no longer a threat to Spain's North American interests, the Spanish monarchy commissioned the Marquis de Rubí to inspect all of the presidios on the northern frontier of New Spain and make recommendations for the future.Chipman (1992), p. 173. Rubí recommended that several presidios be closed, but that La Bahía be kept and rebuilt in stone. La Bahía was soon \\"\\"the only Spanish fortress for the entire Gulf Coast from the mouth of the Rio Grande to the Mississippi River\\". The presidio now sat at the heart of several major trade and military routes. It quickly became one of the three most important areas in Texas, alongside Béxar and Nacogdoches. A civil settlement, now known as Goliad soon developed near the presidio. By 1804, the settlement had one of only two schools in Texas.Roell (1994), p. 19. Mexican independence The Mexican War of Independence began in 1810 at the instigation of Miguel Hidalgo.Owsley (1997), p. 40. At the end of November, Texas governor Manuel María de Salcedo received notice that Hidalgo and his confederates Ignacio Allende and Juan Aldama were expected to invade Texas, and that Salcedo was expected to capture them.Almaráz (1971), p. 109. On January 2, 1812, Salcedo summoned troops throughout Texas to Béxar, leaving La Bahía with a minimal force.Almaráz (1971), p. 115. Mexican revolutionary Bernardo Gutiérrez de Lara had been in the United States organizing support for the revolution. In early August 1812, his recruits under the name, the Republican Army of the North, invaded Texas.Almaráz (1971), p. 159. In November, Salcedo led Spanish Army forces to the Guadalupe River to ambush the Republican Army of the North. One of the soldiers was captured, however, and revealed details of the ambush. The invading army turned south to avoid the trap and quickly captured Presidio La Bahía. Salcedo promptly began a siege of the fort.Almaráz (1971), p. 164. The siege lasted four months, with occasional skirmishes.Roell (1994), p. 20. Unable to win a decisive victory, Salcedo lifted the siege on February 19, 1813 and turned towards San Antonio de Béxar.Almaráz (1971), p. 168. The rebels remained in control of the presidio until July or August 1813, when José Joaquín de Arredondo led royalist troops in retaking all of Texas.Roell (1994), p. 21. A member of the Republican Army of the North, Henry Perry, led forces back to Texas in 1817 and attempted to recapture La Bahía. The presidio was reinforced by soldiers from San Antonio, and Perry and his men were defeated on June 18 near Coleto Creek. La Bahía was again the target of invaders in 1821. After the United States and Spain signed the Adams-Onís Treaty, giving all rights to Texas to Spain, many Americans were angry. On October 4, 1821, the 52 members of the Long Expedition captured La Bahía. Four days later, Colonel Ignacio Pérez arrived with troops from Béxar; Long surrendered.Roell (1994), p. 23. By the end of 1821, Mexico had achieved independence from Spain, and Texas became part of the newly created country.Weber (1992), p. 300. Texas Revolution =Battle of Goliad= This map of the presidio was drawn in 1836. By 1835, La Bahía was one of two major garrisons within Mexican Texas, alongside the Alamo at Béxar.Scott (2003), p. 19. Béxar was the political center of Texas, and La Bahía lay halfway between it and the major Texas port of Copano.Scott (2003), p. 18. Within days of the opening of the Texas Revolution in October 1835, members of the Texian militia in Matagorda decided to march on La Bahía to kidnap Mexican General Martín Perfecto de Cos.Hardin (1994), p. 14. Other Texas settlers flocked to the march, bringing the number of Texian volunteers to approximately 125 men. Although the Texians learned that Cos had already departed La Bahía to travel to Béxar, they continued their march.Hardin (1994), p. 15. Several of the Tejanos who lived near Goliad joined the Texian force, reporting that Colonel Juan López Sandoval commanded only 50 men, far fewer than the number necessary to defend the entire perimeter of the presidio.Scott (2000), p. 19.Hardin (1994), p. 16. In the pre-dawn hours of October 10, 1835, the Texians attacked the presidio. The Texians quickly hacked through a door on the north wall of the fortress and ran to the interior courtyard. Hearing the commotion, the Mexican soldiers had lined the walls to defend the fort.Scott (2000), p. 20. The Mexican soldiers opened fire, hitting Samuel McCulloch, a freed slave, in the shoulder. Texians returned fire for approximately 30 minutes. During a pause in the fighting, a Texian spokesperson yelled out that the Texians would \\"massacre everyone of you, unless you come out immediately and surrender.\\"Hardin (1994), p. 17. The Mexican garrison immediately surrendered. Over the next several days, more Texian settlers joined the group at La Bahía. Stephen F. Austin, the commander-in-chief of the newly formed Texian Army, ordered that 100 men remain at La Bahía, under the command of Philip Dimmitt, while the rest should join the Texian Army in marching on Cos's troops in Béxar. Texian troops confiscated the provisions they found at the fort. Although they found 300 muskets, most of them were broken and unable to be repaired. The food, clothing, blankets, and other provisions were valued at $10,000. For the next three months, the provisions were parcelled out among companies in the Texian Army. The Texians also gained control of several cannon.Scott (2000), p. 21. =Battle of the Alamo support= James Fannin At some point, Colonel James Fannin became the commander of the troops at La Bahía. He renamed the presidio Fort Defiance. In February 1836, President Antonio López de Santa Anna led a large force of Mexican Army troops into Texas to quell the revolution. Santa Anna and part of his force entered Béxar on February 23 and initiated a siege of the Alamo. Alamo commander William B. Travis immediately sent a courier to Fannin, asking him to provide reinforcements to the Alamo.Nofi (1992), p. 78. At first unable to make up his mind, Fannin finally decided to ride to the relief of the Alamo. Historian Robert Scott suggests that the trip was initiated after Fannin's objections were overridden by his officers.Scott (2000), p. 99. On the morning of February 26, 1836, he set out with 320 men, 4 cannon, and several supply wagons for the march from Goliad to the Alamo. The Goliad garrison had no horses to move the wagons and artillery and were forced to rely on oxen.Todish et al. (1998), p. 44. Barely into their journey, one of the wagons broke down, and the expedition stopped for repairs.Edmondson (2000), p. 324. The group then took six hours to cross the waist-deep water of the San Antonio River. By the time they reached the other side it was dark, and the men camped along the river. The cold front reached Goliad that evening, and the poorly-dressed soldiers were \\"quickly chilled and miserable\\" in the driving rain.Scott (2000), p. 100. On awakening, Fannin realized that all of the Texian oxen had wandered off, and that his men had neglected to pack food for the journey.Edmondson (2000), p. 328. It took most of the day for the men to round up the oxen; after two days of travel, Fannin's men had not even ventured from their fort.Nofi (1992), p. 95. In a letter to Acting Governor James Robinson, Fannin said that his officers approached him to ask that the rescue trip be cancelled, as they had received word that General Urrea's army was marching towards Goliad. The officers and men in the expedition claimed that Fannin decided on his own to abort the mission. Several of the men agreed with the decision, with Dr. Barnard writing in his journal, \\"With but three or four hundred men, mostly on foot, with but a limited supply of provisions, to march a distance of nearly one-hundred miles through uninhabited country for the purpose of relieving a fortress beleaguered by five-thousand men was madness!\\"Scott (2000), p. 101. =Goliad Massacre= After learning of the fall of the Alamo, General Sam Houston ordered Fannin and his men to abandon La Bahía and fall back to Victoria. They began the retreat on March 19, 1836, carrying with them nine pieces of artillery but little food or water. Fannin showed no signs of haste, and on the banks of Coleto Creek Mexican General José de Urrea and his men attacked. Although the Texians initially repulsed the attacks, they soon ran out of water and Fannin surrendered. The Texians were escorted back to La Bahía, arriving by March 22, 1836. Although Urrea requested that Santa Anna treat the prisoners with clemency, on March 27, 1836, the men were marched from the fort and executed by Mexican soldiers, in an event known as the Goliad Massacre. Restoration In the 1960s, local philanthropist Kathryn O'Connor donated $1 million to restore the presidio. Construction took place between 1963 and 1968, under the oversight of architect Raiford Stripling. The building was essentially rebuilt from the ground up to look exactly as it had originally.Mason (1974), p. 78. In his Spanish Missions of Texas, Herbert Malloy Mason remarked that the presidio was one of \\"the finest examples of Spanish ecclesiastical building on the North American continent\\".Mason (1974), p. 71.

The \\"wheel\\" is actually a large space frame beam with hooped tracks at either end, within which the performers can stand. As the performers run around on either the inside or outside of the hoops, the whole apparatus rotates. Performers also perform balancing skills with the wheel in a stationary position. The Wheel of Death is said to have originated in America during the early 1930s and was also known as the Space Wheel. Some early versions were performed by a single artist and incorporated a counterbalance on the other end. Following fatal accidents, the apparatus fell out of favour for a time until it was re- introduced in the 1970s under the name Wheel of Death. For its 2007 touring edition, Ringling Bros. started using the name Wheel of Steel, as the word death was not seen as family friendly from a public relations perspective. Noted artists who have performed on the wheel include Nik Wallenda, Elvin Bale and Bello Nock.

Its earliest attested documentation dates to 1600. It is situated in the southern part of the county, near the Apuseni Mountains, on the banks of the Băița River. Câmpani is situated at roughly equal distances to 3 towns: Nucet (5 km), Ștei (6 km), Vașcău (8 km), and 88 km from the county capital Oradea. Administration The commune is composed of five villages: Câmpani, Fânațe (Fonóháza), Hârsești (Herzafalva), Sighiștel (Kisszegyesd) and Valea de Sus (Felsőfeketevölgy). The central village itself is divided into Câmpani de Jos (Lower Câmpani) and Câmpani de Sus (Upper Câmpani); these names are received from where the houses are situated, on the upper or lower course of the river. From the administrative point of view, there is only commune. In the past there were two villages. Now the only difference is that there are 2 bus stops, one in every part. Theoretically there is only one street in the commune, the Main street, most of which is situated along the DN 75 road. However, there are some streets not connected to the road, that received name from the inhabitants, two of which are Mierăști and Hânicău. Education Câmpani has 6 kindergartens, 6 elementary schools and one secondary school. All of the school went under rehabilitation in the past years and they are now very modern ones. The local council provides a bus and a bus driver, which picks up the children from home am takes to school every morning. Most of the highschool students, study in Ștei a nearby town which has two highschools. Special buses are set on the route for their departure and arrival with the fees supported by the government. Institutions The commune contains several institutions: *5 Orthodox churches *2 Protestant churches *Town hall *Pharmacy *Police department *Small hospital *Primary and secondary schools *Community centres There are further plans for building a village museum. Economy The commune does not have any large or midsized business open. Besides few grocery shops and some bars some wood production units are available. While in the past, most of the inhabitants worked at the uranium mine in Băița or at the local factory (uzină) in Ștei, today most of them work at the European Drinks or European Food factories in Rieni, Sudrigiu or Ștei. Agriculture was an important branch of the economy in the past, but nowadays the trend had fallen. Every house was a microfarm, with at least 2 cows, 2 pigs, 20 chicken and 1 horse. Nowadays most still own 1 or 2 pigs and some chicken; but there are some that make money from agriculture owning larger farms with 10 cows and many pigs. Some are them are shepherds with tens of sheep in the herd. Tourism The Natural Reservation of the Sighiștel Valley is a major tourist attraction, the valley having a beautiful and wild canyon and numerous caves. In each summer you can find tens of tourists camping there, with tents. Another tourist attraction is the old wooden church in Fânațe, which is more than 300 years old. Sister commune Câmpani has a sister commune in France: Saint-Jean-en-Royans. Every year French come to Câmpani or Romanians go to France. An organisation “Europrietenia” (Eurofriendship) is dealing with the departures, being funded by its members and by the European Union.

It opened on 1 August 2008. It is located between Docks 1 and 2 at Port Adelaide and links to Francis Street to the east and Victoria Road to the west. The bridge was the subject of a successful community campaign, spearheaded by the local Semaphore & Port Adelaide RSL Sub-Branch and the Portside Messenger newspaper, to name it after Port Adelaide World War II hero, Tom 'Diver' Derrick instead of the State Government's unpopular choice of the Power Bridge.  History  For years, debate raged in Port Adelaide about the need for a third crossing over the Port River, in addition to the existing Birkenhead and Jervois bridges. Ideas for the crossing included an under-river tunnel, closed bridge, causeway and opening bridge. In the early 2000s the State Government announced the Port River Expressway project, a highway linking Port Adelaide to Adelaide's northern suburbs. The project included a closed bridge across the Port River. However the Port Adelaide community were concerned a closed bridge would cut- off the Port River and block larger boats from accessing the port's inner harbour. After a strong community campaign, the State Government agreed to build a high-level single-leaf bascule opening bridge. Abigroup was awarded the tender to build the bridge in 2005 and construction began the following year.Complex bridge project in Adelaide awarded to Abigroup Abigroup 12 July 2005 It opened on 1 August 2008.Official opening for new Port bridges ABC News 1 August 2008Traffic flows faster after bridge opening New Connections issue 2 October 2008 page 7 Department of Planning, Transport & Infrastructure  Name  Tom 'Diver' Derrick Bridge with the Mary MacKillop Bridge in the foreground Both road and rail bridges were originally referred to as the PRExy Bridges, short for Port River Expressway. In 2004, South Australian Premier Mike Rann announced the road crossing would be named the 'Power Bridge' after the Port Adelaide Football Club. Later in 2005, it was suggested the bridge be named after Derrick. This idea gradually garnered grassroots support in Port Adelaide. In May 2008, the Portside Messenger collected a 3,500 signature petition in support of the Derrick name. Port Adelaide-Enfield Council also unanimously supported naming the bridge after Derrick. On 5 June 2008, the State Government announced it had changed its mind and would name the bridge after Derrick.

Description The Plainview Site is located on the banks of Running Water Draw in Hale County, Texas. The site is that of a kill site, where hunters either drove the animals off a cliff or trapped them in a river bend. Fossil remnants of more than 100 animals (a prehistoric form of the American bison) have been found at the site, as were more than 20 projectile points and other stone artifacts. The site has been subjected to illegal digging and vandalism. The site has long been known locally as a source of prehistoric artifacts, but was not formally investigated until the 1940s, after a gravel mining operation began in the area. In 1944, Glen L. Evans and Grayson Meade led a systematic investigation of the site. Although the remains of many animals were found, they were missing both skulls and tailbones, suggesting that these were removed to another location for further processing and use. They dug a pit to understand the site's stratigraphy which was enlarged in 1945 and followed by additional pits in subsequent years. The site was again investigated in the 1970s, at which time the extent of the kill bed was enlarged. Subsequent research into materials collected at the site suggests that it was repeatedly used as a kill site. The site's finds have also shed light on the butchering techniques of hunters.

Puritan also owned WLYN (1360 AM) and WLYN-FM (101.7), as well as stations in Brattleboro, Vermont, and Nashua, New Hampshire. In 1982 the station moved to 1450 kHz, added nighttime operation and changed call letters to WCEA. In 1987 the call letters were changed to WNCG; they returned to WNBP in 1991. WNBP's logo as \\"The Legends\\" Through the late 1970s, '80s and '90s the station changed hands several times. In 1987 it was purchased by longtime WBZ newscaster Ted Larsen and Dan Friel for $195,000. They changed the call sign to WNCG, representing \\"Newburyport, The Coast and Gloucester, Your Coastal Home Companion.\\" In 1989 they sold the station to New Hampshire broadcaster Win Damon for $425,000. He changed the call sign back to WNBP. In 1998, Damon sold the station to Radio Newburyport LLC, owned by Robert \\"Doc\\" Fuller for $225,000. Fuller, along with partner J.J. Jeffrey, owned several other stations under their company name Fuller- Jeffrey Broadcasting. WNBP was a sole venture of Fuller with his longtime friend Al Mozier as general manager. Although J.J. Jeffrey was not part of the ownership, his voice was used for all the recorded imaging and promotional announcements. Many improvements to the station were made by Fuller and Mozier including purchasing all new studio equipment, Audisk and later Air-Traffic- Control automation, new BE-1 transmitter and installing a new tower and ground system at the transmitter site on Ferry Road in Salisbury, Massachusetts. In September 2004, Radio Newburyport LLC (Robert Fuller, president) announced a deal had been reached to sell WNBP to Westport Communications LP (Todd Tanger, managing member) for a reported sale price of $500,000. The deal was brokered by Frank Boyle of Frank Boyle and Associates. At the time of the sale, Westport Communications owned only one other station, WBOQ (104.9 FM). WNBP's studios were relocated to nearby Beverly, Massachusetts, but the station still focused its local news and community coverage on the greater Newburyport area. In March 2009, WNBP was sold by Westport Communications to Port Broadcasting, LLC, owned by Carl Strube, Peter Falconi and Robert Couture. The station began broadcasting from new downtown Newburyport studios at 6 Federal Street on March 13. The format remained the same. On January 1, 2013, WNBP shifted their format from adult standards to oldies. Among WNBP's air staff were former WBOQ disc jockey Jacky Ankeles as well as Jeff Lawrence. On July 28, 2017, Port Broadcasting agreed to sell WNBP and W291CC to Bloomberg L.P. for $1 million; Bloomberg began operating the station under a local programming and marketing agreement on August 1. The station began to simulcast Bloomberg Radio programming with WRCA (1330 AM); that station also operates a translator at 106.1 MHz, which is required to limit its signal to the northeast of Boston to protect W291CC.

In his lifetime he had numerous medical papers published. He was also an amateur mythologist, and wrote Ancient Pagan and Modern Christian Symbolism, first published in 1869 and then again in 1875.Inman, Thomas. Ancient Pagan and Modern Christian Symbolism, Second Edition. New York: J. W. Bouton, 706 Broadway. 1875. In it he elucidated the origins of common symbols, some of them medical. Many of the symbols he discusses are in use today. Life Born on 27 January 1820 in Rutland Street, Leicester, he was second son of Charles Inman, a partner in Pickfords carrying company, and later director of the Bank of Liverpool; William Inman was his younger brother. Thomas went to school at Wakefield, and in 1836 was apprenticed to his uncle, Richard Inman, M.D., at Preston, Lancashire. He entered King's College, London, where he graduated M.B. in 1842 and M.D. in 1844 at the University of London. Declining a commission as an army surgeon, Inman settled in Liverpool as house-surgeon to the Royal Infirmary. He obtained a good practice as a physician, and was for many years physician to the Royal Infirmary. In 1871 he gave up practice and retired to Clifton, near Bristol, where he died on 3 May 1876. He was a man of handsome presence, and his genial temperament made him generally popular. Works Inman's publications on personal hygiene are practical advice. On 21 October 1844 he became a member of the Literary and Philosophical Society of Liverpool, to whose Proceedings he contributed papers, mainly on archæological subjects. He read widely, was no scholar, but wrote with ingenuity. From Godfrey Higgins he derived the suggestion that the key to all mythology is to be sought in phallic worship. On 5 February 1866 he first propounded this theory in a paper on The Antiquity of certain Christian and other Names. The subject was pursued in other papers, and in three works on Ancient Faiths, which he published between 1868 and 1876.

It is situated just south of the Roman site of Jerash and covers an area of of rolling hills covered with pine–oak habitat. This area houses the largest Aleppo Pines one of the oldest and naturally grown habitats in Jordan. It also is the home to 17 endangered species such as the Persian Squirrel. The area was protected as a nature reserve in 2004 under the initiative of the Royal Society for the Conservation of Nature.  Geology and climate  The forest is known as the driest places in the region and ranges over 60 km and is changing in altitude of 500m to 1000m above sea level. The rock within the reserve is a mixture of limestone and chalky limestone, which has been formed into steep slopes. The average rainfall is per year. Within the forest, there is a variety of moisture conditions, with wadis giving different regimes from those found on the steep slopes.  The Royal Society for the Conservation of Nature (RSCN)  The Royal Society for the Conservation of Nature (RSCN) is a voluntary organization that works to preserve the natural resources of Jordan. It was established in 1966 under the patronage of Queen Noorr and the late King Hussein as Honorary President. In 1966 their main focus was the decline in animal species due to illegal hunting in the area and the disregard to nature in Jordan. The small group of pioneers worked side by side with the government to make sure that wildlife was kept safe by creating ground rules and hunting laws. As a result, in 1973, the RSCN was given the right to issue hunting licenses and develop hunting patrols to regulate hunting laws in Jordan. Their work flourished and by 1995 they were the first to establish the first Jordanian Environmental Protection Law and an Environmental Police Unit in 2006. Throughout the years the RSNC has dutifully protected six areas around Jordan (1200 square meters). These areas include Shaumari, Azraq, Dana, Wadi Mujib, Ajloun, and Dibeen. On May 17, 2016, The Jordan Times wrote an article on the RSCN's celebration of its golden jubilee.  Flora  leftThe forest reserve contains one of the last remaining examples of a pine–oak forest in the Middle East. The species of the reserve's trees vary with elevation; Aleppo Pines inhabit the lower altitudes, the mixed pine–oak woodland (comprising Aleppo Pine and Palestine Oak) grows in the middle, and a species of small deciduous oak – Quercus infectoria (the Aleppo, or Cyprus, Oak) – grows at the higher altitudes. Other flora in the habitat include orchids, Greek strawberry trees, pistachio, and olive trees. The forest's age structure shows wide variation, with many areas containing mature forest trees and a vigorous understory.  Fauna  At least 17 endangered species have been identified within the reserve. These include the Persian red squirrel, four bat types, grey wolves and striped hyenas. Woodland birds also live in the forest. It is also believed but not proven, that this reserve has the last population of Southern Banded Newts living in Jordan  Conservation  Dibeen Forest Reserve was established in 2004 after being listed as a conservation priority in the 1998 protected areas review and the 8.5 km2 area became part of the protected area. Between 2004 and 2007, UNDP led a project in the Dibeen Forest, Jerash, Al Meirad and Burma municipalities of the region to support the establishment of the nature reserve. This helped to conserve the unique local biodiversity and encouraged the local communities to make sustainable alternative uses of the available resources. As a result, there was increased awareness of the local capacity-building and need for the conservation- oriented land use planning in the region.UNDP (2003) Conservation and Sustainable Use of Biodiversity in Dibeen Nature Reserve .

It served on a number of the Navy's aircraft carriers during the Second World War, serving in most of the theatres of the war, before decommissioning at the end of the war. It was re-formed in 1950 as 808 Squadron RAN, a carrier-based attack squadron of the Royal Australian Navy's Fleet Air Arm, and saw action during the Korean War before disbanding again in 1958. History =Royal Navy= 808 Squadron was formed at RNAS Worthy Down in July 1940, flying twelve Fairey Fulmars in the role of a Fleet Fighter squadron. They were initially assigned to the Isle of Man to carry out patrols over the Irish Sea, but were soon transferred to Wick for the defence of the dockyards. Following this, the squadron was reassigned to RAF Fighter Command and was one of only two Allied naval aviation squadrons to take part in the Battle of Britain, the other being 804 Naval Air Squadron. In September 1940, the squadron was assigned to the aircraft carrier , which was part of Force H, operating in the Mediterranean. The squadron shot down two enemy aircraft in an attack on Sardinia in November, followed by another two in operations over Sicily in January 1941, and a fifth while defending Malta in May. The carrier was reassigned to the Atlantic in late May, as part of the hunt for the . Following the successful sinking of the Bismarck, the carrier returned to the Mediterranean, with 807 and 808 Squadrons claiming fifteen aerial kills during July and August. 808 Squadron was embarked when Ark Royal was torpedoed and sunk by the on 13 November 1941. Although all of the squadron personnel survived the sinking, many of the aircraft were lost in the attack: the surviving aircraft were flown from Ark Royal before the carrier sank and on arrival in Gibraltar were merged with the survivors of 807 Squadron, which had also been embarked. 808 Squadron was re-formed with six Fulmar IIs aboard in January 1942. They came aboard HMS Battler between April and May 1943 and took part in operations covering the Salerno landings in September 1943. They then formed part of the 3rd Naval Fighter Wing, returning to the United Kingdom aboard HMS Hunter. The Squadron was re-equipped in May 1944 at RNAS Lee-on- Solent with 20 Supermarine Seafire L.IIIs. At the same time, they were attached to No. 345 Reconnaissance Wing of the Royal Air Force Second Tactical Air Force. While part of this wing, 808 Squadron, along with three other FAA squadrons (885, 886 and 897) and two RAF squadrons (26 and 63), plus the USN's VCS-7, flying Spifire VBs, provided valuable target coordinates and fire control for RN and USN battleships and cruisers, during 20 days of operations during the Normandy Landings.Price 1991, pp.108–112.

Krastyo Hadzhiivanov (December 25, 1929 – June 27, 1952) was a Bulgarian poet and resistance fighter. Early life Hadzhiivanov was born in Kapatovo, in the Petrich district of Bulgaria. He began composing poetry when he was six years old. During World War II, at age of 14, he joined the resistance against the Nazis. Hadzhiivanov was involved in smuggling weapons to guerrillas who had been abandoned at the Metaxas Line in Greek Macedonia, a task which involved navigating a dangerous route through mine fields and around Nazi check points. Meanwhile, the young teenager recited poetry at meetings with villagers all over the Serres region. After Bulgaria's successful coup on 9 September 1944, the new communist government offered to send Hadzhiivanov to study literature in Moscow. He refused, with the words, “Moscow is too close to Siberia” (referring to Joseph Stalin’s Gulags). Romantic and idealist, he reflected his beliefs in poetry. Local communist authorities perceived Hadzhiivanov as a threat, and he was persecuted for his democratic and humanistic beliefs. He was mistreated during his studies at secondary school. Later was sent to the uranium mines at Seslavci village, where he was mistreated and beaten. During a strike in the mine, a friend of his was brutally killed. Hadzhiivanov succeeded in escaping from the mines and fled to the Pirin Mountains, aiming to illegally cross the “Iron Curtain” and escape to Greece. He was killed in an ambush at the border on June 27, 1952, at the age of 22. Bulgarian State Security, at the time, stated that he was presumed to be a Greek diversionist. His body was thrown in the swamps around the Struma River. Legacy Krastyo’s poetry was written before 1950 and hidden by his friends from communist State Security services, later his poetry is sent abroad, where it was published. There had been opened a small memorial at the place of Krastyo’s death in 1999 under auspices of Bulgarian vice- president Mr. Todor Kavaldzhiev. There took place a celebration of the 70th jubilee of the poet. For the 80th jubilee in 2009 there has been established an Initiative Committee under chairmanship of Mr. Evtim Evtimov – a Bulgarian poet and country fellow of Krastyo.

History As a result of persistent request from parents of pupils in the local Franciscan Nursery and Primary School and from the general public, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Osogbo decided to establish a private Secondary School in Ilesa, Osun State. By October 1996, a temporary site was established at the compound of the Ijofi- Ilesa Franciscan nursery and primary school, which provided some classrooms and basic facilities, pending the development of the permanent site of about 60 plots of land, comprising about ten hectares along Iyemogun Road. Preparatory classes for prospective students commenced in October, 1996 with about 100 students who had written and passed the entrance examination. By January 1997, the proprietor the Most Reverend Bishop Gabriel 'Leke Abegunrin, gave his approval for the establishment of the school, and the school was officially named. Application was made to the Ministry of Education at the Osun State Government for official approval, resulting in a series of official inspections being conducted by the State Ministry of Education. Provisional approval was given by the government in a letter dated 20 January 1997, and the school was formally opened as the first catholic private high school in Ijesaland, and the first to be established by the newly created Osogbo catholic diocese. Officials Reverend Mary O. Gerard and Chief Lawrence Ade Ogedengbe were appointed as the first Administrator and Principal of the school. Aims and Objectives To conform with governmental policy on education, the aims and objectives of the school as detailed by the founding fathers include : *Preparation of students for useful living in the society and for higher education *Providing qualitative higher education opportunity for the increasing number of primary school pupils, irrespective of sex, social status, religion and ethnicity.

It is the first to be released for the Windows operating system, and the first by Team Shanghai Alice. All games before Embodiment of Scarlet Devil were made for the PC-98 series of computers and were released by Amusement Makers.  Gameplay  Embodiment of Scarlet Devil, or abbreviated as EoSD, features two playable characters to choose from, each having two distinct attack types. Reimu Hakurei covers a wide area of the screen with weaker attacks, whereas Marisa Kirisame relies on her speed and power to make up for her thinner attack spread. The bombs (\\"Spell Cards\\") also show different behavior and damage depending on the character and type chosen. Some important gameplay features that Embodiment of Scarlet Devil introduces over its predecessor Mystic Square are automatic item collection, which allows the player to collect all items on screen by moving to the top of the screen at full power; and the counter-bomb system, which allows the player to negate an enemy hit by pressing the bomb button immediately after contact with the enemy projectile. Also, this game is the first Touhou game to feature Touhou's iconic \\"Spell Card\\" system. Each Spell Card is a particular bullet pattern and is given a name. A bonus can be earned if the player does not use a bomb or die during any particular pattern.  Plot  In the summer of the 118th season, there occurred an incident called the Scarlet Mist Incident (紅霧異変). Gensokyo was entirely covered in this mist, and since the sun was obstructed, it became a gloomy and chilly summer. Since this strange mist even reached the human village of Gensokyo, and since humans are not typically able to withstand 30 minutes of the strange mist, the humans of the village were not able to exit from their homes for several days until the incident was resolved. Reimu Hakurei, a shrine maiden working at the Hakurei Shrine, felt that it was her duty as a shrine maiden to find the cause of this unnatural weather. Marisa Kirisame, a black-clothed magician, hoped that the person responsible for the mist would have some interesting items to collect. The heroines found their way to the Scarlet Devil Mansion (紅魔館) in the middle of Misty Lake (霧の湖), where its residents tried to stop the intruders from reaching the lord of the mansion. The source of the mist is revealed to be final boss Remilia Scarlet, a vampire. Remilia reveals that the scarlet mist was created to block out the sun so that she could feel comfortable during the day (because vampires are weak against the sun). After a fierce battle, Remilia is defeated and things return to relative normality in Gensokyo. The Scarlet Mist Incident is the first time the spell card rules were used, which popularized their use throughout Gensokyo, and battles from then on also used the spell card rules. In the Extra Mode, the heroines returned to the Scarlet Devil Mansion during Remilia's absence and found the entire household in chaos. Remilia's younger sister, Flandre Scarlet, was on the loose, while Patchouli Knowledge, the library witch, was trying to keep her from escaping. Meeting the heroines after 495 years of being locked in the basement, Flandre asked that they would play with her, but the heroines defeated her. = Setting = The Scarlet Devil Mansion, which features in stage 3 and beyond, as well as on the extra stage, is a western mansion located at the bottom of yokai mountain on a causeway of Misty Lake. It is entirely scarlet in color, and the road that leads to it is also entirely scarlet. It has a clock tower, which rings only at 12 o'clock midnight. The head of this mansion is the final boss Remilia Scarlet, but since she is a child, the head maid and fifth stage boss Sakuya Izayoi is in charge of the place. The gatekeeper is the third stage boss Hong Meiling, who intercepts fairies who come from the lake. The extra boss Flandre Scarlet is also in here, as well as a great number of fairy maids who feature as regular stage enemies. Sakuya manipulates the space inside and makes it seem larger in appearance. =Characters= Playable characters: *Reimu Hakurei — The miko of the Hakurei Shrine. Her two modes of attack in this game are homing amulets and needles. *Marisa Kirisame — An ordinary magician. Her two modes of attack in the game are magic missiles and lasers. Boss characters: * — Stage one mid-boss and main boss. She is a yōkai who has the physical appearance of a young girl. She has blond hair, red eyes, wears black clothing, and her hair is wrapped in a red ribbon.Page in Perfect Memento in Strict Sense related to the relevant character. This ribbon is an ofuda, and Rumia herself cannot touch it. Her ability is to create a sphere of night around her, but as it impedes her own vision significantly, it is not useful in combat. She usually spends her days fluttering around aimlessly. * — Stage two mid-boss. An almost inconsequential character who received no character profile in the game; fans named her Daiyousei (lit. \\"Big/Great Fairy\\"). ZUN later attributed her as bright, playful, and full of expressions. Sometimes appears in dōjinshi with Cirno.そそ, ZUN's diary via webarchives. 2004-1-12. * — Stage two boss, attacks with icicles. A leader of the fairies of the Lake of Fog, but is not very bright. Her hobby is freezing frogs and watching them revive as they thaw, but she tends to shatter them instead by accident. She radiates cold air year-round, and can stay awake even in spring and summer. * — Stage three mid-boss and main boss, a Chinese-looking youkai acting as gate keeper of the Scarlet Devil Mansion. She is known to be a very humanoid yōkai who practices martial arts, but is generally friendly towards humans. She is often referred to as \\"Chūgoku\\" (meaning China) by Japanese fans. * — Stage four mid-boss. Similar to Daiyousei, she received no character profile in the game and was named Koakuma (lit. \\"Little Devil\\") by fans. ZUN later described her to be like Daiyousei — whimsical, enjoys pranks, and doesn't think before doing. He also added that while devils are powerful as vampires and magicians, Koakuma is a rather weak one, therefore, she is a Koakuma (Little Devil). * — Stage four boss and Extra Stage mid-boss. A scholar who is a friend of Remilia Scarlet, holing herself in the library of Remilia's mansion and becoming the de facto librarian. She has command over the seven elements (which the Japanese days of the week are named after, making her the \\"One-week Wizard\\") and is in theory an extremely powerful magician. However, her constitution is very poor and asthma often prevents her from reciting her spells. She has a tenuous relationship with Marisa, who tends to carry off her books without asking. * — Stage five boss and stage six mid-boss. The head maid of the Scarlet Devil Mansion, armed with throwing knives and control over time. Sakuya is the only human living in the Scarlet Devil Mansion.『三月精 第2部』「上海アリス通信 三精版 第5号」（『月刊コンプエース』Vol.7 p.275。実質的には「第6号」なのだが誤植で「第5号」になっている。単行本未収録）。 She was not born in Gensokyo, and the name \\"Sakuya Izayoi\\" was given to her by Remilia Scarlet. In Perfect Memento in Strict Sense, Akyuu guessed that she might have originally been a vampire hunter. Meanwhile, she is utterly devoted to her mistress. * — Final boss, the mistress of the Scarlet Devil Mansion. A vampire who controls fate, but is weak against sun and rain. She claims to be descended from Vlad III Dracula although she is not. She is known as the Scarlet Devil as when she feeds, the blood of her victims stains her dress red. Apart from her unpleasant needs, she is hardly malicious enough to deserve such a title; merely childish, even though she is over five hundred years old. Although being a vampire is normally a lonely life, she has a good relationship with her many employees (including Sakuya and Meirin). Reimu is one of the few humans who tolerates her, and Remilia seems quite fond of her in turn. Marisa also gets along with her in exchange for access to her library. She prefers melee fighting to danmaku, but when she does resort to the latter, she is fond of red round bullets and knives. * — Extra Stage boss. Remilia's little sister, she has been shut in the basement for 495 years because of her destructive powers. Despite this, she likes her sister and doesn't usually try to escape. Most vampires hold back somewhat when fighting humans, as they plan to keep them alive and feed from them later, but Flandre was always fed prepared dishes and does not know her food comes from humans. Other: * is a scrapped character associated with a portrait used to advertise Embodiment of Scarlet Devil at Comiket. Development In the four years since Mystic Square, the previous Touhou installment, the creator ZUN branched off from Amusement Makers and established his own dōjin circle named \\"Team Shanghai Alice\\", with ZUN himself as the member. As EoSD would be the first release of Team Shanghai Alice and the first game made for a Windows audience, ZUN felt that the game would need to leave an impression. This is why EoSD has a Western theme, unlike most other games in the Touhou Project whose theme is Oriental. The Spell Card system, featured in every Touhou game since EoSD, was created by ZUN in 1999 while working on Seihou, and was intended to be a means to identify bullet patterns with names as well as adding depth to his characters. ZUN further stated that EoSD itself was created for the purpose of introducing this system.「システム」「スペルカードボーナス」, 幻想掲示板 (ZUN's guestbook) via webarchives. 2002-11. EoSD is also the first time ZUN programmed a Windows application from scratch. As he was more familiar with APIs and DirectX and was relatively unfamiliar with the application level, a lot of time was put into creating libraries and tools for EoSD. As a result, little time remained to improve the game's presentation, and ZUN resolved to improve the next game in that regard.ZUN, \\"Shanghai Alice Correspondence Vol.1\\" . Embodiment of Scarlet Devil Afterword. 2002-8-11. The game's soundtrack was originally composed for the Roland SC-88 Pro sound module.

Eliasson has said that the scaffolds themselves were designed to blend in with their urban surroundings, but that he purposely did not try to conceal them, explaining he \\"want[s] people to know that this is both a natural phenomenon and a cultural one.” Construction involved the work of 108 different people, including two environmental consultants. The installation was designed to be ecologically-friendly. Some example of this are energy efficient LED lighting by USA based LED Lighting Designers & Manufacturers Boca Flasher, Inc., energy purchased from renewable sources and the filters used to keep aquatic life from taking a ride up-and-over the waterfall. When the project closed the materials were intended to be made available for re-use in a future project. =Costs= The over $15 million project had no city funding and was paid for entirely by private organizations, business and donors. Mayor Michael Bloomberg's company, Bloomberg LP, donated $13.5 million. With estimates that the waterfalls could generate up to $55 million for the local economies, the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation gave $2 million to the effort. Environmental impact During the run, trees and shrubs along the Brooklyn Heights Promenade were damaged as a result of the saltwater blown into the parks during high winds. Several steps were taken to solve this problem which included cutting the running time to 50 hours a week instead of the original 101. At the Brooklyn Bridge, the owner of The River Café claimed customer loss and plant replacements as a result of the winds on the falls. The known damages were getting attention to the point that The Brooklyn Heights Association asked the committee to take down the falls after Labor Day, instead of the original date; however, there was no response.

It is run by UCM students for UCM students and contributes to both academic and social life at UCM. The association is involved in the organisation of debates, poetry readings, open-mic nights, parties, charity fundraisers, student representation, and other events. Following a structure typical of Maastricht University study associations, it is run by a student board. The Universalis student board consists of a Social Board, an Academic Council, and an Independent Body. Board positions are traditionally a semester to two semesters long. Active members of the association are organised as committees which provide services for all students at the college. All new students automatically become a member upon enrollment at the college.  Organisation structure  There are currently six members on the UCMSA Universalis Social Board: President, Treasurer, Secretary, External Executive, Social Executive, and Acquisitions Executive. Currently, only the President is elected by Universalis members, the rest of the Board are selected by the previous Board and then officialised through a public vote in a General Assembly. Board members serve for one or two semesters after which they can re-apply.Pot, E.; Pagán, B. UCMSA Universalis Charter, Notarised 3 December 2002 Social Board meetings are held once a week. Universalis's committees and societies operate under the Social Board, who seek to financially and logistically facilitate all committee activities. The Academic Council works in parallel with the Social Board, with five members: Chair, Treasurer, Events Coordinator, Internal Executive and External Executive. The Council represents students in working with the University College Maastricht's Board of Studies, who are responsible for evaluating academic courses and affairs. They also organize Academic conferences, guest speakers, academic workshops, and student exchanges with sister colleges. The Academic Council is funded by the Social Board but works in conjunction with the Social Board. The Independent Body consists of three to five students elected by a general assembly with the goal of keeping the Social Board and Academic Council in accordance with the association's Statutes and Policy Manual. They also serve a functional role in General Assemblies and voting procedures.

Several students formed an informal founding committee to get a student society started.Lucas, G.; Pot, E.; Pagán, B.; Wiebe, P.; Josten, L.; Plenter, J., UCM Study Association Universalis: Annual Report 2002-2003 Because the diversity of UCM's students and its curriculum, they decided that Da Vinci's Homo Universalis was a suitable symbol for the student society's identity. It represents the juxtaposition of different interests in its members and of the diverse UCM student body. The founding committee decided to call the association Universalis and Brian Pagán designed the logo, a stylised version of the Vitruvian Man.

It had 1,381 employees as of December 31, 2006. History Atlantis was founded in 1984 as a holding company, initially with interests in the insurance and furniture industries. From 1986 to 1994 it acquired various plastics industry holdings. In 1987 it was acquired by the equity firm Trivest, which soon spun Atlantis off as a public company but retained an ownership stake. Atlantis is headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia and has facilities in fifteen locations within ten U.S. states (Arkansas, California, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, Oklahoma, Tennessee, and Texas). Atlantis has three business segments: Plastic Films for wrapping pallets of materials, Injection Molding for parts used in products such as appliances and recreational vehicles and Plastics Extrusion used in products such as residential siding. The corporation earned $43.6 million in 2005 and $29.0 million in 2006, on sales of $424.3 and $418.7 million, respectively. The downturn was attributed to the slump in the housing sector. In 2008, Atlantis Plastics agreed to delist from NASDAQ and move to Pink Sheets following disclosure that the company was not in compliance with the minimum bid price requirement. Shooting On June 25, 2008 at the 160-employee injection molding manufacturing facility in Henderson, Kentucky, six workers were killed and another was injured in a workplace shooting. Among the dead was the gunman, who reportedly retrieved the gun from his car after getting into a dispute with a co-worker and being told to go home by supervisor. The gunman shot the supervisor then opened fire in a break room, and ended the shooting spree by killing himself.

Records in 1986. Destiny was Khan's follow-up to the platinum-selling I Feel for You and was as high tech as its predecessor—symptomatically and characteristically for its period with more producers and sound engineers credited in the liner notes than musicians—but was musically more geared towards rock and pop than soul and R&B;, most prominently on tracks such as \\"So Close\\", the self-penned title track \\"My Destiny\\", \\"Who's It Gonna Be\\" and \\"Watching the World\\" featuring Phil Collins on drums and backing vocals. The album spun off five single releases, the first being \\"Love of a Lifetime\\", co-written, co-produced and featuring backing vocals by Green Gartside of British band Scritti Politti (US Pop #53, US R&B; #21, UK #52). The second single \\"Tight Fit\\" was a midtempo R&B; ballad, just like \\"Eye to Eye\\" from I Feel for You produced by Russ Titelman, which reached #28 on the US R&B; chart. The satirical \\"Earth to Mickey\\" (When are you going to land?), featuring Khan both singing and rapping (and keyboardist Reggie Griffin rapping in the role of 'Mickey'), was released as the third single in early 1987 and only just made the Top 100 of the R&B; chart, peaking at #93. The dramatic ballad \\"The Other Side of the World\\", written by Mike Rutherford of Genesis and B. A. Robertson and which had first been released as part of the White Nights soundtrack album in late 1985, reached #81. The fifth single \\"Watching the World\\" never charted. The album itself fared slightly better, reaching #25 on Billboard's R&B; albums chart, but stalling at #67 on Pop and #77 in the UK. Destiny however gave Khan another Grammy nomination in 1987 for Best R&B; Vocal Performance, Female. The track \\"My Destiny\\" was used as the theme song for Richard Pryor's motion picture Jo Jo Dancer, Your Life Is Calling. The closing track, the heavily edited one minute thirty-nine seconds \\"Coltrane Dreams\\", a tribute to John Coltrane, had a backing track mainly made up of samples of Khan's voice. The actual full-length version of the track (4:54) was only released as the B-side of the 12\\" single \\"Love of a Lifetime\\". \\"Love of a Lifetime\\", \\"Tight Fit\\", \\"Earth to Mickey\\" and \\"Watching the World\\" were all released as 12\\" singles including extended remixes. While the success of Khan's own single releases in 1986 was limited to the R&B; charts, she appeared as featured vocalist/vocal arranger on two worldwide pop/rock chart hits that same year, Steve Winwood's \\"Higher Love\\" and Robert Palmer's \\"Addicted to Love\\"; on the latter she was only credited for 'vocal arrangement' in the liner notes. The song was originally recorded with Khan sharing lead vocals with Palmer but due to contractual problems between Warner Bros. Records and Island Records her own vocals were removed from the final mix.Interview, thestar.com February 9, 2008 Track listing #\\"Love of a Lifetime\\" (David Gamson, Green Gartside) – 4:21 #\\"Earth to Mickey\\" (Joshua Fried, Reggie Griffin, Arif Mardin, Charlie Singleton, Jeremy Wolff) – 5:37 #\\"Watching the World\\" (John Lang, Richard Page, Steve George) – 4:44 #\\"The Other Side of the World\\" (B.

Completed in 1894, it was later the headquarters of the Fidelity and Deposit Company of Baltimore which was founded in 1892. Overview Located at the rise of Cathedral Hill at the northwest corner of North Charles Street and West Lexington Street on the eastern edge of the city's main live and movie theatre district along West Lexington and the department store/retail shopping area focused several blocks west at Howard and Lexington Streets. It also is situated at the south end of the tomey Victorian-era residential townhouses and mansions of the neighborhood of Mount Vernon-Belvedere, centered by the landmark Washington Monument several blocks north, visible from the F. & D.'s front doors. The building's architectural style is Romanesque Revival. The building designed by the prominent local architectural firm of Baldwin & Pennington, composed of leading regional designers, Ephraim Francis Baldwin, (1837–1916) and Josias Pennington, (1854–1929) - main \\"house architects\\" for stations and structures of the dominant Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. B. & P. used steel cage framing construction with a grey, rough-cut granite facing. The original roof had French dormers and mansard roof (evoking French Second Empire styling and a southeast corner cupola/tower. The building is used for business by Fidelity. The building originally contained eight floors with a façade of grey granite, with a corner cupola tower and mansard roof. It stood on the northwestern edge of the famous \\"burnt district\\" of the February 1904 Great Baltimore Fire which destroyed numerous downtown and waterfront buildings and skyscrapers up to across the street. Following the initial reconstruction phase of 1905–1910, when several recently built downtown towers were burned out, but their steel skeletons and concrete foundations/floors and floors survived structurally sound and were rebuilt with new interiors and masonry facades. So F. & D. under the leadership of founder and president Edwin Warfield, (1848–1920), former 45th governor of Maryland, made arrangements between 1912 and 1915, reflecting the continued growth of the company to add seven more floors were added to the top of the building, increasing the number of floors to fifteen, with the upper storied covered with a surface of terra-cotta, matching the style of the original architecture below. In 1962, One Charles Center was constructed next to the Fidelity Building.

Set up in 1807, it is one of the U.S. government's oldest scientific organizations. In 1878 it was given the name of Coast and Geodetic Survey (C&GS;). In 1970 it became part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).  History  = Beginnings = The agency was established in 1807 when President Thomas Jefferson signed the document entitled \\"An act to provide for surveying the coasts of the United States.\\"“An act to provide for surveying the coasts of the United States.” While the bill's objective was specific—to produce nautical charts—it reflected larger issues of concern to the new nation: national boundaries, commerce, and defense. The early years were difficult. Ferdinand Rudolph Hassler, who was eventually to become the agency's first superintendent, went to England to collect scientific instruments but was unable to return through the duration of the War of 1812. After his return, he worked on a survey of the New York Harbor in 1817, but Congress stepped in to suspend the work because of tensions between civilian and military control of the agency. After several years under the control of the U.S. Army, the Survey of the Coast was reestablished in 1832, and President Andrew Jackson appointed Hassler as superintendent. The U.S. Coast Survey was a civilian agency but, from the beginning, members of the Navy and Army were detailed to service with the Survey, and Navy ships were also detailed to its use. In general, army officers worked on topographic surveys on the land and maps based on the surveys, while navy officers worked on hydrographic surveys in coastal waters.John Cloud, The U.S. Coast Survey in the Civil War, June 2011 = Civil War = Alexander Dallas Bache, great-grandson of Benjamin Franklin, was the second Coast Survey superintendent. Bache was a physicist, scientist, and surveyor who established the first magnetic observatory and served as the first president of the National Academy of Sciences. Under Bache, Coast Survey quickly applied its resources to the Union cause during the Civil War. In addition to setting up additional lithographic presses to produce the thousands of charts required by the Navy and other vessels, Bache made a critical decision to send Coast Survey parties to work with blockading squadrons and armies in the field, producing hundreds of maps and charts.Maps and charts Bache detailed these activities in his annual reports to Congress.Annual reports to Congress Coast Survey cartographer Edwin Hergesheimer created the map showing the density of the slave populationMap showing the density of the slave population in the Southern states.Distribution of the slave population of the Southern States of the United States – 1860Susan Schulten,\\"Visualizing Slavery\\", The New York Times Opinionator, Dec. 9, 2010 Bache was also one of four members of the government's Blockade Strategy Board, planning strategy to essentially strangle the South, economically and militarily. On April 16, 1861, President Lincoln issued a proclamation declaring the blockade of ports from South Carolina to Texas. Bache's Notes on the CoastNotes on the Coast provided valuable information for Union naval forces. Maps were of paramount importance in wartime: = After the Civil War = Coast Survey attracted some of the best and brightest scientists and naturalists. It commissioned the naturalist Louis Agassiz to conduct the first scientific study of the Florida reef system. James McNeill Whistler, who went on to paint the iconic \\"Whistler's Mother\\", was a Coast Survey engraver. The naturalist John Muir was a guide and artist on \\"Survey of the 39th Parallel\\" across the Great Basin of Nevada and Utah. The agency's men and women (women professionals were hired as early as 1845) led scientific and engineering activities through the decades. In 1926, they started production of aeronautical charts. During the height of the Great Depression, Coast and Geodetic Survey organized surveying parties and field offices that employed over 10,000 people, including many out-of-work engineers.Coast and Geodetic Survey Heritage In World War II, C&GS; sent over 1,000 civilian members and more than half of its commissioned officers to serve as hydrographers, artillery surveyors, cartographers, army engineers, intelligence officers, and geophysicists in all theaters of the war.

The town was an important port and transshipment point on the Rio Grande from 1829 to the 1880s. The architecture of Roma mirrors its sister city of Ciudad Mier on the Mexican side of the river, as well as Guerrero Viejo upriver. Roma is notable for its buildings of river sandstone, caliche limestone and molded brick, using rejoneado (patterned large and small stones) and sillar (stone laid in an ashlar pattern) masonry techniques. Both methods employ an outer finish of rough lime plaster detailed with bands of smooth colored plaster, characteristic of northern Mexico. Roma also features innovative use of molded brick, brought to Roma by German immigrant Enrique (Heinrich) Portscheller, who used techniques of flat brick roofing from Monterrey to Mier, then developed a decorative brick used in Roma, Mier, Rio Grande City and Laredo. Portscheller designed buildings with his products and used wrought iron balconies in a manner reminiscent of both New Orleans and Monterrey. Roma preserves the bulk of his extant work. The historic district includes the 1928 Roma-Ciudad Miguel Alemán International Bridge, a State Antiquities Landmark, as well as the river wharfs and custom house. History Roma was established in 1821 in what had been the Spanish province of Nuevo Santander. The site offered a convenient crossing on the Rio Grande, which became known as El Paso de la Mula (Pass of the Mules). The area was notable for a salt trade from the Roma area to Monterrey. The Roma area became the Mexican province of Tamaulipas with Mexican independence, but then became part of Texas with the establishment of the Republic of Texas in 1835. Although there was a battle at Mier during the Mexican–American War in 1848, the region remained part of Texas. During the American Civil War the region became wealthy on the cotton trade, which was transshipped via Mexico to Europe. While steamboats were able to access Roma through the mid-nineteenth century, lowering water levels as a result of development upstream ended river shipment by the 1880s. Bypassed by railroads, Roma stagnated and inadvertently preserved itself from development. Description The Roma Historic District comprises 38 contributing buildings, of which 16 are stone buildings from the 1829-1870 period and 19 are brick buildings from the 1880-1900 period. The district may be divided into the following areas: *Plaza Area The plaza area features an open-ended plaza that faces the Rio Grande and Mexico on the far bank. It the northern end is the tower of the Catholic Church, on axis with the plaza. The lower plaza is defined by walled compounds built for the Vale-Garcia, Cox, Guerra, Saenz and Ramirez families. These compounds included commercial uses, particularly the Guerra store that dominated the town's commerce. *Wharf Area The wharf area along Hidalgo Street and upwards to Juarez and Estrella Streets dealt with river commerce and consist of warehouses and stores, as well as the Roma-Cuidad Miguel Aleman Bridge. It is associated with the Arroyo de San Pedro. *Customs House Area The customs house area includes Lincoln and Water Streets, comprising a mixture of commercial and residential structures, chiefly of stone construction and dominated by a brick family compound at Zaragoza and Estrella. The customs house was placed on the highest point on the bluff. *Northwestern Zone The northwestern zone is associated with the Arroyo de los Negros, the location of a secondary ferry crossing on the Rio Grande. The Roma Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972 and was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1993. In addition to the international bridge, the Manuel Guerra Home and Store is also a State Antiquities Landmark.

The company farms over 230,000 acres of land in the counties of Hendry, Glades and Palm Beach. It is the largest producer of sugar cane in the United States by volume, producing over 700,000 tonnes per year. The company is also a large producer of refined sugar, sweet corn and oranges. U.S. Sugar is considered in South Florida along with Florida Crystals and the 54-member Sugar Cane Growers Cooperative of Florida as Big Sugar. The company is one of the largest job providers in the Glades region of Florida, employing more than 2,500. History In 1931, industrialist and philanthropist Charles Stewart Mott purchased assets near Clewiston, Florida from a 1920s bankrupt sugarcane company, Southern Sugar Company, to form the United States Sugar Corporation. In the 1940s, U.S. Sugar was charged with slavery violation. Mott later transferred shares to his Charles Stewart Mott Foundation. In 1969 with a law passed limiting private family foundations could hold of a corporation, the foundation gave a large number of shares to the Mott Children's Health Center, a Flint charitable medical organization founded in 1939, to be below the 35% limit. In 1962, the company opened the Bryant Sugar House, which at the time was the largest and most advanced sugarcane processing mill in the world. The mill had a capacity of 5,000 tons of sugarcane per day. After C.S. Mott died in 1973, C.S. Harding Mott, his son, took over as chairman of the corporation. With sugar at 60 cents a pound in the 1970s and purchasers switching to corn syrup, the company expanded into other areas of farming including cattle, citrus and vegetables. In 1980, U.S. acquired South Bay Growers. South Bay Growers produced 13% of the US's leafy vegetables growing lettuce, celery and others. In late 1985, U.S. Sugar began planting orange trees. In 1983, the company formed an Employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) in an attempt to go private. U.S. Sugar borrowed millions in long-term debt to create the ESOP. Some shareholders did not sell out believing the price per share to be too low triggering a class action law suit. The ESOP and Mott group of owners in October 1987 offered $80 per share for the other 110,000 voting shares held by 500 public shareholders. This took the company private and reduced its reporting costs. Most of South Bay Growers was closed down on September 4, 1994 after four out of five prior years of losses including 10 million in 1994. South Bay's salad processing plant with customers like McDonald's and Burger King and 146 employees would continue to operate while seeking new ownership. Big sugar moved in the early 1990s to mechanical cane harvesters. The displaced cane field workers filed a class action lawsuit in which the company paid $5 million plus in 1998. In 2004, U.S. Sugar closed a mill and laid off workers. Its Bryant mill was closed in 2007. In February 2008, the corporation, CEO Robert Buker, Chairman William S. White and his family and Charles Stewart Mott Foundation were sued by employees claiming that they were not getting full value for the ESOP stock given two bids for the company stock for amounts more than ESOP redemption were offered by outside parties. Employees alleged that the Gaylon Lawrence family agro- conglomerate offered $293 per share for the company twice, once in August 2005 and in January 2007. Supposedly US Sugar president was terminated and paid hush money to hide the offer. At the time, share redemption was from $193 to $200. Environment On 24 June 2008, Florida's Governor, Charlie Crist, announced the state was in negotiations to buy of land and all of its manufacturing and production facilities for an estimated $1.7 billion from the company as part of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan. Under the proposals, the company would continue to farm the land for the next six years and convert the land back to its original natural marshland state. In November 2008, the agreement was revised to offer $1.34 billion, allowing sugar mills in Clewiston to remain in production.Cave, Damien (November 12, 2008). \\"Everglades Deal Shrinks to Sale of Land, Not Assets\\", The New York Times, p. 16. Critics of the revised plan say that it ensures sugarcane will be grown in the Everglades for at least another decade.Bussey, Jane, Morgan, Curtis (November 16, 2008). \\"Land deal could lift U.S. Sugar's sagging fortunes: Is it a buyout or a bailout? Either way, a pending deal to sell land to the state for Everglades restoration could reverse Big Sugar's flagging finances\\", The Miami Herald (Florida). In October 2010 the company sold 26,800 acres of land to the South Florida Water Management District for the \\"River of Grass\\" Restoration Project. U.S. Sugar powers its facilities with renewable resources – the residual sugarcane fiber after juice is extracted, known as bagasse. Bagasse is a clean, fibrous biofuel that results from the sugarcane extraction process. Every ton of bagasse powers the equivalent of 50 gallons of fuel oil. A boiler produces steam during the milling process by burning bagasse. Steam is co-generated into electricity on-site. In essence, each year's cane crop provides power for both the sugar factory and U.S. Sugar's refinery operations. U.S. Sugar's farmers have been integral to the success of sending cleaner water to the Everglades since 1994. The company, along with other Glades-area farmers, worked with the University of Florida's Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences (UF/IFAS) to develop soil and water cleansing techniques called best management practices (BMPs). These techniques include holding farm runoff on company property, laser leveling fields, and the growth of foliage along drainage canals bordering farms to help absorb nutrients. The BMP program has helped to yield tremendous success. According to the South Florida Management District, in 2017, Everglades Agricultural Area farmers achieved a 70 percent annual reduction in phosphorus – nearly three times higher than the 25 percent required by the 1994 Everglades Forever Act. Additionally, more than 95 percent of the Everglades is meeting the stringent 10 parts per billion clean water standard for phosphorus. Despite claims made by environmental activists over air quality, according to the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, Glades communities such as Clewiston enjoy some of the cleanest air quality in the state of Florida. In its rankings,2017 County health rankings the foundation lists Hendry County in the lower third of counties experiencing the worst incidences of particulate matter in the air. Economy According to the Florida Sugarcane League,Florida Sugarcane League sugarcane farming has a $3.2 billion impact and supports more than 12,500 jobs.

By contrast with refitting or installation of equipment, jumboization is a long and complex endeavour which can require a specialized shipyard. Enlarging a ship by jumboization allows an increase in its value without needing to purchase or build an entirely new ship. This technique has been used on cruise ships and tankers, as well as smaller vessels like sailing or fishing ships.Guy Saillard Methods Large ships often have a long midsection with a uniform profile. In such cases, the ship is cut in two pieces and an additional section is inserted in between. This operation must be performed in a drydock. On large ships, the additional sections are typically 20 to 30 metres long, consisting of an oil tank, a cargo ship hold, or a group of cabins, depending on the type of ship. The tanker Seawise Giant became the largest ship in the world after her jumboization. Smaller ships are usually jumboized by replacing the entire bow or stern section of the ship. This is done because the shape of their hull is usually incompatible with the previous method.

It follows the story of two best friends, Nate and Cat, young inventors who win a year-long scholarship at Saint Solutions, a giant skyscraper. There, under the eye of the world's greatest inventor, Ebenezer Saint, they are given free rein to invent whatever they want. But things take a dark turn when Saint refuses to let them leave the complex, and what started as the opportunity of a lifetime turns to a fight for not only their lives, but for the world. BBC Retrieved 2016-6-26 The book was shortlisted for the Wow Factor. Plot summary Nate is at home, about to test his latest invention - a machine that can dress humans, like in cartoons. However, the invention goes wrong and ruins his room, upsetting his parents. Nate goes to his best friend Cat's house, to test their latest invention, the Bully Blow - also known as Pergophosphaticus III - a goo-like substance that causes whoever eats it to turn blue. They test it on the school bully by putting some in her chocolate brownie, but it is confiscated by the Headmaster, who turns blue when he eats it. Rather than getting Nate and Cat into trouble, he asks them to take part in Ebenezer Saint's competition. They have under a week to invent something so good that Saint's company, Saint Solutions, will take it on. The winners will be given a year-long scholarship at Saint Solutions, working with Ebenezer himself. After many failed attempts at making Facial-Recognition Glasses, they decide to use the Bully Blow, now in the form of a helmet for the army, allowing the wearer to blend in with the surroundings by turning the appropriate color. Saint loves their invention, and they, along with the other winners, are taken to Saint Solutions. At Saint Solutions, they soon realise that Saint is reluctant to let them leave. He wants to create a nuclear bomb to wipe out the world and start again. However, the kids escape, but Nate and Cat stay behind to stop his bombs from being sent out. They use an EMP Cat hid on the bombs to detonate them early, with the duo just managing to escape before the compound is destroyed, along with Saint. In an epilogue, it is revealed that Saint's memory was saved onto a computer, which downloads his mind into a robotic body. As his memories come back, the robotic Saint heads for the exit.

Groundbreaking on the site began in 1973 and construction finished in 1975. Against the backdrop of a nationwide economic downturn and the collapse of Baltimore's traditional harbor industries, the assessed values of downtown properties declined significantly by 1977, including 100 East Pratt, which was then leased by IBM. After further economic and political turbulence in the 1980s, construction on the building was renewed and completed in 1992 by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill. In 1997, the building's firm was bought by Boston Properties, and later bought by Wells Real Estate in 2005 for $205 million, and was added to the Wells REIT II portfolio. In 2013, the portfolio became its own company and the name was changed to Columbia Property Trust, after which, in 2016, Columbia Property Trust sold the Pratt building to New Jersey- based Vision Properties for $187 million. Architecture Today, the building stands as a 418 ft. (128 m) tower made of aluminum, glass, and steel. The building contains more than of office, retail, and conference space, as well as a fitness center on its twelfth floor. In addition to the main twenty- eight floor glass tower, are two smaller, adjoined structures: a ten-story south-facing concrete office building and an eight-level parking structure with nearly one thousand parking spaces. The trusswork on the roof of the building, while attractive and able to be illuminated decoratively, is not ornamental: it provides suspension for the southern façade.

It was the third track on the band's first studio album, Pretty on the Inside, released on September 17, 1991, by Caroline Records. Dealing with religious and personal issues, \\"Garbadge Man\\" is most notable as Hole's first song to have a music video, which was broadcast on 120 Minutes on MTV several times in the early 1990s. The name of the song, with a seemingly-misplaced \\"d,\\" is intentionally misspelled. A Melody Maker review on Hole's live performance at Club Lingerie in Hollywood, California, on May 23, 1991, written by Everett True, a friend of the co-writers Courtney Love and Eric Erlandson, clearly stated the grammatical error and the original register at BMI for copyright collect also has the \\"d\\" in \\"Garbadge\\". Origin and recording \\"Garbadge Man\\" is known to have been written before July 1990, as Hole performed an embryonic version of the song at a live performance at Raji's in Hollywood on July 26, 1990, as part of an eight-song set. Diary entries from 1990, featured in Dirty Blonde: The Diaries of Courtney Love (2006), also reveal that the song was originally known as simply \\"Garbadge\\". The first and only known studio recording of the song was made in March 1991 at Music Box Studios in Los Angeles, as part of the sessions for Pretty on the Inside (1991). The song was produced and engineered by Kim Gordon of Sonic Youth and Don Fleming of Gumball and mixed by the regular Hole engineer Brian Foxworthy. It was eventually featured as the third track on the album, which saw worldwide release in September 1991. Composition and lyrics The song is one of the more structured compositions on Pretty on the Inside, with both its lyrics and music following a more standard verse-chorus-verse formula. The music was composed by the lead guitarist Eric Erlandson, the bass guitarist Jill Emery and the drummer Caroline Rue with additions by Love, who focused primarily on lyrics. The musical content is heavily influenced by no wave and punk rock and resembles noise rock similar to Sonic Youth, with whom the album's sound was largely compared, due to the overuse of feedback and distorted guitars. Unlike other songs on the album, \\"Garbadge Man\\" was written in standard tuning. The verses are composed of four barre chords (D5-E5-C5-G5) and one major chord (E) and use two distinctive guitar techniques: sliding and string muting. The song's chorus is repetitive, rearranging three of the five verse chords, and focusing largely on sliding. The lyrics, written solely by Love, narrate themes common in Hole songs from this period and also use vast amounts of religious imagery, similar to that in \\"Turpentine\\". The first verse explores religious decay and the chorus questions conventional religious ideals as well as lashing out at an unnamed person in the narrator's life. The end of the song references Love's feelings toward those around her, saying that every one of them \\"looks the same\\" and \\"feels the same\\". This theme of conformity was found in several songs on the band's second album, Live Through This (1994). Music video \\"Garbadge Man\\" was Hole's first song to receive a music video, and the only video recorded for Pretty on the Inside, even though it was not released as a domestic single. Directed by an unknown filmmaker, the video is extremely abstract, with no definitive visual characteristics other than major use of contrast and light. Some fans have interpreted this concept as a reflection of Hole's no wave influence at the time. Shots of Love and Rue asleep and drawing artwork in a trembling car are interspersed with shots of the band playing on a stage outside the car window. According to Love, she obtained original rolls of radiographic medical film from Denver, Colorado that had been used in the Vietnam war, which the music video was then shot on, giving many of the images an X-ray-like appearance. The video was broadcast three times on MTV; in 1992 during an interview with Love and Gordon, again in 1994, and in 1995 as part of 120 Minutes. However, it was never as popular as their later videos for Live Through This (1994) and Celebrity Skin (1998). For the music video, an different studio mix of the song was used. This mix, reputedly done solely by Gordon, diverged significantly from the final version featured on Pretty on the Inside. In order to be broadcast, the mix censored the profanity in the song, down tuned the song one half step, and shortened the song by removing most of the feedback-laden coda. There were also several minor changes in phrasing, especially evident in the last verse.

He was the ninth brother of Zeng Guofan, a prominent statesman and general, and a descendant of the philosopher Zengzi. He served in the Xiang Army, a standing military force organised by his brother to counter the Taiping rebels, and was nicknamed \\"Ninth Marshal\\" (). He was known for his expertise in siege warfare, particularly the use of trenches, hence he was also nicknamed \\"Zeng the Iron Container\\" (). During the conquest of Tianjing (Nanjing), the capital of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, Zeng was notorious for condoning massacres of the city populace, which resulted in him being called \\"Zeng the Butcher\\" (). Life Zeng was born in Xiangxiang, Changsha Prefecture, Hunan Province. Zengzi was his ancestor. He sat for the imperial examination several times but failed to make the cut. During the Taiping Rebellion, Zeng assisted his brother Zeng Guofan in raising and organising local militias from Hunan to form the Xiang Army to fight the rebels. In 1856, he managed to recruit 3,000 troops from Hunan to reinforce Qing imperial forces at Ji'an, Jiangxi Province. In the following year, they managed to recapture Ji'an from the rebels. In 1860, Zeng and his troops besieged Anqing and repeatedly fended off rebel reinforcements led by Chen Yucheng. They captured Anqing in the following year. In 1864, they conquered Tianjing (Nanjing), the capital of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom established by the rebels. Zeng was later appointed as the Provincial Governor of Hubei Province. During the reign of the Tongzhi Emperor, Zeng, Guo Songtao and others compiled the book Hunan Tong Zhi (湖南通志; Guide to Hunan). In 1863, he sponsored 5,000 silver taels for the publishing of a book, Chuanshan Yishu (船山遺書; Lost Book of Chuanshan), by Wang Fuzhi. He also offered 300 silver taels to Li Shanlan for the printing of Ze Guxi Zhai Suanxue (), a book on mathematics written by Li. In 1882, when he learnt that Peng Yulin wanted to establish a Chuanshan Academy in Hengyang, he donated his personal copy of the Chuanshan Yishu and provided funding to help Peng start the school. In 1867, when the Nian Rebellion was ongoing, Zeng and Li Hongzhang adopted different approaches towards attacking the rebels. Zeng ordered Bao Chao to lead his unit to attack the rebels. Liu Mingchuan was defeated but was saved by Bao Chao. Liu then pushed the blame for the defeat to Bao and Liu Shengzao, resulting in the latter two being punished. Zeng was also forced to retire, ostensibly on the grounds of illness, but actually as punishment for his failure. In 1875, Zeng returned to politics and consecutively served as the Provincial Governor of Shaanxi and Shanxi provinces, and Viceroy of Liangguang. In 1884, he was appointed as Viceroy of Liangjiang. He died in 1890 and was given the posthumous name \\"Zhongxiang\\" (). See also *Li Chenden *Zhu Hongzhang *Third Battle of Nanking References * Hummel, Arthur William, ed.

A native of Canada, Casler married a plumber who opened a plumbing business in Buffalo, New York. Her husband left her behind with two daughters to make his fortune in gold mining. He returned eight years later with only $700, but during those years, Casler had obtained her license as a plumber expert and built a business employing twelve men. In 1921, after her husband died, Casler moved with her daughters to Los Angeles, where she went into business as a builder and developer. In 1931, she recalled, \\"I put up flat buildings right after the war when no one was risking building anything. I have sixty of them now. Then I had the idea of developing Maple Avenue. My Class A buildings are on Maple -- one for garment manufacturers, one for printing, one for furniture, and they are all full.\\" Though she joined the real estate development company, Lloyd and Casler, Inc., in 1923, she later went out on her own, preferring to make all decisions herself without partners. Among the buildings she developed is the Textile Center Building, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Upon the opening of the Textile Center Building in 1926, the Los Angeles Times noted that the building was \\"the outgrowth of an idea born of one of the builders -- Mrs. Frances C. Casler -- who, though only a resident of Los Angeles for ten years, is responsible for the construction of over $7,000,000 worth of property ...\\" Casler maintained her office at the Textile Center Building during the height of her career. Other buildings developed by Casler include the Allied Crafts Building, the Mac Printing Co. Building, the Bendix Building and the Garment Capitol Building. By 1931, the Los Angeles Times reported that Casler had \\"eight Class A limit-height buildings to her credit, sixty flat buildings and a vast vision of the future of Los Angeles.\\" The group Preserve LA has described Casler as \\"perhaps the only woman involved in heavy construction in Los Angeles at the time.\\" The Los Angeles Times cautioned the city's businessmen in 1931 not to underestimate \\"this nice maternal little woman, in a soft green suit, a black and white hat with a feminine white rose beneath its brim.\\" It also noted: \\"She seems to be pleasantly unaware what a remarkable little woman she is. She went right along with her plumbing while the babies were coming along and she marvels that there could ever be any discussion as to whether women should try to combine both careers and matrimony. 'I had to,' she laughs, 'so I never thought about it.'\\" In 2008, the Los Angeles Cultural Heritage Commission recognized Casler as \\"one of the first women in the early 20th century to head a company in the field of development and construction of high-rise buildings.\\" She was also appointed as the head of Peoples Bank of Los Angeles, making her the only female director of a bank in Los Angeles.

Biography Born in London, his father Sidney was an Inland Revenue employee. His mother, Lillian, made the decision that he was to take up piano lessons. He was influenced by jazz pianist Art Tatum after listening to his recordings in the 1940s.Derek Smith Obituary The Guardian Retrieved 21 May 2020. Smith played his first professional gig when he was fourteen. Someone rolled a piano out into the street, and he played for the VE Day celebrations in May, 1945. Over his parents' protestations, he joined John Dankworth's band when Cleo Laine was the female vocalist, and with many other British jazz musicians, including Kenny Graham and Kenny Baker. Smith also began performing and recording for the BBC, but soon realised the place for him professionally, was America. Smith emigrated to the United States with no job awaiting him. Fourteen days after arriving in New York, he recorded with the Modern Jazz Quartet. One of his first engagements was working with his trio opposite Mel Tormé and Ella Fitzgerald at Basin Street East in New York. He joined Benny Goodman's band in 1961, and was pianist on Benny Goodman – The Swing Era, released by Time/Life Records, as well as working with Connie Kay and recording copiously as a session musician. Derek Smith met Doc Severinsen when both were contracted to play a society gig. Later, when Severinsen was named leader of the NBC Orchestra, \\"The Tonight Show Band\\", he called Smith to be the pianist. Smith played with the band for seven years while continuing to record daily in New York studios and work with Benny Goodman. When The Tonight Show moved to the West Coast, Smith opted to stay in New York and continue his career as a \\"first call\\" studio musician. Smith led his own band on NBC's Musical Chairs game show after he left The Tonight Show. After \\"Musical Chairs\\" was cancelled, he began concentrating on jazz concert performances while continuing to record. Smith's trio album, Love for Sale, was nominated for a Grammy Award on 1989. Smith has around 30 albums as leader to his credit in the United States and Japan. Described by critics as \\"fiery\\", \\"passionate\\", and having \\"an evil left hand\\", he was a frequent headliner at jazz festivals around the world. Smith may be heard on recordings ranging from the popular Burt Bacharach/Dionne Warwick and Steve Lawrence/Eydie Gorme tracks, recorded in the 1960s, to jazz albums with Dizzy Gillespie, Buddy DeFranco, Louie Bellson, Milt Hinton, and Clark Terry. The material Smith has recorded also includes movie sound tracks among them Woody Allen's Hannah and Her Sisters (1986), Crimes and Misdemeanors (1989) and Martin Scorsese's The Age of Innocence; (1993). The roster of singers with whom Derek Smith performed go from Frank Sinatra to Luciano Pavarotti, Placido Domingo and Robert Palmer (in the Royal Albert Hall). Lyricist Sammy Cahn, a good friend until his death, comedian Steve Allen, and many other performers have frequently called upon his accompanying and conducting skills. He continued to work with Goodman in the 1970s, and recorded as a leader from 1978. He worked as a solo performer into the 2000s and also played in a trio with Bobby Rosengarden and Milt Hinton. Smith died in New York in 2016 aged 85.

Strict boundaries between layers are enforced in the original OSI networking model, where data is kept strictly within a given layer. Cross‑layer optimization removes such strict boundaries to allow communication between layers by permitting one layer to access the data of another layer to exchange information and enable interaction. Any highly dynamic change of resource allocation might affect the intelligibility of voice or the steadiness of videos. However, as with other optimizing strategies, the algorithm consumes time as well.  Principles  There are principles that a cross-layer design must adhere to: * Interactions and the Law of Unintended Consequences * Dependency Graph * Timescale Separation and Stability * The Chaos of Unbridled Cross-Layer Design Unlike a traditional architectural design approach, where designers can focus on a single problem without worrying about the rest of the protocol stack, one must be careful to prevent unintended effects on other parts of the system. Dependency graphs are helpful for adaptation loops that occur using cross-layer design.  Applications  Cross-layer optimization can be used for * adaptation * scheduling * resource allocation * power control * congestion control * multihop routing Its advantages include high adaptivity in a Wireless sensor network and a larger optimization space. *  Adjusting quality of service  Cross-layer optimization shall contribute to an improvement of quality of services under various operational conditions. Such adaptive quality of service management is currently subject of various patent applications, as e.g. The cross-layer control mechanism provides a feedback on concurrent quality information for the adaptive setting of control parameters. The control scheme apply * the observed quality parameters * a fuzzy logic based reasoning about applying the appropriate control strategy * the statistically computed control input to parameter settings and mode switches  Tailoring to resource efficiency of cross-layer The quality aspect is not the only approach to tailor the cross-layer optimization strategy. The control adjusted to availability of limited resources is the first mandatory step to achieve at least a minimum level of quality. Respective studies have been performed and will continue.http://www.nyman- workshop.org/2003/papers/Cross- Layer%20Optimization%20for%20Sensor%20Networks.pdf  Adapting MAC scheduling based on PHY parameters  Communication systems that need to operate over media with non stationary background noise and interference may benefit from having a close coordination between the MAC layer (which is responsible for scheduling transmissions) and the PHY layer (which manages actual transmission and reception of data over the media) S. Shabdanov, P. Mitran, C. Rosenberg, \\"Cross-Layer Optimization Using Advanced Physical Layer Techniques in Wireless Mesh Networks\\", in IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications In some communications channels (for example, in power lines), noise and interference may be non-stationary and might vary synchronously with the 50 or 60 Hz AC current cycle. In scenarios like this, the overall system performance can be improved if the MAC can get information from the PHY regarding when and how the noise and interference level is changing, so that the MAC can schedule transmission during the periods of time in which noise and interference levels are lower. An example of a communications system that allows this kind of Cross-layer optimization is the ITU-T G.hn standard, which provides high-speed local area networking over existing home wiring (power lines, phone lines and coaxial cables).  Issues  Some issues may arise with cross-layer design and optimization by creating unwanted effects as explained in.V. Kawadia, P.R.

Full body spinal immobilization is the process by which a person with obvious or suspected spinal trauma is secured to a long backboard (LBB) in a neutral in-line position. The goal of immobilization is to effectively splint the spine in order to prevent movement and additional damage to the vertebral column and spinal cord.Shade, Bruce R., Mikel A. Rothenberg, Elizabeth Wertz, Shirley A. Jones, and Thomas E. Collins. \\"Head and Spinal Trauma\\". EMT- Intermediate Textbook. 2nd ed. Ed. Claire Merrick. St. Louis: Mosby, 2002.\\"Strapping Techniques in Spinal Immobilization\\". Adapted from the Annals of Emergency Medicine, June 1994-Tips from Other Journals. American Family Physician. October 1994. Find Articles.com. 24 June 2008. . Immobilization equipment A long backboard, also called a long spine board (LSB), is a reinforced, firm surface with several hand and strap holes along its lateral edges.Bledsoe, Bryan E., Robert S. Porter, and Richard A. Cherry. \\"Management of the Spinal Injury Patient\\". Paramedic Care. Principles and Practice: Trauma Emergencies. 2nd ed. Upper Saddle River: Pearson Prentice Hall, 2006. Other immobilization equipment consists of straps, or cravats, and cervical immobilization devices (CIDs). CIDs, which stabilize the neck and reduce movement, include a soft or rigid cervical spine immobilization collar, also called a c-collar or neck brace. In addition to the c-collar, commercial head supports or substituted items, such as bulky blankets, rolled towels, or foam head blocks, are placed on each side of the head and then secured to the backboard with tape. Straps are used to secure the torso (chest and pelvis) and extremities (arms and legs) to the backboard. Other strapping techniques Several different strapping techniques exist for immobilizing the torso so that the thoracic, lumbar, and sacral sections of the spine are supported with spinal motion restriction.Honeycutt, Linda, Jeffrey P. Salomone, MD, FACS, NREMT-P, and Peter T. Pons, MD, FACEP, eds. Prehospital Trauma Life Support. 6th ed. St. Louis: Mosby, 2007. One method calls for three separate straps: one at the level of the chest, one at the hip/pelvis, and one across the legs. A revised variation of this technique uses two straps for the chest in a diagonal pattern with an additional strap below the knees. Spider straps are a commercial alternative that uses a single Velcro system with ten points of attachment. Grady straps are a specific configuration forming a criss-cross “X” across the chest and a “V” across the pelvis in a harness-type fashion using only two long straps.Grady Emergency Medical Service. Department of Training and Education. \\"Strapping Technique Workbook\\". 2008. 24 June 2008. . This technique is highly effective for stabilizing both the upper torso (shoulders and chest) and the lower torso (pelvis). Grady straps protect against movement in all directions: up, down, left, and right, and prohibit the patient from sliding on the backboard. Because this method prevents anterior, posterior, and lateral shifts, it is very useful for high-angle rescues and awkward extrications where the backboard must be rotated sideways or tilted vertically. Grady straps are also effective in situations where the backboard must be positioned in a way other than supine, such as left lateral recumbent (or recovery position) for pregnant patients. This method also allows the backboard to be tilted in order to facilitate patient care in cases of emetic episodes where protecting the airway against aspiration is crucial. Another benefit of Grady straps is that they can be applied in a quick, timely manner which enables rapid transport for trauma patients. Grady Emergency Medical Service (Grady EMS Website) in Atlanta, Georgia implemented this strapping technique over eight years ago. Grady straps are the ONLY accepted technique for Grady EMS field personnel to immobilize a patient with possible spinal injury to a long backboard. Members of the Atlanta Fire Department also utilize Grady straps. The National Association of Emergency Medical Technicians (NAEMT Website) in cooperation with The Committee on Trauma of the American College of Surgeons also recognizes the effectiveness of this technique in the Prehospital Trauma Life Support, 6th edition textbook. \\"X\\" and \\"V\\" Pattern  References   Sources  * Grady Emergency Medical Service, Training and Education Department * National Association of Emergency Medical Technicians  External links  * https://web.archive.org/web/20080501144827/http://www.gradyhealthsystem.org/ems.asp * http://www.grady-ems.org * https://web.archive.org/web/20080623004002/http://www.naemt.org/aboutNAEMT/ * http://www.facs.org * (American College of Surgeons Website) Category:Medical transport devices ","title":"Grady straps"},{"id":"18129043","text":"The Roman Catholic Diocese of Lu'an/Changzhi (, ) (Not to be confused with Lu'an (六安) in Anhui province) is a diocese located in the city of Lu'an in the Ecclesiastical province of Taiyuan in China.

The technique involves an enzymatic amplification using primers directed at the conserved regions at the ends of the 16s gene, followed by digestion using tetracutter Restriction enzymes. The pattern obtained is said to be representative of the species analysed.

Numerous other studies have applied ARDRA for different bacterial taxa. Based on the simple formula for the frequency of random occurrence of a Restriction site, a 4-bp sequence can occur once every 256bp. A restriction enzyme having a recognition site of more than 4bp would be irrelevant with respect to a gene of approximately 1500bp such as that coding for the 16s ribosomal subunit. A number of tetracutter Restriction enzymes are available in the market. For the sake of statistical significance, at least three restriction enzymes must be used for the analysis to overcome the probability of certain restriction enzymes to yield similar patterns for not so unrelated organisms. The amplicon to be analysed must preferably correspond to a size of greater than 1000bp, purely for the sake of encountering a greater possibility of the restriction site. The amplicons must be preferably purified before digestion. This can be done by numerous commercially available purification kits. Care should be taken to choose the restriction enzymes. Certain restriction enzymes recognize the same sites, and cannot contribute productively to the analysis. Overnight digestion (10–16 hours) of about 300-500 ng of amplicon DNA in a 20 μL system with 4-5 units of Restriction Enzyme along with the recommended buffer at the prescribed temperature is recommended. Following digestion, the reaction is stopped and the entire digest run in a 2-3% agarose gel at 90-100V. The gel should be of a length that would allow proper resolution of minor fragments, as small as 100–200 bp. Analysis of the patterns is done with methods used for RAPD patterns. Clusters of related bacteria can be represented in the form of a cladogram or phylogram. After initial analysis a multivariate analysis program such as NT-SYSExeter Software: NTSYSpc http://www.exetersoftware.com/cat/ntsyspc/ntsyspc.html or PASTPAlaeontological STatistics: http://folk.uio.no/ohammer/past/ furnishing details about the presence or absence of bands, marked as 1(for presence) and 0(for absence). The data can be subsequently used for generating a phylogram or cladogram. The data table can be used to plot a phylogenetic tree that would indicate the relationship of the organisms based on the restriction pattern obtained from their respective 16s genes. Commercial software is also available for the analysis of these patterns, most used are the packages GelCompar II and BioNumerics.

Musical shows *2009 HGTMusic *2008 Itaca *2007 AsperMusic *2006 MilkMusic *2005 HornGlobetrotter  Biography  Nicola Gomirato was born in Venice, Italy in 1963. At an early age, he demonstrated a natural musical talent and at the age of nine, he began taking private piano lessons. In the first year of studying piano, he reached such a high level of technique that he was able to enroll in the local music school. Additionally, he attended junior secondary school courses within the Conservatoire, as well as complementary courses about instruments, theory and solfeggio, harmony, history of music, literature and science. Nicola’s teachers consistently noted his excellent musical skills and suggested he not only work as an instrument player, but as a conductor. With his sights set on this new option, he decided to expand his knowledge of orchestral instruments and began taking French horn and violin lessons. Well before Nicola finished his academic studies, he started working both as a concert player and teacher. He performed several concerts in Venice and the surrounding area, and taught children at the Rudolf Steiner School in the primary and junior levels. As a horn player, he was asked by the Teatro La Fenice to perform a series of concerts, including the cycle of Mahler’s symphonies. In the same period, he substituted for his own French horn teacher and taught beginner classes. In 1983, he was awarded his French horn diploma, and began his career as a music education teacher in state schools and as an instrument teacher in private schools. At the same time, he continued performing concerts and taking part in a variety or orchestras and chamber music groups in major Italian and European cities. Since then, Nicola has actively collaborated with youth orchestras as a horn- player and conductor, composed pieces specifically aimed at young musicians and formulated new teaching methods. He worked as a teacher and director at the Music Academy of Treviso in Italy, taught primary and junior levels at the Leonardo da Vinci Institute in Switzerland and played horn in chamber music groups in Switzerland and Milan. In 2000, he began work in music theatre, and began writing music for fairy tales. In 2005, he formed a new orchestra called “Orchestra Rondinella,” and worked with the Royal Oman Symphony Orchestra in Muscate. In 2012 he starts the activity as publisher with Martino Tales!, an imaginary world for kids translated in musical fairy tales Compositions Some of his compositions are registered at the National Library in Florence. =Educational compositions= * Easy duets for violin, cello, piano, flute. * Kits for guitar, clarinet and trumpet. * Sonatinas for piano, violin, cello, trumpet, oboe, flute, clarinet, bassoon, horn. * Easy concertos for piano, French horn, bassoon, oboe and flute and orchestra * Instrumental music for children's orchestra =Educational compositions for choirs= *Six solo voice pieces for treble voice choir. *Four pieces for two voices, for treble voice choir. *Let’s sing in chorus – choral compositions for mixed four-part choir. *“In the land of Music” for treble voices and children’s orchestra. =Compositions for various instruments= *21 piano preludes. *Two nocturnes for French horn and orchestra.

The idea came from the Italian custom of preparing coffee with a caffettiera (a coffee percolator) it is a type of pot used to brew coffee. Cafehorn is made of six caffettiere, with the same shape but with different size, connected with brass tubes and a bell, has 3 rotary valves. The cafehorn produces a particular and coloured sound similar to French horn sound. In 2006, Nicola Gomirato received a patent for it.  Lessons and Teacher  As musical teacher Nicola Gomirato taught for several years teaching history of music, composition, piano, guitar, and French horn as well as brass ensamble. Nowadays he decided to devote himself to a worldwide teaching experience. Using his knowledge, his music, his love for teaching and the technology.

Origins Mackenzie, nicknamed \\"Ruadh\\" (i.e. \\"Red\\"), was the eldest son of Kenneth Mackenzie, 1st Lord Mackenzie of Kintail by his first wife, Ann, daughter of George Ross of Balnagown. The Mackenzies were a clan from Ross-shire that had risen to prominence in the 15th century during the disintegration of the Lordship of the Isles. The final subjection of Lewis Mackenzie was only 14 when his father died in 1611, and the clan territories were therefore entrusted to his uncle, Sir Roderick Mackenzie of Coigach, the \\"Tutor of Kintail\\". Upon Lord Mackenzie's death, Neil Macleod and other members of the Macleods of Lewis, whom Lord Mackenzie had recently subdued, rose in rebellion in Lewis. A number of commissions against them were granted between 1611 and 1616 to the Tutor of Kintail, Colin Mackenzie of Killin, Murdo Mackenzie of Kernsary, Alexander Mackenzie of Coul and Kenneth Mackenze of Davochmaluag, while neighbouring chiefs (Donald Gorm Macdonald of Sleat, Roderick Macleod of Harris, Hugh Mackay of Farr and his son, and MacNeill of Barra) were forbidden to assist the rebels. Neil Macleod himself was captured and executed in Edinburgh in April 1613, but the turbulence continued. By a special commission from the king dated 14 September 1614, the Mackenzies were exempted by reason of their involvement in Lewis from engaging in the resolution of a dispute between two factions of the Clan Cameron (acting as proxies for the Marquis of Huntly and the Earl of Argyll). Once it had again eventually been brought under control, Lewis remained in the possession of the Mackenzies of Kintail until it was sold to Sir James Matheson in 1844. Acquisition of further territory and wealth At the death of Lord Mackenzie, his estates were very heavily burdened in consequence of the feud with Clan MacDonell of Glengarry and various family difficulties and debts. The Tutor of Kintail completed the compromise of the disputes with Glengarry that had been commenced by Lord Mackenzie and otherwise devoted himself to his nephew's affairs to such effect that the estates were freed before Colin came of age, leaving him \\"master of an opulent fortune and of great [feudal] superiorities\\". In particular, he acquired the superiority of Trotternish with the heritable Stewartry of the Isle of Skye, and the superiority of Raasay and other islands. The Earl of Cromartie said: \\"This Colin was a noble person of virtuous endowments, beloved of all good men, especially his Prince. He acquired and settled the right of the superiority of Moidart and Arisaig, the Captain of Clandonald's lands, which his father, Lord Kenneth, formerly claimed right to but lived not to accomplish it. Thus, all the Highlands and Islands from Ardnamurchan to Strathnaver were either Mackenzie's property, or under his vassalage, some few excepted, and all about him were tied to his family by very strict bonds of friendship or vassalage, which, as it did beget respect from many it be got envy in others, especially his equals.\\" Such wealth was not easily acquired: both the Tutor of Kintail and, in due course, Colin were criticized for imposing high entries and rents on Colin's Kintail and West Coast tenants. Indeed, a Gaelic proverb in common currency was \\"There are two things worse than the Tutor of Kintail: frost in spring and mist in the dog-days\\". Royal favour Mackenzie's favour with King James, as referred to by the Earl of Cromartie, is well demonstrated by his elevation in 1623 to the Earldom of Seaforth (the name of the sea loch dividing Lewis from Harris) and Viscountcy of Fortrose. On his last visit to London (at which the king also complimented him on being the best archer in Britain), Mackenzie was disturbed to be told by the king that his loyalty had been called into question by an anonymous source. However, the king's confidence in him remained apparently unshaken. Extravagance Mackenzie did not aim at economy and spent vast sums in securing his superiority over Moidart and Arisaig in a legal dispute with the Earl of Argyll. He added greatly to the castle of Chanonry and also built Brahan Castle. The Reverend John Macrae (d. 1704) recorded that he \\"lived most of his time at Chanonry in great state and very magnificently. He annually imported his wines from the Continent, and kept a store for his wines, beers, and other liquors, from which he replenished his fleet on his voyages round the West Coast and the Lewis, when he made a circular voyage every year or at least every two years round his own estates … It is scarcely credible what allowance was made for his table of Scotch and French wines during these trips amongst his people … I have heard my grandfather, Mr Farquhar MacRa (then Constable of the Castle) say that the Earl never came to his house with less than 300 and sometimes 500 men.\\" Piety Mackenzie and his wife had reputations for personal piety. They went yearly to take the sacrament from the Rev. Thomas Campbell, minister of Carmichael, South Lanarkshire, and usually had more than one chaplain in their house. Mackenzie provided the kirks of Lewis without being obliged to do so, as also the five kirks of Kintail, Loch Alsh, Lochcarron, Lochbroom, and Gairloch (of all of which he was patron), with valuable books from London, the works of the latest and best authors. He also laid the foundation for a church in Strathconan and Strathbran. He mortified 4000 merks for the Grammar School of Chanonry, and had several works of piety in his view to perform if his death had not prevented it. Family and posterity Mackenzie married Margaret Seton, the daughter of Alexander Seton, 1st Earl of Dunfermline, the Lord Chancellor of Scotland. Their only son, Alexander, died of smallpox at Chanonry on 3 June 1629. Margaret died at Edinburgh on 20 February 1631, after which Mackenzie contracted a lingering sickness which confined him to his chamber for some time before his death. He died at Chanonry on 15 April 1633 and was succeeded in his title and estates by his brother, George. He was survived by two daughters. Anne (d. 1705) married, first, Alexander Lindsay, later first Earl of Balcarres, and, secondly, Archibald Campbell, 9th Earl of Argyll. Jean married, first, John Sinclair, Master of Berriedale, and secondly, Alexander Sutherland, first Lord Duffus.

Along with the Oldenhorn to the east, it is one of the main peaks of the Diablerets, a huge ice-covered mountain near the western end of the Bernese Alps, straddling the border between the cantons of Vaud, Valais and Bern, and exceeding 3,000 metres above sea level. On its west side, the Scex Rouge is part of a nearly 2,000 metre-high amphitheatre of cliffs surrounding the Creux de Champ valley, south of Les Diablerets. On its southeast side, the Scex Rouge overlooks the Tsanfleuron Glacier, the largest in the massif. Administratively, the mountain is part of the municipality of Ormont-Dessus, which also includes Les Diablerets. The Scex Rouge is connected from the Col du Pillon (Vaud) by two aerial tramways and from Reusch (Bern) by three, all operated by Glacier 3000. The first leads to the summit of the Tête aux Chamois (2,525 m), which can also be reached from Reusch and Oldenegg on the Bernese side. From the Tête aux Chamois, the highest aerial tramway leads to near the summit of the Scex Rouge, or more precisely, a 2,965 metre-high subsidiary summit. The mountain station lies at an elevation of 2,940 metres and consists of a large building, designed by Mario Botta, including a panoramic restaurant. The true summit of the Scex Rouge can only be reached by a bridge connecting it with the subsidiary peak, which is in turn connected to the station by stairs. The 107 metre-long so-called \\"suspension bridge\\" (without towers), called Peak Walk, is the world's first suspension bridge which connects two mountain peaks. Many of the highest Alpine summits can be seen from the top. The area is used for winter sports from October to May, with several ski lifts being located on the Tsanfleuron Glacier. In the summer season, several hiking trails cross the glacier between the Scex Rouge, the Quille du Diable and the Oldensattel, at the foot of the Oldenhorn. The Glacier 3000 company also operates a snow coach on the glacier. Without the aerial tramways, the Scex Rouge itself can be reached by experienced hikers from Reusch via the Oldensattel or from Derborence and the Sanetsch Pass via the Quille du Diable. Two other more difficult access are from Les Diablerets via the Col de Prapio and from the Col du Pillon via the Scex Rouge Glacier. The first connection to the Scex Rouge was inaugurated on July 1964, at the time of Expo64, the fifth Swiss national exhibition. All the facilities were entirely renewed in 2001. The true summit, however, is accessible to tourists only since October 2014, when the suspension bridge was inaugurated. The Scex Rouge remains nowadays the highest mountain of the canton with public transport access. { Artificial access to the summit (right), through the lower summit (centre), with snow protection and bridges.

It first aired on BBC One in the United Kingdom on 20 May 2002. The episode was written by series creator David Wolstencroft, and directed by Bharat Nalluri. The episode focuses on MI5's efforts in bringing down right-wing leader Robert Osbourne (Kevin McNally), who is believed to be planning a series of race riots across the UK. The storyline was originally slated for the finale of the first series, but was pushed forward when the producers were pressured to deliver the story to the BBC. Filming took two weeks, around December 2001. After its original broadcast, the episode was viewed by over eight million Britons, a decline of one million from the first episode, but was still the strongest performer in its time slot. The episode marked the death of a main character, Helen Flynn (Lisa Faulkner), which was met with considerable controversy due to its perceived violence; at 250 complaints, it marked the highest number of complaints for a television programme in 2002. Plot MI5 suspect that right-wing leader Robert Osbourne is planning a series of race riots in the UK. A team led by Danny Hunter (David Oyelowo) attempts to bug his home, only to find it impossible because of the home's high-tech countersurveillance equipment. What MI5 does find is that Osbourne abuses his wife Claire (Debra Stephenson); believing Claire is vulnerable for recruitment, Section D start \\"Operation Greensleeves\\" and tasks a \\"runner\\" to befriend her before recruiting. However, vetting did not pick up on the runner's alcoholism after she becomes involved in a road traffic accident while inebriated. Harry Pearce (Peter Firth) appoints Tom Quinn (Matthew Macfadyen) and junior administrative officer Helen Flynn (Lisa Faulkner) to step in and pose as a married couple who are substitute tutors at the same Romford community college Claire is attending. The two initially succeed, and are invited to dinner with Osbourne at his home. However, during their visit, Osbourne catches Helen out by addressing Tom as her boyfriend rather than husband; Helen's improvising makes Osbourne more suspicious of the two. Later, one of Osbourne's contacts, Nick Thomas (Tom Goodman-Hill), is revealed to be freelance journalist Kieran Harvey. When Osbourne discovers this, he has Harvey murdered. Tom and Helen gain Claire's trust and recruit her; she agrees to help the two in exchange for a £600-a-week account and transport to anywhere in the world. In the meantime, a cargo of illegal immigrants from Chechnya is intercepted by HM Customs and Excise; the traffickers throw their cargo overboard, drowning them. Believing the traffickers will change their routes, Tessa Phillips (Jenny Agutter) and Zoe Reynolds (Keeley Hawes) investigate and discover a link between the shipment and Osbourne. With the information gathered from \\"Greensleeves\\", they discover that Osbourne intends to choke the asylum system by overcrowding the holding centres, and after his followers stir up the race riots, Osbourne would encourage independent Member of Parliament (MP) Bill Watson (Jasper Jacob) to raise the issue of asylum seekers in the House of Commons. Tom and Helen prepare to move out, but are kidnapped by Osbourne's gang and taken to the kitchen of his waste management plant for interrogation. Knowing they are MI5 officers, Osbourne demands everything Tom knows about their operation; when Tom fails to co-operate, Osbourne forces Helen's hand, followed by her head into a deep fryer, before shooting her. Before Tom can suffer the same fate, Claire throws a cigarette into the vat, which ignites, buying Tom time to escape and return to Thames House. However, Tom and Harry are disgusted to hear that the powers-that-be are happy about Helen's murder & Osbourne's plans, since it discredits the far right, and enables the government to gain a political victory and gain consensus on an immigration policy. Additionally, they refuse to take any action against Osbourne, in order to track the movements of all far-right groups, until the surveillance has finished, after which Special branch will be allowed to do MI5's \\"dirty work\\". At the end of the episode, Harry has Osbourne assassinated, and Claire & her son are in an airport about to catch a flight abroad. Bill Watson receives photographs of the dead refugees washed up on a beach, presumably sent by MI5, along with a note reading \\"are you happy with your wash?\\" Production =Writing and pre-production= Kevin McNally guest stars as antagonist Robert Osbourne. The episode's storyline, including Helen's death, was meant to be in the first series finale. However, by then, the second episode was not yet written, and series producer Kudos were due to deliver the story to the BBC in one month. As a result, the episode was brought forward to the second slot. Since the first episode began Spooks \\"with a bang\\", series creator and writer David Wolstencroft, was under pressure to top the efforts of the first episode with the second, but not by much. During the writing stage, he introduced a story arc involving Danny Hunter and his obsession with money and spending, apparently mirroring the writer; the arc was created for the temptations that the officers may have. In the original screenplay, Danny was to spend on his mother. Wolstencroft included some suggestions from his friends and girlfriend. An early scene was to take place in a shower room, but was rewritten when the producers thought it would be \\"too racy\\" for a 9:00 p.m. audience. In another instance, a long sequence would take place at sea concerning the smugglers dropping off illegal immigrants into the water; the scenes were cut before filming due to time constraints. Also, before deciding on waste disposal, Osbourne was originally going to head a security company. The funeral scene towards the end of the episode was inspired by The Godfather II. In the end, the script was rewritten four times before the BBC took the final version of the episode. Kevin McNally was cast as the antagonist Robert Osbourne; McNally was chosen because the producers thought he would be perfect to play the part, as is the case with Debra Stephenson, who portrayed his wife. Child actor Daniel Chenery, who played the part of their son, Sammy, was chosen due to his likeness of a younger version of McNally. Also, Simon Crawford Collins's wife made a cameo appearance as a BT operator. =Filming= Filming took place over a 13 to 14 days period in December 2001. It was not filmed on order of the script; the scenes set around the Osbourne residence for instance, were all filmed at once, during two to three days, though during the episodes, the scenes took place in separate parts of the episode. Parts of the introduction scenes, where Danny's team break into Osbourne's house, was actually filmed on the Grid set. Parts of the sequence were originally filmed without sound; the sound would later be added during post production. The footage of the drowned immigrants found at the shore were shot by the second unit headed by producer Simon Crawford Collins on a pebbled courtyard in Kensington to double as a beach. Some of the exterior scenes at night were filmed with the street wet down so that the lights could kick off the ground. Also in the episode, the editing suite, where the series was edited, was used as a set. The West12 shopping centre in Shepherd's Bush, London was used in one scene as an airport, as well as the shopping centre itself in another. The Chadford Community College was filmed at a rugby club. The safe house Tom and Helen were appointed to was filmed in two separate locations. One of those locations was used before in the Mary Kane interrogation scene in the pilot episode \\"Thou Shalt Not Kill\\". In one scene where Tom was driving to the operation the car was in fact towed; an error was made in the episode where the car looked taller than the other cars on the road during the shoot. =Helen Flynn death scene= Wolstencroft wrote the death scene with the intention of giving the audience the impression that no one in the series is safe. According to producer Jane Featherstone, the idea to kill off a main character involved a female getting \\"her head set on fire\\" later in the series, but she decided \\"let's move the most dramatic thing you've got to episode two and kill off the only actress the audience recognise [Faulkner was considered the only recognisable cast member when the series was introduced] and then you've got them hooked.\\" Matthew Macfadyen stated that the shooting of the death scene, although not emotionally draining, was gruelling to perform. Director Bharat Nalluri wanted as little of the torture to be seen as possible, because he wanted the sequence to be more psychological to make it easier to frighten the audience, since they know the physicality of being burnt, whereas if Helen was shot, not as many would. Producer Stephen Garrett wanted to show a more realistic sense of violence, rather than a fantastical \\"cartoon violence\\" \\"in which blows to the head with iron bars leave small bruises rather than crushed skulls, gunshot wounds leave neat abrasions in conveniently fleshy parts of the anatomy rather than eviscerating their victims; and fights that would hospitalise Mike Tyson are walked away from with barely a mark.\\" Broadcast, reception and controversy The episode was first broadcast on 20 May 2002, during the 9 to 10 pm time slot. It achieved overnight viewing figures of 7.8 million, with a 35 per cent audience share. Ratings were down over one million from the pilot episode the previous week. Regardless \\"Looking After Our Own\\" won its time slot; the finale episode of ITV1 drama Helen West came second, with 4.9 million viewers and a 21 per cent share. The final numbers posted on the Broadcasters' Audience Research Board website went up slightly to 8.1 million viewers, making the episode the ninth most viewed BBC One broadcast, and the nineteenth most viewed broadcast in total the week it aired. The episode attracted controversy following the demise of Helen Flynn after her hand and head were forced into a deep fryer. The death scenes attracted over 250 complaints, 154 of them to the television watchdog, the Broadcasting Standards Commission, the highest number of complaints for a television programme in 2002. In the wake of the complaints, BBC insiders had admitted that the scenes \\"clearly disturbed\\" some of the viewers, but also defended their decision to show the scene as it would show the audience \\"the kind of threat which might be faced by agents engaged in the fight against terrorism.\\" The Broadcasting Standards Commission stated that despite the content; \\"in the context was acceptable and important for the later narrative,\\" however the watchdog still criticised the BBC for failing to warn viewers of the violence to come. Garrett refuted this, stating: \\"Not only was there a clear warning before the programme began, but for anyone who missed that, the subject matter of the episode (a conspiracy to stir up inter-racial violence perpetrated by a man who clearly beat his wife) was hardly the stuff of which chirpy little bucolic fantasies are made.\\" Wolstencroft stated that after watching the episode with his friends, they both commended and criticised his work: \\"I got some angry phone calls from my friends the next day saying 'how could you, but well done, but how could you, but she was so nice, but how could you, but well done'.\\" Oyelowo also responded to the controversy, believing that it came from a result of Faulkner's male fans. Comedian Charlie Brooker however, commended the scene, as well as the series in general, stating in his Guardian column: \\"The moment her head was forced into the deep-fat-fryer, viewers reared on the formulaic, it'll-be-alright-in-the-end blandness of cookie-cutter populist dramas like Casualty and Merseybeat sat up and blinked in disbelief: here was a major BBC drama series that actually had the nerve to confound expectation.\\" In a January 2010 poll, fans of the show voted Helen's death as the \\"most shocking death scene\\" in the series, drawing 49% of the votes.

It was built circa 1855 in the Gothic Revival style. The architect is unknown but it exemplifies contemporary trends in home design popularized by the writings and pattern books of Andrew Jackson Downing of nearby Newburgh, as articulated in the Picturesque mode. Since its construction it has remained a private home. At one point it was owned by the Erie Railroad, used as worker housing while it was building the Otisville Tunnel beneath the property. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on March 5, 2008, the first in Otisville to be so listed. Building The house sits on a slightly sloping lot between Route 211 and Main Street, on the west side of Otisville near where the highway crests a low area of the Shawangunk Ridge. A neighboring parcel is included in the Register listing, for a total of including the house, three outbuildings, two objects, a ruin and a non- contributing swimming pool. It is a -story frame with a two-story wing to the rear, giving it an L-shape. The facade is three bays wide. The green rolled asphalt roof is steeply pitched, cross-gabled with smaller dormer gables. Bargeboards decorate the cornices of the intersecting gables, with turned finials at the apexes. Two large brick chimneys further accentuate the vertical Gothic motifs. A veranda on brick piers matches the Gothic trim on the gables, with clustered octagonal-capitalled columns and open-work tracery at the soffitt. Below the deck, wooden latticework fills the gaps between the piers. The recessed center entrance has a Tudor frontispiece, opening to the main hallway, and is flanked by two smaller openings with French doors, leading to the living and dining rooms. A kitchen and den complete the first floor. The floors in all rooms save the den are sawn-oak parquet, and the ten- foot (3 m) ceilings have cornices, some with detail work in the plaster. All window and door openings have wide architraves with rounded molding, a typical feature of Picturesque buildings. The living room wall has wainscot and a bay window with corbeled plaster arch. The decor includes two fireplaces with Italianate marble mantelpieces and period coal grates. Under the keystone of the den mantel is carved \\"ASD\\" for Algernon S. Dodge, first owner of the house. The wing has the same features as the full house, with which it was once connected. Of the detached contributing buildings and structures, the barn features the most Gothic detailing, especially on its window surrounds. It was painted gray, and made with board-and-batten siding, as was the -story potting shed. The rafter tails are exposed and curved, another Gothic touch. The outhouse also used board-and-batten siding with Gothic detail on the trim. Unusually, it has two holes for adults with one for a child. Other contributing structures on the site include an old gas pump near the barn, a cut-granite hitching post and a remnant of the early foundation. History Algernon Dodge, keeper of the local general store, bought the property from its original owners, the Loomis family, in 1851. He was an active local businessman, owner of 13 sawmills across nearby Sullivan County and a director of the Otisville & Wurtsboro Turnpike Company, operators of the road that has since become Route 211. He married one of the Loomis daughters, and lived in the house from the time of its completion to his death in 1881, shortly after some renovations and expansions that likely included the addition of the rear wing. His son Alsop inherited it, but moved to Colorado shortly afterwards. He retained ownership of the house until selling it in 1902 to a William E. Morse, who in turn sold it roughly four years later to a subsidiary of the Erie Railroad for $5, so it could build the mile-long (1.6 km) tunnel still in use under the property. The supervising engineer for the tunnel, considered an engineering marvel in its day, lived in the house for at least some of the time it was under construction. In 1908, with the tunnel complete, the railroad sold the house to Oscar Shaw Greenleaf for $1. His son Oscar Benton Greenleaf, who later became a local philanthropist, lived there until 1984. He sold the house to another couple who lived there for two decades, selling to the present owners in 2005. Aesthetic At the time of the house's construction, in the early 1850s, American domestic architecture was undergoing a transition from the Greek Revival style exemplified in the Avery Cook house adjacent to the Dodge property to the cottage-style homes advocated by Andrew Jackson Downing in books such as The Architecture of Country Houses and Rural Residences. Downing had died in a steamboat explosion in 1852, but Samuel Sloan of Philadelphia had filled the pattern-book void with titles like Sloan's Homestead Architecture and American Houses, a Variety of Designs for Rural Buildings, featuring designs showing the influence of Downing and his theories. Algernon Dodge, by building a house so clearly in the newer style, was on the leading edge of the tastes of his time in rural areas The Dodge- Greenleaf House's detailing is similar to many of Sloan's examples, although they were published slightly later than the period generally accepted as that in which it was built. The steeply pitched gables, high chimneys and filials are the most striking Gothic Revival component of the exterior; although the house is generally symmetrical its intersecting gables give it a strong Picturesque quality as well. Original vertical board-and-batten siding also exemplified the style. The interior is more conventionally Picturesque, with the finished marble suggesting a later Italianate influence, perhaps from the 1870s renovations.

Totila was based at Tivoli and, in pursuit of his quest to reconquer the region of Latium, he moved against Rome. The city endured a siege lasting almost a year before falling to the Goths. Siege Bessas, the commander of the imperial garrison, had a stock of grain but would only sell it to the civilian population at highly inflated prices. He also refused requests to let civilians leave the city. The contemporary historian Procopius describes the famine during the siege, in which the ordinary Romans, who were not rich enough to buy grain from the military, were reduced to eating bran, nettles, dogs, mice and finally \\"each other's dung\\". Some committed suicide. Finally, the imperial commanders \\"released such of the Romans as desired to depart from the city\\". He states that many perished on the journey, since they were already enfeebled by famine and many were killed on the road by the enemy.Procopius, translation by Dewing, H B (1914) History of the Wars: Book VI (continued) and Book VII, William Heinemann Limited, London (pp. 299–301) Pope Vigilius, who had fled to the safety of Syracuse, sent a flotilla of grain ships to feed Rome, but Totila's navy intercepted them near the mouth of the Tiber and captured the fleet. The imperial forces, led by Belisarius, were encamped at Portus awaiting reinforcements. An attempt by them to relieve Rome very nearly succeeded, but failed through the unreliability of subordinate commanders. Belisarius was then taken ill and took no further action.Barker, John W (1966) Justinian and the Later Roman Empire, University of Wisconsin Press (p. 160) Fall of Rome Totila finally entered Rome on 17 December 546, after his men scaled the walls at night and opened the Asinarian Gate. Procopius states that Totila was aided by some Isaurian troops from the imperial garrison who had arranged a secret pact with the Goths. As the Goths cautiously advanced into the city, many of the defenders escaped through another gate; according to Procopius, only 500 were left who sought refuge in various churches; 26 soldiers and 60 civilians were killed.Procopius (pp. 325–333) Rome was plundered but Totila – who had apparently intended to turn the city into a sheep pasture – relented. However he tore down about one third of the defensive walls before leaving in pursuit of Byzantine forces in Apulia.Procopius (pp. 345–349) The Porta Asinaria or Asinarian Gate, through which Totila entered Rome Aftermath After defeating a force left behind by Totila, Belisarius decided to re-occupy Rome in the spring of 547 and hastily rebuilt the demolished sections of wall by piling up the loose stones \\"one on top of the other, regardless of order\\" according to Procopius.Procopius p.359 Totila quickly returned, but was beaten back by the defenders.Barker. p. 161 However, Belisarius did not follow up his advantage. Several cities, including Perugia, were taken by the Goths, while Belisarius remained inactive and then was recalled from Italy. In 549, Totila advanced for a third time against Rome, which he took after another long siege.

In addition to solar lighting arrays, the facility is capable of generating thermal plasma fields of a type experienced in the outer atmosphere and low earth orbit. There are two man-sized airlocks, one at ground level, and one at .

Like Chamber A, it has two airlocks; one of them is configured to a water deluge system and other elements needed to simulate oxygen-rich environments encountered on spacecraft. Its solar lighting array is also simpler than that of Chamber A, necessating the use of mirrors to achieve certain lighting angles. The smaller size of the chamber makes it possible to more efficiently perform tests on smaller objects with a more rapid turnaround time.

History The former MW&CR; Railroad right of way prior to construction of the linear trail.Construction of the Meriden & Waterbury Railroad (M&W;) commenced in 1887 and finished the following year, when the M&W; Railroad merged with the Meriden and Cromwell Railroad to form the Meriden, Waterbury & Connecticut River Railroad. The line never saw high traffic, and by 1924 the section from West Main Street in Meriden to East Farms in Waterbury was abandoned. The line through Meriden remained active until 1966 as an industrial spur to Ragazzino's on West Main Street and the Suzio York Hill Quarry in East Meriden. Since little new development has occurred along the line, much remains intact with the railroad tracks still in place. Construction began in 2006 and was opened November 2007. Future expansion has been discussed. References *Meriden Linear Trail official website *Andrew Perlot, \\"Residents seek answers on master plan\\". Meriden Record-Journal, June 25, 2008.

In early modern times, Kurmark proper denoted the western part of the margraviate to the exclusion of later acquisitions. Territory The Kurmark included the Altmark in the west and the Mittelmark, core territory of the 10th century Northern March, as well as the Uckermark region in the northeast and Prignitz in the northwest. The boundary also comprised the minor lordships of Ruppin and Lubusz Land west of the Oder River; since 1575 also Beeskow and Storkow. It did not include the adjacent possessions of the Hohenzollern dynasty, such as the Neumark (New March) beyond the Oder, purchased by the margraves in the mid 13th century, and Cottbus in the southeast. History The Kurmark corresponded to the Margraviate of Brandenburg held by the House of Hohenzollern until 1535, when upon the death of Elector Joachim I Nestor, the lands were divided among his elder son Joachim II Hector, who also inherited the electoral dignity, and the younger John of Küstrin. John received the Neumark territory and Cottbus, which were split off the electoral lands. Already in 1571, the Hohenzollern lands were re-united under Elector John George of Brandenburg, when his uncle John of Küstrin died without heirs. Nevertheless, the denotation Kurmark remained affiliated with the territory west of the Oder. General Superintendency With the Protestant Reformation in the Electorate of Brandenburg, starting officially in 1539, the following year the first general superintendent of Kurmark was appointed. In 1815 the usage of the title was interrupted. Within the March of Brandenburg ecclesiastical province of the Evangelical Church in Prussia, established in 1817, the Kurmark formed again a general superintendency from 1829 to 1948. Two other general superintendencies within the March of Brandenburg ecclesiastical province were that of the New March and Lower Lusatia and that of Berlin. Most known is Kurmark's General Superintendent F. K. Otto Dibelius, officially serving in this position from 1925 until his furlough by the Prussian State Commissioner for the Prussian ecclesiastical affairs (), August Jäger, in 1933. After the schism of the evangelical church (then Evangelical Church of the old-Prussian Union, under this name 1922-1953) into a schismatic streamlined Nazi-obedient branch and a steadfast truly Protestant branch, clinging to the Confessing Church, Dibelius ignored the furlough and continued to serve as general superintendent until 1945 - with effect only in the non- schismatic congregations. In 1945 the schism was overcome by repressing many prominent Nazi-obedient leaders from their positions in the official church body. The provisional advisory council (), leading the church body for the time being until the new election of a provincial synod (October 1946), reconfirmed Dibelius as General Superintendent of Kurmark and commissioned him to also serve the vacant general superintendencies of Berlin and New March and Lusatia. In 1948 the new constitution of the March of Brandenburg ecclesiastical province, now named Evangelical Church in Berlin-Brandenburg renamed the general superintendency of Kurmark into Sprengel Neuruppin (1949) with a smaller territory. Also after the merger of the Silesian and Berlin- Brandenburg evangelical church bodies into today's Evangelical Church of Berlin-Brandenburg-Silesian Upper Lusatia in 2004 the Sprengel Neuruppin continued to exist. Despite the name, the general superintendent is seated in Potsdam. =List of General Superintendents= * 1540–1550: Jacob Stratner (*unknown-1550*) * 1550–1566: Johannes Agricola (*1494-1566*) * 1566–1581: Andreas Musculus (*1514-1581*) * 1581–1594: Christoph Cornerus (also Corner, Körner, or Korner; *1519-1594*) * 1595–1633: Christoph Pelargus (also Storch; *1565-1633*) * 1633–1829: vacancy, the function was assumed by the recently formed Marcher Consistory (Märkisches Konsistorium), comprising Lutheran and Reformed (Calvinist) members * 1829–1853: D.

The island was originally a possession of the Venezuelan government, but became part of the territory of Trinidad and Tobago in 1942. The island is a wildlife sanctuary since being declared in 1934.

Its current name is derived from the Spanish word for \\"Soldier\\". It was named in the 17th century after a Spanish boat shipwrecked near the island when a number of soldiers and sailors on board were rescued from the island.Joseph 1838, p.142 In the 19th century, it was also referred to as Île du Soldat (French) as charted by Dauxion Lavaysse in 1813. Sooty tern (pictured here in the French Frigate Shoals) is one of the species of birds that nest on Soldado Rock =Wildlife sanctuary= The island was proclaimed a wildlife sanctuary in 1934 primarily for protection of seabirds granting it full legal protection by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry Division. Key species identified in the sanctuary protection include the sooty tern (Onychoprion fuscatus) and brown noddy (Anous stolidus). The island is a nesting ground for these species during the months of March and July. Other species noted on the island include the sandwich tern (Thalasseus sandvicensis), grey-breasted martin (Progne chalybea), magnificent frigatebird (Fregata magnificens), and brown booby (Sula leucogaster). A subspecies of the short-tailed zygodont or common cane mouse (Zygodontomys brevicauda soldadoensis) was first identified on the island in 1965 and published in the American Museum of Natural History.

The areas around the island form part of the Southwest Soldado Field, a hydrocarbon area important to the oil and gas industry in Trinidad. It is estimated that 43 million barrels of oil in proven reserves exist in the oilfield. Production of the oilfield first started in 1955. The waters around Soldado Rock are popular for local fishermen due to an abundance of fish in the area, but are dangerous due to rapid tide changes and numerous rocks. The area has been an issue of contention, with fishers from Trinidad and Tobago claiming to be arrested by the Venezuelan National Guard within T&T;'s maritime borders. The area around the island has also seen piracy attacks on fishers and drug trade activity.

Oneida-Herkimer Solid Waste Management Authority, 550 U.S. 330 (2007), was a United States Supreme Court case about interstate commerce. Chief Justice John Roberts wrote the opinion of the Court, holding that a New York state ordinance forcing private waste management companies to deliver waste to a public facility did not discriminate against interstate commerce. Justice Samuel Alito wrote a dissent.  Background  The plaintiff, United Haulers, a not-for-profit corporation made up of waste management companies, sued the New York counties of Oneida and Herkimer, which controlled the Oneida-Herkimer Solid Waste Management Authority, under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. United Haulers claimed that county ordinances requiring all solid wastes and recyclables generated within the two counties to be delivered to one of several waste processing facilities owned by the Authority violated the Dormant Commerce Clause. Procedural history The district court ruled in favor of United Haulers, on the basis of the Supreme Court's holding in C&A; Carbone, Inc. v. Town of Clarkstown, New York. The Second Circuit Court of Appeals reversed, reasoning that the public benefit outweighed any restriction on interstate commerce. United Haulers appealed, and the Supreme Court granted certiorari. Decision =Issue= Does an ordinance requiring delivery of all solid waste to a publicly owned and operated local facility impose a substantial burden on interstate commerce and therefore violate the Commerce Clause? =Opinion of the Court= Chief Justice Roberts, writing for the Court, held that the law did not violate the dormant commerce clause. In Carbone v. Clarkstown,511 U. S. 383 (1994) the Court struck down a similar flow control ordinance that forced haulers to deliver waste to a private processing facility. Here, the Court held that because the facilities were owned and operated by a state-created public benefit corporation, the restriction was permissible. \\"Disposing of trash,\\" Roberts wrote, \\"has been a traditional government activity for years, and laws that favor the government in such areas— but treat every private business, whether in-state or out-of- state, exactly the same—do not discriminate against interstate commerce for purposes of the Commerce Clause.\\" Roberts applied the balancing test from Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc.397 U. S. 137 (1970) to determine that the local benefits outweigh the interstate commerce concerns, but a majority of the court did not agree that applying the balancing test was necessary. =Scalia's concurrence= Justice Scalia agreed with the Court's holding, and wrote separately to restate his opinion that \\"the so-called 'negative' Commerce Clause is an unjustified judicial invention, not to be expanded beyond its existing domain.\\" Scalia also objected to the use of the Pike test. =Thomas's concurrence= Justice Thomas agreed with the Court's holding, and wrote separately to refute the majority opinion he had joined in C&A; Carbone, Inc. v. Clarkstown, 511 U.S. 383 (1994) stating that, contrary to his position in Carbone, he now believes \\"the negative Commerce Clause has no basis in the Constitution and has proved unworkable in practice.\\" =Dissent= Justice Alito, joined by Justices Stevens and Kennedy, dissented from the Court's holding, stating that the facts in this case did not differ enough from those in Carbone to justify the opposite result.

His best-known character is Snappy Sammy Smoot.\\"Skip Williamson,\\" Lambiek Comiclopedia. Accessed March 31, 2017.  Biography  = Childhood = Williamson was born in San Antonio, Texas, but later moved to Lynchburg, Virginia, and then to Canton, Missouri. Williamson's real first name is Mervyn; however when he was a child, he was a bit of a troublemaker, so his grandmother gave him the nickname \\"Skip\\" after Percy Crosby's comic strip character \\"Skippy\\". = First publication = Williamson's first published cartoon was in Harvey Kurtzman's Help! magazine in 1961. The cartoon was accepted by then Help! editor Gloria Steinem.Williamson's biography on skipwilliamson.com The cartoon was of two New Orleans trash cans. One was labeled \\"Negro Trash\\" the other \\"White Trash\\". Subsequently, comedian Dick Gregory went on The Tonight Show and showed the cartoon on national television, launching Williamson into the mainstream. = Underground comix = Williamson moved to Chicago in 1967 and almost immediately teamed up with Jay Lynch to publish the underground newspaper The Chicago Mirror. (Williamson and Lynch remained friends for the rest of their lives.) In 1968, Williamson, Lynch, and Robert Crumb rechristened the Chicago Mirror as Bijou Funnies, which became one of the earliest and longest running underground comix titles. Williamson's character Snappy Sammy Smoot became popular enough to appear (played by Carl Reiner) on the 1960s television program Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In. Some years later the Comix Journal wrote: = The Chicago 8 = Because of Williamson's friendship with Yippie activist Abbie Hoffman, he was allowed into the courtroom where the Chicago 8 trial was being held, where he did sketches of key characters in the trial. https://www.lambiek.net/artists/w/williamson_skip.htm Williamson designed the cover of the first printing of Abbie Hoffman's Steal This Book. Hoffman gave Williamson the advance from his book for Williamson to produce a comic that would raise money for the Chicago 8 defense fund. Williamson produced the comic book Conspiracy Capers, which featured the art of Jay Lynch, Art Spiegelman, Jay Kinney, Dan Clyne, Paul David Simon, and others.\\"Arts Picks,\\" Philadelphia City Paper (Aug. 3, 2006). = Later work = During the 1970s and 1980s Williamson art-directed and contributed artwork to men's magazines. In 1973 he was art director of Gallery magazine, where he created the “Girl Next Door” concept by publishing snapshots of sweethearts and wives sent in by readers. In 1974 Williamson was the founding art director of Hustler, and in 1976 he joined the staff of Playboy. There he created the popular \\"Playboy Funnies\\" section and introduced millions of readers to his characters Neon Vincent and the \\"postmodern\\" couple Nell ‘n’ Void. Williamson designed album covers for blues artists like Albert Collins (Cold Snap, 1986), Koko Taylor (An Audience With the Queen, 1987), Little Charlie and the Nightcats (All The Way Crazy, 1987) and Mudcat (You Better Mind, 2013). For the band Wilderness Road he drew a special comic book, Snuk Comics, to promote them. In later years Williamson concentrated on producing large-scale canvases depicting political social abomination and political treachery. = Death = He died at Albany Medical Center at 12:30 pm on March 16, 2017.

Many of Smith's films show an interest in supernatural themes, such as Photographing a Ghost (1898), The Haunted Picture Gallery (1899), and his major short comedy Mary Jane's Mishap (1903); he also filmed a version of the Faust legend. A film called The Haunted Castle, supposedly released by Smith in December 1897, was attributed to him in the 1973 edition of The British Film Catalogue. However, the film historian John Barnes, in his book-length study of the year 1897 in British film, concluded that the title referred to a Méliès film that had been referenced in England since May of that year.

The site occupies the first and second terraces above the Brazos River's floodplain. Archeological investigation began in 1938 as a Work Projects Administration and University of Texas Statewide Archeological Survey. The site is believed to be that of a Plains Indian agricultural village, and was first excavated in 1938-39. The site's major element is a large midden and hearth, with a number of smaller hearth features and burial sites nearby. The site contains artifacts from the Late Prehistoric period, approximately 1200 AD to 1600 AD, including a variety of chipped stone points and scrapers. Fired earthenware bowls and jars have also been found. It is also the site where a particular type of projectile point, known as the Harrell Point, was first identified, and was identified as the type site of the Henrietta Focus in 1946. The site contains numerous hearths and more than one hundred burial sites, suggesting a settled population. Burials are often fragmentary in nature, with a few covered by limestone slabs. Excavations have also found evidence of mass graves, scalpings, and bodies with other signs of murder and mutilation such as dismemberment and arrow wounds dating back around 1000 - 1500 A.D., leading archaeologists to believe the area was fought over because of its access to water and fertile farmland. The site is still under excavation today.

The Israeli army believed that Israeli settlers from Adei Ad had fired the shots. The head of the al-Mughayyir village council told Haaretz: \\"We're not entirely sure who has hit by military fire and who has hit by settler (shooting), but there undoubtedly are some hit by the settlers, who had attacked the houses unprovoked.\\"Palestinian shot dead by settler in West Bank clashes, IDF officials believe, Jack Khoury, Yotam Berger, Yaniv Kubovich, Jan. 26 2019, Haaretz Na'asan, the father of four young children, had previously spent eight years in an Israeli jail for security related offenses.

October is harvest time for olives and is often a time of \\"tension between Palestinian farmers and Jewish settlers\\", and The Economist tied the destruction of trees to the settlers' 'price tag policy. In her 2009 publication entitled Tree Flags, legal scholar and ethnographer Irus Braverman describes how Palestinians identify olive groves as an emblem or symbol of their longtime, steadfast agricultural connection (tsumud) to the land. \\"More than 80,000 Palestinian farmers derive a substantial portion of their annual income from olives. Harvesting the fruit, pressing the oil, selling and sharing the produce is a ritual of life.\\" In January 2019, twenty-five 35-year-old olive trees were cut down by vandals who left vehicle tracks leading to the nearby Israeli outpost of Mevo Shiloh, but no disciplinary action was taken by Israeli authorities.The sadists who destroyed a decades- old Palestinian olive grove can rest easy, by Gideon Levy and Alex Levac.

Built in 1918, it is the oldest U.S. Air Force aircraft storage and repair facility, and the only surviving hangar from World War I. The building, now rehabilitated as a special event facility, was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1976. Description and history Hangar 9 stands at the northern corner of Inner Circle Road and Challenger Drive on the grounds of the former Brooks Air Force Base. It is a two-story wood frame structure, with a broad gambrel roof supported by massive wooden trusses. The exterior is finished with vertical board siding, its long sides dotted with windows. The north and south facades each have four rail- mounted sliding doors, which originally provided access for the movement of aircraft into and out of the building. The interior is essentially unfinished, with wall studs and roof trusses exposed. Hangar 9 was one of sixteen similar wood structures built at Brooks Field early in 1918. By the 1960s, only Hangar 9 remained. When, in the 1960s the Air Force proposed Hangar 9's demolition, the Bexar County Historical Society was given permission to restore the building. The building was dedicated as the Edward H. White II Aviation Museum in 1968. The museum, then known as the Edward H. White II Museum of Aerospace Medicine, closed in 2011 with the closing of the base. As part of the base's redevelopment as the mixed-use Brooks City-Base community, it has been restored for use as an events venue, hosting weddings as well as corporate and other events.

The COAH was created by the New Jersey Legislature in response to the Fair Housing Act of 1985 and a series of New Jersey Supreme Court rulings that are known as the Mount Laurel doctrine. History The council is made up of 12 members appointed by the Governor of New Jersey and approved by the New Jersey Senate. COAH defines housing regions, estimates the needs for low/moderate income housing, allocates fair share numbers by municipality and reviews plans to fulfill these obligations. As of January 2006, 287 of New Jersey's 566 municipalities are part of the COAH process, and another 78 are or were under the court's jurisdiction. There are at least two COAH municipalities in each of the state's 21 counties. Bergen County has 42 of its 70 municipalities involved, the highest number in the state, with Morris County's 29 municipalities ranking second. Municipalities originally were allowed to enter into a Regional Contribution Agreement (RCA), which allows them to pay a fee to another municipality that agrees to provide affordable housing units to fulfill up to half of the sending municipality's COAH obligations. The sending municipality must pay a negotiated fee for each unit transferred. For example, Marlboro Township signed an agreement in June 2008 that will have Trenton build or rehabilitate 332 housing units (out of Marlboro's 1,600-unit obligation), with Marlboro paying $25,000 per unit, a total of $8.3 million to Trenton for taking on the responsibility for these units.\\"Marlboro will pay Trenton to take affordable housing\\" , News Transcript, June 18, 2008. Accessed June 25, 2008. RCAs were suppressed by the latest amendment to the state's housing laws on July 17, 2008.\\"Corzine Signs Landmark Affordable Housing Reforms\\", Cape May County Herald, July 18, 2008. Accessed July 26, 2008 COAH's defunct status as of 2017 On March 10, 2015, the New Jersey Supreme Court divested COAH of jurisdiction of municipal housing plans. Towns must now petition the lower court for approval of their housing plans. Builders, developers and other interested parties may intervene in such proceedings, which are known as declaratory judgment actions.In 2015, the Supreme Court rendered a decision that considered COAH defunct, and called for a judicial forum as “a substitute for [COAH’s] substantive certification process.” In re N.J.A.C. 5:96 & 5:97, 221 N.J. 1, 7, 110 A.3d 31, 35 (2015). On February 9, 2010, Governor Chris Christie had suspended COAH and appointed a committee in preparation to dismantle it.http://nj.gov/infobank/circular/eocc12.pdf The Supreme Court ruled that it was not within his power \\"“to abolish independent agencies that were created by legislative action”. It also ordered COAH to come up with new regulations regarding the development of affordable housing. COAH passed new guidelines on May 1, 2014, which increase the number of units developers are permitted to build in exchange for one affordable housing unit from four to nine. When asked, the agency refused to provide the contract for the Rutgers University professor who prepared the plan and claimed that the documents used to calculate the new guidelines had been lost, leading an affordable housing group to offer a $1,000 reward. In July 2014, a superior judge ruled that the contract must be released and search conducting for the missing documents. In October 2014 the COAH Board failed to meet the deadline by the Supreme Court for establishing new Third Round guidelines, when the board voted, 3–3, to adopt the proposal. In the absence of action by the state, the New Jersey Supreme Court ruled in March 2015, that determination of affordable housing obligations would be administered by the court.http://www.northjersey.com/news/n-j-supreme-court-judges-taking-over- enforcement-of-affordable-housing-1.1285819 References External links * End Christie's defiance of the Supreme Court: Editorial * Courts' procedures coming into focus as New Jersey's affordable housing saga continues * Proposed rules April 30, 2014 * Category:State agencies of New Jersey Category:Government agencies established in 1985 Category:Affordable housing Category:1985 establishments in New Jersey ","title":"Council on Affordable Housing"},{"id":"18130409","text":"In Rainbows – From the Basement is a 2008 live video by the English alternative rock band Radiohead.

Early life and education Mark del Castillo was born in Brownsville, Texas, United States. Raised in a family with many musical influences, he started learning guitar at age 14, following after his talented older brother Rick del Castillo. For some time Mark studied guitar by himself; then in year 1990 he entered the University of Texas at Brownsville and became a Music Major. There Mark studied Music Theory, Ear Training, and Applied Guitar and played in University Latin/Jazz band.  Career  In 1991, Mark started to play with a cover band called Kickstart as a guitarist and spent over three years with them.

They graduated in 1996 and moved to Austin, Texas, where they started to perform on the famous 6th Street circuit. As Vivid they played in other cities in Texas and even had some show trips to Europe. At that time Mark del Castillo also joined the rock band called Milhouse, where he for the first time met Mike Zeoli (drummer of Del Castillo). Mark's brother Rick recorded and produced the first Milhouse CD, for which Mark wrote and performed an instrumental Latin-flamenco track named “Para Mija Linda”. Written for his future wife, this song inspired him very much, and he started to write more guitar music in different Spanish styles. Mark created a few instrumentals and then began collaboration with Alex Ruiz, who wrote lyrics to several of songs. Mark offered these songs to his brother Rick del Castillo. Rick liked them very much. The brothers realized that they had never worked together before and decided to start writing and playing music together.Mark del Castillo's Bio on Del Castillo Band Official Website Mark now plays guitar and sings in the Del Castillo band he founded together with his brother Rick.

It was the first active-duty associate unit attached to an Air National Guard wing, working with the 187th Airlift Squadron at Cheyenne Regional Airport (National Guard Base), Wyoming. It operated the Lockheed C-130 Hercules aircraft of its co-located Guard unit, conducting airlift missions. The squadron was last active in this role from 2006 until about 1 September 2015. The squadron was first activated in 1942 as the 30th Ferrying Squadron. It ferried aircraft across the North Atlantic ferry route until it was disbanded in 1943 in a reorganization of Air Transport Command units. The squadron was reactivated in 1952 as the 30th Air Transport Squadron. Except for a brief period from 1965 to 1967, it conducted strategic airlift missions throughout the world until 1993, when it moved to Yokota Air Base, Japan and conducted aeromedical airlift missions until inactivating in 2003. History =World War II= The squadron was first activated at Presque Isle Army Air Field, Maine in late July 1942 as the 30th Ferrying Squadron, one of the original squadrons of the 8th Ferrying Group. In August, the 8th Group squadrons were moved to various bases along the North Atlantic ferrying route and the squadron moved to Bluie West One, at Narsarsuak, Greenland. The 30th ferried bombers and Lockheed P-38 Lightning aircraft until August 1943. On 1 September 1943, the squadron, now titled the 30th Transport Squadron, was disbanded, and its personnel and equipment transferred to Station 11, North Atlantic Wing, Air Transport Command. =Cold War airlift= MATS Douglas C-118A Liftmaster In July 1952 Military Air Transport Service replaced its Major Command Controlled air transport squadrons (4 digit) with Air Force Controlled squadrons that were able to continue their history if they were temporarily inactive.Under the USAF organization and lineage system MAJCON units' lineages (histories, awards, and battle honors) ended with their discontinuance and could never be revived. Ravenstein, Guide to Lineage and Honors, p. 12. Implementing this program, the 30th, now the 30th Air Transport Squadron was activated at Westover Air Force Base, Massachusetts, where it was assigned to the 1600th Air Transport Group and took over the personnel and eight Douglas C-74 Globemaster aircraft of the 1253d Air Transport Squadron, which was discontinued. The squadron began to convert to Douglas C-54 Skymaster transports shortly after activation, but this conversion was cancelled and the unit reverted to flying Douglas C-118 Liftmasters in August. Although the squadron continued to fly C-118s, by 1954, the advent of larger transport aircraft, such as the c-74 and the Douglas C-124 Globemaster II prompted the Air Force to change its designation from a heavy transport squadron to a medium transport unit. In April 1955, Strategic Air Command took over Westover from MATS.Mueller, p. 578 The 1600th Air Transport Wing was inactivated, but the squadron moved its operations to McGuire Air Force Base, New Jersey. It provided air transport for the Atlantic Division of the Military Air Transport Service from July 1952 until inactivating in June 1965, when the 1611th Air Transport Wing discontinued its C-118 operations. 438th Wing C-141 over Philadelphia The squadron was organized again in April 1967 as the 30th Military Airlift Squadron and equipped with Lockheed C-141 Starlifters. Starting in August, conducted worldwide airlift, including support for the Vietnam War, earning a Republic of Vietnam Gallantry Cross with Palm for its support. It supported Operation Desert Storm in Southwest Asia from August 1990 to June 1991. Other operations included Operation Just Cause, Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom =Aeromedical Airlift= Squadron C-9A approaching Misawa Air Base, Japan In 1993 the squadron moved to Yokota Air Base, Japan where it flew aeromedical evacuation missions with the McDonnell Douglas C-9 Nightingale until 2003, when the Nightingale was retired and the squadron was inactivated. =Active duty associate= On 8 July 2006 the 30th became the first active- duty associate unit partnering with the Wyoming Air National Guard's 153d Airlift Wing. As an associate unit, the squadron flies the Lockheed C-130 Hercules aircraft of the 153d Wing on tactical airlift missions in the \\"Total Force Integration\\" concept. Although its administrative headquarters is an active duty group, it is under the operational control of the 153d Wing. Housing, medical, and other support is provided by the 90th Mission Support Group at Francis E. Warren Air Force Base. The 153d Wing added five aircraft to support this program, which was implemented as a result of the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure Commission. Members of the squadron deployed to both Iraq and Afghanistan after its reactivation, including supporting *Operation New Dawn, although the squadron does not appear to have deployed as a unit. In 2014, two consecutive commanders of the squadron were relieved of command, as the unit went through four commanders in less than a year. The reliefs were due to a \\"lack of confidence\\" in the commanders involved and the atmosphere in the squadron, although no additional information was publicly released. On 1 September 2015, due to budget cuts, the active duty airmen and their aircraft were withdrawn from Wyoming and the aircraft were transferred to the 152d Airlift Wing of the Nevada Air National Guard by the following month.

This form of consciousness is also sometimes called \\"sensory consciousness\\". Put another way, primary consciousness is the presence of various subjective sensory contents of consciousness such as sensations, perceptions, and mental images. For example, primary consciousness includes a person's experience of the blueness of the ocean, a bird's song, and the feeling of pain. Thus, primary consciousness refers to being mentally aware of things in the world in the present without any sense of past and future; it is composed of mental images bound to a time around the measurable present.Edelman, G. (2004). Wider than the sky: The phenomenal gift of consciousness: Yale Univ Pr. Conversely, higher order consciousness can be described as being \\"conscious of being conscious\\"; it includes reflective thought, a concept of the past, and speculation about the future. Primary consciousness can be subdivided into two forms, focal awareness and peripheral awareness. Focal awareness encompasses the center of attention, whereas peripheral awareness consists of things outside the center of attention, which a person or animal is only dimly aware of.Johanson, M., Revonsuo, A., Chaplin, J., & Wedlund, J.-E. (2003). Level and contents of consciousness in connection with partial epileptic seizures. Epilepsy & Behavior, 4(3), 279–285. Theories One prominent theory for the neurophysiological basis of primary consciousness was proposed by Gerald Edelman. This theory of consciousness is premised upon three major assumptions: # The laws of physics apply to consciousness, which rules out concepts such as spirits and a soul and allows for a purely physiological model of consciousness. # Consciousness is an evolved characteristic, which means it is a helpful characteristic from a Darwinian perspective. # There is no such thing as a \\"qualia-free\\" observer. Qualia are collections of personal or subjective experiences, feelings, and sensations that inevitably come with human awareness. Edelman's theory focuses on two nervous system organizations: the brainstem and limbic systems on one side and the thalamus and cerebral cortex on the other side. The brain stem and limbic system take care of essential body functioning and survival, while the thalamocortical system receives signals from sensory receptors and sends out signals to voluntary muscles such as those of the arms and legs. The theory asserts that the connection of these two systems during evolution helped animals learn adaptive behaviors. This connection allows past signals related to values set by the limbic-brain stem system and categorized signals from the outside world to be correlated, resulting in memory in conceptual areas. This memory is then linked to the organism's current perception, which results in an awareness of the present, or primary consciousness. In other words, Edelman posits that primary consciousness arises from the correlation of conceptual memory to a set of ongoing perceptual categorizations—a \\"remembered present\\". Other scientists have argued against Edelman's theory, instead suggesting that primary consciousness might have emerged with the basic vegetative systems of the brain. That is, the evolutionary origin might have come from sensations and primal emotions arising from sensors and receptors, both internal and surface, signaling that the well-being of the creature was immediately threatened—for example, hunger for air, thirst, hunger, pain, and extreme temperature change. This is based on neurological data showing the thalamic, hippocampal, orbitofrontal, insula, and midbrain sites are the key to consciousness of thirst.Merker, B. (2007). Consciousness without a cerebral cortex: A challenge for neuroscience and medicine. Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 30(01), 63–81. These scientists also point out that the cortex might not be as important to primary consciousness as some neuroscientists have believed. Evidence of this lies in the fact that studies show that systematically disabling parts of the cortex in animals does not remove consciousness. Another study found that children born without a cortex are conscious. Instead of cortical mechanisms, these scientists emphasize brainstem mechanisms as essential to consciousness. Still, these scientists concede that higher order consciousness does involve the cortex and complex communication between different areas of the brain. Neurophysiological basis Physiologically, three fundamental facts stand out about primary consciousness:Seth, A. K., & Baars, B. J. (2005). Neural Darwinism and consciousness. Consciousness and Cognition, 14(1), 140–168. #Waking consciousness is associated with low amplitude, irregular EEG activity in the 20–70 Hz range. #* Conversely, unconscious states like deep sleep, coma, general anesthesia, and epileptic states of absence show a predominance of low frequency, high-amplitude and more regular voltages at less than 4Hz. #Consciousness seems to be intrinsically associated with the thalamus and cortex, even if the extent to which this true is argued among scientists. #* Damage to the brainstem or thalamus can abolish consciousness, while damage to the sensory cortex appears to delete specific conscious features such as color vision, visual motion, conscious experiences of objects and faces, and the like. #Consciousness is distinctively associated with widespread brain activation related to the conscious content. #*Perhaps two dozen experiments show that sensory input supporting consciousness spreads from the sensory cortex to parietal, prefrontal, and medial-temporal cortex, while closely matched input that does not reach consciousness activates mainly local sensory regions. Further, the widespread activity appears to involve more globally coordinated activity. Measurement To be fully comprehensive, measures of consciousness must not only define and distinguish between conscious and unconscious states, but must also provide a guide by which the conscious level, or extent of consciousness, can be determined.Morin, A. (2006). Levels of consciousness and self-awareness: A comparison and integration of various neurocognitive views. Consciousness and Cognition, 15(2), 358–371. Measures of consciousness are each associated with particular theories.Seth, A. K. (2008). Theories and measures of consciousness develop together. Consciousness and Cognition, 17(3), 986–988. Certain defining theories are included below: Worldly discrimination theory asserts that any mental state that is manifested in behavior is conscious; thus, an organism is consciously aware of something in the world if it can discriminate it with choice behavior. Signal detection theory quantifies discriminability of a stimulus among a set of different stimuli. Integration theories focus on finding a divide between conscious and unconscious processes. According to integration theories, conscious contents are widely available to many cognitive and/or neural processes.Seth, A. K., Dienes, Z., Cleeremans, A., Overgaard, M., & Pessoa, L. (2008). Measuring consciousness: relating behavioural and neurophysiological approaches. Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 12(8), 314–321. These theories are then accompanied with measures of the level of consciousness, which are subdivided into behavioral measures and physiological measures. =Behavioral measures= Behavioral measures of primary consciousness can be either objective or subjective. Regarding objective measures, knowledge is unconscious if it expresses itself in an indirect test. For example, the ability to pick which item might come next in a series can indicate unconscious knowledge of regularities in sequences. \\"Strategic control measures\\" use a person's ability to deliberately use or not use knowledge according to instructions. If they use information despite intentions not to use it, it indicates unconscious knowledge. Post-decision wagering can also be used. In this method, subjects make a first-order discrimination (i.e. a choice) and then place a wager regarding the outcome of the discrimination. Some scientists view this as a direct and objective measure of consciousness, and it can be used with children and animals. However, this method has been argued to be subjective and indirect. =Physiological measures= Event-related cortical potentials (ERPs) have been used to assess whether a stimulus is consciously perceived or not. These EEG measures either float free of theory, gaining credibility through reliable correlation, or assume a version of integration theory in which the appearance of a particular ERP indicates global availability or locally recurrent processing.Seth, A. (2009). Explanatory Correlates of Consciousness: Theoretical and Computational Challenges. Cognitive Computation, 1(1), 50–63. Abundant evidence indicates that consciously perceived inputs elicit widespread brain activation, as compared with inputs that do not reach consciousness. The dynamic core hypothesis (DCH) proposes that consciousness arises from neural dynamics in the thalamocortical system, as measured by the quantity neural complexity (CN). CN is an information- theoretic measure; the CN value is high if each subset of a neural system can take on many different states, and if these states make a difference to the rest of the system. The information integration theory of consciousness (IITC) shares with the DCH the idea that conscious experiences provide informative discriminations among a vast repertoire of possible experiences. In the IITC, the quantity phi is defined as the information that is integrated across the informational \\"weakest link\\" of a system. Importantly, phi is a measure of the capacity of a neural system to integrate information, whereas CN is a measure of the actual dynamics of the system. A third measure, causal density (CD), measures the fraction of causal interactions among elements of a system that are statistically significant. =Challenges in measuring= It is important to note that subjective measures are always indirect and can be vulnerable to many biases (e.g., reluctance to report uncertain experiences). Anmetacognitive conscious content assumes primary consciousness but not vice versa, subjective measures risk missing or rejecting the presence of sensory consciousness simply because metacognition isn't observed. Furthermore, there is the problem of post-decision wagering, which has been criticized because there is a possibility that advantageous wagering could be learned unconsciously; as a result, post-decision wagering would not in fact be considered a conscious behavior. For example, individual differences in risk aversion may lead to variations in wagering performance even with the same underlying conscious phenomenology. Thus, although behavioral measures are mostly used for assessing which contents are conscious, some brain-based measures seem better suited for measuring conscious level. Objective measures also have their challenges, however. First, objective measures still require a response criterion, for example the decision of whether or not to push a button. Second, they may not even measure consciousness at all because many behavioral proxies, such as forced-choice decision accuracy, are capable of being learned unconsciously.Edelman, G. (2001). Consciousness: the remembered present. Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences, 929, 111–122. Miscellaneous studies =In lucid dreams= Hobson asserts that the existence of lucid dreaming means that the human brain can simultaneously occupy two states: waking and dreaming. The dreaming portion has experiences and therefore has primary consciousness, while the waking self recognizes the dreaming and can be seen as having a sort of secondary consciousness in the sense that there is an awareness of mental state. Studies have been able to show that lucid dreaming is associated with EEG power and coherence profiles that are significantly different from both non-lucid dreaming and waking. Lucid dreaming situates itself between those two states. Lucid dreaming is characterized by more 40 Hz power than non-lucid dreaming, especially in frontal regions. Since it is 40 Hz power that has been correlated with waking consciousness in previous studies, it can be suggested that enough 40 Hz power has been added to the non-lucid dreaming brain to support the increase in subjective awareness that permits lucidity but not enough to cause full awakening. Dreaming is thus a virtual reality experience with a remarkably predictive simulation of external reality. Lucid dreamers may experience primary consciousness (the dream) and secondary consciousness (the waking) separately but simultaneously. Moreover, primary consciousness has recently been proposed by us to be characteristic of dreaming. It remains to be seen whether the enactment of dream behaviors uses the same brain processes as those that mediate those very behaviors in waking, and whether conscious within a dream is governed by the same processes. =In epileptic seizures= Studies show that it is possible to retain primary consciousness and even secondary consciousness during complex partial epileptic seizures. One study analyzed 40 patients with complex partial seizures to determine their level of consciousness during seizures. The data acquired was based on patients' subjective descriptions of their experience and descriptions from family members who witnessed the seizures. This study found there was a complete absence of consciousness in only 65% of people during the core period of the seizures. Meanwhile, 35% of seizures included some form of primary consciousness. Five seizure descriptions even reported some form of secondary consciousness, albeit short and intermittent. The level and contents of consciousness during epileptic seizures show considerable variability. =In thirst= In one study, 10 adult males underwent positron emission tomography scans in three different scenarios:Denton, D., Shade, R., Zamarippa, F., Egan, G., Blair-West, J., McKinley, M., et al. (1999). Neuroimaging of genesis and satiation of thirst and an interoceptor-driven theory of origins of primary consciousness. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 96(9), 5304. # During generation of moderate thirst by infusion of intravenous hypertonic saline 0.51 M # After wetting of the mouth with water to remove the sensation of dryness # 3, 14, 45, and 60 minutes after drinking water to fully quench thirst The data suggest that the anterior and posterior cingulate cortex as well as the anterior wall of the third ventricle, are major elements of a circuit including thalamic, hippocampal, orbitofrontal, insula, and midbrain sites that are needed for the generation of consciousness of thirst. This study shows that consciousness of some key sensations like thirst is governed by the oldest regions of the brain, which raises the question of whether it is really then possible to say when primary consciousness developed. = In meditation = In some types of meditation/yoga it is possible to have the experience known as Samadhi, where there is inner alertness but no object of consciousness.Patanjali's Yoga Sutras. This mental state corresponds with specific physiological parameters.Travis, F. & Pearsoon. C.

With several historic homes remaining from that era, and countless more from the period of rapid growth in the 1920s and 1930s that followed, this neighborhood has an undeniable historic charm. Bouldin Creek is also highly diverse, with a variety of cultures, backgrounds, and architectural styles blending together, resulting in a neighborhood that is uniquely Austin. One of Bouldin Creek's homes Bouldin Creek is bordered by South Congress to the east, the Union Pacific railroad track to the west, Barton Springs to the north, and West Oltorf to the south. It includes two major commercial areas, South First and South Congress. Given its proximity to these areas, and to Downtown Austin, the neighborhood has changed dramatically as result of gentrification. The neighborhood has several local historical sites including the Victorian mansion Green Pastures, which once belonged to famous Austinite John Henry Faulk, and the St. Anne African Methodist Episcopal Church (originally constructed in 1916) on Newton Street. In the South First area, the Mexican bakeries, tattoo parlors, art galleries, and unusual shops reflect the changing ethnic and social identity of the neighborhood. Another integral part of the neighborhood is the Texas School for the Deaf. The campus occupies the entire area bounded by South Congress, Elizabeth Street, Barton Springs Road, and South First.

It stars Dick Van Dyke, Kathleen Quinlan, Maureen Stapleton, Tammy Grimes, Beau Bridges, and Ray Bolger. Plot The film is set in 1911 at a Roman Catholic parish in the rural town of Isadore, Michigan. Sister Rita (Quinlan), a young nun, arrives at the parish to help run the church school. When the parish's two elderly nuns contract tuberculosis, Sister Rita is forced to move into the rectory that is home to Father Rivard (Van Dyke), the parish priest. The close proximity between the two begins to set off gossip and suspicions, to the point that a monsignor from the diocese (Bolger) comes to give Father Rivard a talking-to. The gossip turns out to be correct, as the priest and the nun confess their love for each other. However, their declaration of emotion leads to tragedy. Historical basis The original play and film are both inspired by the August 1907 murder of Sr. Mary Janina Mezek, a Polish-born nun of the Felician Sisters. In December 1918, Sister Janina's bones were re-exhumed from a shallow grave underneath the parish church in Isadore, Michigan. The former parish priest, Father Andrew Bieniawski, was rumored to be having an affair with Sr. Janina and of being the father of her unborn child. However, he was found to have an ironclad alibi of fishing on Lake Michigan. This, and his frantic attempts to find Sr. Janina for years after her disappearance, caused Fr. Bieniawski to be ruled out as a suspect. While being held at the jail in Leelanau County, Michigan, Fr. Bieniawski's elderly housekeeper, Stanislawa Lipczynska, confessed to having repeatedly bludgeoned Sr. Janina with a garden spade before burying her alive under the church. During her subsequent trial, numerous Isadore residents testified how Mrs. Lipczynska had referred to the Felician Sisters as \\"priest's wives\\" and \\"whores\\". Mrs. Lipczynska was convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to life imprisonment. Original play Writing on the play began in 1965 and debuted in 1971; it finally appeared on Broadway in 1976.Nat Segaloff, Final Cuts: The Last Films of 50 Great Directors, Bear Manor Media 2013 p 154-157 The play received a well-reviewed remount by Retro Productions in 2011 which moved Off-Broadway in 2012. Reception Janet Maslin, writing in The New York Times, complained: \\"The movie's ethics are...so hazy, and its attention to religion so perfunctory, that it almost seems as if this were a story about something else that had been transferred, as an afterthought, to a Church setting...Mr. Kramer treats the film's religious questions as afterthoughts, and too often achieves a dispirited, noncommittal tone.\\" Roger Ebert, writing in the Chicago Sun-Times, considered the film to be \\"a little silly\\", but added that \\"in its relentlessly old-fashioned way, The Runner Stumbles has a sort of dramatic persistence: It's not great, but it's there.\\" Variety criticized the film for being \\"presented in such a way that, at times, it appears like the best of the old-fashioned 1940s tear jerkers complete with overly lush sound track.\\" The Runner Stumbles was not commercially successful, and it turned out to be Kramer's last film. It had a brief VHS video release, but to date it has not been released on DVD. Kino Lorber Studio Classics has announced that the movie will be released on DVD and Blu-ray in March 2020. UK premiere (theatre) On 21 October 2009, the play The Runner Stumbles made its UK Premiere at The Crescent Theatre in Birmingham. It was the first time the play had been performed outside of the United States. The play was presented by the Birmingham School of Acting Theatre Company and directed by Lise Olson with music by Andy Ingamells, lighting by Jo Dawson, sound by Charlie Horne and design by David Crisp.

History Ilaro Court was designed and built in the early 1920s by Lady Gilbert Carter, an American artist whose husband Sir Gilbert Thomas Carter was Governor of Barbados from 1904 to 1911. The name Ilaro was derived from a town in Nigeria where the Governor was stationed when he was an officer. This gracious mansion built of local coral-limestone successfully combines Edwardian, Italian, and Caribbean architectural features into a distinctive and individualistic whole; it boasts the first swimming pool in Barbados — in which Prince Edward the Prince of Wales bathed when he visited Barbados. The large, park-like garden has a gazebo, fishpond and orchid house. The property was purchased in the 1980s by the then Barbados Labour Party government under Prime Minister The Rt Hon. \\"Tom\\" Adams and was set to be a cultural centre; but the decision was made by the Cabinet to move the Prime Minister's official residence from Culloden Farm where it had been under Errol Barrow and make Ilaro Court the official residence of the Prime Minister. The house was extensively refurbished throughout the early years of the 1980s and filled with antique furniture most of which had been made by the talented prisoners of the Glendairy prisons. In 1984 Tom Adams and his family moved into the residence officially and made it their home; unfortunately however, Tom Adams died a year later of a heart attack in the study. Thereafter, all persons who held the office of Prime Minister in Barbados, stayed at the residence, with the exception of Rt Hon. Errol Barrow (later Rt. Excellent). Among the Prime Ministers who stayed at the residence were the Rt. Hon. J.M.G.M. \\"Tom\\" Adams, the Hon. Bernard St. John, the Rt Hon Lloyd Erskine Sandiford later Sir. Lloyd, the Rt Hon. Owen Arthur, the Hon. David Thompson, who, in May 2010 moved back to his St. Philip residence after he had been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, subsequently dying on 23 October 2010. The resident who preceded the current Prime Minister Mia Mottley was the Rt. Hon. Freundel Stuart (2010-2018). The property is maintained by the Barbados National Trust which ensures that all historic buildings are kept in a decent state of repair, preserving as much of Barbados' history as possible. At various times of the year the National Trust organizes tours to the mansion so locals and visitors alike can see where the head of the government spends most of his time. Ilaro Court is now used primarily for official state functions and other events like Carols by Candlelight. The current Prime Minister, the Honourable Mia Mottley has not indicated yet whether she will reside at Ilaro Court.

It is located in south Austin, and encompasses part of ZIP code 78704. Barton Hills is bounded by South Lamar and Zilker neighborhoods to the east, Barton Springs Road and Zilker Park to the north, Barton Creek and the Spyglass-Barton's Bluff neighborhood to the west and the Capital of Texas Highway to the south. Barton Hills is primarily residential, with the oldest homes dating back to the 1940s. Additionally, the area is home to several attractions including the Barton Creek Greenbelt nature preserve and the Umlauf Sculpture Garden and Museum. Just north of the neighborhood are Barton Springs Pool, a natural spring fed by Barton Creek, and the 351-acre Zilker Park. History In 1837, William \\"Uncle Billy\\" Barton set up his pioneer homestead near a natural spring on the southern bank of the Colorado River, naming the springs after his daughters Parthenia, Eliza and Zenobia. Their names did not stick, but William's did and 160 years later the springs, the pool, and several popular Austin neighborhoods bear the name \\"Barton.\\" Established in the 1940s and 1950s with construction continuing through the 1970s to the late 1990s, Barton Hills contains many different styles of single-family homes. In the 1940s, noted Austin-based architect A.D. Stenger designed and built a group of contemporary mid-century modern homes in a section of land bound by Arthur Street and Ariole Way. Barton Hills was featured in Austin’s 1956 Parade of Homes as “the world’s largest air-conditioned subdivision.” Beginning in that year, it was platted as a subdivision in six sections by S.R. Sheppard, Builders Development Corporation and others. Barton Hills eventually had 1,585 lots planned on its 535 acres (0.84 square mile). During the 1972 presidential election, Barton Hills was labeled a political bellwether, described as being a microcosm of the national population. In the 1970s, much of the lots and streets west of Barton Skyway were re-platted into a subdivision named \\"Horseshoe Bend\\". In 1978, City Manager Dan Davidson asked the Austin City Council to authorize preliminary engineering to build a previously-proposed bridge over Barton Creek to connect Barton Skyway from Spyglass Drive to Barton Hills Drive. The city also planned to extend Barton Skyway west to Bee Caves Road, along with connecting various gaps east between Lightsey Road to Woodward Street. Residents of Barton Hills and Horseshoe Bend protested the bridge, concerned about increased traffic and damage to Barton Creek. The bridge was eventually shelved and the former right-of-way was absorbed into the Barton Creek Greenbelt. Demographics According to data from the U.S. Census Bureau, the population of the area defined as Barton Hills was 7,993 in 2009, across an area of 3.199 square miles. The population density per square miles is 2,499, just below the citywide average of 2,610 people per square mile. The racial breakdown is 80% white, 12% Hispanic/Latino, 4% Asian/Pacific Island, 2% black and 2% other. Median household income in 2009 was $51,930, slightly above the median household income for the city at large. The average estimated value of detached houses in 2009 was $395,682, notably higher than the citywide average of $286,025.

Zucker (; born 1950) is an American-Canadian psychologist and sexologist. He was named editor-in-chief of Archives of Sexual Behavior in 2001. He was psychologist-in-chief at Toronto's Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH) and head of its Gender Identity Service until its closure in December of 2015. Zucker is a professor in the departments of psychiatry and psychology at the University of Toronto. Zucker collaborated with Susan Bradley, collecting clinical and research data over a period of twenty years and became an international authority on gender dysphoria in children (GDC) and adolescents. In 2007, Zucker was chosen to be a member of the American Psychological Association Task Force on Gender Identity, Gender Variance, and Intersex Conditions, and in 2008 he was named chair of the American Psychiatric Association workgroup on \\"Sexual and Gender Identity Disorders\\" for the 2012 edition of the DSM-5. He previously served on workgroups for the DSM-IV and the DSM-IV-TR. Zucker's views are controversial among some mental health professionals and many advocates. Citing a review by two adolescent psychiatrists stating that CAMH was out of step with current best practices for transgender youth, CAMH fired Zucker and closed the clinic. They later apologized to Zucker and paid him a financial settlement after one of the complaints in the review was found to be false. Zucker was featured in a BBC2 documentary in 2017. Life Zucker was born in 1950 to Jewish parents and grew up in Skokie, Illinois. Zucker received his B.A. from Southern Illinois University, his M.A. from Roosevelt University, and his Ph.D. from University of Toronto in 1982. He holds a certification from College of Psychologists of Ontario. Zucker became interested in gender identity after reading Richard Green's 1974 book Sexual Identity Conflict in Children and Adults. Zucker's graduate work in developmental psychology resulted in his master's thesis on normative gender identity development in children. While in graduate school, Zucker met his future collaborator, Susan Bradley, a child psychiatrist on staff at the Child and Adolescent Service of the Clarke Institute of Psychiatry (now the Child and Family Studies Centre of the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health), a public mental health centre and teaching hospital of the University of Toronto Faculty of Medicine. Zucker was impressed with the Clarke Institute and met with then chief of psychology, Kingsley Ferguson, who told Zucker of Bradley's new working group assessing children and adolescents with gender identity problems. He joined Bradley's group. Therapeutic intervention for gender variance Since the mid-1970s, Zucker has treated about 500 preadolescent gender-variant children to have them accept the gender identity they were assigned at birth until they are at an age he believes they may determine their own gender identity. Considerable disagreement exists between academic sex researchers, who say the sciences supports Zucker's approach, and activists who compare it to conversion therapy attempting to change gay men and lesbians into heterosexual men and women. Zucker says he tries to encourage children to accept their birth sex and supports them in transitioning should they still experience gender dysphoria into adolescence. For children assigned as male at birth, Zucker reportedly asked parents to take away toys associated with girls and to instruct their child not to play alongside or draw pictures of girls, although the parent that originally made this claim has more recently expressed that there was a miscommunication in the original interview and that such directives were to treat the social isolation that stemmed from her son's obsession with dolls. Psychologist Darryl Hill wrote that Zucker and Bradley believed that reparative treatments can reduce rejection by enabling gender non-conforming children to mix with children of the same sex, reducing the possibility of adult gender dysphoria. Among Zucker's publications is the case history of two patients who were male by birth but underwent a penectomy and were shortly thereafter reassigned as female. At age 26 both denied ever feeling the desire to be male. Both patients reported more masculine behavior and bisexuality, about which Zucker suspects that gender role and sexual orientation develop mostly before birth while gender identity development begins shortly after birth. There is some support for the position that \\"prenatal sex differentiation can at least sometimes trump social influences.\\" Zucker says parents set the goals at his clinic. \\"We recommend that one goal be to help the child feel more secure about his or her actual gender, another to deal with the child's emotional difficulties, and a third to help with problems in the family. It's helpful to have parents set limits on things like cross- dressing, which many parents have not done before coming to us.\\" Zucker's follow-up of 50 treated children found that \\"about 10 percent are still very unhappy about their gender, still cross-dressing, and thinking about having sex reassignment surgery\\" as young adults. Zucker has stated that \\"the therapist must rely on the 'clinical wisdom' that has accumulated and to utilize largely untested case formulation conceptual models to inform treatment approaches and decisions.\\" Zucker coauthored a statistical report with J. Michael Bailey that found gay men and lesbians exhibited more cross- gender activity as children. For adolescent clients expressing gender identity disorder, Zucker's treatment protocol resembles that for adult GID, consisting of hormone replacement therapy to aid the adolescent in a social transition. Zucker's clinic does not provide recommendations for sex reassignment surgery – instead, clients are encouraged to pursue reassignment through the adult Gender Identity Clinic at CAMH, which controls funding for the procedure in Ontario. Activists have compared Zucker's approaches with reparative therapy. The Gay and Lesbian Medical Association believes \\"'reparative' therapy that seeks to reverse sexual orientation or gender identification\\" is an \\"extreme example\\" of bias that \\"may lead to increased self hatred and mental health problems.\\" Psychiatrist Simon Pickstone-Taylor has cited similarities between Zucker's therapeutic intervention and reparative therapy for homosexuals. Zucker responded that prevention of homosexuality was never a goal in their treatments and cites a lack of empirical evidence for the most effective approach. Journalist Marc Lostracco described Zucker's therapy as \\"well- meaning\\" but \\"problematic and harsh.\\" Others, like author Phyllis Burke, object to any diagnosis of GID in children, considering it to be \\"child abuse.\\" Zucker dismisses Burke's book as \\"simplistic\\" and \\"not particularly illuminating;\\" journalist Stephanie Wilkinson said Zucker characterized Burke's book as \\"the work of a journalist whose views shouldn't be put into the same camp as those of scientists like Richard Green or himself.\\" Closure of the CAMH Gender Identity Clinic for Children In 2015, the Ontario provincial parliament introduced legislation banning conversion therapy. Members of Rainbow Health Ontario, a provincial health promotion and navigation organization, approached CAMH expressing their concerns regarding Zucker's clinic. They alleged that cases of suicide of transgender youth results from methods used by Zucker and that the ban on conversion therapy made those methods illegal. CAMH stopped the clinic from accepting new patients and initiated an external review of the clinic's practices. The reviewers were child and adolescent psychiatrists Suzanne Zinck of Halifax, and Antonio Pignatiello of Toronto. They invited stakeholders to comment on their experiences in the clinic. A former client, now an adult, claimed Zucker \\"asked him to remove his shirt in front of other clinicians present, laughed when he complied, and then referred to him as a 'hairy little vermin'.\\" The review noted numerous strengths of the clinic, but also described it as an insular entity with an approach dissimilar from other clinics and described it as being out of step with current best practices, including WPATH SOC version 7. They also raised concerns about clinicians asking age inappropriate questions. After the review, CAMH shut down the clinic and fired Zucker. Kwame McKenzie, medical director of CAMH's child, youth, and family services, said \\"We want to apologize for the fact that not all of the practices in our childhood gender identity clinic are in step with the latest thinking\\" and that Zucker is \\"no longer at CAMH.\\" CAMH announced a process of consultation with community leaders to examine how best to offer care. CAMH director Kwame McKenzie said that Zucker's treatments were against the centre's guidelines. Prior to the review, he stated that there exists two groups of thinking on such therapy for children under 11 among professionals. The client who accused Zucker of calling him a \\"vermin\\" withdrew his accusation, which was reported as false. CAMH removed the report from its website and apologized, and replaced it with a summary of the report which has not survived a move to its new website. Zucker subsequently sued McKenzie and CAMH. After the lawsuit, CAMH again apologized to, and settled with Zucker paying $586,000 in damages, legal fees, and interest. When the settlement was announced, CAMH stated that it \\"stands by its decision to close the child and youth gender identity clinic following an external review which concluded the clinic was not meeting the needs of gender expansive and trans children and their families\\" \\"We believe our modernized approach to delivering services to youth better supports diverse patients through best practice and timely care.\\" Archives of Sexual Behavior As editor of Archives of Sexual Behavior, Zucker published a controversial study on reparative therapy by Robert Spitzer. According to The New York Times, after his presentation of the study caused controversy, Spitzer asked Zucker to publish it. \\"I knew Bob and the quality of his work, and I agreed to publish it,\\" Zucker said in an interview. \\"But I told him I would do it only if I also published commentaries\\". Spitzer later recanted the study's conclusions. DSM Several LGBT activists spoke out against Zucker's 2008 appointment to the DSM-5 working group. The National Gay and Lesbian Task Force issued a statement questioning the APA's decision to appoint Zucker and a second member of the work panel. According to a response released by American Psychiatric Association, Zucker does not advocate reparative therapy for transgender adults or for trans youth in all cases, and he opposes change therapy for gay people under all circumstances. Publications According to the Web of Science, Zucker has published almost 100 articles in peer-reviewed journals. These articles have been cited over 2000 times, with an h-index of 20. He has published several books, including: * Gender Identity Disorder and Psychosexual Problems in Children and Adolescents (1995) * Attachment and Psychopathology (1997) * Ex-Gay Research: Analyzing the Spitzer Study And Its Relation to Science, Religion, Politics, and Culture (2006) References External links *Dr. Kenneth Zucker's personal website * Further reading *Article on Kenneth Zucker's work in The Atlantic (2008). *Interview with Dr. Kenneth Zucker in GayOut (no date).

It was based on the left wing of the syndicalist association Freedom and People, founded in Warsaw on October 21, 1939. Association Freedom and People (Wolność i Lud, WiL) had two wings - military and civilian. Its objectives were presented in official declaration Kupujmy broń (Let us buy weapons). In December 1939 the first armed units (called Polish Syndicalist Units Freedom and People) were created. They consisted of small 3-5-persons groups, which cooperated with the Związek Walki Zbrojnej (Association of Armed Struggle, ZWZ). In April 1941 Freedom and People was renamed to The Union of Polish Syndicalists, and in the summer of next year a group of officers decided to leave the Union and enter the general anti-Nazi organization, the Home Army (Armia Krajowa, AK). As a result, the military wing of WiL had to be re- created almost from scratch. In October 1942 first Assault Unit Zew was organized, and it was subject to headquarters of the Home Army. Union of Polish Syndicalists also issued several conspiratorial magazines (such as Akcja, Sprawa, Czyn, Sprawa Chłopska, Myśl Młodych, Dekada, Iskra). In the fall of 1942 it co-created the Front of the Patriotic Left. In its program, created in 1943, it supported among others issues, moving the borders of Poland westward to the Oder-Neisse line, while at the same time preserving pre-1939 eastern borders of the country. It also supported close cooperation with other Slavic nations. During the Warsaw Uprising, the Union created the 104th Company of Syndicalists under Kazimierz Puczyński, which fought in Warsaw's Old Town. After World War II, it supported the Soviet-backed State National Council (KRN) and Polish Committee of National Liberation (KPWN) and dissolved itself some time in mid-1945.

She was a daughter of Francesco I de' Medici and Joanna of Austria. She was a family member of the famous House of Medici and the sister of Marie de' Medici the Queen of France. Early life Eleanor, born Eleonora, was born in Florence, Tuscany, Italy, on 28 February 1567, as the eldest child of Francesco I de' Medici and his first wife Archduchess Joanna. Her baptism took place the same year and was attended by Cardinal Innocenzo Ciocchi Del Monte an adoptive nephew of Pope Julius III. Cardinal Spinello de' Benci performed the ceremony on behalf of Pope Pius V. The baptism was celebrated also with hunting excursions and parties. It was at first believed Eleanor would marry Francis, Duke of Anjou, son of Henry II of France and Catherine de' Medici. In 1570 it was feared Eleanor had contracted smallpox but this was not the case, she had only a fever from which she recovered. Her parents and grandfather Cosimo sent her flasks of holy water as she recovered from her illness. In 1574 when Eleanor was seven years of age, her grandfather Cosimo died so her father became Grand Duke of Tuscany. In 1578, when Eleanor was eleven her mother died, and her father later married Bianca Cappello. Medici was one of seven children; one of her sisters, Marie de' Medici became queen of France and was the mother of Louis XIII of France. Another sister, Anna, died at the age of 14; Eleanor wrote to her father on behalf of the dying Anna, who wished to see her father, but Anna died the same day. The rest of Eleanor and Marie's siblings also died during childhood. Marriage =Wedding and Celebrations= Vincenzo I Gonzaga Medici married Vincenzo I Gonzaga on 29 April 1584, as his second wife after he divorced Margherita Farnese. Celebrations for the signing of the marriage contract on 4 April 1584 took place in Mantua, including bells ringing and fireworks being set off. Eight days after the celebrations, the couple traveled to Florence to meet Eleanor's father Grand Duke Francesco and her stepmother Bianca Cappello. At this point Vincenzo kept a portrait of Eleanor by his bed. On April 10, Francesco sent a letter to Philip II of Spain asking for permission for Eleanor and Vincenzo to be married, although Francesco also wished for proof of his son-in-law's fertility before concluding marriage negotiations. On 3 May 1584, Eleanor arrived in Mantua. After arriving by boat, Eleanor disembarked at Miglioretto (the shores of the Mincio river immediately downstream from Mantua) and was accompanied to Palazzo Te by Ottavio Farnese, Duke of Parma, her husband Vincenzo, and many noblemen and women from Piacenza, Parma, and Mantua. After resting at Palazzo Te, Eleanor changed into a jewelled silver-brocade dress and made her entry into the city to salvos of arquebuses and artillery while riding in a semi-covered gilded carriage pulled by four white horses and accompanied by the Mantuan military, mounted arquebusiers, light cavalry, noblemen and women in carriages. After arriving at the Castello di San Giorgio she proceeded to the palatine church of Santa Barbara and the Ducal Palace where she was greeted at the foot of the stairs by Duke and Duchess of Mantua, Guglielmo Gonzaga and Eleanor of Austria. After a meal she was accompanied by Cardinals Gianfrancesco Gambara and Giovanni Vincenzo Gonzaga di Guastalla by boat to Palazzo Te, where she was visited by Cardinal Alessandro Farnese and Duke of Parma. =Married Life= Eleanor initially had several portraits commissioned to be made of her deceased mother Joanna as well as her deceased siblings Anna and Filippo, but was unhappy with the length of time taken to paint the portraits. On 7 May 1586, Eleanor gave birth to her first child, a son named Francesco; during the pregnancy her father sent her a present of some plums. The following year, Eleanor's father-in-law Guglielmo died, Vincenzo becoming Duke of Mantua whilst Eleanor served as his Duchess consort. The same year, she gave birth to a second son, Ferdinando after a difficult pregnancy. In the following years, Eleanor had further children: firstly a son, Guglielmo Domenico in 1589, who died young, then in 1591 a daughter, Margherita, who married Henry II, Duke of Lorraine, followed by a son, Vincenzo in 1594, who succeeded his older brothers. She then suffered a miscarriage in 1596, four months into pregnancy and in 1598 she gave birth to a second daughter, also named Eleanor, who married Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor. In October 1600, Eleanor attended the wedding of her sister Marie to Henry IV of France. In 1601, Queen Marie gave birth to her first child and son, the future Louis XIII of France; Marie made her sister Eleanor the godmother of the child. In 1602, Vincenzo traveled to Flanders in search of medical treatment, he left Eleanor in control of the duchy. In this time she sent Ferdinando I de' Medici a list of men condemned to the galleys, in the letter she informed Ferdinando of her post whilst her husband was away. During the winter of 1603–1604, Galileo visited the Mantuan court in an effort to obtain a position there, and was offered a salary, but could not agree on the terms with Vincenzo, who instead presented Galileo with a gold chain and two silver dishes. In 1606, Eleanor accompanied her daughter Margherita to Lorraine for her marriage to Duke Henry. =Death and Funeral= Eleanor fell ill in the first quarter of 1611 with a prolonged illness, but seemed to recover by April. She retired for two months to the Palazzo di Porto in Porto Mantovano, \\"one mile from the city and beautiful for its gardens and fresh water.\\" With the arrival of hotter weather, Eleanor moved north to the hill-top fortified villa at Cavriana. There, on the day after the Feast of the Birth of the Virgin, her health rapidly declined and died on 9 September 1611, aged forty four. At the time of her death, her husband Duke Vincenzo was in Casale Monferrato; he outlived her by only one year, dying in 1612. After her death, Eleanor's body was placed in a \\"lead casket\\" (which in turn was placed inside a wooden casket sealed with pitch and draped with a black velvet cloth), and accompanied by \\"numerous priests from the outlying towns\\" to the parish church of Cavriana, where she lay in state for two days. Next her body was transported to Mantua on a \\"cart draped with black fabric\\" and pulled by six horses caparisoned in black and accompanied by twelve \\"priests on horseback\\" and twelve \\"foot attendants bearing burning torches\\" and followed by twelve carriages carrying members of the Gonzaga family and twelve carts, also covered in black. Eleanor's body was then taken to the Corte Vecchia where her body was deposited to await the return of Vincenzo. When Duke Vincenzo returned to Mantua on 3 October 1611, plans were made for Eleanor's funeral to be held on the Feast of Saint Francesco (it was then delayed by a few days so that preparations in Sant'Andrea could be finished). During this interim period, her body was placed upon a \\"beautiful catafalque resplendant with many candles\\" that had been specially constructed in the aforementioned oratory and accompanied by priests from Santa Barbara and tertiary nuns from the city's major churches. The funerary functions were performed by the Bishop of Casale, since the bishop of Mantua, Annibale (\\"Francesco\\") Gonzaga di Bozzolo, was ill. The procession on foot that accompanied Eleanor's body from the oratory in the Corte Vecchia to Sant'Andrea was led by the \\"gonfalone\\" of the principal church and followed in order by members of the city's various civic and religious institutions, including: the misericordia, the city's various hospitals, schools, and churches (including the abbots of each).

It is operated by the Windsor-Essex Catholic District School Board. Danielle Desjardins-Koloff is the school's principal. Catholic Central High School has a diverse, multicultural student body. History Catholic Central was founded in 1985 / 1986 when the Windsor Catholic School Board voted to open a fourth Catholic high school in the city. In January 1986, a principal was chosen: Mr. Ed Johnston (principal 1986 - 1988), who began to visit the feeder schools and work with students who would soon be the school's first class, and would eventually become the first graduates of the school. The physical location of the school was the first major problem. It was decided that the first year classes would be held in the vacated St. Hubert's School in South Windsor (now occupied by Monseigneur Jean Noel). The first classes began in September 1986 with a staff of 16 teachers. Students were bused out to South Windsor for their classes. In August 1987, negotiations with the Windsor Public School Board were completed and the school location moved from St. Hubert's. The new location had a long history in the area as a grade school (Guppy), a commercial high school (Commerce) and as the Adult Education Center. In the second year, the staff grew to 36 and there were 470 students in grades 9 and 10. In the fifth year, there were 1074 students and 75 teachers. =Expansion= In 1992, the school began a $4.6 million addition and renovations. The grand opening was held on Nov. 19, 1993 under the leadership of Mr. R.

Composed of three cardinal plane components: subtalar eversion, ankle dorsiflexion, and forefoot abduction, these three distinct motions of the foot occur simultaneously during the pronation phase. Pronation is a normal, desirable, and necessary component of the gait cycle. Pronation is the first half of the stance phase, whereas supination starts the propulsive phase as the heel begins to lift off the ground. An illustration of pronation and supination of the foot from an anatomy textbook Types The normal biomechanics of the foot absorb and direct the occurring throughout the gait whereas the foot is flexible (pronation) and rigid (supination) during different phases of the gait cycle. As the foot is loaded, eversion of the subtalar joint, dorsiflexion of the ankle, and abduction of the forefoot occur. Pronation should not occur past the latter stages of midstance, as the normal foot should then supinate in preparation for toe-off. Abnormal pronation occurs when a foot pronates when it should supinate, or overpronates during a normal pronation period of the gait cycle. Approximately four degrees of pronation and supination are necessary to enable the foot to propel forward properly. In the neutral position, the foot is neither pronating nor supinating. If the foot is pronating or supinating during the stance phase of the gait cycle when it ought to be in the neutral position, a biomechanical problem may exist. For ease of choosing corrective footwear, three types of pronation are recognized: neutral pronation, overpronation, and underpronation. =Neutral pronation= Some pronation, also called eversion, is natural in the body’s regular movement. Neutral pronation occurs when the foot experiences a normal, healthy amount of pronation instead of overpronating or underpronating. In healthy movement, more of the toe area will be used when pushing off than an unhealthy movement. In neutral pronation, the weight distributes fairly evenly among all of the toes with a slight emphasis on the big toe and second toe, which are better adapted to handle more of the load. =Overpronation= Overpronation Those who overpronate tend to push off almost completely from the big toe and second toe. As a result, the shock from the foot’s impact doesn’t spread evenly throughout the foot and the ankle has trouble stabilizing the rest of the body. Additionally, an unnatural angle forms between the foot and ankle and the foot splays out abnormally. It is common even for people who pronate normally to have some angle between the foot and the ankle, but not to the extent seen in those who overpronate. In normal pronation, the weight distributes evenly throughout the foot. Causes There are many possible causes for overpronation, but researchers have not yet determined an underlying cause. Hintermann states, “Compensatory overpronation may occur for anatomical reasons, such as a tibia vara of 10 degrees or more, forefoot varus, leg length discrepancy, ligamentous laxity, or because of muscular weakness or tightness in the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles.\\" Pronation can be influenced by sources outside of the body as well. Shoes have been shown to significantly influence pronation. Hintermann states that the same person can have different amounts of pronation just by using different running shoes. “It is easily possible that the maximal ankle joint eversion movement is 31 degrees for one and 12 degrees for another running shoe.\\" Flat foot There has been some speculation as to whether arch height has an effect on pronation. After conducting a study at the Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology, Maggie Boozer suggests that people with higher arches tend to pronate to a greater degree. However, the generally accepted view by professionals is that the most pronation is present in those with lower arch heights. To complicate matters, one study done by Hylton Menz at the University of Western Sydney-Macarthur suggests that the methods for measuring arch height and determining whether someone is “flat-footed” or “high-arched” are unreliable. He says, “For this reason, studies investigating the relationship between static arch height motion of the rearfoot have consistently found that such a classification system is a poor predictor of dynamic rearfoot function.” Effects Overpronation may have secondary effects on the lower legs, such as increased rotation of the tibia, which may result in lower leg or knee problems. Overpronation is usually associated with many overuse injuries in running including medial tibial stress syndrome, or shin splints, and knee pain Hintermann states, “Individuals with injuries typically have pronation movement that is about two to four degrees greater than that of those with no injuries.” He adds however, that between 40% and 50% of runners who overpronate do not have overuse injuries. This suggests that although pronation may have an effect on certain injuries, it is not the only factor influencing their development. Prevention/treatment =Orthotics= The design principles of foot orthoses are founded on knowledge of the functional anatomy of the foot. Pronation of the foot is triplanar. The axis of rotation in the foot joints is not perpendicular to any of the cardinal planes (sagittal, horizontal, frontal) of the human body. The triplanar motion of the foot postulates that blocking of any one component of triplanar motion in a single cardinal plane prevents movement in the other two planes as well. This all-or-nothing rule is the premise for orthotic posting or wedging. Supportive orthotics in the shoe is a method commonly implemented to treat many common running injuries associated with excessive pronation. Orthotics are the most effective treatment for symptoms that develop from biomechanics within the body such as overpronation, resulting in either great improvement or complete healing of the injury in about half the cases. =Shoe type= Foot pronation tends to increase in runners as mileage also increases, potentially increasing the risk for injury. Motion control shoes are a specific type of running shoe designed to limit these excessive foot motions by reducing the amount of plantar force (a force generated by excess pronation). Motion control and stability shoes have increased medial support which may increase stability to the foot and leg and lower the amount of pronation in the foot. =Taping= Certain methods of taping the foot and leg have also been shown to be effective in preventing overpronation. In a study conducted at the University of Queensland, a taping procedure known as the LowDye taping technique was shown to be effective in controlling pronation during both movement and standing. =Shoe-lacing patterns= Specific patterns of lacing running shoes also reduce pronation. Pronation significantly decreases when the highest number of eyelets in the shoe is used for lacing and the shoes are tied as tight as possible, Closeup of a person running barefoot =Barefoot running= Several studies have shown that running barefoot can decrease pronation on the foot’s impact with the ground. This is thought to be because running shoes have extra weight for cushioning at the heel of the shoe, causing the runner to heel-strike more, which in turn results in increased pronation during the step. According to researchers at the Biomechanics Laboratory of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, “The least amount of pronation takes place when running barefoot.\\" =Supination= Supination is the opposite, and occurs when the foot impacts the ground and there is not enough of an “inward roll” in the foot’s motion. The weight of the body isn’t transferred at all to the big toe, forcing the outside of the foot and the smaller toes which can't handle the stress as well to take the majority of the overweight instead. Runner’s World states, “[Underpronators] do best in a neutral-cushioned shoe that encourages a more natural foot motion.\\" Since underpronators’ feet don’t roll inward like overpronators’, support isn’t necessarily needed to correct supination as it is to correct overpronation.

He was the son of Giuseppe Scalamandré and Maria Teresa Ambrosina Scalamandré. His father was a broker of silk, and a textile importer in Calabria. Education, immigration and founding Scalamandré Silks 1923 Scalamandré completed a doctorate in engineering from the Royal Polytechnic School of Naples, and in 1924 immigrated to the United States. In 1925 he worked as a draftsman for the Westinghouse Electric Company in Newark, New Jersey. In 1926 he began teaching drawing at the E. A. Seeley School of Decoration in Paterson, New Jersey. In 1929 Scalamandré married Flora Baranzelli a designer and painter. The same year they formed Scalamandré Silks. Founding of the company coincided with a growing movement in the United States of restoring historic houses and furnishings. Scalamandré began recreating historic fabrics based on the collections of historic homes and museums. Scalamandré Museum of Textiles In 1936 Scalamandré opened the Scalamandré Museum of Textiles, located in the company's Manhattan showroom. The museum displayed the company's collection of historic European and American textiles. The museum continued in operation, with a mission of showing historic textile documents to the public, often alongside the company's careful reproductions, until the late 1960s. Recreating historic textiles Scalamandré and his company reproduced historic textile documents for prestigious homes and museums including the White House, the United States Capitol, many state houses, governors' mansions, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and Hearst Castle in San Simeon, California. A 1989 exhibition at the Paley Design Center of the Philadelphia College of Textiles and Science titled \\"Scalamandre: Preserving America's Textile Heritage, 1929-1989\\" credited Franco Scalamandré and his firm with having recreated over 600 historic textile reproductions. Work at the White House Scalamandré was commissioned to produce silk fabric for the White House restoration during the administration of president John F. Kennedy. In 1961 the firm was contacted to provide material for the White House. American interior decorator Sister Parish performing initial redecoration work primarily on the residential floor of the White House specified several stock fabrics from Scalamandré Silks. As the White House restoration began to focus on the more public ceremonial rooms of the State Floor, French interior designer Stéphane Boudin of Maison Jansen was given oversight of the redecoration of the Red Room, Blue Room, East Room, and the fabric selection for the Green Room. Boudin was encouraged to use the American manufacture Scalamandré to recreate several of the historic fabric documents from the library of Maison Jansen, and the recreation of a complex silk lampas with an eagle design for the upholstery of a suite of French Empire furniture by cabinetmaker Pierre-Antoine Bellangé originally acquired by James Madison for the Blue Room. This, and the Green Room's complex hand woven watered silk moiré proved most challenging. Samples for the Blue Room's upholstery disappointed First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy and Stéphane Boudin. White House Chief Usher J. B. West recorded that the Curator of the White House William Voss Elder, III described the sample as looking like a plucked chicken. Samples for the Green Room watered silk wall covering were found to be coarse, too thick, and too regular in comparison with the 18th century sample provided to the firm. Production of both fabrics was quietly moved to the venerable French textile firm Tassinari et Chatel, which had probably woven the Monroe era fabric, originally in crimson. The completed fabric was delivered to the United States by diplomatic pouch avoiding scrutiny by the United States Customs Service and the controversy of a foreign manufactured product. Scalamandré silks were used in the Blue Room drapery, Red Room walls, drapery, and upholstery. Subsequent refurbishments of the White House during the Nixon, Carter, Reagan, Clinton, and both Bush administrations used stock and custom woven textiles from Scalamandré workshops. And the firm has provided silk lampas and silk and wool velvets to restoration projects in the United States Capitol. Civic and design recognition Scalamandré received several design awards including the Gordon Gray Award for Achievement in Preservation from the National Trust for Historic Preservation and the Thomas Jefferson Award granted by the American Society of Interior Designers. He also received numerous civic citations for his work in preserving and recreating historic American textiles including one from The National Society of the Colonial Dames of America, whose several historic properties Scalamandré's firm helped restore.

The station is owned by Saga Communications of New England, LLC, a subsidiary of Saga Communications. It broadcasts a classic country radio format, under the \\"92.3 The Outlaw\\" branding. WPVQ's programming is also heard on translator station W222CH (92.3 FM); the FM frequency is used in its branding. History WPVQ signed on May 13, 1956 as WCAT, operating on 1390 AM. Original owner Miller's River Broadcasting sold the station to Tri-State Radio in 1960, who in turn sold it to Berkshire Broadcasting in 1969. By 1971, the station had a middle-of-the- road format, which it would retain into the 1980s, as the station was sold to P&S; Broadcasting in 1975. In 1983, WCAT moved to its current position on 700. The station changed its call letters to WPNS, reflecting its ownership, in 1987; after just over a year, however, the station reverted to WCAT. WCAT subsequently discontinued locally originated programming; by 1996, the station was a talk radio station, affiliated with the Talk America network. An FM sister station on 99.9 FM (now WKMY) was launched on December 4, 1989. In 1998, P&S; sold WCAT and WCAT-FM to CAT Communications Corporation (a company controlled by Jeff Shapiro), who in turn sold the stations to Citadel Broadcasting in 2000. Citadel operated the WCAT stations as part of its Worcester group of stations, even though Arbitron considered the stations to be within the Boston market. Several months after Citadel took over, WCAT went silent while its tower was replaced, putting the station in danger of having its license canceled by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for failing to broadcast for a year; when it returned in late October 2001, just before its November 1 deadline to do so, it simulcast the oldies format of WCAT-FM. By the following year, WCAT had been leased out to a Spanish language operator that implemented a religious format. The station's logo as an ESPN Radio affiliate, used from January 2, 2008 until late 2011. Citadel sold WCAT and its FM sister station, by then WAHL, to Northeast Broadcasting, controlled by Steve Silberberg, in 2003. Silberberg subsequently purchased WGAW (1340 AM) in nearby Gardner, and in 2004 WCAT began simulcasting its talk format. The station was renamed WJOE in 2005; it subsequently resumed separate programming, and after a stint as an oldies station, WJOE joined ESPN Radio on January 2, 2008. WJOE was to switch to a Brazilian format on March 16, 2009; this format was to be programmed by Langer Broadcasting Group as a sister station to WSRO. However, this format change did not occur, and the station remained with ESPN Radio. On September 2, 2009, WJOE swapped callsigns with Columbia City, Indiana station WVBB (106.3 FM), which desired the WJOE callsign to match its \\"Joe FM\\" branding. Nine days later, the callsign was changed again, this time to WTUB. The station dropped ESPN Radio in late 2011 and returned to simulcasting its FM sister station, by then WXRG, which at that time was itself rebroadcasting adult album alternative sister station WXRV from Andover. On April 30, 2014, the station became WWBZ. Logo used from June 9, 2014 until January 10, 2019, as \\"The Big 700 WFAT\\". WWBZ and what had become WFNX dropped the WXRV simulcast in May 2014 and began stunting with a wide range of music while preparing to launch new formats for the stations on June 9, with listeners being asked to vote on which of the songs being played should be included in the new formats. At the end of the stunting, WWBZ dropped the simulcast with WFNX (which continued with a variety hits format) and introduced the oldies format. During its first day with the format, the station referred to itself as \\"Legends 700 WBZ\\" despite not being associated with Boston radio station WBZ (1030 AM), whose signal reaches the Orange-Athol area; on June 10, the branding was amended to feature the full WWBZ call sign. The station subsequently rebranded as simply \\"AM Radio 700\\" after WBZ's owner, CBS Radio, objected to the WWBZ call sign as an infringement of its trademark for WBZ, as well as a separate trademark infringement dispute with the owners of WNBP in Newburyport over the \\"Legends\\" branding. WWBZ then announced its intention to introduce a new branding and call sign; on September 1, 2014, it took the WFAT call sign. Following a lack of success at attracting advertisers, in May 2016 WFAT announced that it would end its oldies format after May 29 and return to simulcasting WXRV, concurrently with sister station WFNX; in its announcement, WFAT said it needed ten businesses to advertise on the station on an annual basis to cover its costs. Despite the announcement, WFAT continued to broadcast the oldies format until 2019. Saga Communications agreed to acquire WFAT for $210,000 in September 2018. The purchase was consummated on January 4, 2019, at which point Saga changed the station's call letters to WPVQ, shared with existing Saga-owned country music station WPVQ-FM (95.3).

Beliefs  In 2015, APF had more than 1100 members in forty countrieshttp://anglicanpeacemaker.org.uk/resources/the-history-of-the-apf/ who had signed the pledge stating \\"that our membership of the Christian Church involves the complete repudiation of modern war, pledge ourselves to renounce war and all preparation to wage war, and to work for the construction of Christian peace in the world...\\"http://www.peacetaxseven.com/anglican.html By December 2019, this had declined to 544 members. https://www.anglicanpeacemaker.org.uk/wp- content/uploads/2019/12/ANG-26784-Peacemaker-19-3.pdf The key beliefs of members of the Fellowship are: * that Jesus' teaching is incompatible with the waging of war. * that a Christian church should never support or justify war. * that our Christian witness should include opposing the waging or justifying of war.http://www.anglicanpeacemaker.org.uk/ Today, pacifism is recognised as a mainstream Anglican position,http://www.peacetaxseven.com/anglican.html though it is not yet a dominant belief of the faith. \\"Numerous bishops have been Counsellors of APF and two, Wilfrid Westall, Bishop of Crediton, and Colin Scott, Assistant Bishop in the Diocese of Leicester, have chaired the Fellowship\\".http://www.peacetaxseven.com/anglican.html The current chairperson of APF as of 2018 is Sue Claydon.https://www.anglicanpeacemaker.org.uk/apf-80th-anniversary-day-new- chair/ History =Origins and early history= The Anglican Pacifist Fellowship was established in 1937, and now has some 1,400 members in over 40 countries, as well as a sister organisation, the Episcopal Peace Fellowship, in the United States of America. APF was founded as a specifically Anglican offshoot of Dick Sheppard's secular Peace Pledge Union. APF was formed by Anglican clergy and laity led by Sheppard who were intent on undertaking a torchlit peace march to Lambeth Palace in 1937 as the threat of a Second World War loomed on the horizon. The aim of the march was to give Sheppard's colleague, the then-Archbishop of Canterbury, Cosmo Lang, a statement of pacifist conviction. This was at a time when many churchmen were intent on \\"trying to reconcile the teachings of Christ with the practice of war\\". Besides many priests and bishops, notable early members of the group included British Labour Leader George Lansbury and famous literary figure Vera Brittain. In 2006, songwriter and fellow Anglican Pacifist Fellowship member Sue Gilmurray wrote a song in Brittain's memory, entitled \\"Vera\\". In addition to her famous novels, which were heavily imbued with pacifist ideology, Brittain was very much an active member of the \\"Ban the Bomber\\" campaign during the inter-war period, which sought to outlaw bomber aeroplanes as an illegal weapon of war, in recognition of the fact that they directly target civilian populations, beyond the frontline of conflicts and that they carry increasingly deadly payloads. This campaign had parallels to later attempts to ban nuclear weapons and ICBMs. =Second World War= During the war, \\"as well as campaigning for peace at every opportunity, APF had a support role for conscientious objectors... Anglican pacifists [also] became involved in social projects as an alternative to military duties\\".http://www.peacetaxseven.com/anglican.html Lansbury was particularly active in this period, though his life was nearing its end. In contrast to Neville Chamberlain's policy of appeasement, Lansbury took a pro-active diplomatic approach towards preventing a war. He sought negotiation with all the major parties in order to arbitrate a peaceful settlement, as related in his book My Pilgrimage for Peace, published in 1938. His efforts were, however, in vain, and most APF members now acknowledge that, to counteract Hitler by non-violent means, Governments should not have allowed the economic and political situation of instability in the Weimar Republic to arise in the first place. This issue is discussed at depth in APF's 1989 publication, What to Do About Hitler: A Pacifist Symposium. Notably, many early pacifists had argued against the excessively harsh terms of the Treaty of Versailles from its inception. It is notable that, by 1944, Vera Brittain was on Hitler's list of those English people posing the greatest threat to his regime. The leader of the Reich clearly felt deeply threatened by her pacifism. Upon a successful Nazi invasion of Britain, the Gestapo were to arrest her immediately. Undaunted, she continued writing further tracts on the immorality of saturation bombing, as the British Royal Air Force undertook its campaign against target cities such as Dresden.http://www.ppu.org.uk/learn/infodocs/people/pst_vera3.html Another famous woman to actively work for APF during the war period was the Anglo- Catholic intellectual Evelyn Underhill. Although initially opposed to pacifism (and, in fact, working for Naval Intelligence during World War I), after much soul-searching, she found pacifism to be the correct Christian position by 1939 and threw herself whole-heartedly behind APF's work, for \\"Not content to be merely a proclaimer of pacifism, Underhill tried to live by its principles\\". Writing in a famous pamphlet for APF entitled Church and War (1940),http://disseminary.org/hoopoe/pubs/underhill.html Underhill stated that, \\"If she remains true to her supernatural call, the Church cannot acquiesce in War for War, however camouflaged or excused, must always mean the effort of a group of men to achieve their purpose... by inflicting destruction and death on another group of men... it is often difficult to define the boundary which divides legitimate police action from military action; nevertheless, Christians must try to find that boundary and to observe it\\". During the war, APF supported conscientious objectors, and became involved in social projects to provide an alternative to military duties, including the Hungerford Club, which sheltered Londoners during the Blitz.https://www.churchtimes.co.uk/articles/2017/22-december/features/interviews/interview- sue-claydon-anglican-pacifist-fellowship-chair = Historical opposition to nuclear proliferation = Some prominent members of APF were at the forefront of resistance to nuclear proliferation. \\"Canon John Collins from St. Paul's Cathedral was in the forefront of the founding leadership of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND). The Revd. Sidney Hinkes was an early Chairman of CND\\".http://www.peacetaxseven.com/anglican.html Hinkes' \\"theology was conservatively Catholic in what he regarded as essentials, yet his parochial and pastoral practice was radically open, both to the working-class culture and the ethnic diversity of the people in the areas in which he served\\".http://www.churchtimes.co.uk/content.asp?id=14957 Hinkes was a leading member of APF during his lifetime, known for leading peace rallies and prayer vigils with his distinctive, large-sized version of the APF's emblematic blue and gold cross. He worked with the then-President of the Fellowship, Gordon Wilson and APF counsellor Paul Oestreicher on many strident campaigns for peace, his motto being \\"we put the 'fist' into pacifist!\\"http://www.churchtimes.co.uk/content.asp?id=14957 This stance exemplified the proactive peacemaking stance and pacifism of APF and contrasted sharply with any accusations of \\"passivism.\\" \\"To Sidney, peacemaking was anything but passive. His priesthood was a total commitment to the non-violent struggle to implement God's just and gentle rule. It was tough and demanding, but never embittered\\".http://www.churchtimes.co.uk/content.asp?id=14957 Frustrated that the Church often saw peace-making as a marginal issue, Hinkes worked to ensure that it came to central prominence due to his diligent work on race-relations as Britain became more ethnically-diverse following the War. Up until his death, he worked for both APF and the Stop the War Coalition to proactively pursue peace and an end to the 2003 Iraq War. Oestreicher, an honorary doctor from the University of Sussex,http://www.sussex.ac.uk/press_office/bulletin/15jul05/article6.shtml fled Nazi Germany as a child refugee. He grew up in New Zealand and was for many years director of the Centre for International Reconciliation at Coventry Cathedral. Like many APF members, he also works for other peace organisations. In his case, he has worked for the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and was also the founding chair for Amnesty International. Though an Anglican priest, also holds a strong affinity for the Quaker religion.http://www.sussex.ac.uk/press_office/bulletin/15jul05/article6.shtml He continues to write columns for the Guardian newspaperhttps://www.theguardian.com/profile/pauloestreicher and occasionally returns to New Zealand to speak on peace issues.http://www.converge.org.nz/pma/pauloes.htm  Current Activities  =United Kingdom = Church reform APF campaigns prominently at each Lambeth Conference.http://anglicanpeacemaker.org.uk/wp- content/uploads/2015/09/19-TAP-Sept-2008.pdf This activism aims to make the Church uphold Resolution 25 of the 1930 Lambeth Conference and Resolution 5 from the 1978 Lambeth Conference that state that \\"war as a method of settling international disputes is incompatible with the teaching and example of our Lord Jesus Christ\\". This Resolution overrules the older Article 37 of the 39 Articles of Anglican faith, which had stated that \\"It is lawful for Christian men at the commandment of the Magistrate to wear weapons and serve in the wars\\".http://www.eskimo.com/~lhowell/bcp1662/articles/articles.html#37 Making Bishops take practical steps to proclaim and uphold this Resolution is a key aim of APF. The 1968 Lambeth Conference saw a victory for conscientious objectors who finally had their rights recognised and upheld by the Church. The use of nuclear and bacteriological weapons was also \\"emphatically condemned\\".http://anglicanpeacemaker.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/19-TAP- Sept-2008.pdf \\"Gordon Wilson of APF was pleased that there were no ‘but’s in the Conference’s anti-war statements\\".http://anglicanpeacemaker.org.uk/wp- content/uploads/2015/09/19-TAP-Sept-2008.pdf During the 1978 Conference, after a pilgrimage to Dick Sheppard's grave, activists nailed Seven Theses to the door of Canterbury Cathedral. \\"The theses reflected the theological approach of Gordon Wilson for whom Christ’s victory of love over violence on the cross was a fundamental principle\\".http://anglicanpeacemaker.org.uk/wp- content/uploads/2015/09/19-TAP-Sept-2008.pdf This action deliberately echoed Martin Luther's famous nailing of The Ninety-Five Theses to the church door in Wittenberg. Much time is also spent lobbying bishops and politicians and promoting the pacifist viewpoint in public forum debates and on representational committees. Prayer In 1974, APF founded the Week of Prayer for World Peace, and continue to have close ties with it, now that it has expanded to become an inter-religious event.http://nfpb.gn.apc.org/Prayer/ White poppies APF is also heavily involved in the Greenbelt Festival and White Poppy sales for protesting Remembrance Day, which APF members feel has become too much a celebration of the military. Support for conscientious objectors Songwriter Sue Gilmurray, an APF member, is heavily involved in commemorations surrounding International Conscientious Objectors Day, held annually on May 15 at Tavistock Square in London,http://www.rrk.freeuk.com/ Gilmurray is one of a number of APF members who showed support for the Baptist peace activist and human shield, Norman Kember. Faslane protests Gilmurray is also prominent in protests against the Faslane Naval Base, at which Trident Nuclear Weapons are situated.http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio2/musicclub/doc_power.shtml Opposition to the arms trade Several prominent APF members, such as Gilmurray and scientist Dr Tony Kempster are also involved in the secular Movement for the Abolition of War. Kempster has been a strident opponent of the weapons manufacturer, BAE. Indeed, BAE considered Kempster such a threat that it infiltrated MAW and stole a membership database. Legal action against the arms manufacturer was pursued. Child soldiers In 2009, the Fellowship supported Red Hand Day, to raise awareness of the plight of child soldiers in African conflicts.http://anglicanpeacemaker.org.uk/peacemaker- posts/http://www.redhandday.org/ Peace education APF also supports peace museums with Clive Barrett being particularly involved in this type of education and awareness campaigning.http://anglicanpeacemaker.org.uk/wp- content/uploads/2015/08/o-where-shall-peace-be-found.pdf APF also sponsors the Peace and Faith project at the Peace Museum in Bradford.https://www.churchtimes.co.uk/articles/2017/22-december/features/interviews/interview- sue-claydon-anglican-pacifist-fellowship-chair Elnora Ferguson also lead peace education in the British education system. The Fellowship focuses very much on the promotion of Peace Studies in British schools to counter attempts by the military to recruit English school students.http://anglicanpeacemaker.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/o-where- shall-peace-be-found.pdf APF promotes the use of Peace Education Network materials in school assemblies.https://www.churchtimes.co.uk/articles/2017/22-december/features/interviews/interview- sue-claydon-anglican-pacifist-fellowship-chair In 2017, APF created a new travelling exhibition for British cathedrals, “Faith and Peace”, looking at the three Abrahamic faiths, using textiles created by women in Bradford.https://www.churchtimes.co.uk/articles/2017/22-december/features/interviews/interview- sue-claydon-anglican-pacifist-fellowship-chair Publication To further peace education, the organisation also published The Anglican Peacemaker on a quarterly basis.https://www.churchtimes.co.uk/articles/2017/22-december/features/interviews/interview- sue-claydon-anglican-pacifist-fellowship-chair Peace award APF also helps to facilitate individuals to take action for peace.https://www.churchtimes.co.uk/articles/2017/22-december/features/interviews/interview- sue-claydon-anglican-pacifist-fellowship-chair It sponsors the Wilson/Hinkes Peace Award for grass-roots peacemaking.https://www.churchtimes.co.uk/articles/2017/22-december/features/interviews/interview- sue-claydon-anglican-pacifist-fellowship-chair = New Zealand = APF branches exist in all British Commonwealth countries but the Fellowship is particularly prominent in New Zealand. The New Zealand Chapter was initially established in Christchurch in 1948.http://www.converge.org.nz/pma/apf/apfmay07.pdf The New Zealand Chapter has its own website and newsletterhttp://www.converge.org.nz/pma/apf/ and count a number of local bishops amongst its membership. The prominence of the New Zealand branch was helped significantly by Sidney Hinkes' pilgrimages to that country during the branch's formative stages.http://www.churchtimes.co.uk/content.asp?id=14957 The New Zealand Chapter was headed by an Anglo-Catholic, Professor Margaret Bedggood, and Chris Barfoot throughout 2008.http://www.converge.org.nz/pma/apf/contact.htm The previous head of the Chapter in this country had been Roger Baker. As of 2018, the head of the New Zealand chapter was Jonathan Harfield.https://www.anglicanpeacemaker.org.uk/peacemaker-post/father-said- jesus-forgive-dont-know-theyre-luke-23-34/ Bedggood, an Anglo-Catholic Franciscan Professor of Law and was the Chief Commissioner of the New Zealand Human Rights Commission, a member of Amnesty International and a member of the New Zealand Film and Literature Review Board. The current Chair of the New Zealand Chapter is Dr Jonathan Hartfield.http://www.converge.org.nz/pma/apf/apfjan09.pdf The New Zealand Chapter supports the Aotearoa New Zealand Campaign to Stop Killer Robots, the Global Day of Action on Military Spending and iCAN Aotearoa New Zealand (International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons).http://www.converge.org.nz/pma/apf/link.htm = Australia =  Anglo-Catholics and liberals  In contrast to New Zealand, APF has a much more low-key presence in Australia. The most notable member of the organisation in this country was Margaret Holmes, a lifelong peace activist, prominent in many anti-war organisations, notably the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom. She was a member of the congregation at the Anglo-Catholic parish of Saint Luke's in Mosman.https://www.smh.com.au/national/powerful-voice-for-peace-and- freedom-20091002-ggg6.html Author Michelle Cavanagh published a readily- available biography of Holmes in 2006.http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/3638376 Holmes died on September 10, 2009, at the age of 100.http://www.smh.com.au/national/obituaries/powerful- voice-for-peace-and-freedom-20091002-ggg6.html For many years, the secretary of APF in Australia was an English-born Anglo-Catholic clergyman, David Thawley (sometime Dean of Wangaratta), a Second World War conscientious objector who was proactive in promoting the organisation and working on various committees within the Church and alongside secular anti-war organisations. He passed away in 2010.http://www.peacecourier.com/terrorism.htm According to his obituary, he graduated from school in World War Two and \\"registered as a conscientious objector, although as an ordinand he was not bound to register - but felt morally obliged to do so.

He became interested in Christian pacifism in the 1990s. He initially organised fundraisers for African refugees and was involved in some low-key anti-military protest activities. At university, David Le Sage undertook post- graduate academic research on the pacifist ideology of various 1930s writers.http://www.research.utas.edu.au/warp/reports/individual.htm A published author, from January 2009 he led peace education in a teaching role at a private Christian school in Brisbane. He later worked as a technical writer for one of the world's leading software companies for many years. David Le Sage had an affinity for the pacifist strain of conservative Calvinist thinking exemplified by André Trocmé and Jean Lasserre. He had a deep interest in various other Calvinist and Lutheran pacifist thinkers, too. He also studied the writing of the British conservative evangelical anti-military thinker, Nick Megoran, author of Warlike Christians in an Age of Violence and the Early Church's pacifist writings. David Le Sage was an opponent of the extremely liberal/progressive theology promoted by the Anglican Diocese of Brisbane. He was staunchly opposed to homosexual- and women pastors for theological reasons. He was a conservative Christian antifeminist and believed in traditional gender roles for women. He later attended a Lutheran church in Brisbane. After working for a Christian charity for a brief time, David Le Sage became a successful freelance editor. Another leading member of the APF with a background in the evangelical/low church Anglican Diocese of Tasmania is Nathanael Reuss, who served as the worldwide chairman of APF from 2012 until the end of 2017.https://www.anglicanpeacemaker.org.uk/apf-80th- anniversary-day-new-chair/https://www.anglicanpeacemaker.org.uk/peacemaker- post/a-drowned-out-truth/ Born in rural Victoria, he grew up in an Anglo- Catholic household before becoming an evangelical/low church Anglican. Unlike David Le Sage who was a traditional conservative Calvinistic Protestant, Nathanael Reuss has Pentecostal/charismatic leaningshttps://revnatreuss.blogspot.com/search?q=Charismatic Training as a scientist before becoming a clergyman,http://revnatreuss.blogspot.com/2018/06/srchttpsgiphy.html?spref=fb&m;=1 Reuss worked for a long time in Tasmania as an assistant priest at the evangelical parish of Saint John's in Launceston and also performed duties as a hospital chaplain in that city.http://www.stjohnsac.net.au/index.php/clergy- of-st-johns-church/ He then undertook postgraduate studies in Nottingham.

The Fellowship is a member body of the Peace Education Network, Network of Christian Peace Organisations, War Resisters International and of the International Peace Bureau. Indeed, Roberta Bacic, a survivor of the Pinochet regime in Chile and President of WRI, has worked closely with Fellowship membershttp://anglicanpeacemaker.org.uk/wp- content/uploads/2015/09/79-Anniversary-edition.pdf and written for the APF newsletter. APF closely with Christian Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, and has applied to join the Community of the Cross of Nails at Coventry.https://www.churchtimes.co.uk/articles/2017/22-december/features/interviews/interview- sue-claydon-anglican-pacifist-fellowship-chair APF also works with Roman Catholic peace organisation, Pax Christi.  APF publications and resources  The Fellowship publishes a newsletter, The Anglican Peacemaker, which is available onlineThe Anglican Peacemaker or via mail subscription. Each newsletter explores a specific theme or current event and also contains a page depicting art, song lyrics and poetry that promote a culture of peace. Book and film reviews are also featured. The newsletter explores pragmatic, constructive ways of building peace as well as exploring the Christian spiritual foundations of pacifism. It frequently critiques the actions of the military and arms manufacturers in many parts of the world whilst exploring the reasons why the military still has such influence in society. The role of the media, environment, politics and capitalism are explored whilst ways of educating people about the immorality of military life are also discussed. Promotion of proactive peace-making and analysis of the causes of war and attraction of the military are key aims of the newsletter. APF also publishes a range of leaflets on a variety of topics, from traditional Anglican pacifist tracts and an explanation of the Church's teachings on pacifism, through to articles discussing pragmatic pacifist responses to the problem of Hitler and alternatives to warfare. Pamphlets analyse the Bible in detail, with particular reference to the Sermon on the Mount and the teachings and actions of Jesus Christ to show pacifism as the most Christian response to warfare, such as how Jesus, through disarming Saint Peter in the Garden of Gethsemane, thereby \\"disarms every soldier\\". They also depict the pacifist attitude of believers in the Early Church, prior to Christianity's acceptance by Constantine.http://www.catholicpeacefellowship.org/nextpage.asp?m=2479 Many of these educational pamphlets were written by Derek Savage, a prominent British poet, APF member and Second World War conscientious objector. One of Savage's tracts, Pacifism, Church and State, discusses one of the unique problems facing the Anglican Communion. As a State Church in England, the Anglican Church is often seen as part of \\"The Establishment\\" and, thus, critiquing Government policy and fully realizing the subversive, radical politics and social message at the heart of Jesus' Gospel can be difficult. The Church can thus be criticised for excessive compliance to the Government and not living up to Christ's ideals as expressed in the Sermon on the Mount, in which he criticises the power structures of this world, including the dominant military and economic force of His own time, the Roman Empire. A topic often discussed amongst pacifists is that of how best they could respond to the emergence of Hitler, using non-violent means. Most APF members feel that the problem of Hitler could only have been settled earlier peacefully prior to 1939, via a more just and equitable Treaty of Versailles and more work to promote a stable economic and political situation in the Weimar Republic, as related in the pamphlet What to Do About Hitler: A Pacifist Symposium, published in 1989. The pamphlet also notes that whilst the Jews suffered horrific persecution under the Nazis during the 1930s, the Final Solution could only occur under the cloud of wartime activity. Those who argue against fighting Hitler also note that the bombing of Dresden, Hiroshima and Nagasaki meant that the Allies sunk to the level of their opponents, whilst a campaign of non-violent resistance to any Nazi regime may have been more effective as such an overstretched empire would not be sustainable in the long run. The pamphlet argues that if Germany had been treated with greater dignity and been helped to recover more quickly after the 1918 defeat, the conditions that led Hitler to rise to power would not have occurred. Hence the Fellowship aims to work proactively in the world to determine and eliminate causes of warfare before conflict becomes inevitable. Other notable tracts include: *Why I am Not a Pacifist: A Pacifist's Reply, which addresses some of the key theological and pragmatic questions often asked by people hesitant to embrace pacifism; *Article XXXVII and War, which discusses the contentious Article and its bearing on modern Anglican pacifism; *Against the Stream,http://www.c3.hu/~bocs/jager-a.htm about the life of the German Roman Catholic conscientious objector Franz Jägerstätter, who was executed for refusing to serve in the Nazi army;http://justus.anglican.org/resources/bio/224.html *The Church and War, a classic 1940 tract by Evelyn Underhillhttp://disseminary.org/hoopoe/pubs/underhill.html Combined, these texts explore many of the issues surrounding a pacifism and intellectually engage the spiritual and pragmatic consequences of the ideology. In 2000, the Fellowship released a compact disc of music, entitled Finest Hour, featuring music composed by Gilmurray, the renowned Anglican hymn writer Christopher Idle and John Bell of the Iona Community. The songs on the album promote pacifism and Christian fellowship by critiquing a number of issues and themes relating to war, arms manufacturing, American imperialism and corporate capitalism.http://www.crossrhythms.co.uk/artists/Sue_Gilmurray/10892/ A second recording by Gilmurray, The Way of Peace, was released in 2006 to recognise the United Nations' Decade for the Promotion of a Culture of Peace and Non- Violence for the Children of the World. It was accompanied by a Lenten study book that contains poetry and passages of scripture. This album featured songs critiquing social issues such as the use of child soldiers in African combat zones and the depictions of violence in films and other media products marketed towards children.

During his career, his work was published in many American magazines, including Esquire Magazine, New York Magazine, Travel + Leisure, Seventeen, Time, Newsweek, Harper's Bazaar, McCall's Magazine and Woman's Day. He also provided covers for books, record albums, and international magazines (sometimes with himself as his model). Life and work Born in Chicago in 1920, his family moved to Los Angeles when he was twelve. He attended the Chouinard Art Institute alternating his education at the University of California. Serving in the US Army Air Force during World War II, Wynn learned how to take pictures and run a photo lab and, back in Los Angeles after the war, he attended the Art Center School: while still a student, there he won the Condé Nast Photo Contest. Wynn moved to New York in 1947 and got his editorial start at Seventeen, where he quickly became successful shooting fashion. He went on to shoot major accounts for top advertising agencies including Revlon (with Kay Daly ) and memorable campaigns for clients as diverse as International Paper, Van Raalte and Maidenform (the famous \\"I dreamed I was... in my Maidenform bra\\" ), and Ford cars, while continuing his photojournalist work covering events such as Le Mans auto racing . Wynn's portraiture and photo essays included entertainers (Jimmy Durante, Dolly Parton), artists (Salvador Dalí) musicians (Duke Ellington, Luciano Pavarotti, Louis Armstrong), television personalities (Carol Burnett, Sid Caesar), movie stars (Robert De Niro, Katharine Hepburn, Dustin Hoffman, Al Pacino), film directors, (Alfred Hitchcock, Billy Wilder, Frank Capra, François Truffaut), fashion models (Suzy Parker and Jane Fonda in the early days of her career) and such national figures as President and Mrs. Lyndon Johnson, Rose Kennedy, Norman Mailer, Gloria Steinem and the very young Bill Gates (for a Newsweek cover). With Malcolm Forbes, Wynn traveled the world photographing their trip in the Forbes private plane. Wynn was a long-standing member of ASMP (American Society of Media Photographers). His photography was recognized with numerous awards from The New York Art Directors Club, Communication Arts and the American Institute of Graphic Arts, and in 1976 his photographs were included in The Family of Man photography exhibit at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. Dan Wynn's photography has been acquired by the National Portrait Gallery for their permanent collection and has been seen in New York City at the Bonni BenRubi Gallery among others, and the Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology. Wynn's editorial spreads of beautiful people and places in international cities, pubs, vineyards, and restaurants brought him into contact with food writer James Beard. He first photographed Beard in 1963, and remained Beard's semi-official photographer until the latter's death, providing photographs for book covers, Beard's various articles, recipes and food columns. In the process, he became one of America's most renowned food photographers. Dan Wynn died in 1995 at age 75. Peter Kump, the Founder of the James Beard Foundation, dedicated an obituary to Wynn in the Foundation's newsletter on April 1995, and pledged his commitment to keeping Wynn's photography as a part of the foundation's heritage.

It is one of thirteen government protected wildlife sanctuaries, one of two breeding grounds for pelicans in the country.Trinidad and Tobago Natural History , Smithsonian Latino Center, Accessed 6 July 2008. Characteristics The island's highest point is 106 metres and its area is approximately 100,000 m2. Its geology comprises several jagged cliffs rising to a high elevation given the island's small size. Its flora comprises deciduous forest, scrub and coarse grass. Wildlife sanctuary The island was proclaimed a wildlife sanctuary in 1935 by the Trinidad and Tobago Government, granting it full legal protection by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry Division. Its notable wildlife is the Pelecanus occidentalis (brown pelican) which breed on the island, the only breeding place for the species in the country. Other important species on the island include the chestnut- collared swift and rufous-necked wood-rail, both of which are rare in the country. There are estimated to be at least 27 species of birds on the island.

The county's river network is formed primarily by small rivers that flow to the northeast and north from the mountains that line the county's southwestern border toward the Yellow River (i.e., these days, the Liujiaxia Reservoir) near the northern end of the county. The largest of these rivers is the Daxia River (), which flows from the Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture to cross Linxia County. The river's lower course forms the border between Linxia County and the neighboring Dongxiang Autonomous County to the east. It forms a large bay at its outfall into the Liujiaxia Reservoir. A new temple near the Liujiaxia Reservoir The county surrounds the prefecture seat, Linxia City, from the north, south, and west, but does not include it, since Linxia City forms a county-level administrative unit of its own.

Administrative divisions As of 2004, the county was divided into 25 towns or townships. Population A village temple in Hexi Town According to the county government, the county's population totaled 375,162 in 2007. The main ethnic groups represented were Han Chinese (221,419 or 59.2% of the total), Hui (121,680 or 32.4%) and Dongxiang (29,782 or 8%). There were also 872 Salar people, 840 Tibetans, 311 Tujia people, 256 Bao'an people, 2 Mongols and 1 Uighur. The authorities reported that as of 2004, there were 592 places of worship in the county, with 506 clerics of all religions. 267,731 residents (71.62% of the county's population) were reported as religious believers. Of them, the 117,610 reported Muslims had 409 religious facilities (including, 405 mosques) and 445 clerics. The 52,570 Buddhists, with 59 temples, had 49 religious personnel: 31 monks, 15 lamas and 3 living Buddhas. The 97,551 Taoists had 124 temples and 12 clerics. According to the county's official statistics, there were also 138 Christians there, with no churches. Transport At the Lianhua Tai ferry dock (Lianhua Town) The county is served by China National Highway 213 (G213), which crosses the county on its way from Lanzhou to southern Gansu, and by a number of provincial highways. Due to the terrain and the remote location, there are no railways, sea ports or civil airports in the county; however, there is an active wharf at Lianhua Tai, on the Liujiaxia Reservoir, which also serves as the port for Linxia City. It is used both by vehicle ferries that provide a more convenient route for travel between Linxia (City or County) and Liujiaxia Town (Yongjing County) than Highway G213 does, and by recreational boaters. One can also hire a boat there to travel to Bingling Temple in Yongjing County. Due to the county's geography, the main hub of its road network, as well as of public transportation, is actually not within the county itself, but in Linxia City. Minibuses provide passenger service from the city's Eastern Bus Station to Linxia County seat (Hanji Town), Hexi Township, Lianhua Town, and a few other destinations. History Farmers harvesting Sichuan pepper in the lower Daxia River valley. The hills in the background, on the other side of the river, are in Dongxiang County During the Ming and Qing Dynasties, the Linxia region was known as Hezhou, and usually was administered as part of Lintao Prefecture (Fu) or Lanzhou Prefecture. Lanzhou Prefecture was abolished in 1913, and the Linxia area was included into Daohe County () with the capital in Jiachengguan Town () (part of today's Linxia City), which in its turn was part of Lanshan Circuit (Dao). In 1928, Daohe County was renamed Linxia County, thus giving origin to its modern name. After a few more administrative reorganizations during the Republic of China administration, the Linxia region was eventually taken by the Communists during the Lanzhou Campaign (August 22, 1949), and on August 26 the Linxia County of the new Communist state was created, with the capital in Linxia City. On June 23, 1950, Linxia City was separated from Linxia County, and the county seat was moved to Hanji Town. In December 1958 Linxia County was abolished and merged into Linxia City, as was the neighboring Yongjing County, but the counties were restored in December 1961. In December 1973, the opposite thing happened: Linxia City was merged into Linxia County, but on August 31, 1983, this merger was undone again.

Its traditional capital is Prenzlau. Geography The region is named after the Uecker River, which is a tributary of the Oder; the name Uckermark means \\"March of the Uecker\\". The river's source is close to Angermünde, from where it runs northward to Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. The Oder River, forming the German-Polish border, bounds the region in the east. The western parts of the Lower Oder Valley National Park are located in the Uckermark. View of the Uecker Valley in the Uckermark History = Early history = Pechberg Bronze Age Megalith tomb near Vossberg In the Ice Age, glaciers shaped the landscape of the region. A climate change left a hilly area with several lakes formed by the melting ice, and humans started to settle the area. Megalithic-cultures arose, followed by Germanic cultures. = Ukrani, a Polabian tribe = Burgwallinsel Ukrani burgh isle in Lake Oberuckersee From the 6th-12th centuries Polabian Slavs migrating from Eastern Europe moved westward into the later Uckermark. The Slavs settling the terra U(c)kera (Uckerland, later Uckermark) became known as Ukrani (Ukranen, Ukrer, Ukri, Vukraner).Materna, p. 29 Their settlement area was centered around the lakes Oberuckersee and Unteruckersee at the spring of the Uecker River. In this region, burghs with a proto-town suburbium were set up at Drense and on an isle in Lake Oberuckersee (near modern Prenzlau). In 954, Margrave Gero of the Saxon Eastern March (the marca Geronis), aided by Holy Roman Emperor Otto I's son-in-law, Conrad of Lorraine, launched a successful campaign to subdue the Ukrani, who had come in reach of the Empire after the 929 Battle of Lenzen. After the 983 revolt of the Obodrites and Liutizians, the area became independent again, yet remained under permanent military pressure, especially from Poland and the Holy Roman Empire. View of the Uecker Valley in the Uckermark = Pomerania, Ostsiedlung = In 1172 Pomeranian dukes, vassals of the Duchy of Saxony, later of the Holy Roman Empire, controlled the area. In the course of the medieval Ostsiedlung, the Ukrani were Christianized and Germanized by Saxons, who founded monasteries, castles, and towns; the Slavic heritage is reflected in the many regional towns whose names end with \\"-ow\\" and \\"-in\\". The early centers of the territory were the Seehausen (Gramzow) Premonstratensian monastery and the city of Prenzlau, developed and granted German town law by Barnim I, Duke of Pomerania, in 1234. Both the central city and the central monastery were set up beside the former Ukrani central burghs. = Pomerania and Brandenburg struggle for overlordship = The Margraviate of Brandenburg, holding claims on the Duchy of Pomerania, expanded north since the 1230s, taking her chances while the House of Pomerania was weakened. In the 1250 Treaty of Landin, Barnim I conceded the Uckermark to John I and Otto III, Ascanian Margraves of Brandenburg. After the extinction of the Ascanians, the Pomeranian dukes reacquired a few border regions. Mecklenburg advanced into the Uckermark, but lost her gains in a 1323 war with Brandenburg. In the Pomeranian-Brandenburg War from 1329-33, Pomerania was able to defeat Brandenburg at Kremmer Damm. In the following years, control of the Uckermark was disputed by Brandenburg, Mecklenburg, and Pomerania. = Brandenburg = The first Peace of Prenzlau of 3 May 1448 established Brandenburg's control over most of the territory, except for the northern Pasewalk and Torgelow region, which was to remain in Pomerania and is not considered to be a part of Uckermark anymore. Though another Brandenburgian-Pomeranian war was fought in the area in the 1460s, Brandenburg's possession of most of the Uckermark was confirmed again in a second Peace of Prenzlau on 30 July 1472, which was renewed on 26 June 1479. = Prussia, and Huguenot settlement = The Uckermark became part of Brandenburg-Prussia in 1618, but was ravaged during the Thirty Years' War. Frederick William, the Great Elector, invited large numbers of French Huguenots to resettle the Uckermark and his other territories by announcing the Edict of Potsdam. These Huguenots helped to develop the economy and culture of the Uckermark. In 1701 the territory became part of the Kingdom of Prussia. In 1815 after the Napoleonic Wars, the Uckermark became part of the Prussian Province of Brandenburg. Previously divided into the administrative units Uckerkreis and Stolpirischer Kreis, in 1817 a third district was created in the area, the district Angermünde, and the other two districts were renamed to Prenzlau and Templin. = Post-World War II = The Uckermark was a battleground during World War II, with many of its towns being severely damaged. As part of East Germany after the war, the Uckermark was divided between Bezirk Neubrandenburg and Bezirk Frankfurt (Oder). With German reunification in 1990, most of the Uckermark voted to become part of the restored state of Brandenburg, with the exception of the small Strasburg region becoming part of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.

Her only known son, Andronikos II of Trebizond, preceded his half-siblings George, Emperor of Trebizond, John II of Trebizond and Theodora of Trebizond on the throne. For this reason Andronikos is considered to have been their elder.Kelsey Jackson Williams, \\"A Genealogy of the Grand Komnenoi of Trebizond,\\" Foundations, 2 (2006), pp. 174f Manuel had at least two daughters whose mother is not mentioned.

Kuršanskis believes that the Trapezuntine embassy Manuel sent to King Louis IX of France in 1253, asking to marry a daughter of his house, provides a terminus post quem for the death of Anna Xylaloe.

Belknap to protect the Texas frontier against raids by the Kiowa and Comanche. It was the northernmost fort in a line from the Rio Grande to the Red River. The fort functioned as a base of operations rather than as a fortified point, and it became the center of a substantial network of roads, including the Butterfield Overland Mail. The fort was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1960, in recognition of its key role in securing the Texas frontier in the 1850s and 1860s. Other forts in the frontier fort system were Forts Griffin, Concho, Richardson, Chadbourne, Stockton, Davis, Bliss, McKavett, Clark, McIntosh, Inge, and Phantom Hill in Texas, and Sill in Oklahoma.Carter, R.G., On the Border with Mackenzie, 1935, Washington D.C.: Enyon Printing Co., p. 48 Subposts or intermediate stations also were used, including Bothwick's Station on Salt Creek between Fort Richardson and Fort Belknap, Camp Wichita near Buffalo Springs between Fort Richardson and Red River Station, and Mountain Pass between Fort Concho and Fort Griffin. Some notable officers who were stationed at Fort Belknap include Captain Randolph B. Marcy and Lieutenant George B. McClellan. Together, the officers explored the Canadian River and found the headwaters of the Red River. The Second Cavalry was headquartered here in 1858. Prior to the outbreak of the American Civil War, the post was abandoned, partly as a pullback of federal troops to the north, and partly due to the fort's unreliable water supply. \\"Northern indians fell upon the hapless Texas frontier with such violence that a whole tier of frontier counties was disbanded...\\"Neighbours, K.F., 1975, Robert Neighbors and the Texas Frontier, 1836-1859, Waco: Texian Press Families remaining in Young County \\"huddled in the abandoned buildings of Fort Belknap\\" and \\"during snow storms sought shelter in the abandoned buildings.\\" The fort was briefly reoccupied in 1867, then abandoned for the last time.

In 1970 he left Israel to attend the University of Florence. After graduation he served as a lecturer of architecture and structural engineering at the same university. Career Fisher launched Fiteco Ltd. in New York during the mid-1980s while also becoming involved in the development and building of hotels. He designed pre- assembled bathrooms for luxury homes and hotels. =Failures and frauds= Between November 1995 and February 1997, Fisher was an honorary vice consul of Italy in Beersheba, Israel. According to the testimony before the Senate by Undersecretary of State of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Rino Serri, the scope of Fisher's activities was limited, due to the small size of the Italian community resident in the consular disctrict, and his appointment was terminated following investigations into his businesses by both Israeli and Italian law enforcement. During this time, Fisher was sole director of a construction firm misrepresented as being led by Alan Katz. The firm went bankrupt in 1998. In November 2008, based on an affidavit from Katz and documents obtained from various tax havens around the world describing Fisher's assets, Fisher was tried before the Italian court for the embezzlement of 70 billion Italian lira (35 million euros) and was sentenced to three years in prison. According to Kalmanson & Co., the liquidator's attorney, this represents one of the largest cases of corporate fraud in the history of Israel, and David Fisher still owes his creditors more than US$100 million. In 2008 in New York City, Fisher distributed a biography which said he received an honorary doctorate from \\"The Prodeo Institute at Columbia University in New York\\". No such institution exists, however, and Columbia said it had never awarded Fisher an honorary degree.

These temperatures cause the flash to become stiff or brittle and to break away cleanly. Cryogenic deflashing is the preferred process when removing excess material from oddly shaped, custom molded products. Process Parts are loaded into a parts basket. A cryogen, such as liquid nitrogen, is used to cool the workpieces; once cooled they are tumbled and blasted with media pellets, ranging size from . In some instances, cryogenic deflashing does not utilize a blasting action, relying instead only on the tumbling of the parts to remove flash on the outer edges. Advantages Cryogenic deflashing provides various advantages over manual deflashing and other traditional deflashing methods. * The process maintains part integrity and critical tolerances. * Since it is a batch process, the price per piece is far less as many more parts can be processed in a given amount of time. * Cryogenic deflashing extends mold life. Rather than replace or repair a mold (which typically involves downtime and high cost), the parts can be deflashed. This is typical of parts molded at the end of their product lifetime. * The process is computer controlled, therefore removing the human operator variable from the process. * The process offers consistent results from lot to lot. * Cryogenic deflashing is non-abrasive. * The cost per part is generally well below any alternative technique. Applications A wide range of molded materials can utilize cryogenic deflashing with proven results. These include: * Silicones * Plastics – (both thermoset & thermoplastic) * Rubbers – (including neoprene & urethane) * Liquid crystal polymer (LCP) * Glass-filled nylons * Aluminum zinc die cast Examples of applications that use cryogenic deflashing include: * O-rings & gaskets * Catheters and other in-vitro medical * Insulators and other electric / electronic * Valve stems, washers and fittings * Tubes and flexible boots * Face masks & goggles Today, many molding operations are using cryogenic deflashing instead of rebuilding or repairing molds on products that are approaching their end-of-life. It is often more prudent and economical to add a few cents of production cost for a part than invest in a new molding tool that can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars and has a limited service life due to declining production forecasts. In other cases, cryogenic deflashing has proven to be an enabling technology, permitting the economical manufacture of high quality, high precision parts fabricated with cutting edge materials and compounds.

Taken together, a low salt diet (median of approximately 4.4 g/day – approx 1800 mg sodium) in hypertensive people resulted in a decrease in systolic blood pressure by 4.2 mmHg, and in diastolic blood pressure by 2.1 mmHg. Advising people to eat a low salt diet, however, is of unclear effect in either hypertensive or normal tensive people.

The most common form of sodium is sodium chloride, which is table salt. Milk, beets, and celery also naturally contain sodium, as does drinking water, although the amount varies depending on the source. Sodium is also added to various food products. Some of these added forms are monosodium glutamate, sodium nitrite, sodium saccharin, baking soda (sodium bicarbonate), and sodium benzoate. Because large amounts of salts are given out by regenerative water softeners, over 60 cities in Southern California have banned them because of elevated salt levels in ground water reclamation projects.

The Western Idaho Fair is the one of the annual state fairs of Idaho. It has been held in the capital city of Boise virtually every late summer/early fall since 1897, and annually in the contiguous city of Garden City on the grounds of the Expo Idaho since 1967. It is usually held from the third Friday of August, until the fourth Sunday of August. The corresponding Eastern Idaho Fair is held in Blackfoot, Idaho. History Western Idaho Fair's historical precursor was the Idaho Intermountain Fair, first held in 1897. As with many fairs of its era it was primarily an agricultural and livestock exhibition; sheep, cattle, horses and hogs were shipped to Boise from all over the West for the event.Hart 10 - Hart, Arthur A.

From 1913 to 1935, for example, the fair changed names five times, and wasn't even held in eight of those twenty- two years. In 1936 Ada County Commissioners appointed a Fair Board to organize a new Western Idaho State Fair.

Cullen was heavily involved in the petroleum industry having struck oil near Texas in 1928. He was a large supporter of the University of Houston and longtime chairman of the board of regents for the university. He is considered one of the most important figures in Texas during the \\"oil boom\\" era. Biography =Early life= Cullen grew up in San Antonio with his mother and siblings; his father had abandoned the family when Roy was only four years old. A misguided kidnapping attempt by his father a couple of years later brought Roy closer to his mother, who was shaken by the event. Roy lived out his childhood in poverty, even resorting to dropping out of school in the fifth grade to work at a candy factory to help his mother pay the bills. At sixteen years of age, he made for Dallas, where he attempted to make amends with his ailing father. After this proved a failure, he attempted to join the army, recruiting young men to fight in the Spanish–American War. Roy was rejected after his father blew the whistle on Roy's age, too young to fight. Still seeking a path in life, Roy moved with his half-sister and her husband to Schulenburg, Texas, where he found a job in a cotton-trading office. At eighteen, he became a cotton buyer, a position that had him buying cotton from farmers so that the company, Ralli Brothers, could resell it at a profit. He eventually took a job with a Houston firm and was dispatched to Mangum, Oklahoma, where his recovering father then lived. After marrying Lillie Cranz, his girlfriend of five years, he continued working as an independent cotton broker, but he searched for a new venture after he lost his savings in the Panic of 1907. He discovered that Houston was seeking much shipping business and Roy figured the city was ripe for opportunity. He relocated his family there in 1911 and focused his efforts on learning the business of real estate. After four years of poor results, however, Roy was again down on his luck. =Career= In 1915, Roy met Jim Cheek, a successful Houston real estate developer whose office was nearby Roy's. Cheek divulged to Roy his plan to enter the risky, but booming, oil industry. Neither man had any prior experience with oil, but they decided to pursue the venture. Roy worked for and traveled with Cheek for the next five years, buying leases on land in Central and West Texas, 43 in total. With investors' $250,000, they had three oil rigs built, but all three were dry. Back in Houston, Lillie would complain to Roy that he traveled too much and didn't spend enough time with his family. In an effort to move his venture closer to home, Roy decided to search for oil on his own and closer to Houston. In the early days of oil exploration, creekology was the common method of finding drilling sites, a method involving looking for certain geological surface features that could indicate an oil field. Usually, a salt dome would be a hopeful sign of oil. Roy knew of one that he felt was promising, and it lay in the old Pierce Junction oil field inside the Houston city limits. He wouldn't drill near the center as the previous drillers had, however; Roy had a hunch that the outskirts of the salt dome, where it dipped in the ground, was where oil could be found. He mustered up $40,000 in investment with the help of Judge R. E. Brooks and together with $20,000 of his own savings, Roy bought a lease on the land from Gulf Oil. He hired Judge Brooks' son Emory to do the drilling job and after some delays, drilling began in the spot that Roy had picked out. It ended up being a \\"gusher\\" and was producing 2,500 barrels of oil a day. Roy's investors were impressed and most decided to fund other drill sites. The three other sites drilled came up dry, but the investors still made 300% returns on the initial gusher. After several failed oil wells, Roy reevaluated how drilling was being done; he realized that oil wasn't being drilled for farther than 4,000 below the surface, beyond which were oil-rich sands. He decided to go to his investors with a plan to reach these sands, known as the Frio sands. He would drill deeper into the ground, despite technical issues and the higher cost, in order to reach the large oil deposits. The investors took the chance, and the result was the second Pierce Junction gusher, giving Roy his confidence again and establishing him as a respectable oilman. One of Roy's original investors, Jim West, a highly successful Texas lumberman, approached him with an offer to partner with Roy to run West's Western Production Company. West laid $3,000,000 on the table and promised Roy the title of President and complete charge of the company if he accepted. After a week of ignoring West's offer, Roy declined it, but proffered a new arrangement: Roy would put up $5,000 and West would match it. Upon being asked why that offer was better than $3,000,000 up front, Roy said that with his arrangement, he wouldn't be working for West. The partners squabbled over where to drill their acres for oil. One such salt dome, the Blue Ridge dome, had been previously drilled by West, but Roy insisted on drilling its flanks. The resulting well brought in 60,000 barrels of oil a day. Roy had similar fortunes drilling the perimeter of the old Humble Field, championing a troublesome layer of shale rock 3,500 feet below the surface, eventually reaching oil-rich Yegua sand. Also at this site, Roy displayed his characteristic approach to his job in that he led by example instead of from a distance; he led the wrangling of an errant pipe to the admiration of the crew. He enjoyed the success of his business into his fifties. =Zoning activist= In 1948, Cullen led the effort to prevent new zoning regulation for land development in the city of Houston. This was in response to a group of zoning advocates led by Jesse H. Jones, financier and owner of the Houston Chronicle. Cullen believed zoning regulations to be socialist and un-American. Two more attempts to introduce zoning regulations to the city of Houston failed in 1962 and 1993. =Personal life and philanthropy= Cullen married Lillie Cranz in 1902 and had five children: Roy Gustav, Lillie, Agnes, Margaret, and Wilhelmina. In 1938, the Cullens made a contribution to build the Roy Gustav Cullen Building on the new campus of the University of Houston. He would continue to make large donations to the university throughout his lifetime. The Cullen Foundation is still a large contributor to the school. Cullen had been in his early life a Democrat, but supported Herbert Hoover and other Republicans after 1929, due to the belief that the Democratic Party was, at the national level, the party of machine politics and socialism, labelling FDR's policies the 'Jew Deal'. Additionally, he was critical of fellow Houston leader Jesse H. Jones. He was also at one point a supporter of the Dixiecrat movement: \\"Although Cullen aided the Dixiecrat movement in 1948, he normally supported Republican candidates, particularly Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1952.\\" \\\\- Handbook of Texas Online In 1946, he donated the land that later became Texas Southern University. In 1947, the Cullens created the Cullen Foundation. In late 1954, less than three years before his death, Cullen's fortune was estimated to be $200–300 million. Cullen is the grandfather of coal magnate Corbin Robertson, Jr. See also * Cullen College of Engineering * Cullen Center * The Lillie and Hugh Roy Cullen Sculpture Garden * Hugh Roy and Lillie Cullen Building References Further reading * * External links * * The Cullen Foundation * 1947 Time article regarding Cullen * 1951 Time article regarding Cullen * 1953 Time article regarding Cullen Category:American businesspeople in the oil industry Category:American energy industry businesspeople Category:American philanthropists Category:Businesspeople from San Antonio Category:1881 births Category:1957 deaths Category:Texas Oil Boom people Category:Texas Dixiecrats Category:Texas Democrats Category:People from Denton County, Texas Category:Businesspeople from Houston Category:People from Mangum, Oklahoma Category:University of Houston System regents Category:Old Right (United States) Category:20th-century philanthropists ","title":"Hugh Roy Cullen"},{"id":"18132323","text":"The following highways are numbered 690: Canada *31px Alberta Highway 690 *31px New Brunswick Route 690 *Saskatchewan Highway 690 United States  * * ","title":"List of highways numbered 690"},{"id":"18132340","text":"The following highways are numbered 590: Canada *31px Alberta Highway 590 *31px New Brunswick Route 590 *31px Ontario Highway 590 Ireland * 25px R590 regional road United States   ","title":"List of highways numbered 590"},{"id":"18132363","text":"Joseph Alphonse Oscar Jetté (December 28, 1887 – June 11, 1944) was a professional ice hockey player, playing the defence position for the Montreal Canadiens ice hockey club from 1911 to 1915.

Oregon's ERPO is a tool to help prevent suicide and other harmful behavior by removing dangerous weapons from people in crisis. Similar to Washington's Extreme Risk Protection Order – a ballot measure that passed statewide with about 70 percent of the vote in November 2016https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/extreme-risk- protection-order-initiative-1491/ – Oregon's ERPO allows a process for keeping deadly weapons away from a person found by the court finds to be at risk of suicide or being a danger to others. In the 2018 Legislative Session, Burdick supported the passage of House Bill 4145, which strengthened Oregon's gun control laws by aligning the definition of a domestic violence conviction under Oregon's Unlawful Possession of Firearms statute with the definitions of domestic violence found elsewhere in Oregon law, effectively closing the loophole for when there is a dating relationship. It also adds a stalking misdemeanor as a qualifying offense, subject to firearm dispossession.  Personal life  Burdick has two daughters.

Company history  =Early years= J.W. Black, ca.1863 In 1832 William Davis Ticknor and John Allen began a small bookselling business which operated out of the Old Corner Bookstore located on Washington and School streets in Boston, Massachusetts. The space had previously been used by publishers Carter & Hendee, who hired a teenaged James Thomas Fields as an apprentice. When Ticknor and Allen began their business, Fields joined them. A year later, Allen withdrew from the firm, and Ticknor continued business under William D. Ticknor and Company. When John Reed and Fields became partners in 1845, the imprint was changed to Ticknor, Reed, and Fields. Reed retired in 1854 and the imprint was renamed as Ticknor and Fields, which became well known. During these years the firm purchased and printed the Atlantic Monthly and the North American Review. Also in 1842 Ticknor became the first American publisher to pay foreign writers for their works, beginning with a check to Alfred Tennyson. These were prosperous years for the firm, and they compiled an impressive list of authors, Horatio Alger, Lydia Maria Child, Charles Dickens, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Oliver Wendell Holmes, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, James Russell Lowell, Harriet Beecher Stowe, Alfred Tennyson, Henry David Thoreau, Mark Twain, and John Greenleaf Whittier. The Old Corner Bookstore had become the publishing house and meeting place for these authors. Many writers visited many times a week; George William Curtis referred to it as \\"the hub of the Hub\\", referring to Boston's nickname, and said that it \\"compelled the world to acknowledge that there was an American literature\\".Felton, R. Todd. A Journey into the Transcendentalists' New England. Berkeley, California: Roaring Forties Press, 2006: 28. The success of the firm was largely in part to the perfectly matched but widely varied talents of Ticknor and Fields. Ticknor gave his attention to the financial and manufacturing departments while Fields focused on literary relations and social aspects of the business. It was also during these years that Ticknor and Fields developed a close relationship with the Riverside Press, founded by Henry Oscar Houghton in 1852. =After Ticknor= Ticknor & Fields office, 124 Tremont Street, Boston, ca.1868; located across from the Park Street ChurchBoston Directory. 1868 In the spring of 1864, Ticknor accompanied Nathaniel Hawthorne on a trip to restore the author's health, at the urging of his wife Sophia Hawthorne.McFarland, Philip. Hawthorne in Concord. New York: Grove Press, 2004: 288. During the trip, Ticknor became ill with pneumonia.Wineapple, Brenda. Hawthorne: A Life. New York: Random House, 2003: 371. Hawthorne wrote to Fields that \\"our friend Ticknor is suffering under a billious attack... He had previously seemed uncomfortable, but not to an alarming degree.\\"McFarland, Philip. Hawthorne in Concord. New York: Grove Press, 2004: 290. Ticknor died on the morning of April 10, 1864.Wineapple, Brenda. Hawthorne: A Life. New York: Random House, 2003: 372. Upon Ticknor's sudden and unexpected death, interests in the firm were carried on by his son Howard M. Ticknor. During these years the business had outgrown the Old Corner Bookstore and Fields, now in charge of the company, was no longer interested in the retail store. He sold the Old Corner Bookstore on November 12, 1864, and moved the publishing house to 124 Tremont Street.Tryon, Warren S. Parnassus Corner: A Life of James T. Fields, Publisher to the Victorians. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Houghton Mifflin Company, 1963: 279. The firm also began to publish Our Young Folks edited by Howard M. Ticknor. The younger Ticknor soon retired and, in 1868, the firm was reorganized as Fields, Osgood, & Co.Winship, Michael. American Literary Publishing in the Mid-nineteenth Century: The Business of Ticknor and Fields. Cambridge University Press, 2003: 22. Benjamin Holt Ticknor, son of William Davis Ticknor, was admitted at a partner in 1870. On New Year's Day, 1871, Fields announced his retirement from the business at a small gathering of friends,Tryon, Warren S. Parnassus Corner: A Life of James T. Fields, Publisher to the Victorians. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Houghton Mifflin Company, 1963: 361. intending to focus on his own writing. On January 2, 1871, the remaining partners bought out Fields's share of the company for $120,000 and it was renamed James R. Osgood & Co. Osgood, who considered Fields a mentor, attracted substantial new talent and published new works by Thomas Bailey Aldrich, Bret Harte, William Dean Howells, Henry James, Sarah Orne Jewett, Lucy Larcom, Elizabeth Stuart Phelps Ward, Celia Thaxter, and Charles Dudley Warner.Winship, Michael. American Literary Publishing in the Mid- nineteenth Century: The Business of Ticknor and Fields. Cambridge University Press, 2003: 23. =Final years= The firm invested in heliotype printing technology, various periodicals, and established a New York office. Within a few years, the company was in financial difficulty and Osgood and B. H. Ticknor were forced to sell off various assets, including many stereotype plates. By December 1878, they were forced to merge with Hurd & Houghton and became Houghton, Osgood, and Co. Henry Oscar Houghton became a partner in the deal. The partnership would last until 1880, when Osgood left to form a second J. R. Osgood and Company. Houghton's company, now Houghton, Mifflin, and Co, retained the rights to the Tickner and Fields backlist. The second J. R. Osgood and Co. was taken over by Benjamin Holt Ticknor in 1885 under the name Ticknor and Company. Ticknor and Company operated until 1889 when it became part of Houghton, Mifflin, and Co. In 1908 the name was changed to Houghton Mifflin Company. =Twentieth-century revival= In 1979, Houghton Mifflin revived the Ticknor and Fields name as an imprint. Chester Kerr was the editor from its reestablishment to 1984; Corlies Smith followed him from 1984 to 1989. Image gallery File:1840 WilliamTicknor.pngWilliam D.

The individuals who perform the assessment are typically architects and engineers, and skilled- trade technicians. Engineering and architectural professional opinions as to the conditions observed are part of the assessment. Building diagnostics go beyond facility condition assessments to determine solutions to the problems found and predict outcomes of the solutions. This analysis can be done by walk-through inspection, mathematical modeling (see Mathematical Model), or a combination. The most accurate way of determining the condition requires walk- through to collect data. This analysis can be performed on government/public, commercial, and private facilities. The term facility condition assessment describes work accomplished for federal, state, and local government agencies or entities, as well as private facilities. History Architectural and Engineering (A&E;) firms, or organizations, have assessed facilities as a part of their duties since those professions were conceived and formalized; though engineering and architectural work are not part of the assessment and are excluded in the scope of the assessment. The end product was usually an extensive narrative, supplemented with drawings and photographs, as to what conditions were observed, with a summary budget for correction of all deficiencies. In the 1970s the term \\"facility audit\\"\\"The Facilities Audit, Dr. Harvey H. Kaiser\\" was commonly used. This term was phased out as it suggested a review of the way a facility manager spent money on the facility; something that might be done by an ‘auditor’. Modern-day work took on its current form around the time of the founding of the International Facility Management Association in 1980, although the two were not related. Facility condition assessments became useful because of the dramatic reduction in the size of computers, coupled with a rapid increase in speed and storage. This helped create the product known as a computerized maintenance management system. The first publication that described the use of facility condition assessment data, financial modeling, and the use of the computerized maintenance management system application was \\"Managing the Facilities Portfolio\\", published by the National Association of College University Business Officers. The principal author of that book was Applied Management Engineering of Virginia Beach, Virginia.Applied Management Engineering, Inc As technology has advanced, facility condition assessment modeling has become more recognized in the condition assessment industry. In 2007, Graphic Systems, following research they had performed for the United States Federal Government, published a white paper on Condition Indices and Strategic Planning, demonstrating the value that strategic condition assessment modeling and the theoretical condition index can offer to traditional visual condition assessment programs. Application Once the walk-through data has been collected, appropriate estimates to correct the deficiencies should be prepared. When this is done, the user is left with potentially thousands of line items that need to be sorted, grouped together, and presented in a useful format. It is typical this format will adhere to the guidelines set forth by the Construction Specifications Institute. At this point, computerized assistance makes the product usable and changes the nature of the facility condition assessment from pure engineering and management, to an amalgam of engineering, management, and technology. Many firms use purpose-built software to make the process of data collection and reporting more efficient, improve data analysis and visualization, and allow users to develop projects and capital planning strategies based on the deficiencies and costs identified in the assessment. These software products typically integrate easily with computerized maintenance management systems, geographic information systems, and other management information systems. Mostly facility-intensive organization such as military bases, schools, colleges and universities, and city https://pbworld.com/capabilities_projects/new_york_city_school_construction_authority_building_condition_assessment_survey_.aspx and state governments need to develop a budget that allocates money for maintenance and repair. The information from facility condition assessments is used by people or organizations (e.g., boards of directors, commissioners, trustees, etc.) that must make these decisions as to how to distribute financial resources for facilities along with other needs of the organization. Frequently these people or organizations rely upon facility or building metrics for year-to-year comparisons. A good example of a facility metric that can be generated by the facility condition assessment is the facility condition index. There are many facility condition assessment software systems developed by organisations to help business owners get everything at one place.

It is perhaps most easily thought of as an algebraic extension of multivariable polynomials—an extension that permits exponents to be arbitrary real numbers (rather than just non-negative integers) while requiring the independent variables to be strictly positive (so that division by zero and other inappropriate algebraic operations are not encountered). Formally, a signomial is a function with domain \\\\mathbb{R}_{>0}^n which takes values : f(x_1, x_2, \\\\dots, x_n) = \\\\sum_{i=1}^M \\\\left(c_i \\\\prod_{j=1}^n x_j^{a_{ij}}\\\\right) where the coefficients c_k and the exponents a_{ij} are real numbers. Signomials are closed under addition, subtraction, multiplication, and scaling. If we restrict all c_i to be positive, then the function f is a posynomial. Consequently, each signomial is either a posynomial, the negative of a posynomial, or the difference of two posynomials. If, in addition, all exponents a_{ij} are non-negative integers, then the signomial becomes a polynomial whose domain is the positive orthant. For example, : f(x_1, x_2, x_3) = 2.7 x_1^2x_2^{-1/3}x_3^{0.7} - 2x_1^{-4}x_3^{2/5} is a signomial. The term \\"signomial\\" was introduced by Richard J. Duffin and Elmor L. Peterson in their seminal joint work on general algebraic optimization—published in the late 1960s and early 1970s. A recent introductory exposition involves optimization problems.C. Maranas and C. Floudas, Global optimization in generalized geometric programming, pp. 351–370, 1997. Nonlinear optimization problems with constraints and/or objectives defined by signomials are harder to solve than those defined by only posynomials, because (unlike posynomials) signomials cannot necessarily be made convex by applying a logarithmic change of variables. Nevertheless, signomial optimization problems often provide a much more accurate mathematical representation of real-world nonlinear optimization problems. References External links * S. Boyd, S. J.

Its location is unclear but was probably near Selsey. Historical context Later engraving of a picture commissioned in 1519 showing Cædwalla confirming a grant of land, at Selsey, to Wilfrid. The position of the presentation is probably where the Mixon is today, based on the location of the church (at Church Norton) in the top left of picture. The account of Ælle and his three sons landing at Cymenshore appears in the Anglo- Saxon Chronicle, a collection of seven vernacular manuscripts, commissioned in the 9th century, some 400 years or more after the events at Cymenshore. The legendary foundation of Saxon Sussex, by Ælle, is likely to have originated in an oral tradition before being recorded in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle. From 491 until the arrival of Christianity in the 7th century, there was a dearth of contemporary written material.Information about early Sussex derived from the chronicle has been modified by our knowledge of what was happening elsewhere in England and by a growing body of archaeological evidence. The Chronicle goes on to describe a battle with the British in 485 near the bank of Mercredesburne, and a siege of Pevensey in 491 after which the inhabitants were massacred. Towards the end of the Roman occupation of England raids on the east coast became more intense and the expedient adopted by Romano-British leaders was to enlist the help of Anglo-Saxon mercenaries to whom they ceded territory. Gildas said that the king of the Britons Vortigern invited the Saxons in among them like wolves into the sheep-fold. It is thought that mercenaries may have started arriving in Sussex as early as the 5th century. Archaeological evidence suggests that the main area of settlement during the 5th century can be identified by the distribution of cemeteries of that period Apart from Highdown, near Worthing and Apple Down, 11 km northwest of Chichester, they are between the lower Ouse and Cuckmere rivers in East Sussex. This area was believed to have been for the treaty settlement of Anglo-Saxon mercenaries Bell suggested that subsequently Ælle seems to have tried to break out of the treaty area and in about 465 he fought the battle of 'Mearcredesburne', one translation of which is 'river of the frontier agreed by treaty'. The Chronicle does not tell us who won the battle, but with the taking of Pevensey in c 471 Ælle extended his territory up to the Pevensey Levels. East of the Levels was an area independently settled by the Haestingas, a people whose territory continued to be regarded as an area apart from the rest of Sussex as late as the 11th century. No pagan cemeteries have been found in this region, and this is an indication that they were already Christian when they arrived. As far as the west of the Arun Valley is concerned, this includes Selsey and Chichester, to date there have been no archaeological finds of the early Anglo-Saxon period. The only known pagan Saxon burials are at Pagham (7th or 8th century AD) and Apple Down. Etymology A mention of Cymen, the Ælle's son, in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle Although there is no archaeological evidence for Ælle's existence or his invasion, there is some lexical evidence for the existence of Cymensora, the place where the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle AS 477 say he landed. The word ora is found only in placenames where Jutish and West Saxon dialects were in operation (mainly in southern England). It is possible that the stretch of low ground along the coast from Southampton to Bognor was called Ora \\"the shore\\", and that district names were used by the various coastal settlements. They include Ower near Southampton, Rowner near Gosport, Copnor in Portsmouth, Marker in West Thorney, Itchenor, Chalder Farm, Keynor Farm, Honer in Pagham and Bognor. According to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle Cymensora is named after Cymen, one of Ælle's sons and thus would mean Cymen's landing place or shore. Location Remains of jetty at Wytherings location(grid reference SZ8797) =Evidence for Selsey area= Section of 1583 Dutch map showing Rumbridge (Weenbrug). The Selsey area, is traditionally the most popular candidate for Cymenshore. The tradition is based largely on two charters that refer to a place with a similar name in the boundary clause to that cited in the Anglo- Saxon Chronicle.The charter that defined the land award to Wilfrid at Selsey, in the 7th century, by King Caedwalla is actually a 10th-century forgery. The relevant section of the forged charter, says (in Latin): and the translation is: A further source is from the Charter of Byrhthelm (presumably Brihthelm (Bishop of Selsey)), which is believed to be genuine and is to do with some land that had been seized from the See of Selsey, it confirms that the boundary is from Wytherings Mouth and Cymenshoran in the east to Hormouth in the west: Rumbruge/ Rumbridge (alias \\"thri beorg\\" – three barrows, now the Medmerry Bank) is believed to have been an islet and trading port off the southwest coast of the Manhood Peninsula, that has long since succumbed to the sea and Wytherings mouth was part of what is now Pagham Harbour. =The Owers= Just off the tip of Selsey Bill, to approximately SSE, are groups of ledges and rocks known as the Owers. The Owers showing possible location for Cymenshore Outer and Middle Owers Some historians such as Hunter-Blair identify the Outer Owers and Middle Owers as the landing place for Ælle.However this is problematical as according to SCOPAC the coastal erosion pattern means that this section of the Owers would not have been part of the shoreline for at least 5000 years. The Outer Owers are approximately off Selsey Bill and the erosion pattern suggests that the shore would have been 2–3 km seaward 5000 years ago. The Mixon Camden's description of Selsey and the ancient little City To the south of Selsey Bill lies the Mixon rocks. It is believed that, in the Iron Age, the Atrebates (one of the Belgae tribes) built their Oppidum in the Selsey area and Richardson speculates that the Mixon could be the site of Cidade Celha (the Old City) and therefore Cymensora. The archaeological evidence demonstrates that the Mixon would have been the shoreline during the Roman occupation, with it not being breached by the sea until the 10th or 11th century. As late as the 17th century, it was reported that the remains of the \\"ancient little city\\" could be seen at low tide. =Keynor= The Manor of Keynor is situated at the western end of Pagham Harbour. Selsey-based historians Edward Heron-Allen and Francis Mee favour the Keynor area of Sidlesham for Cymenshore; they suggest that the name Keynor is derived from Cymensora. However Margaret Gelling asserts that Keyn- or actually means Cow-Shore in Old English. =Pagham Harbour= Pagham Harbour currently is a nature reserve, however in earlier times was a working harbour with three ports, one at the western end at Sidlesham Mill known as Wardur, one at the other at the entrance to the harbour and known as Charlton and one on the Pagham side known as the Port of Wythering (Wyderinges). The port of Wardur was part of 'New Haven' a development in the Middle Ages. The Port of Wythering was overrun by the sea in the 13th century and the whole harbour eventually silted up and ceased to be navigable, except for small craft. =West Wittering= West Wittering has been cited by some early cartographers and historians as the site for Cymenshore. For example in his Britannia Camden said: Also Morden's map of 1695 shows Cimenshore being adjacent to the Witterings. Section of 1695 map of Sussex showing location of Cymenshore (spelt Cimenshore on map) However, other historians have posited that siting Cymenshore off West Wittering as mistaken and was probably due to a mistranslation of the charter. The charter itself, in the original early English describes part of the boundary of the land as .. Wedering muðe.. (Wedering mouth). Wedering was the port of Withering a village, now lost, at the entrance to what is now Pagham Harbour. It is possible that earlier historians had translated Wedering incorrectly, as Wittering. Other possible locations =Ouse-Cuckmere= Welch believes that the location for Cymenshore is more likely to be in the Ouse-Cuckmere area of East Sussex, his reasoning is that there is no archaeological evidence to support a landing at Selsey. However Richardson states that the place names with the Old English ora element of Cymensora are very common along the Hampshire and West Sussex coastline but not around the Ouse-Cuckmere area. There is also a suggestion that the archaeology off the Selsey coast has just not been fully realised yet. =Shoreham= Shoreham has also been cited as a possible location, for example in 1906 Hilaire Belloc in his Hills and the Sea when discussing St Wilfrid he said: See also * History of Sussex Notes Citations References            * External links *Sidlesham Parish Site - Information on how to find Keynor - Note Keynor Lane on map and Earnley (suggested area for Rumbruge) immediately to the west. * St Thomas a Becket - Parish Church at the East end of Pagham Harbour near to Wythering. St Wilfrid gave Pagham to the Archbishops of Canterbury when he left Selsey, and they are still the patrons of this church. A Saxon burial urn was found near to the church in the 1950s and now is on display in the south aisle. * Movable Type Scripts - Useful site for calculating distances based on the latitude/ longitude bearings.

Very little is known for certain about her. Family Rusudan is commonly considered a member of the Bagrationi dynasty.See, for example, George Finlay, The History of Greece and the Empire of Trebizond, (1204-1461) (Edinburgh: William Blackwood, 1851), p. 404 Szabolcs de Vajay has argued that Rusudan was probably an illegitimate daughter of Giorgi IV Lasha.De Vajay, \\"Essai Chronologique a propos de la Famille du Grand-Comnène Manuel, 1238-1263\\", Byzantinische Forschungen 6 (1979), pp. 281-291 cited in Kelsey Jackson Williams, \\"A Genealogy of the Grand Komnenoi of Trebizond\\", Foundations, 2 (2006), p. 174 However, Michel Kuršanskis argues that Rusudan could have been no more than a commoner and mistress of Emperor Manuel. First, Kuršanskis notes that it was not Georgian custom to name their children after their parents. \\"That alone should be enough to indicate that Rusudan couldn't be a daughter of the homonymous Queen,\\" he writes. He points out that in the chronicle of Michael Panaretos she is the only one of the three women who gave him children who is not referred to as kyra, or \\"lady\\". Lastly, Rusudan is described simply as \\"from Iberia\\" and nothing is said about her ancestry.Kuršanskis, \\"L'usurpation de Théodora Grande Comnène\\", Revue des études byzantines, 33 (1975), pp. 198f Empress Rusudan is mentioned briefly in the chronicle of Michael Panaretos. \\"Lady Theodora Komnene, the first daughter of lord Manuel the Grand Komnenos by Russadan from Iberia.\\" \\"The Chronicle of Michael Panaretos Part One\\", translated by Basileos Nestor Drawing on Georgian sources, Kuršanskis suggests that Rusudan died in 1247.Kuršanskis, \\"L'usurpation de Théodora\\", p. 204 Manuel had at least two daughters whose mother is not mentioned, and they could be children by Rusudan. One of the daughters married Demetre II of Georgia, the other married one of his Didebul.Kuršanskis, \\"L'usurpation de Théodora\\", pp. 200f Though mentioned in modern genealogies as a name, \\"Didebul\\" was actually a title.

Thus the microcomputer revolution, in which electronic computing moved from exclusively enterprise and government use to include personal computing, is a cardinal example of consumerization. But many technology-based products, such as calculators and mobile phones, have also had their origins in business markets, and only over time did they become dominated by high-volume consumer usage, as these products commoditized and prices fell. An example of enterprise software that became consumer software is optical character recognition software, which originated with banks and postal systems (to automate cheque clearing and mail sorting) but eventually became personal productivity software. In a different sense, consumerization of IT is the proliferation of personally owned IT at the workplace (in addition to, or even instead of, company-owned IT), which originates in the consumer market, to be used for professional purposes.Sebastian Köffer, Kevin Ortbach, and Björn Niehaves. Exploring the Relationship between IT Consumerization and Job Performance: A theoretical framework for future research. Communications of the Association for Information Systems. http://aisel.aisnet.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3823&context;=cais This bring your own device trend has significantly changed corporate IT policies, as employees now often use their own laptops, netbooks, tablets, and smartphones on the hardware side, and social media, web conferencing, cloud storage, and software as a service on the software side. Origins Consumerization has existed for many decades, as, for example, the consumerization of refrigeration occurred in the 1910s through 1950s. The consumerization of IT is believed to have been first regularly called by that term by Douglas Neal and John Taylor of the Leading Edge Forum in 2001; the first known published paper on this topic was published by the LEF in June 2004.David Moschella, Doug Neal, John Taylor, and Piet Opperman. Consumerization of Information Technology. Leading Edge Forum 2004. http://lef.csc.com/projects/70 , Accessed 27/02/2012 The term is now used widely throughout the IT industry, and is the topic of numerous conferences and articles. One of the first articles was special insert in \\"The Economist\\" magazine in October 8, 2011.Special Report: Personal Technology, \\"Consumerisation: The Power of Many\\", Economist, 2011, http://www.economist.com/node/21530921, Accessed 27/02/2012 Later, Consumerization of IT has been used ambiguously. In an effort to structure the amorphous nature of the term, researchers suggested to take three distinct perspectives: an individual, organizational and market perspective.Jeanne G Harris, Blake Ives, and Iris Junglas. IT Consumerization: When Gadgets Turn into Enterprise IT Tools. MIS Quarterly Executive. The technology behind the consumerization of computing can be said to have begun with the development of eight-bit, general-purpose microprocessors in the early 1970s and eventually the personal computer in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Thus the microcomputer revolution, in which electronic computing moved from exclusively enterprise and government use to include personal computing, is the cardinal example of consumerization. However, it is significant that the great success of the IBM PC in the first half of the 1980s was driven primarily by business markets. Business preeminence continued during the late 1980s and early 1990s with the rise of the Microsoft Windows PC platform. Meanwhile, other technology-based products, such as calculators, fax machines, and mobile phones, also had their origins in business markets, and only over time did they become dominated by high-volume consumer usage, as these products commoditized and prices fell. It was the growth of the World Wide Web in the mid 1990s that began to reverse this pattern. In particular the rise of free, advertising-based services such as email and search from companies such as Hotmail and Yahoo began to establish the idea that consumer IT offerings based on a simple Internet browser were often viable alternatives to traditional business computing approaches. Meanwhile, it is argued that consumerization of IT embodies more than consumer IT diffusion, but a chance for considerable productivity gains. It \\"reflects how enterprises will be affected by, and can take advantage of, new technologies and models that originate and develop in the consumer space, rather than in the enterprise IT sector\\".Gartner IT Glossary: Consumerization. http://www.gartner.com/it-glossary/consumerization, Accessed 21/01/2016 Business implications The primary impact of consumerization is that it is forcing businesses, especially large enterprises, to rethink the way they procure and manage IT equipment and services. Historically, central IT organizations controlled the great majority of IT usage within their firms, choosing or at least approving of the systems and services that employees used. Consumerization enables alternative approaches. Today, employees and departments are becoming increasingly self- sufficient in meeting their IT needs. Products have become easier to use, and cloud-based, software-as-a-service offerings are addressing an ever-widening range of business needs in areas such as video-conferencing, digital imaging, business collaboration, sales force support, systems back-up, and other areas. Similarly, there is increasing interest in so-called Bring Your Own Device strategies, where individual employees can choose and often own the computers and/or smart phones they use at work. The Apple iPhone and iPad have been particularly important in this regard. Both products were designed for individual consumers, but their appeal in the workplace has been great. They have demonstrated that elements of choice, style and entertainment are now critical computer industry dimensions that businesses cannot ignore. Equally important, large enterprises have become increasingly dependent upon consumerized services as search, mapping, and social media. The capabilities of firms such as Google, Facebook, and Twitter are now essential components of many firm’s marketing strategies. One of the most important consumerization questions going forward is to what extent such advertising-based services will spread into major corporate applications such as email, Customer Relationship Management (CRM), and Intranets. One of the more serious negative implications of consumerization is that security controls have been slower to be adopted in the consumer space. As a result, there is an increased risk to the information assets accessed through these less trustworthy consumerized devices. In a recent CSOOnline article by Joan Goodchild she reported a survey that found \\"when asked what are the greatest barriers to enabling employees to use personal devices at work, 83 percent of IT respondents cited \\"security concerns\\"Joan Goodchild, \\"Consumer device use is growing, but IT and security can't keep up\\", http://www.csoonline.com/article/686087/consumer-device-use- is-growing-but-it-and-security-can-t-keep-up?page=1, 2011, Accessed 27/02/2012 This shortcoming may soon be remedied by the chip manufacturers with technologies such as Intel's \\"Trusted Execution Technology\\" James Green & Sham Datta, White Paper, \\"Intel® Trusted Execution Technology\\", http://www.intel.com/technology/security/downloads/arch-overview.pdf, Intel, Accessed 27/02/2012 and ARM's \\"Trust Zone\\" White Paper, \\"Building a Secure System using TrustZone® Technology\\", http://infocenter.arm.com/help/topic/com.arm.doc.prd29-genc-009492c/PRD29-GENC-009492C_trustzone_security_whitepaper.pdf, ARM, Accessed 27/02/2012—these technologies being designed to increase the trustworthiness of both enterprise and consumer devices. Technology implications In addition to the mass market changes above, consumer markets are now changing large-scale computing as well. The giant data centers that have been and are being built by firms such as Google, Apple, Amazon and others are far larger and generally much more efficient than the data centers used by most large enterprises. For example, Google is said to support over 300 million Gmail accounts, while executing more than 1 billion searches per day. Supporting these consumer-driven volumes requires new levels of efficiency and scale, and this is transforming many traditional data center approaches and practices. Among the major changes are reliance on low cost, commodity servers, N+1 system redundancy, and largely unmanned data center operations. The associated software innovations are equally important in areas such as algorithms, artificial intelligence, and Big Data. In this sense, consumerization seems likely to transform much of the overall computing stack, from individual devices to many of the most demanding large-scale challenges.

Mark the Mountain Guide and the Compass Adventure from Boxer Books, 2009. Mark the Mountain Guide is a series of illustrated children's books which combine short tales with an introduction to mountaineering. The books are written by Mark Seaton and illustrated by Graham Philpot. The series is published by Boxer Books. Background Author Mark Seaton and David Bennett, a publisher of children's books, conceived the books while they climbed Mont Blanc together.Mark the Mountain GuideMark the Mountain Guide and the Compass Adventure David Bennett was responsible for commissioning the Where's Waldo? books which have sold over 40 million copies worldwide. The British mountaineer Sir Chris Bonington provides the introduction, and the International Federation of Mountain Guides Associations offers their seal of approval to the technical section at the end of the books. The main character is Mark, a mountain guide. Most of the characters are engaging animals, including Leo the Mountain Dog and three little Marmot Mountaineers. At the end of the story, an instructional section explains more about some of the phenomena encountered along the way. In the first book, Mark the Mountain Guide, this includes child-friendly explanations of what causes an avalanche, how mountains are formed and why stars are so bright at altitude. A glossary defines mountain-related words from the story, including terms like avalanche, crampon, gorge, glacier and mountaineer. This section also includes practical information to get children started on their mountaineering careers, such as how to build an igloo, what a mountaineer wears and carries in his pack, and how to tie a couple of useful knots. To facilitate this particular skill, the first book includes a toy carabiner and a length of accessory cord. Later books continue this format. For example, the second book, Mark the Mountain Guide and the Compass Adventure, includes a working compass & brief illustrated explanations of the history, science & technique behind magnetic needles used for navigation. Author The author, Mark Seaton, is a British mountain guide who lives with his wife and children in the Chamonix valley. He guides climbers and skiers in the French, Swiss and Italian Alps. Seaton's accomplishments as a professional mountain guide include the first complete unassisted British guided ascent of the Eiger Nordwand“Oh, are you still here?” A Bagman's View of the Eigerwand with his client Charles Sherwood in 2007. In 2008, Seaton & Sherwood teamed up again to complete a traverse of Mont Blanc via an ascent of Aiguille Blanche de Peuterey, the most difficult 4000-m summit in the Alps. In 1996, Mark led Don Planner, the first blind man to climb Mont Blanc.Blind Mont Blanc Planner, incidentally, was also the first man to reach the summit after undergoing a heart by-pass operation. Mark has also guided various regiments of the British army including the Special Forces. Illustrator Graham Philpot, a children's artist best known as the creator of Anthony Ant, illustrates the books.

Thus, the two stars will eventually merge to form a single fast-spinning star. Calculating the properties of the component stars from the orbital period indicates that the primary star has a mass 1.94 times and a diameter 2.026 times that of the Sun, and the secondary has a mass 0.76 times and a diameter 1.322 times that of the Sun. The primary has a surface temperature of 7800 K, while the secondary is a little cooler at 7340 K. The two stars have similar luminosity and spectral type as they have a common envelope and share stellar material. The system is thought to be around 5-6 billion years old. Based upon an annual parallax shift of 11.84 milliarc seconds as measured by the Hipparcos satellite, this system is from Earth. Analysing and recalibrating yields a parallax of 13.30 and hence a distance of . History The star's variability was first recorded in 1888 by H.M. Paul,. At the time, it had the shortest known period of any variable star. It was initially thought to be an Algol- type eclipsing binary, but this was discounted by E.C. Pickering on account of it lacking a shallow minimum in its maximum and the width of its minimum period. Alfred H. Joy noted the similarity of its light curve to W Ursae Majoris in 1926, concluding the system was indeed an eclipsing binary with two stars of spectral type A8.

He lived much of his life in New York City beginning at the age of seven. Apparently Shaler had a private income that allowed him to pursue his own interests, and he was educated in private schools. He was active in the New York State militia, beginning as a private in 1848 and becoming major of the 7th New York Militia in 1860. Shaler published a Manual of Arms for Light Infantry, New York : T.B. Harrison & Co., 1861. With the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861, Shaler's regiment, then called the 7th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment, was sent to defend Washington, D.C.. American Civil War: Service in the East After returning to New York City, Shaler became lieutenant colonel of the 65th New York Volunteer Infantry, known as the 1st United States Chasseurs. John Cochrane served as colonel. Shaler was credited by The New York Times with drilling the regiment well. The regiment left for the front on August 27, 1861. They served in the Peninsula Campaign of Major General George McClellan and then in the Maryland Campaign as part of the division of Brigadier General Darius Couch in IV Corps, Army of the Potomac. Shaler became colonel on June 17, 1862, after Cochrane was promoted to the rank of brigadier general. After Antietam, Couch's division became the third division of VI Corps. John Newton succeeded Couch. Shaler's regiment became part of Cochrane's brigade in that division. It was present at the Battle of Fredericksburg but not seriously engaged. Alexander Shaler assumed command of the brigade in March 1863, and was appointed to the rank of brigadier general, to rank from May 26, 1862, on May 26, 1863.Eicher, John H., and David J. Eicher, Civil War High Commands. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2001. . p. 728.President Abraham Lincoln sent the nomination for this appointment to the U.S. Senate on December 31, 1863, and the Senate confirmed the appointment on April 20, 1864. Eicher, 2001, p. 728. (Joseph Eldridge Hamblin became colonel of the regiment in his place.) Shaler led the brigade at the Second Battle of Fredericksburg, also known as the Second Battle of Marye's Heights, on May 3, when VI Corps, under Major General John Sedgwick drove Jubal Early's division away from the Heights. At a crucial moment, Shaler seized a flag and led his men into the Confederate defenses. In 1893, he received the Medal of Honor for this act. His brigade also participated in the Battle of Salem Church. In the Battle of Gettysburg, VI Corps served as a reserve for the Army of the Potomac. Shaler's brigade was sent to the right flank early on July 3, 1863. There it helped XII Corps hold Culp's Hill. Shaler's brigade usually was in reserve, but units went to the front line to help in resisting Confederate attacks. About 3:30 that afternoon, Shaler's brigade was sent to the center of the army as a reserve around the time of the repulse of Pickett's Charge.Gen. Alexander Shaler's Official Report (OR) For The Battle of Gettysburg at www.civilwarhome.com Shaler commanded the prisoner of war camp at Johnson's Island on the shores of Lake Erie in the winter of 1863-1864, with his regiment serving as prison guards. He was back with his brigade in 1864 in time to participate in the Overland Campaign. VI Corps had been reorganized, and Shaler's brigade served in General Horatio Wright's first division. This brigade was on the army's right flank in the Battle of the Wilderness on May 6, 1864. At first, it was in a \\"refused\\" position facing north, thus protecting the rest of the corps. Then it was drawn into the main line of battle, supporting its fight with LG Richard S. Ewell's corps. As a result, Shaler's brigade was flanked by Confederate troops led by Brigadier General John Brown Gordon that had swung northward to attack the Union right flank. Shaler and Brigadier General Truman Seymour were among the Union soldiers captured in his foray. Shaler was trying to rally his men when he was made a captive. He was sent to Libby Prison, in Richmond, Virginia and then to Macon, Georgia. In the summer of 1864 he was placed under the fire of Union batteries bombarding Charleston, South Carolina. American Civil War: Service in the West After being exchanged, Shaler was transferred West where he served in the Department of the Gulf, briefly commanding third brigade, second division XIX Corps, from November 3 to December 3, 1864. Then he served in Arkansas, where he led the second division in VII Corps, December 28, 1864 – August 1, 1865, under Major General Joseph J. Reynolds. This division was based in DeValls Bluff in east central Arkansas. It most was engaged in occupation of the region and minor skirmishes with Confederate forces. In June 1865, as the war was ending, Shaler cooperated in the efforts of Major General Grenville Dodge, commanding the Department of Missouri, to parole the irregular forces of Brigadier General M. Jeff Thompson. Shaler was mustered out of the volunteers on August 24, 1865. On January 12, 1866, President of the United States Andrew Johnson nominated Shaler for appointment to the brevet rank of major general of volunteers, to rank from July 27, 1865, and the United States Senate confirmed the appointment on March 12, 1866.Eicher, 2001, p. 714. Post-war life After the war, Shaler served as commissioner of the New York City Fire Department from 1867 to 1873. He was active in veterans' affairs, including heading the New York Commandery of the Loyal Legion. He also became major general of the state militia in 1867, commanding the first division. His tenure was not always peaceful. One of his officers accused the general of incompetence. Later, in 1885, he was arrested and charged with corruption, especially connected with the choice of sites for armories. Shaler was not convicted in two trials, because in both cases the jury could not reach agreement. Nonetheless, he had to step down from his militia position; and the city removed him from the Board of Health. The general had become chair of the Board of Health in 1883. He also served as President of the Soldiers' Business Messenger and Dispatch Company incorporated in 1867 which helped infirmed vets in good standing and orphans of vets lost during the war find employment as trusted messengers in New York City. Shaler is credited with being a founder of the National Rifle Association, serving as a director and its president in 1876. Shaler served as president of the Automatic Signal Telegraph Company, where his tenure was also stormy. In an altercation with William B. Watkins, the inventor of the fire alarm telegraph system the company marketed, Shaler had Watkins arrested for trying to remove certain papers from the premises of the company. This dispute culminated in a trial. The court ruled on April 15, 1885, that Shaler's charge of fraud against Watkins was unfounded, but the general was able to retain the shares in the company he had received as compensation for his work as president even after the company sold itself to the Watkins Automatic Telegraph Company, run by many of the same people. Shaler moved to Ridgefield, New Jersey, possibly to escape past disputes, though he also maintained a residence in New York City, at 126 Riverside Drive. He served as Mayor of Ridgefield, New Jersey, from 1899 to 1901. Shaler died at his New York home on December 28, 1911. He was buried in Ridgefield in the cemetery of the Dutch Reformed Church in the English Neighborhood. His only son, Ira Alexander Shaler, a major in the Spanish-American War, was put in charge of building the first subway tunnel through the Murray Hill neighborhood of Manhattan. Major Shaler died in 1902 at age 39 two weeks after his back was broken when a subway tunnel collapsed on him.

He was also a brigadier general in the US Army. Biography Harry had never ridden a horse before attending West Point, from which he graduated in 1910. However, he learned to ride incredibly well while at West Point under General Guy V. Henry, and went on to great accomplishments in various equestrian sports. Chamberlin was in active military duty in France during World War I, when he served with the 161 Brigade. It was during this time that he competed internationally for the first time, riding in the 1919 Inter-Allied Games, held in Paris (the 1916 Olympics were cancelled due to the war), before returning home. Chamberlin was assigned to Fort Riley's Horsemanship Department and went on to compete at the 1920 Olympic Games with his mount Nigra. He was then sent to Europe to train for two years, the first year at the French Cavalry School in Saumur, and the second at the Italian Cavalry School in Tor di Quinto. While in Italy, he was introduced to the forward seat, which he brought back to the United States and which now dominates the hunter and jumper scene. Chamberlin was then sent to Fort Bliss in Texas. In 1927, he returned to train the 1928 Olympic Team, which he captained in both eventing and jumping. During this time, he taught his teammates the forward seat, which was renamed by them as the \\"Chamberlin Seat.\\" At the Olympics, the event team was eliminated when one of their riders missed an obstacle, despite having had the best cross-country rounds of the day. Chamberlin finished 21st individually in the event competition on Benny Grimes. In the jumping competition, Chamberlin competed again on Nigra, finishing 18th individually, and the American team placed 8th (out of 16 nations). He later went on to compete at the 1932 Olympic Games, again riding on the event and jumping teams. He finished 4th individually on the ex- racehorse Pleasant Smiles, despite a fall on cross-country, and the team was able to clinch the first gold medal the American equestrian team had seen. In the jumping competition, Chamberlin rode the Thoroughbred Show Girl over a notoriously difficult course, and went away with the individual silver medal. A disqualification of another team member meant the Americans did not win the gold team medal as well. Chamberlin commanded the 2nd Cavalry Regiment from 1939 to 1941, and the 4th Cavalry Brigade from 1941 to 1942. He eventually served as commander of Fort Ord from 1943 until his death in 1944. Chamberlin is perhaps best known for his teaching and training ability, with Lieutenant Earl Foster Thomson citing him as teaching him how to ride. He was inducted into the US Show Jumping Hall of Fame in 1990. Other sports Chamberlin was also a very accomplished polo player, where he won the national 12 goal championship (1925), and 20 goal championship (1926). While at West Point, he was also known to be very good at non-equestrian sports, including boxing, football, and track. Books Chamberlin wrote several books, including Riding and Schooling Horses (1934) and Training Hunters, Jumpers, and Hacks (1937). References * \\"Harry D. Chamberlin.

One day, Naomi and Owen's mother, Skyla, suddenly reappears after 7 years of being gone. Although initially happy to have her mother back in her life, Naomi questions the reason for Skyla's return, whilst Skyla showers Naomi with gifts, but neglects and expresses disgust towards Owen. Mary later tells Naomi and Owen the truth, but they don't really know the truth, until the day of the Parent- Teacher Conferences which Skyla promised to attend, but didn't. That day, Naomi realized that Skyla is really an alcoholic and that her father wanted custody of her and Owen but Skyla wouldn't allow it. As things get more severe, Naomi becomes weary of Skyla, but is ultimately hesitant to warn Mary of her behavior. However, after a seemingly regular doctor's appointment for Owen, Skyla suddenly becomes infuriated and threatens Naomi, Owen, and Mary's well-being while revealing her plans of taking Naomi with her and her boyfriend, Clive, to Las Vegas so she would take care of Clive's daughter, Sapphire, while leaving Owen behind. However, refusing to let that happen, Mary takes the kids on a whirlwind journey accompanied by their neighbors Fabiola and Bernardo Morales to the city of Oaxaca, Mexico. There they go on a quest in which Naomi is determined to find her father, Santiago. The group participate in Mexico's Los Posadas and Night of the Radishes, where Santiago arrives and reunites with his children, but he is unable to come back with Naomi and Owen to Lemon Tree.

Owen Soledad León Outlaw: the son of Santiago and Skyla, the great-grandson of Mary, and the brother of Naomi. He is severely deformed, but is more cheerful and outgoing than Naomi, and enjoys wearing tape. Mary Outlaw: Also known as \\"Gram\\", Mary is the great-grandmother and guardian of Naomi and Owen and the grandmother of Skyla. Wise and loving, she worries constantly for Naomi and Owen and loves them dearly, willing to do anything to protect them and ensure their happiness, even from her granddaughter. Skyla Jones: the mother of Naomi and Owen, the ex-wife of Santiago, and the main antagonist in the story who suddenly reappeared in her children's life after seven years of being gone. An alcoholic, Skyla is mentally unstable and verbally and physically abuses Naomi and Owen, despite expressing favoritism towards Naomi. Santiago León: the father of Naomi and Owen and the ex-husband of Skyla. Although absent from the majority of his children's lives, Santiago is a loving and patient man who cares for his children dearly despite their estrangement. He also is talented at carving, which Naomi inherited from him. Reception Kirkus Reviews wrote \\"Ryan’s sure-handed storytelling and affection for her characters convey a clear sense of Naomi’s triumph, as she becomes “who I was meant to be.”\\" and Publishers Weekly wrote \\"Once again, Ryan (Esperanza Rising ) crystallizes the essence of settings and characters through potent, economic prose.\\" Common Sense Media found \\"Skyla a rather cardboard villain, and lessens the complexity of the situation.

This is intended to make storage more convenient and to make the table more portable. Many folding tables are made of lightweight materials to further increase portability. It can be combined with folding chairs.  Description  Folding tables are produced in many sizes, configurations, and designs. They can be made from plastic, metal, wood, and other materials. Some manufacturers use specialist materials like engineered wood when producing tables. = Folding mechanism = There are two main types of folding table. Those that have leaves that fold down such as a Pembroke table, drop-leaf table or gateleg table, and those that fold by having legs that bend on a hinge located at the connection point between the table top and the leg. The leg is designed to fold and fit securely against the underside of the table top, while remaining attached. Because the hinge requires a stable material such as metal for dexterity, some producers use lightweight materials such as aluminium for an increased degree of portability in the folding mechanism. = Uses = Folding tables are used in homes, schools, churches, and other buildings that have rooms intended for various functions. Folding tables can be used for sit-down activities, and then easily removed and stored out of the way when open space is needed. Wooden folding tables are also sometimes used as weapons in professional wrestling. Rolls Royce Phantom I Open Tourer Windovers (1926)  Styles  = Card table = A card table is a square table with legs that fold up individually, with one leg lining each edge. Card tables are traditionally used for playing card games, board games, and other tabletop games. Due to their low cost and small storage size, in the United States they are frequently found in college apartments, or as auxiliary seating for family meals such as Thanksgiving. Many folding card tables are used for specialist games such as contract bridge, Mahjong or poker, as a result there are some folding tables with fabric surfaces such as felt. In the UK, card tables are purpose-designed for cards with have a green baize surface and foldaway leaves or legs. = General-use table = Rectangle, square, and round folding tables are designed for general home and office uses. = Banquet table = Banquet tables are traditionally used by restaurants and caterers for setting up temporary buffets. They are also popular among retailers and vendors at trade shows for displaying products, and for use as temporary desks. = Personal table = A personal table, also called a TV tray, is a small table designed to be used by only one person at a time. They are popular for dining while watching television, or for working on small projects. Students often use personal tables for doing homework. = Folding picnic table = A folding picnic table has built-in seats that fold up along with the legs. They are used commonly in school cafeterias and in the backyards of homes. = Ironing board = An ironing board is a small, portable, folding table with a heat-resistant top that is used for ironing clothes. = Wallpaper table = A wallpaper table (or paste or pasting table) is a long, light folding table used by interior decorators. The decorator lays out a strip of wallpaper flat on the table to apply paste so that the wallpaper can then be fixed onto the wall. The table needs to be long to accommodate wallpaper, so other tables typically found in rooms are insufficient, and needs to be light and foldable so that they can be easily transported. Their ease of transportation and assembly means wallpaper tables are sometimes used for other informal purposes such as car boot sales and camping.https://www.diy.com/departments/b-q-foldable-paste- table-h-740mm-w-560mm-l-1780mm/819258_BQ.prd = Gallery = File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-26070-0002, Präsentation einer Zeltmöbelgarnitur.jpgA 1950s folding table File:Tvtable.jpgPersonal table or TV tray File:LoungeConservatory-2.jpgFolding ironing board File:LifetimeTable.jpgModern folding table File:Traveling table (table de voyage or table pliante) MET DP117995.jpgThis ca. 1700–1720 table, designed for coach travel, folds out to accommodate six for dinner (with utensil drawer and fiddle rails) and offers felt and leather surfaces for playing cards and writing, respectively.  History  English folding table The history of the folding table may date back as far as ancient Egypt. By the Colonial and Victorian eras, the tables were common. During the 20th century, folding tables became an inexpensive item manufactured and sold in large quantities. In the 1940s, Durham Manufacturing Company was marketing a basic model. 'The Milwaukee Journal, 30 Nov 1949 In 1951, Boris Cohen and Joseph Pucci patented the first table that could be easily carried around. It was widely used by paper-hangers and handymen, and is fairly indistinguishable from present day aluminum folding tables. In the 1950s and 1960s, Falco and Samsonite tables were popular. In the 1990s and 2000s, American manufacturer Lifetime Products became the world's largest producer of folding tables.\\"Lifetime Products Files Patent Infringement Complaint Against Three Chinese Companies\\" Patents and Trademarks Today, 12 Feb 2010  See also  * Drop-leaf table, where the top folds down ** Gateleg table, a drop-leaf table where some of the legs fold inwards as well  References  Category:Tables (furniture) Category:Space- saving furniture ","title":"Folding table"},{"id":"18133102","text":"BarCampBank is an ongoing series of unconferences about innovation in the financial world.

He was born in Cleveland. Biography Graduating from West Point in 1922, Thomson earned the Silver Star in World War II while he was serving as chief of staff to the 10th Mountain Division in Italy. Trained under Harry Chamberlin, Thomson had an extremely successful equestrian Olympic career. He finished individually second, and won team gold, at his first Olympic competition in 1932. At the 1936 Olympics, he won the team gold and individual silver in eventing on the legendary mare Jenny Camp, being one of the few riders, and the only American, to successfully negotiate the 4th obstacle on cross-country, a water jump. This obstacle included a 3' jump into the water and, for most of the competitors, they found that the footing on the bottom was slippery and it was much deeper than it looked. This obstacle created considerable controversy as the entire German team made it through, suggesting that the home team could have had prior knowledge regarding the footing. In 1948, Thomson competed in the dressage competition with Pancraft to win the team silver (after the gold medal-winning Swedish team was disqualified due to one of its members being an enlisted man rather than an officer). This is, to-date, the highest team medal the US has won in dressage competition. That same year, he finished with the team gold medal on Reno Rhythm He also served as the chef d'equipe for the eventing team at the 1960 Olympics in Rome, and was a judge at the 1952 Olympic Games.

ABC broadcast the race on television beginning at 3 PM US EST while MRN along with Sirius Satellite Radio had radio coverage starting at 2:45 PM US EST. = Qualifying = Jimmie Johnson won the Pole for Sunday's race, while the man closest to him, Carl Edwards starts fifth. = Recap = In a race delayed by rain for almost half an hour, then held up another twenty minutes due to a major accident, Johnson all but clinched the 2008 Sprint Cup Championship, his third in a row. Also, a second major accident happened at the end of the race. When the field came to the finish line to take the checkered flag, Matt Kenseth, knocked A. J. Allmendinger into Juan Pablo Montoya.

NASCAR Chairman Brian France was enraged by this decision: Other broadcast networks since 2001 (when the national television contracts took place) had previously broadcast races to the conclusion, even in rain delay cases. The 2002 UAW-GM Quality 500 at Lowe's Motor Speedway, the 2005 Aaron's 312 (NNS) at Talladega Superspeedway, and the 2005 Pepsi 400 at Daytona International Speedway each ran late past network hours and were retained on the broadcast network until their conclusions. ESPN, on the other hand, pulled a similar \\"Heidi Game\\" rule at the 2007 LifeLock 400 at the Kansas Speedway. Both Phoenix races during the 2008 season had incidents with other events. During the spring race, the broadcast started when the cars were in the dogleg of the first lap. And 20 years ago during the first Cup race at Phoenix, ESPN joined the race after 30 laps had been completed.

The show was animated by Cosgrove Hall Films and created by Isabell Mills and Shanii Novak. Rocky And The Dodos aired on then-new channel Toons & Tunes (later renamed Pop) in 2003. Premise The series focuses on a group of anthropomorphic dodos who live on a remote, rocky island.Entry on ITV studios Accessed 25-03-2017 The action rarely moves away from it. Although the series is recognisably set in the modern day, with aeroplanes and electricity, the island is seemingly unknown to man. Various pieces of man-made detritus, such as household appliances, foodstuffs and furniture, regularly wash up on the island, and often play a central role in episode plots. The dodos have only the vaguest notion of any life away from their island, referring to everything away from the immediate vicinity as 'the beyond', and refer to the semi-mythical beings which populate it as 'Fartians'.  Main characters  Rocky - A young male dodo who lives in a cave with Elvis. He is good-natured, impressionable and always eager for adventure, though Elvis' antics sometimes cause more trouble than he can comfortably handle. Elvis - A bizarre bird who lives with Rocky. It is not made clear how they first met. Elvis resembles a cross between a penguin and a blue-footed booby, though has a long flexible tongue; it is never made clear exactly what species he is (indeed he seems not to know himself). He has an outrageous, excitable manner, and is inclined to cause chaos and mayhem at every opportunity. He is, however, more intelligent than most of the dodos, and enjoys playing tricks on them if he gets the chance. Bill - The rather vain and slightly camp dodo who owns and operates the Loose Juice Bar on the island, where he creates popular (but odd) cocktails. He has a large, prominent quiff of which he is inordinately proud. Wonda - The wife of Bill. She has orange, frizzy hair and wears a necklace of seashells. She is probably (at least in comparison with the others), the cleverest of the dodos, regularly alluding to the words and actions of the 'ancient dodos', and sometimes acts as the group's de facto leader or organiser should a situation require one. Tantra - A young female dodo who has an appearance and mannerism modeled on punk subculture, with her hair dyed bright red and her beak painted in bright colours. She wears a bath-chain (complete with plug) on the end of her beak. She is friendly with Elvis (even replacing Rocky in their cave in one episode), but seems to spend most of her time alone. Astra - A deeply scatterlogical and eccentric female dodo who speaks with an upper-class English accent and lives in the uppermost cave on the island (accessible by a lift seen in the title-sequence). She is obsessed with studying the various objects from 'the beyond' which wash up on the island's shores, and working towards making contact with the 'Fartians'. For all her scholarly airs, she is not very intelligent, and generally misidentifies the things she discovers, thinking for example, that a clothes horse is a skeleton, and that a rubber duck is alive. Dougan - A lazy and less-than-bright walrus who lives at the island's rubbish-dump. Bjorn - An affable Swedish-accented puffin who regularly visits the island. Owing to his ability to fly, he has a far better understanding of 'the beyond' than the dodos. The Limpets - A large, unspecified number of limpets which live both around and on the island. They move much quicker than real limpets, and have prominent eyes on the tops of their shells. Although they do not speak, they have considerable intelligence. They rarely play an important role in stories, but are vital to the island's smooth (as much as this is possible) operation, as they provide power to the various appliances by running in devices which resemble large hamster wheels.

Controversy over the location—in close proximity to Ground Zero—ensued, and in an interview with Larry King on September 8, 2010, Rauf was asked \\"... given what you know now, would you have said, listen, let's not do it there? Because it sounds like you're saying in retrospect wouldn't have done it.\\" Rauf answered: \\"If I knew this would happen, this would cause this kind of pain, I wouldn't have done it. My life has been devoted to peacemaking.\\" On September 12, 2010 on This Week with Christiane Amanpour, Abdul Rauf repeated that if complaints had been raised in December 2009 when the project was front-page news in The New York Times, he would have moved it, but at that time there was broad support for it, which did not change until May. He furthermore expressed concern that a move would be used by radicals internationally to claim that \\"Islam is under attack in the Western world\\".\\"Imam Feisal Abdul Rauf on Islam in America\\". This Week. ABC News. September 12, 2010 On January 14, 2011, Park51 developer Sharif el-Gamal surprised Rauf by unilaterally announcing that Rauf would no longer speak for or raise money for Park51, replacing him with Imam Abdallah Adhami. The split was attributed to a number of differences in vision for the project—Rauf had wanted a larger interfaith center named Cordoba House, but el-Gamal had changed the name to Park51, wanted it to primarily serve Muslims, and to have a local scope. The removal of Rauf from this leadership role raised concerns that the project would be unable to raise the necessary funds to build the planned center. On January 29, Rauf announced that he would move the Cordoba House to a different site if one were offered to him and if the new site was \\"on par, or even better\\" than the current Park51 site. Rental properties Central Avenue in Union City, New Jersey, one of several in Hudson County owned by Rauf. Rauf owns several apartment buildings in Hudson County, New Jersey, including four in Union City, and one in North Bergen in which he lives. By 2010, numerous residents of Rauf's properties in Union City had alleged that those properties have fallen into disrepair over the course of the prior several years, with some of the residents attributing this to time Rauf spends on his activities in Lower Manhattan. On September 8, 2010, Union City Mayor Brian P. Stack, who criticized Rauf as a \\"slumlord\\", announced court actions to have a custodial receiver take over management of these properties, and the creation of a Quality of Life Task Force to identify 15 apartment buildings in need of renovations, including Rauf's.Diaz, Lana Rose. \\"Stack puts landlords on notice\\" The Union City Reporter; September 12, 2010; Pages 3 and 7 A September 15, 2010 hearing revealed that following a September 7 inspection that determined imminent hazards, police began monitoring two of Rauf's buildings, due to inoperable fire alarms and sprinklers, and failure on Rauf's part to hire a private fire patrol. Judge Thomas Olivieri gave Rauf's lawyers until September 23 to produce plans and evidence of efforts to address these violations, lest Rauf face loss of control over the buildings.\\"UC sues landlord and 'Ground Zero Mosque' imam\\" The Union City Reporter; Pages 2 and 5 On November 9, Judge Olivieri placed the Central Avenue property into temporary custodial receivership, with $7,000 in rent payments held in escrow from Rauf's attorney set aside to pay for the repairs.\\"Receivership granted for neglected buildings in UC\\", The Union City Reporter, November 14, 2010, Pages 4 and 31Mestanza, Jean-Pierre. \\"Imam's building in receivership\\", Hudson Dispatch Weekly, November 18, 2010, pages 1 and 7 According to 2010 reports by the Bergen Record, Rauf met with U.S. Senator Robert Menendez around 1991 when Menendez was Mayor of Union City, to request state funds to renovate three of his properties. As a result, Rauf received $80,000 in city funds, $384,000 from the Union City Community Development Agency, $1.3 million in construction loans from Hudson County's Affordable Housing Trust Fund, and $630,900 from the state. Rauf was also sued for fraud in 2008 by his one-time business partner, James Cockinos, over a $250,000 mortgage that Cockinos gave Rauf for his Central Avenue property, ownership of which Rauf then transferred to Sage Developments for a second $650,000 mortgage. Rauf and his wife, Daisy Khan, made payments to Cockinos for 11 years, but ceased after a fire damaged the property. The two parties settled out of court. Reception Fareed Zakaria praised Rauf for speaking of \\"the need for Muslims to live peacefully with all other religions\\", for emphasizing the commonalities among all faiths, for advocating equal rights for women and opposing laws that in any way punish non-Muslims. Walter Isaacson, head of The Aspen Institute, says Rauf \\"has participated at the Aspen Institute in Muslim-Christian-Jewish working groups looking at ways to promote greater religious tolerance. He has consistently denounced radical Islam and terrorism, and promoted a moderate and tolerant Islam.\\" =Views on Hamas= During an interview on New York WABC radio in June 2010, Rauf declined to say whether he agreed with the U.S. State Department's designation of Hamas as a terrorist organization. Responding to the question, Rauf said, \\"Look, I'm not a politician. The issue of terrorism is a very complex question ... I am a peace builder. I will not allow anybody to put me in a position where I am seen by any party in the world as an adversary or as an enemy.\\" Sarah Palin and Lazio criticized his refusal to agree with the assessment of the United States that Hamas is a terrorist organization, and former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani alleged that Rauf had supported radical causes that sympathized with Islamic terrorism. Personal life Rauf's first wife was an American woman who converted to Islam. Rauf later married a Malaysian woman. Rauf has two children with each of his first two wives. He has been married to his third wife Daisy Khan since the late 1990s. Khan, a native of Kashmir, is a professional interior architect, but since 2005 has worked full-time for the two non-profit organizations founded by Rauf, and at times functions as his spokesperson. They live in North Bergen, New Jersey.

It was located in the Penn Quarter neighborhood of Washington, D.C., half a block south of the Gallery Place station. The museum closed in 2015 and is now operated as Alcatraz East, a museum in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee. The museum was built by Orlando businessman John Morgan, in partnership with John Walsh, host of America's Most Wanted, at a cost of $21 million, and opened in May 2008. Unlike most museums in Washington, DC, the Crime Museum was a for-profit enterprise. It was forced to close in September 2015 by its building's owners after it failed to meet sales targets specified in its lease.Stein, P. (August 31, 2015). Crime museum is closing at the end of September. Washington Post archive, retrieved February 22, 2016. More than 700 artifacts in of exhibition space related the history of crime, and its consequences, in America and American popular culture. The museum featured exhibits on colonial crime, pirates, Wild West outlaws, gangsters, the Mob, mass murderers, and white collar criminals. Twenty-eight interactive stations included the high-speed police chase simulators used in the training of law enforcement officers, and a Firearms Training Simulator (F.A.T.S.) similar to that utilized by the FBI. The galleries  The main floor was devoted to a staged crime scene investigation of a simulated murder. Visitors to the museum were guided through the process of solving the crime through forensic science techniques, including ballistics, blood analysis, finger printing and foot printing, and dental and facial reconstruction. The museum included a mock police station with a booking room, celebrity mug shots, police line-up, lie detector test, prisoners' art and jail-made weapons and escape tools, and a re-creation of the jail cell of Al Capone at the Eastern State Penitentiary in Philadelphia. A capital punishment room offered a re-creation of a guillotine and gas chamber, along with an authentic lethal injection machine from the state prison in Smyrna, Delaware, and an electric chair from the Tennessee State Prison in Nashville which was used for 125 executions. The crime- fighting gallery drew attention to such notables as founding FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, and the legendary law enforcement agent Eliot Ness. It also included the uniforms, firearms, and restraining equipment of law enforcement officers, as well as exhibits on bomb squad and night vision technologies. America's Most Wanted studio At one time the museum served as the television studio for America's Most Wanted, a long-running (1988–2013) television series that dramatized unsolved crimes. The television program led to the capture of more than 1,000 fugitives (16 from the FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives) due to the crime tips reported by the public when criminals were profiled. When the series switched to on-location shooting, the studio was converted into an interactive exhibit where visitors could solve a hypothetical crime. Surrounding the studio were exhibits on the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and McGruff the Crime Dog, as well as a Cross Match Technologies station for child finger printing.

It stars Matt Reaves and Anthony Bianchi. Plot Joe Johnson is a young college student in desperate need of a room to rent. Due to initially ambiguous reasons, he cannot return to the city that he has come from, and, having spent the previous month draining his savings in a hotel room, he is prepared to settle for any living arrangement, regardless of the conditions. He ultimately rents a room from a fellow college student named Tom, in spite of the latter's warnings that he is exclusively seeking to rent the room to a dedicated Christian. Given that Joe is only a lukewarm Christian at best, his lax attitude towards the faith causes tensions between him and his new roommate, culminating in a life- changing confrontation. Cast and characters * Matt Reaves as Joe, a college student running from his past and afraid to accept personal responsibility. * Anthony Bianchi as Tom, a victim of a tragic past who seeks to ease the pain of it by burying himself in religion. * Rachael Norman as Anna, Joe's best friend and a lesbian with hostile feelings towards organized religion given the bigotry she has suffered because of it. * Ashneel Kumar as Tim, a follower of Tom's who is also seeking to find his way through God. * Amandeep Lehal as Muhammad, a Muslim friend of Joe's who seeks to convert his friend to what he believes is the true path. * Richard Britt as Phillip Washington, an unscrupulous profiteer whose primary motivation is money. * Phyllis Britt as the kindly lady. Themes The Crusader is a film that tackles such issues as religion in the modern day world, homosexuality, friendship, betrayal and hipocrisy. Through its characters, it observes the everyday complexities with regard to such aforementioned topics and how they impact individual people. For example, Joe is a character often torn between his personal principals, and those of religious faiths. He professes to be a devout Catholic, and yet he defends his best friend against his roommate, who opposes her homosexuality on religious grounds. Furthermore, Joe's defense of his friend's preference doesn't prevent him from using anti-gay slurs. In addition, while he claims to be a practicing Catholic, his crude behavior and poor decisions suggest otherwise. He is a walking contradiction, so much so that when his Muslim friend Muhammad attempts to persuade him to join Islam, he does so by pointing out as a black man, his ancestors most likely had Christianity forced onto them as slaves.

His name has also been written as Lemaistre and Le Maître, and he sometimes used the pseudonym of Lamy. Background and early life Le Maistre was the son of Isaac Le Maistre, a king's counsellor, and of Catherine Arnauld, who was the eldest daughter of the lawyer Antoine Arnauld (1560–1619) and the granddaughter of another Antoine Arnauld, seigneur de la Mothe. The Arnaulds were a family of the lesser nobility which had come to Paris from the Auvergne during the 16th century. Le Maistre's grandfather Arnauld, a well known lawyer, defended the University of Paris against charges laid by the Jesuits in 1594 and presented his case so forcefully that his defense has been called the original sin of the Arnaulds. He married Catherine Marion de Druy, and they had twenty children, of whom ten died young. All but one of their ten surviving children were connected with the Jansenist abbey of Port-Royal des Champs. In 1629, Arnauld's widow, Le Maistre's grandmother, became a nun at Port-Royal de Paris, where she died in 1641. Among her children were Antoine Arnauld (1612–1694), called the Great Arnauld, the leading Jansenist theologian of the 17th century in France; Jacqueline-Marie-Angélique Arnauld, known as Mère Angélique, who became abbess of Port-Royal des Champs, transferred the religious community to Paris and made it into a great centre of Jansenism; Jeanne-Catherine-Agnès Arnauld, known as Mère Agnès, also an abbess of Port- Royal; Henri Arnauld (1597–1692), who after a diplomatic career was ordained as a priest and went on to become bishop of Angers; and three other daughters who became nuns of Port-Royal des Champs.H., A. K., Angélique of Port-Royal 1591-1661 (London, Skeffington & Son, 1905) At the age of seven, the young Le Maistre moved with his mother and brothers into the household of his grandfather Antoine Arnauld and was brought up there. Influenced towards a career in the law, after his grandfather's death Le Maistre also considered going into the church, but he trained as a lawyer.Sedgwick, Alexander, The Travails of Conscience: The Arnauld Family and the Ancien Régime (Harvard University Press, 1998) page 82 online at books.google.co.uk, accessed 25 June 2008 Career Jean du Vergier de Hauranne, abbot of Saint-Cyran Le Maistre quickly became a famous young advocate, with Guez de Balzac writing of him that his \\"powerful, rich and magnificent harangues would have aroused jealousy in Cicero and Demosthenes\\". But at the time of the civil war called the Fronde, Le Maistre spectacularly gave up the bar and retired to Port-Royal at the instigation of Jean du Vergier de Hauranne, abbot of Saint-Cyran, placing himself under Saint-Cyran's spiritual direction. Le Maistre was then a little less than thirty. He announced his decision in a letter to his father written after three months of reflection.Antoine Le Maistre (1608-1658) at amisdeportroyal.org (web site of the Société des Amis de Port-Royal), accessed 25 June 2008 Le Maistre's withdrawal from public affairs displeased Cardinal Richelieu, who was unhappy at the loss of a talented jurist. On 10 January 1638 Antoine and his brother Simon Le Maistre settled at Port Royal de Paris, where they were soon joined by their brothers Louis-Isaac, Jean and Charles. Later the same year, Le Maistre and others, including two of his brothers, established a Jansenist ascetic group known as les solitaires (the hermits) at Port-Royal des Champs, under the spiritual direction of the abbot of Saint Cyran.Arnauld Family at concise.britannica.com, accessed 25 June 2008 At the request of Saint Cyran, the brothers Le Maistre took children into their homes to teach them according to Cyranian principles. The arrest of Saint-Cyran on 14 May 1638 put an end to this life of the solitaires as teachers. First of the Solitaires, Antoine Le Maistre settled permanently at Port Royal des Champs in August 1639, where he led a quiet and austere life. In about 1644, he was joined in his ascetic religious community by his uncle Robert Arnauld d'Andilly (1588–1674), a poet and translator whose career had been in the government's service and who became the editor of Saint-Cyran's Lettres chrétiennes et spirituelles (1645). Le Maistre's uncle Antoine Arnauld Le Maistre became a friend of Jean Racine and dedicated himself to translation work and to writing the lives of saints. He claimed that France's long- standing affiliation with freedom was to do with its being a Christian nation. He wrote:Peabody, Sue, There Are No Slaves in France: The Political Culture of Race and Slavery in the Ancien Régime (Oxford University Press, 1996), p. 22 With his cousin Angélique de Saint-Jean, Le Maistre persuaded their aunt Angélique Arnault, abbess of Port-Royal, to write an autobiography, which was mostly the story of her community's heroic resistance in the face of its religious tribulations.Sedgwick, Alexander, op. cit. p. 8 In 1656, an anti- Jansenist campaign was mounting in France, and Le Maistre went into hiding in Paris with his uncle Antoine Arnauld, then on trial for Jansenist views before the Faculty of Theology in Paris, and with the philosopher Pascal, who before that had been living at Port-Royal. Le Maistre helped Pascal to write Lettres provinciales (1656–1657), a series of letters in defence of Arnauld. Le Maistre died on 4 November 1658 after a short illness, leaving a considerable body of work. His youngest brother was Louis-Isaac Le Maistre de Sacy (1613–84), also a follower of Saint-Cyran. He was ordained a priest in 1649, became confessor to the nuns of Port-Royal and the solitaires, and was much respected by the Jansenists. At the time of his death, Antoine Le Maistre had begun a new translation of the New Testament. This was continued by his brother Isaac, who became its principal translator. The new work was published in 1667 as Le Nouveau Testament de Nostre Seigneur Jesus Christ: traduit en François selon l'edition Vulgate, avec les differences du Grec, and printed in Amsterdam for Gaspard Migeot, a bookseller of Mons. It thus became known as the Nouveau Testament de Mons, or the Testament of Mons.Horne, Thomas Hartwell, An Introduction to the Critical Study and Knowledge of the Holy Scriptures Volume II (New York, Robert Carter & Brothers, new edition, 1852) Sect. 6, p. 45 online at books.google.co.uk (accessed 25 June 2008)Saifullah, M S M, The Canons of the Old Testament & the New Testament through the Ages at islamic-awareness.org, accessed 25 June 2008 Likenesses Le Maistre's brother Louis-Isaac Le Maistre de Sacy, studio of Philippe de Champaigne Le Maistre's portrait was painted by Philippe de Champaigne (1602–1674), a painter who was closely connected with Port-Royal des Champs.Lesaulnier, Jean, Philippe de Champaigne et Port-Royal: témoignages, chapter 4, 'Les secrets d'une correspondance: à propos du portrait d'Antoine Le Maistre' A copy exists, but the original is lost.Liste des oeuvres de Champaigne Philippe de (1602-1674) dans la catégorie \\"Peintures\\" at photormn.com, accessed 25 June 2008 The portrait was later engraved by Charles Simonneau.

They may also contain radio and radio beacons. The navigation buoy was to be monitored remotely from onshore and was designed to run for extended periods without repair. The running costs were estimated to be as little as 10% of those of a lightship. They are now obsolete. Equipment The original UK models followed the General Dynamics design: power was supplied by three diesel alternators of 230 V, individually rated at 5 kW continuous output. These were each run in a 72-hour operational cycle of 24 hours under power, followed by 48 at rest. Maintenance and refuelling was at six-monthly intervals. A static rectifier provided continuous power at 28 V DC, charging a nickel-iron accumulator to operate the xenon discharge tube main light and the ancillary equipment, including a UHF telemetry link to a monitoring shore station. The Hawker Siddeley models incorporated components from the original General Dynamics design but only two diesel generator sets, one running continuously for six months and one on standby, were found to be sufficient. Revolving sealed-beam main lights were substituted for the discharge tubes because the rotating beams were more easily seen than the original short- duration flashes. Withdrawal Experience showed that it was difficult to attain the required reliability in British waters due to the high acceleration forces experienced in rough seas with 14m waves and 7 knot currents. Alternative experiments were made with more stable platforms, such as the Royal Sovereign Lighthouse—a concrete tower on a flat base constructed on shore, floated into place and sunk to rest on the seabed. The automatic technology was later used successfully in more conventional lightships, such as the Calshot Spit lightvessel. A Lanby buoy replaced the Bar Lightship PLANET in the Mersey estuary in 1972 and remained in service for 21 years before itself being replaced.

The book was also printed under the title Angel of Grozny: Orphans of a Forgotten War. Background Åsne Seierstad first visited Chechnya in 1994 (aged just 24) during the First Chechen War. In 2006, she returned to the region to examine its progress. In the intervening period, Chechnya had been ravaged by a second civil war after disputed elections were won by Russian-backed Akhmad Kadyrov. During this conflict Russian control of the province was re-established, a process which caused enormous loss of life and widespread destruction of buildings and infrastructure. In 2003, the United Nations described the Chechen capital Grozny as the most destroyed city in the world. Foreign journalists are not generally allowed into Chechnya, and Seierstad did most of her travelling and research in disguise with her hair dyed. Summary Angel of Grozny attempts to give an accessible and impartial account of the complicated historical and political forces at play in the Chechen conflict whilst also describing her encounters with combatants and civilians on both sides. The book features an account of her meeting with Chechen President Ramzan Kadyrov. As well as trying to understand the mindset of the Chechen and Russian people, one of the books key themes is the exposure of corruption in the process of reconstructing Chechnya. The Angel of Grozny of the book's title is a Chechen woman Hadijat Gatayeva who has turned their home into an orphanage for street children of the war. Criticism A criticism often levelled at Åsne Seierstad is her tendency to present personal stories which have not been fully cross-checked for accuracy. Her style, blending historical facts with personal accounts, sometimes blurs the boundary between fact and fiction and language gaps can cause misunderstandings. By focusing on such a small group of individuals to present her case, she fails to prove any abuses or wrongdoing is systemic, and therefore cannot easily hold people to account for their actions. In Angel of Grozny she goes a step further by writing some sections of the book in the third person. She describes events she did not witness, often in vivid and evocative language which is ill-suited to the actual person telling the story. The Manchester Guardian reviewer described the \\"blurring of reportage and imagined scenes\\" as \\"sometimes uncomfortable\\".When the Russian bear roared, The Guardian, March 9, 2008 References External links * Author Asne Seierstad enters hell with the angel of Grozny, The Sunday Times, March 2, 2008 * Where angels dare to tread, The Guardian, March 3, 2008 * Grozny's children, The Guardian, March 3, 2008 * Angels of war, Irish Times, March 15, 2008 * Grozny's lost boys, The Sydney Morning Herald, March 22, 2008 * An angel in a hell on earth, Irish Independent, March 22, 2008 * Everyday terrors, The Guardian, March 29, 2008 * Witness to horror, The Sunday Business Post, April 20, 2008 Category:2007 books Category:Books about Chechnya Category:Chechen culture Category:Norwegian books ","title":"Angel of Grozny"},{"id":"18133312","text":"HD 82785 is star in the southern constellation of Antlia.

Early life Collett Leventhorpe was born on the 15th of May, 1815 to Thomas Leventhorpe and Mary Collett in Exmouth, Devon, England. Thomas died, probably of tuberculosis, about nine weeks after Collett's birth. Leventhorpe's ancestry could be traced back to the 14th century and was connected to royalty through marriage and service.Hess, p. 43.Cole and Foley, pp. 2-13. His older brother Thomas Leventhorpe was a first-class cricketer for Cambridge University.Cole and Foley, p. 17. Leventhorpe studied at Winchester College until the age of fourteen. For the next three years he was educated by a private tutor. In 1832 Leventhorpe purchased the rank of ensign in the 14th Regiment of Foot (the Buckinghamshire's), in the army of King William IV. Leventhorpe was stationed in Ireland for the next three years. He purchased a lieutenancy on the 2nd of November, 1835, and was stationed in the British West Indies. After several years of duty there he spent a year in Canada. Leventhorpe reached the level of Captain of Grenadiers, on the 16th of November, 1842. He then transferred to the 18th Regiment of Foot and on the 24th of October, 1842 he sold his Captaincy in order to travel to South Carolina on business for an English company. Antebellum life In 1843, while on an extended holiday in the United States, Leventhorpe traveled to Asheville, North Carolina, where he met his future wife, Louisa Bryan, daughter of General Edmund Bryan, of Rutherfordton, NC. Leventhorpe entered the Medical College of Charleston in Charleston, South Carolina. He graduated at the top of his class then married Louisa on April 1, 1849 and the couple made their home in Rutherfordton. Leventhorpe never practiced medicine. In 1849, Leventhorpe applied for and was granted United States citizenship. Civil War When North Carolina seceded Leventhorpe offered his military services to his adopted state. His community standing and military background won him the rank of colonel in the 34th North Carolina Infantry. He spent the early months of the War drilling and disciplining the regiment and by December he was given temporary command of a brigade. During the winter of 1861-62 he was at Fort Branch near Hamilton, North Carolina guarding the Roanoke River and the Weldon Railroad Bridge. In April 1862 he was transferred to the 11th North Carolina, elected its colonel and was sent to the Atlantic coast to head the District of Wilmington. Later that year he manned the defenses along Virginia's Blackwater River. Returning to North Carolina in December, he led his troops impressively at the Battle of White Hall, which slowed Federals under Brigadier General John G. Foster in their advance toward Goldsboro, North Carolina. In mid-December, Leventhorpe's 11th North Carolina was attached to the brigade of Brig. Gen. J. Johnston Pettigrew.Hess, pp. 76-77. During this period, Leventhorpe complained that he was being held back from higher command because of his foreign birth and lack of political connections, though he was offered a command in the cavalry but declined it due to his lack of experience in that branch.Hess, pp. 82; 104. After helping repulse an attack during the Siege of Washington, in April 1863, Pettigrew's Brigade joined General Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia for the Gettysburg Campaign as part of Major General Henry Heth's division in Lieutenant General A. P. Hill's Corps. With the rest of Heth's command, the 11th North Carolina participated in the July 1 fighting at the Battle of Gettysburg. Leventhorpe was seriously wounded in fighting against the Iron Brigade after flanking the 19th Indiana south of Herbst's Woods. He was wounded in the left arm, shattering the bone, and hip and was removed from the field.Hess, p. 125. Leventhorpe was captured by Union cavalry during the retreat to Virginia. The Union surgeon tending to him detected that gangrene had set in his wound and suggested amputation but Leventhorpe refused, so submitted to allowing the surgeon to cauterize the wound with nitric acid and Leventhorpe refused anesthesia, saying he \\"would have died, rather than let an enemy see that a Confederate Officer could not endure anything without a complaint.\\"Hess, p. 174. His arm discharged bone fragments for three months. He survived the operation, but was held at Fort McHenry and Point Lookout for eight months before he was exchanged, with friends in England sending him money to purchase necessities while held in prison. After he was released, he resigned his commission with the 11th North Carolina and took command of one of the North Carolina Home Guard brigades tracking down deserters. He was later commissioned brigadier general of state troops and he defended the Roanoke River, Fort Branch, and the Petersburg & Weldon Railroad. His state generalship made him the Confederacy's only English born soldier to hold that rank. On February 18, 1865, he also became a Brigadier General in the Confederate ranks, but 3 weeks later he refused the appointment, choosing instead to remain in state service. His troops defended Raleigh when Major General William T. Sherman marched through North Carolina. He and his men retreated to Greensboro, where they surrendered on April 26, 1865.Hess, p. 312.Foley & Whicker, pp. 25; 30; 104; 108. Post-War career After the war, Leventhorpe was involved in several business enterprises and politics following the War. He and his wife moved to New York City and also traveled frequently to England. Leventhorpe was sympathetic to the Ku Klux Klan during Radical Reconstruction, though no record exists of his joining the Klan. He eventually settled in Wilkes County, North Carolina, where he died on the 1st of December, 1889.

Known as Bensville Road, the state highway runs from MD 227 near Pomfret north to MD 228 near Bennsville. MD 229 passes through the community of Bennsville in northern Charles County. The state highway was originally constructed as part of MD 228 in the late 1920s. When MD 228 was extended west to Accokeek in the mid 1990s, MD 229 was assigned to Bensville Road. Route description View north at the south end of MD 229 at MD 227 near Pomfret MD 229 begins at an intersection with MD 227 (Marshall Corner Road) near Pomfret. The state highway heads north as a two-lane undivided road through a forested area, intersecting the Indian Head Rail Trail and crossing over Old Womans Run. MD 229 continues through scattered residential subdivisions in the community of Bennsville, where the highway intersects Billingsley Road, a major east-west county highway connecting Bryans Road with St. Charles. The state highway veers northeast, paralleling Mattawoman Creek to its northern terminus at MD 228 (Berry Road) just south of the Prince George's County line. History Bensville Road is the second highway to be designated MD 229. MD 229 was originally assigned to Morgantown Road between Morgantown and MD 3 (now MD 257) in Wayside in southern Charles County. Morgantown Road was constructed as a modern highway by 1921. MD 229 served as the connection to a Potomac River ferry that operated between Morgantown and Colonial Beach, Virginia from 1933 to at least the early 1940s. Morgantown Road was removed from the state highway system in 1956. Bensville Road was originally part of MD 228. The highway was constructed as a gravel road from Pomfret to Bennsville in 1925 and 1926. The remainder of Bensville Road was built in 1927. The MD 228 designation was removed from Bensville Road after that highway was extended to Accokeek in southwestern Prince George's County in 1995. MD 229 was assigned to Bensville Road by 1997.

It was formed 600 million years ago, as part of the Avalon terrane.Roadside Geology of Massachusetts, James W. Skehan, 2001 During the 19th century, the City of Fall River, Massachusetts became famous for the granite rock on which much of the city is built. The ridge extends approximately from the village of Assonet in the north through Fall River and into Tiverton, Rhode Island in the south, along the edge of the basin that forms Narragansett Bay. The eastern edge of the underlying granite is the Hixville Fault near Dartmouth, Massachusetts. Description From a distance, the rock exhibits a distinctive tan-gray color. Viewed up close, it is more pink. The granite is very hard and durable, but cannot be polished very well. As a result, its appearance on a building is almost always somewhat rough, rather than the sharp lines of other types of building stone. Edmund Hitchcock, of the 1841 Geological Survey of Massachusetts gave the following description of the granite: > But no rock can be finer for architectural purposes than the granite of > Troy[Fall River]...The feldspar of this rock is a mixture of the flesh red > and light green varieties; the former predominating: the quartz is light > gray, and the mica, usually black... it works easily and has a lighter and > more lively appearance than Quincy granite. (1841 Google Books) Historical context The granite quarry industry in Fall River had been established by 1840, employing 30 people, with the rock being transported to places such as Newport, New Bedford, Providence, Bristol, and New York City. Several granite quarries operated in the area in the late 19th century, the largest of which was the Beattie Granite Quarry, located near what is now North Quarry Street, near the corner of Locust Street in Fall River.2003 Herald News article on Fall River granite Originally called the Harrison Quarry, consisting of fewer than three acres, brothers William and John Beattie purchased the site near the end of the Civil War.South Coast Today \\"Quarry days: Fall River built with granite\\" After its abandonment in the late 1920s, the area began to filling with water from natural underground springs and aquifers. During the 1940s and 50s, the city used the pit as an open dump. In the mid 1960s, the area was reclaimed with the help of clean fill. It was acquired by the Fall River Housing Authority which built Oak Village in 1965, an apartment complex for the disabled and elderly. It may need to be razed. At least two of the buildings' floors have cracked, causing the walls to tilt. It has been attributed to settling of the stratified and poorly compacted layers of dirt-covered trash now filling the old quarry.Herald News, May 15, 2011 Another notable source of this granite was from the \\"Assonet Ledge\\" Quarry located in what now is Freetown-Fall River State Forest, located in Freetown, Massachusetts. The remains of the old railroad grade used to transport the stone from the quarry are still visible within the state forest. Examples of use Many of the cotton textile mills in the city were built from this native stone, and it was highly regarded as a building material for many public buildings and private homes alike. Examples of the stones use within Fall River include St. Mary's Cathedral, The Fall River Historical Society Mansion and the base of St. Anne's Church. The first floor of the former B.M.C. Durfee High School building in Fall River is also constructed of native granite. Another fine example of the use of this material was the Notre Dame de Lourdes Church, Fall River Massachusetts. The entire lower portion of this structure below the roof and steeples was constructed of Fall River granite. Unfortunately this building was destroyed by fire on May 11, 1982. The Chateau-sur-Mer mansion in Newport, Rhode Island is perhaps the best example of Fall River granite being used for private home construction.

The soldiers included members of North Carolina's 58th Regiment of the Confederate Army. The regiment had been formed at Camp Martin in Mitchell County, North Carolina. They had traveled from Cumberland Gap to Jacksboro, and were assigned to guard Big Creek Gap. There were approximately 1,000 soldiers camped at Jacksboro. In addition to North Carolina, there were soldiers from Tennessee and Alabama. The cemetery was kept up until the 1960s, but had fallen into disrepair. While the plot of land was known to be a cemetery due to the sunken graves, knowledge that it was a military burial ground had been lost. Since Campbell County was strongly pro- Union in sentiment, there was no knowledge of a C.S.A. burial ground. However, a North Carolina descendant of one of the soldiers visited Campbell County in December 2002 and produced documents verifying the deaths of 50 soldiers at the base of Pine Mountain. After her visit, the local community began work to clear the cemetery. Fifty military tombstones have been set up at the cemetery.

He became dean of faculty of arts at Shanghai's Aurora University.

Veneration Chang's body was returned to the Church the next day on November 12 and Shanghai's Catholics began to venerate him as a martyr, turning out in great numbers for a series of requiem Masses.

Carpenter House is a Georgian Revival-style house located in Loring Hills, the mansion district in turn-of-the-century Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States. The house was built in 1887 by C.M Douglas, who owned a coal delivery business. 300 Clifton was built in the Queen Anne style, with prominent porches and a turret in the southeast. Harvey Brown, a successful businessman and banker bought the house in 1890 and lived there until his death in 1904. The house was purchased in 1905 by Eugene and Merrette Carpenter and was owned by the family until 1948. This constitutes the historically significant time period. Eugene Carpenter and Merrette Lamb came from lumber milling families and were owners of the Carpenter-Lamb Lumber Co. of Minneapolis. The Carpenters were also significant patrons of the arts and Eugene Carpenter played a pivotal role in establishing the Minneapolis Institute of Arts. Renovation After purchasing the house in November 1905, the Carpenters hired a young and promising architect, Edwin Hawley Hewitt, who had recently finished his schooling in Paris. The task was daunting. Hewitt was asked to turn the Victorian style house into a Georgian Revival style house. “About as different as can be,” said Olivia (Carpenter) Coan who was 9 years old in 1906 during the renovation. Hewitt removed the roof, moved fireplaces, built additional foundations, moved interior and exterior walls and rebuilt the carriage house from the foundation up all in time for the family to move in by September 1906, 10 months after the purchase. The house features some remarkable architectural designs implemented by Hewitt. The French drain was invented in 1885, and Hewitt brought the concept back to Minneapolis and implemented it throughout the grounds. Johnson Controls had recently patented a revolutionary thermostat that allowed for temperature control, room to room. The Carpenters included this pneumatic system in their house. Hewitt designed an effective passive cooling system for the house which made use of massive concrete porches to moderate the temperatures inside the house. John S Bradstreet, a prominent Minneapolis designer, did the interior design of the house. Bradstreet collaborated with Hewitt and Carpenter to bring Arts and Crafts style to the house. Description 300 Clifton faces south towards Clifton Ave, has 14 bedrooms, 11 bathrooms and sits on a one- acre double lot. The north edge of the property is bordered by a low bluff which forms the foundation of the 6500 square foot carriage house. The main house is 12,000 square feet. All three of the original fireplaces are still functional. A focal point of the house is the gardens to the east. Historical significance Carpenter, Hewitt, and Bradstreet developed a friendship through their work on the 300 Clifton project and continued their friendship through the establishment of the Minneapolis Institute of Arts. Bradstreet was the president of the floundering Minneapolis Society of Fine Art when he invited Carpenter to come aboard to help the group realize its ultimate goal of creating an Art Museum for Minneapolis. Carpenter was a marketing, promoting and financing genius. In 1911, Carpenter as the new president of the Minneapolis Society of Fine Art organized an art show and personally invited 400 prominent businessmen to a private viewing. Every recipient attended. From this, Carpenter began his campaign to build a publicly funded museum in a manner that had never been done before. Carpenter secured a donation of land worth $250,000 and used this to electrify the many businessmen to donate to his new cause. In a single fund raising dinner, Carpenter hosted 200 local businessmen and received pledges for over a half million dollars. The edifice was funded and built in 1915. With Hewitt as president and Carpenter as Vice-President of the new museum, their work had just begun. The Minneapolis Art Society only owned 12 objects of art. For the rest of his life, Carpenter worked to excite and motivate the people of Minneapolis to become patrons of the arts. He encouraged corporations to donate and for well heeled businessmen to learn about art and purchase art around the world. Today the MIA has over 80,000 objects of art, but more importantly, by enlisting the participation of so many in the community, Carpenter jump started the creative sector which has come to define Minneapolis. Through his unique style of fund raising he gave birth to a tradition of corporate sponsorship of the arts which has been a key ingredient in the flourishing Minneapolis art community. 300 Clifton as a multi-unit building The Carpenter family sold the house after Merrette's death in 1946. The Mack family purchased the 300 Clifton and subdivided the house into several smaller living units. While the Mack family owned the house from 1946 to 1963, the house was kept impeccably in keeping with the other homes in the mansion district. =Families of note during the 1950s and 1960s= Several prominent families resided at the high-end 300 Clifton living spaces throughout the 1950s and 1960s. *John Warner, the President of Hanna Coal Company, lived at 300 Clifton for many years in the 1950s. *Forest Selvig, a primary curator at the Walker and then a director at Minneapolis Institute of Arts lived in the carriage house flat for many years in the same decade. *Richard Heiny and David V Peterson who were the primary designers at LaVoy's, a preeminent Minneapolis design firm, also lived at 300 Clifton. *Attorney Emerson Hopp lived at 300 Clifton for many years. Hopp is famous for representing the Oglala Sioux tribe in several treaty disputes which include the land of the Twin Cities and the bottom third of Minnesota. Hopp won 20 million dollars in settlements in favor of the tribes he represented. *Oscar- winning actress Jessica Tandy and her husband Hume Cronyn lived in the house while they were in Minneapolis for the inaugural season of the Guthrie in 1963. In the 1960s the Mack family sold the house to the Klein brothers who decided to demolish the old house as it fell into significant disrepair. It is unclear how the house escaped the wrecking ball at that time. 300 Clifton as an office In 1973 David Beide saved the house in more ways than one. First he repurposed the troubled property into an office building. Beide also owned 314 Clifton Ave, the Elbert L Carpenter house next door. Together he called the two properties Clifton Court. Second, Beide accomplished listing both of the properties on the National Historic Register, protecting them in perpetuity. Beide transferred the property to his friend and tenant Bill Urseth who developed the property tremendously over the next decade. Urseth built a new building at 310 Clifton between the two Carpenter homes. Among all three buildings, Clifton Court at that time housed 150 employees. After Urseth sold in 1993, 300 Clifton remained an office for twenty more years, but fell into considerable disrepair. Neighbors behind 300 Clifton on Oak Grove were forced to paint the house and rebuild the retaining wall that was crumbling onto their property. The Loring neighborhood group (Citizens for a Loring Park Community), invested $30,000 to fix the roof in order to save the historic structure.

The novel is loosely based on the author's own journey into rural China, which was inspired by a false diagnosis of lung cancer. The novel is a part autobiographical, part fictional account of a man's journey to find the fabled mountain Lingshan. It is a combination of story fragments, travel accounts, unnamed characters (referred to by the pronouns \\"I\\", \\"you\\", \\"she\\", etc.), and folk poetry/legends. An English version translated by Mabel Lee was published in the United States on December 5, 2000. Plot The first of the two characters to be introduced is \\"You\\". He is described as a local tourist – \\"not that sort of tourist\\" but a backpacking one \\"wearing strong sensible sports shoes and a backpack with shoulder straps\\". He seeks out the elusive Lingshan, a sacred mountain. \\"You\\" has long lived in the city, but yearns for a rural existence from the past He shuns the idea of settling for \\"a peaceful and stable existence\\" where one wants to \\"find a not-too-demanding sort of a job, stay in a mediocre position, become a husband and a father, set up a comfortable home, put money in the bank and add to it every month so there'll be something for old age and a little left over for the next generation\\". \\"You\\" meets up with another wanderer, a troubled and emotional \\"She\\". And so \\"You\\"'s journey also becomes a journey into an erotic relationship. \\"You\\" also travels inwards as he explores his powers as a storyteller. Later in \\"You\\"'s story, \\"She\\" departs \\"as if in a story, as if in a dream\\". Meanwhile, \\"I\\" is a writer and academic who travels to Sichuan after having been misdiagnosed of a terminal lung cancer. He wants to take a break and start looking for an \\"authentic life\\"—meaning the opposite of that of the state's concept of real life. The characters' sense of humanity is revealed during their quest. \\"I\\" realizes that he still craves the warmth of human society, despite its anxieties. =Structure= Soul Mountain is essentially a two-part novel featuring two main characters—known only as \\"You\\" and \\"I\\". The \\"You\\" character occupies the odd-numbered chapters 1–31 and the even-numbered chapters from 32–80, while the \\"I\\" character's includes even-numbered chapters 2–30 and odd-numbered chapters 33–81. Writing process =Autobiographical influences= In the early 1980s, Gao Xingjian faced a great deal of criticism in the wake of the Chinese Cultural Revolution. It was during this time, in 1983, that the author was diagnosed with lung cancer during a regular health screening. With the memory of his father's death by the same cause just two years earlier still fresh in his memory, Xingjian resigned himself to death, which brought about a \\"transcendent tranquillity\\". However, soon after this diagnosis, an x-ray revealed that his lung cancer was non-existent. At this time Xingjian heard rumors of plans to have him sent to the hellish prison farms of Qinghai province, and thus quickly made the decision to flee Beijing. This decision led him to begin the journey that forms much of the autobiographical portion of the novel. The journey commences in the forests of Sichuan province and continues along the Yangtze River to the coast. The protagonist ostensively searches for Lingshan (Soul Mountain), but in fact the novel describes \\"one man's quest for inner peace and freedom\\" The journey, both in the author's life and in the narrative, include visits to the districts of Qiang, Miao and Yi, located on the fringes of Han Chinese civilization; excursions into several nature reserves; and stops at Buddhist and Daoist institutions. =Political and cultural influences= An important and critical aspect of, and influence on the novel was the political and cultural environment in which it was written. The novel was begun in 1982, shortly after the ending of the Cultural Revolution in 1976. Additionally, traditional Chinese culture promotes the Confucian ideology of dissolution of the self and promotion of subservience and conformity. The combination of traditional conformity and the \\"self-sacrificing\\" ideology of the Chinese Communist Revolution effectively silenced artists and writers who depended on their creativity of self-expression. Thus, under these circumstances, Gao Xingjian left his native country to finish Soul Mountain in 1989 in Paris, and Mabel Lee describes the novel as \\"a literary response to the devastation of the self\\". Publication 2000 cover of the English version of Soul Mountain Soul Mountain was first published by the Taipei-based press agency Lianjing Chubanshe (聯經出版社, Linking Publishing Company) in 1990. It was then published first in Swedish 1992 by Göran Malmqvist, member of the Swedish Academy and close friend of the author; in 1995 it was translated and published into French by Liliane and Noël Dutrait by the title of '. In 2000, it was published with an English translation by Mabel Lee, by Flamingo/HarperCollins in Australia. Reception In a review published in 2000, after Gao's Nobel win, The New York Times said \\"His 81 chapters are an often bewildering and considerably uneven congeries of forms: vignettes, travel writing, ethnographic jottings, daydreams, nightmares, recollections, conversations, lists of dynasties and archeological artifacts, erotic encounters, legends, current history, folklore, political, social and ecological commentary, philosophical epigrams, vivid poetical evocation and much else.\\" The Times continues: \\"A novel in theory, 'Soul Mountain' is more nearly a collection of the musings, memories and poetic, sometimes mystical fantasies of a gifted, angry writer.\\" Publisher's Weekly called it Gao's \\"largest and perhaps most personal work\\". The Yale Review of Books wrote: \\"Blazing a new trail for the Chinese novel, Gao Xinjian's Soul Mountain combines autobiography, the supernatural, and social commentary\\".http://www.yale.edu/yrb/summer01/review12.htm The entry on the novel in Enotes notes: \\"While many critics have found Gao's inventive storytelling techniques to be the novel's most remarkable feature, others have found the novel to be overly self-indulgent and alienating to the reader\\".http://www.enotes.com/contemporary-literary-criticism/xingjian-gao References =Bibliography=  * Category:1990 novels Category:20th- century Chinese novels Category:Novels set in China Category:Works by Gao Xingjian Category:Chinese autobiographical novels ","title":"Soul Mountain"},{"id":"18133752","text":"Sankore Mosque in Timbuktu Tourism in Mali is not well developed. Due to issues with infrastructure, tourism had been slow to grow but had seen improvements prior to the 2002 Africa Cup of Nations. However, due to the Northern Mali conflict and threats from terrorism, all major tour operators have withdrawn services which saw a decrease in tourists from 200,000 in 2011 to 10,000 the following year. The nation has four UNESCO World Heritage Sites, including Timbuktu. Overview Development of the tourist industry was hindered by the country's inadequate transport infrastructure and a shortage of hotels for visitors. Mali hosted the Africa Cup of Nations soccer tournament in 2002. In preparation for this event, the government implemented a social development programme called \\"Mali 2002\\". The tourist industry benefited from this programme. However, since then, ongoing conflicts have caused tourism to dwindle due to the ongoing risks of attacks against foreign nationals. In the early 2000s, around 90,000 tourists visited Mali each year. This had increased to 200,000 by 2011, but following attacks against tourists and the withdrawal by tour operators, this decreased to 10,000 in the following year. =Warnings against tourism= Since 2012, the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office recommends against all but essential travel to several areas of the country, and a complete ban on travel to others. While this does not mean that travellers from the UK cannot travel there, they would have to do so independently and without insurance. There are no direct flights to Mali from the United Kingdom, nor do any major British tour operators offer travel to the country. It describes the situation in Mali as \\"still unstable and there is a high threat from terrorism, attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places frequented by expatriates and foreign travellers.\\", and highlights potential retaliation against Western tourists following the 2013 intervention by France in the Northern Mali conflict. Attractions =Festivals= The country had been noted for its festivals, especially the Festival au Désert which had been held since 2001 but was put on hold in 2013 because of the security issues. =UNESCO World Heritage Sites= Mali has four UNESCO World Heritage Sites, including the well known city of Timbuktu. This has been on the UNESCO danger list since 2012, which the organisation describes as \\"an intellectual and spiritual capital and a centre for the propagation of Islam throughout Africa in the 15th and 16th centuries, its three great mosques, Djingareyber, Sankore and Sidi Yahia, recall Timbuktu's golden age. Although continuously restored, these monuments are today under threat from desertification.\\" The other three include Bandiagara Escarpment, Djenné and the Tomb of Askia.

Retrieved on 2009-11-13 on the lands of the partitioned Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Antoni Mackiewicz in God's Playground, a History of Poland: 1795 to the present by Norman Davies, Columbia University Press  Biography  Mackevičius was born into a family of minor Polish-Lithuanian nobility.Lietuvos katalikų dvasininkai ir 1863 metų sukilimas. Retrieved on 2009-11-13 Between 1846-1849, after finishing his secondary education at the gymnasium in Vilnius, he continued his studies at St. Vladimir University in Kiev. During this period a series of political upheavals occurred throughout the European continent, the Revolutions of 1848, which spread eastward. As a consequence of these events and influenced by them, Mackevičius began to consider the possibility of liberating Lithuania from the Russian Empire. In 1850 he left Kiev and entered the seminary in Varniai. He was ordained, and between 1853 and 1855 he served as the vicar in Krekenava, and between 1856 and 1862, served as pastor of the church in Paberžė. According to Jurgis Želvys, following the unsuccessful 1831 Uprising, Mackevičius, like most of the Lithuanian nobility, did not lose hope of restoring Lithuania's independence. A new opportunity arose in the spring of 1863, when a subsequent uprising against the Russian Empire spread to Lithuania. Antanas Mackevičius was one of the first to openly agitate for Lithuanian independence. In a sermon at the church in Paberžė he called upon the people to rise up and restore independence, and promised to reorganize society by granting greater rights for peasants, and also promised them land. Mackevičius also criticized Polish nobility attempts to attach Lithuania to Poland. However, according to Timothy Snyder, although now seen as a \\"proto- Lithuanian nationalist\\", Mackevičius' goal was indeed to recreate the Grand Duchy - but \\"in a provisional association with Poland\\" Mackevičius succeeded in organizing some two hundred and fifty men, armed with hunting rifles and straightened scythes. Mackevičius' platoon fought until November 26, but after a defeat near Vilkija on December 17, he was captured and taken to the prison in Kaunas. After Mackevičius refused to betray other leaders of the uprising, he was hanged on December 28, 1863 by the direct order of Mikhail Nikolayevich Muravyov-Vilensky. Virginija Skučaitė.

Biography During his school years in the hills above Oakland, California, where his father was a woodworker, he developed such a passion for entomology that he acquired the nickname \\"Bugs.\\" He would go on summer camping trips organized by the Boy Scout leader \\"Bugsy\\" Cain, and developed a circle of boyhood friends who went on to become entomologists, including Robert L. Usinger, Judson Linsley Gressitt, and E. Gorton Linsley. At first he collected butterflies, but began to concentrate on weevils at the suggestion of a professor at the nearby University of California, Berkeley. During a camping trip in 1930, he discovered a new species of weevil that became the subject of his first academic publication, in 1932, soon after enrolling in UC Berkeley, where he received a B.S. degree in 1936.Juvik 2001, p. xviii. On the basis of his considerable field experience and his earlier work mounting specimens of Hawaiian and Pacific insects for the Pacific Entomological Survey, which was then headquartered at UC Berkeley, his mentors there recommended him to serve as the field entomologist on the Bernice P. Bishop Museum's Mangarevan Expedition to southeastern Polynesia in 1934. His senior colleagues on that expedition gave him a new, lifelong nickname, \\"Zimmie,\\" and his close-up encounters with a wide variety of island ecosystems gave him a new, enduring passion for biogeography.Juvik 2001, p. xviii-xx. He settled in Honolulu in 1936, where he worked as an entomologist for the Bishop Museum and conceived the idea for a single-author, multivolume Insects of Hawaii monograph modeled on the Insects of Western North America (1926) by his Berkeley mentor, Edward Oliver Essig. By 1946, he had completed the first five volumes, but Bishop Museum director Peter H. Buck was more eager to publish new works in anthropology than in entomology, so Zimmie turned instead to the University of Hawaii, whose president, Gregg M. Sinclair, agreed to publish the volumes under the auspices of the newly established University of Hawaii Press. The first five volumes finally appeared--to considerable local and international acclaim--in 1948, the same year that their author received a Fulbright fellowship to work at the British Natural History Museum on its large holdings of Hawaiian insects, many of them collected by R. C. L. Perkins over a period of 25 years beginning in the 1890s, at a time when many native fauna were disappearing.Juvik 2001, p. xx-xxiii. Zimmie spent most of the next two decades living on grant money and private funds, in London as an honorary associate of the British Museum and in Peterborough, New Hampshire, where he had easy access to the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard University. He completed a Ph.D. from the University of London in 1956, published three more volumes of Insects of Hawaii in 1957-58, and prepared one more that languished in the pipeline until 1978.Juvik 2001, p. xxiii-xxiv. He was also made a life- fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1957. Meanwhile, back in Honolulu, D. Elmo Hardy and others began publishing further volumes of Insects of Hawaii devoted to the exceptionally rich variety of Diptera (true flies) in the islands, a variety Zimmie had called attention to in a short contribution to Evolution in 1958 with the provocative title, \\"300 insect species of Drosophila in Hawaii?--A challenge to geneticists and evolutionists\\" (Evolution 12, pp. 557–558). > This paper helped stimulate one of the most outstanding and scientifically > rewarding long-term, multidisciplinary research efforts in the history of > evolutionary biology, encompassing systematics, genetics, ecology, and > ethology of the Drosophila complex.Juvik 2001, p. xxiv. By the 1970s, however, Zimmie had trouble securing the funds needed to keep working on Insects of Hawaii and ended up accepting a generous offer from Douglas Waterhouse at Australia's CSIRO to turn his attention to producing another ambitious multivolume monograph, this time on Australian Weevils. By 1990, he had the first five volumes ready to publish, only to find that funding for this project, too, had dried up. He and his wife sold much of their estate, not just to subsidize publication, but also to endow an ongoing position at CSIRO for research on Pacific weevils. In 1992, they moved from their cattle ranch near Canberra to a home and laboratory on Tura Beach, where Zimmie spent his remaining years.Juvik 2001, p. xxiv-xxvi. Among the awards Zimmie received for his life's work were a fellowship to the Entomological Society of America in 1946;v a D.Sc. from the University of London in 1980; the Karl Jordan Medal for his work on Hawaiian Lepidoptera in 1983; the Herbert E. Gregory Medal at the Pacific Science Congress in Beijing in 1995; and Member of the Order of Australia and the University of Hawaii Regents' Medal of Distinction in 1998.

One of the many throne villages (a central village dominated by a semi-feudal family which controlled tens of villages around it) in Palestine, the castle of the Samhan family, erected in 18th or 19th century, is the subject of a preservation effort, and provides proof of the great power and wealth held by its owners at the time.Grossmann 1986:358, cited in Finkelstein et al, 1997, p. 222 The chief Sheikh of the Simhan family was Isma'il, who was killed by Ibrahim Pasha in the 1834 uprising. After Isma'il, Hasan es-Sa'id and Mohammah ibn Isma'il became the rulers.Macalister and Masterman, 1905, p. 354 Edward Robinson passed by in 1838, and described the place as \\"a castle\\".Robinson and Smith, 1841, vol. 2, p. 133Robinson and Smith, 1841, vol. 3, pp. 30, 58, 62 It was also noted as a Muslim village, located in the Beni Harith district, west of Jerusalem.Robinson and Smith, 1841, vol 3, Appendix 2, p. 124 Ras Karkar was ruled by Sheikh Ismail Ibn Samhan who was respected and appreciated by his clan for the many contributions and support that he provided. Sheikh Ismail was killed by the Abu Ghosh family which controlled another throne village near Ras Karkar, and the castle was handed over to his nephew Hussein. An Ottoman village list from about 1870 showed that Ras Karkar had 16 houses and a population of 74, though the population count included men only.Socin, 1879, p. 159 It was also noted that it was located in the Beni Harith districtHartmann, 1883, p. 126, also noted 16 houses In 1882 the PEF's Survey of Western Palestine (SWP) described Ras Kerker as \\"a small village in a lofty position, with a spring below it on the north.

After the 1995 accords, 18.6% of Ras Karkar's land was classified as Area B, while the remaining 81.4% is Area C. Israel has confiscated land from Ras Karkar for the establishment of the Israeli outpost \\"Zayt Ra'nan\\", and for the construction of roads leading to the Israeli settlement of Talmon.Ras Karkar Village Profile, ARIJ, pp. 15-16 The majestic castle is surrounded with historic buildings, overlooking to the west the mountains leading to the Mediterranean Sea and to the south, the city of Jerusalem. The village fields below are planted with olive trees. Entering the now abandoned castle from the northern gate leads to a large courtyard surrounded by a row of rooms. Al- Iliyeh, which is the highest room in the three-floor castle, was used for administrative purposes and as the Sheikh's private refuge. Narrow hallways and oil storage containers, as well as decorations and poems carved in the castle's walls and stones are among the things one can see there. Naby Annir Just north of Ras Karkar is Neby Annir, meaning \\"The prophet Annir\\". According to Tawfiq Canaan, writing in 1927, this place (called en−Nebi 'Annir in Beni Harit) was formerly a place of pilgrimage (mawasim), taking place about the same time as the Nabi Musa religious festival; at the Djum'et el-'Alemat, or Feast of the Flags, on Good Friday.Canaan, 1927, p. 215 References Bibliography      External links * Welcome To Ras Karkar *Survey of Western Palestine, Map 14: IAA, Wikimedia commons *Ras Karkar Village (Fact Sheet), Applied Research Institute–Jerusalem (ARIJ) *Ras Karkar Village Profile, ARIJ *Ras Karkar aerial photo, ARIJ *Locality Development Priorities and Needs in Ras Karkar Village, ARIJ * Throne villages, with Ibn Sahman Castle, Ras Karkar, RIWAQ Category:Villages in the West Bank Category:Ramallah and al-Bireh Governorate Category:Throne villages Category:Municipalities of the State of Palestine ","title":"Ras Karkar"},{"id":"18133843","text":"Scott Blaine Johnson (born July 17, 1969) is an American cartoonist, illustrator, designer and podcaster. He lives in South Jordan, Utah, with his wife and three children. In 2008, Johnson launched Frog Pants Studios, LLC, an illustration and audio production company.  Early life  Scott Johnson was born in Salt Lake City, Utah. He grew up and went to high school in the suburb Sandy City. He has also lived in Mississippi and Louisiana while on a mission for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). Johnson met his wife Kim during his mission.  Comics and illustration  Johnson began publishing the webcomic ExtraLife in June 2001. The subject matter concentrates on many of Johnson's interests such as computers, technology, video games, and movies. In 2009, Johnson launched Experience Points, a second web comic that draws inspiration from World of Warcraft and other MMORPG computer games. The strip was one of several web comics published by Crispy Gamer until its closure in January 2010. It then was moved to GameCulture. Johnson is the creator of the popular \\"56 Geeks\\" poster,\\"56 Geeks Poster\\". Myextralife.com and he illustrated the cover of World of Warcraft Programming (2010).  Podcasts  Johnson is the creator and host of several podcasts. = ExtraLife Radio = Johnson's oldest podcast, ExtraLife Radio (often shortened to ELR) began in 2003 as a stand-alone downloadable MP3 file. It was a bi-monthly show that covered a wide variety of subjects, including video games, movies, comic books, and many random subjects as the hosts saw fit. It was a self-proclaimed geek show, for and by geeks. In 2005, the delivery format was changed to a podcast. The original hosts other than Johnson were cartoonists Sergio \\"Obsidian\\" Villa-Isaza (nicknamed \\"O\\") and Brian Dunaway, and forum contributor Andrew Konietzky (who left the show in 2007). In addition to this panel the show also often featured guests and infrequent or frequent guest hosts. Mark Larson, a childhood friend of Johnson's, joined Johnson in studio (whereas most other guests, as well as the three other co- hosts, used Skype to connect) every week for a period until gas prices deterred him from driving to Johnson's house for the show. Afterwards he would appear infrequently over Skype as well as frequently sending in a 3-minute Movie Reviews segment. ExtraLife Radio won a People's Choice Podcast Award in 2008 and other awards over its four-year run. On February 12, 2010, after 233 shows, Johnson announced that ELR would no longer be recording and be placed on what he called an \\"indefinite hiatus\\" in a blog post titled \\"All Good Things...\\" On September 5, 2010 on Diary of a Cartoonist Johnson said he missed ExtraLife Radio and has considered bringing it back, but also noted that its layout would probably be different and not include consistent panel members. = The Instance = The Instance is a weekly award-winning World of Warcraft podcast started in 2006 by Johnson and then-ExtraLife Radio host Andrew Konietzky, both of whom noticed a lack of podcasts dedicated to the MMO. The show is dedicated to news and rumors about the game, and relies heavily on listener contribution. An early contributor, Randy \\"RandyDeluxe\\" Jordan, joined the podcast as a third seat on show 45, and eventually became second seat when Konietzky left the show in 2007. Jordan was a part of the show (becoming a regular guest on ExtraLife Radio, and a co-host on Film Sack) until a job opportunity at Blizzard Entertainment (makers of World of Warcraft) required him to retire his position. Episode #217: \\"Now I've Gotta Go...\\" was Jordan's final show, and was dedicated to him. Jordan's replacements were Mark \\"Turpster\\" Turpin (a former guest and friend of the show) and William \\"Dills\\" Gregory (a member and raider in the Instance guild, alea iacta est). In 2014, Patrick Beja (a friend of the network and former Blizzard employee) joined that podcast as a 4th seat. The podcast won a Blogger's Choice Award in 2008 for Best Podcast. Former guests have included Veronica Belmont, Felicia Day, Tom Merritt, and retired Boston Red Sox pitcher Curt Schilling, who also co-hosted the show with Randy and Johnson for several months. = AppSlappy = In June 2009, Johnson began publishing the weekly podcast AppSlappy, dedicated to reviewing Apple iPhone (and later, iPad) applications. Johnson, with co-hosts Eric Van Skyhawk and Eileen Rivera (Tom Merritt's wife), review and rate popular apps. The podcast also covers news and rumors related to the iPhone and iPad. As of August 2013, AppSlappy is on hiatus. Soundcloud.com App Slappy was later repurposed into a recurring segment (sometimes referred to as App Time!) on one of Johnson's other shows, The Morning Stream, where he and co-host Brian Ibbott review mobile games and other apps.https://www.frogpants.com/blog/tmspm-1811-nooks-and-crannies-i- dont-play-chess = Diary of a Cartoonist = The Diary of a Cartoonist podcast uses an introspective stream-of-consciousness format where Johnson discusses a wide variety of topics ranging from the day-to-day activities in his life to his thoughts about current events. Unlike Johnson's other podcasts, Diary of a Cartoonist does not have other co-hosts, though his family occasionally make minor appearances. Johnson often records the podcast using his iPhone while engaging in other activities such as driving or walking his dog. = FourCast = Started on July 7, 2009, Tom Merritt and co-host Johnson invite various guests and discuss the future and what it might contain in a so-called virtual fireside setting. Fourcast, not part of the Frogpants network, was produced and hosted by Merritt's main employer at the time, TWiT.tv. The podcast ended in June 2012. = Film Sack = Started on October 31, 2009, Johnson and co-hosts Brian Ibbott, Brian Dunaway, and Randy Jordan review 'forgotten gems' of movies selected from the streaming media service Netflix. Film Sack won a Podcast Connect People's Choice Podcast Award in the film category in 2011 and in 2013. = Current Geek = Started on November 13, 2009, Johnson again teamed up Tom Merritt for 3-times-a-week dose of the geekiest stories around the world. After some difficulties and a hiatus, this show was revived as a weekly segment on The Morning Stream. After Merritt's contract ran out with TWiT in December 2013, Current Geek was restarted as a standalone weekly show in January 2014. = Hypothetical Help = Started on March 29, 2010, Johnson and co-host Mark Turpin a.k.a. \\"Turpster\\" tackle the world of hypothetical counseling. Listeners are invited to call and leave a recorded question, or record a sound file, to have Johnson and Turpster possibly play it on the show and then give their best comedic advice to solve the world's problems. Episodes feature about 3 user calls each, and are about 30 minutes long. = Final Score = Restarted on April 9, 2010, Johnson and co-host Brian Dunaway tackle the field of video games. New releases, reviews, retrogaming, and game \\"first plays\\" are some of the topics covered. Johnson and Dunaway were joined by Nicole Spagnuolo (aka Nicole Spag) of the Ladies of Leet podcast and blog at episode 20. In February 2015 the show was put on hiatus. = The Creep = Started on September 9, 2010, with Johnson and co- host Brian Hough, described as \\"the Starcraft 2 podcast, helping you find your way in the Starcraft Universe.\\" It is geared to be of interest to new and highly experienced players, with news, tips, and tricks. It started out in a bi-weekly format, but in episode 13 in February 2011 it was announced that due to lack of regular quality content and information release in the Starcraft universe, the podcast would be recorded whenever there was enough information to produce a show. This resulted in a 6-month hiatus. Episode 14 saw the return of The Creep in September 2011 when it was announced that shows would again be more regularly recorded than every 6–12 months. = The Morning Stream = Started on January 24, 2011, with Johnson and Brian Ibbott. It is published every Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday morning (usually) for the discussion of current entertainment, politics, live calls, and other segments. The Morning Stream won a People's Choice Podcast Award in the entertainment category in 2011, and two in 2013, in the People's Choice and Comedy categories. In March 2014 Johnson and Ibbott began producing a weekly evening edition of the show, airing live on Thursday nights and published as a podcast the morning after; this version is called TMS PM, features most of the same elements as the morning show and is a one-hour long show, rather than the usual two hours, but it includes two songs each time like the other daily episodes. TMS PM is a Patreon exclusive, given as a reward for supporters having reached the $5,000-per-month donation tier on the show's Patreon page. https://www.patreon.com/tms = AutoPilot = Started on March 10, 2012, Johnson is joined by Tom Merritt in a podcast in which the duo watch and dissect early television pilot episodes from classic and modern shows. The first full episode was published in late March 2012, about the Star Trek pilot episode \\"The Cage\\".\\"AutoPilot\\". Frogpants.com  Community  Fans and contributors to The Instance are invited to join the show's U.S. Earthen Ring Server guild named Alea Iacta Est (AIE), which, currently at over 6,300 active members, makes it one of the largest guilds in World of Warcraft. Johnson's main character on AIE, a level 90 orc hunter named Gerp, is a founder and officer of the guild. Notable members have included Curt Schilling,Alea Iacta Est in popular culture Veronica Belmont, Leo Laporte and Tom Merritt. Johnson is well known in the Utah area both for his online work and as host of the increasingly popular Nerdtacular event, an annual gathering of fans, friends, and members of the Frogpants community. In 2007, Johnson was targeted with a cease and desist email by disbarred attorney and American activist Jack Thompson for running a photograph parody contest on the Myextralife site.

He remains a hate figure in local nationalist tradition. He was buried on 28 May 1824 in Christ Church, Gorey aged 97 years. Family history =Ancestry= John Hunter Gowan II was the son of John Hunter Gowan I (b.1699 - d. 1779) and Anne Hatton (b. circa 1700). His father was the son of John Gowan (b.1668) who married the daughter of John Hunter from Co Tipperary resulting in the double- barrelled surname. John Hunter Gowan I's father, John Gowan, was an officer in King William’s army and bought property in Wexford for his eldest son, John Hunter Gowan I, an attorney. John Hunter Gowan II had one brother, Henry Hatton Gowan (b.1736).The Hattons Of Wexford Local contribution: John Hunter Gowen is interred in St John's Church, Hollyfort, Gorey, Co Wexford. I am a native of that area, and when young, heard stories of men coming out of a local public house and going up to the church where his body laid in a vault which could be accessed by an open gate. They took out his skull and proceeded to play a game of football around the cemetery, his reputation for deeds of horror on neighbours during 1798, when he was about 72 years old, having stayed in the minds of locals. The story came to the attention of a local vicar, and eventually the vault was sealed (cemented). The spelling always was Gowen. He was a local magistrate and knew all neighbours. This is why he became so hated after the 1798 battle for Irish independence.A Local's knowledge =Wives and family= John Hunter Gowan II married Frances Norton in 1771. They had four sons and twelve daughters.H.Ardagh, The Life of Sir James Robert Gowan (Toronto, 1911)familyPAF - pafg13 - Generated by Personal Ancestral File Outside of marriage, Hunter Gowan had children by Margaret Hogan, including another son, Ogle Robert Gowan, who was a prominent Orangeman and a newspaper publisher in Brockville, Kingston and Toronto, Canada; this man was the founder and first Grand Master of the Orange Association, Canada. His home in Canada is now called Nebo Lodge in tribute to his father's Wexford home Mount Nebo. At the age of sixty-one, Gowan started a relationship with Margaret Hogan, a young local Protestant who was governess for his children. The following is an extract from the somewhat fictionalised biography of his son Ogle Robert Gowan: > 'Gowan's wife had died six years previously, worn out, as Hunter himself > expressed it, like an old ewe from too many birthings. She had served as dam > for sixteen of Gowan's children, most of whom had lived, and she had [died], > not from any specific disease, but from overuse, and in that respect was far > from unique among Irish women of her era.[Harman Akenson, Donald,'The > Orangeman: The Life & Times of Ogle Gowan', 1986 > https://books.google.com/books?pg=PA59&lpg;=PA59&dq;=hunter+gowan+nebo&sig;=gqiHF3QU15GfNEvD66bPWQ8Irck&ct;=result&id;=79kicg2JGloC&ots;=jTDEsLBBcY&output;=html] John Hunter Gowan II had many mistresses and some illegitimate children.

There are no details about his early life but in 1873 he immigrated to the United States, settled in New York, and became a naturalized citizen in 1880.Ancestry.com By this time he was a member of the Brooklyn Entomological Society and had demonstrated great skill at preserving and mounting insects. Charles Valentine Riley, the noted federal entomologist, was impressed by these skills and offered Koebele a job at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Koebele promptly accepted the offer and moved to Washington, D.C. in 1881.Mallis, 1971 Riley sent his new employee to the South in 1882 to study the cotton worm, the larva of a moth (Alabama argillacea) that originated in South America but had become a serious pest for cotton growers in the United States. The following year Koebele traveled to Brazil where he studied cotton pests and collected a large number of insect specimens. California citrus At his request, Koebele was transferred in 1885 to Alameda, California where he studied local insect pests and evaluated the effectiveness of various insecticides. At this time the California citrus industry was facing an economic crisis brought about by the cottony cushion scale (Icerya purchasi), an invasive insect that had established itself in California orchards several years earlier. Koebele was soon focused on this pest, working alongside another federal entomologist, Daniel William Coquillett, to find a remedy. Insecticides had little effect and growers resorted to pulling up infested trees and burning them. Back in Washington, Riley had noted the curious fact that citrus trees in Australia were largely unaffected by the cottony cushion scale even though the insect was native to the region. He suspected that natural predators of the scale insects held them in check. In 1888 Riley sent Koebele to Australia to investigate. There he found two likely predators of the scale—a parasitic fly (Cryptochaetum iceryae) and the vedalia beetle (Rodolia cardinalis). Koebele captured hundreds of these insects and shipped them back to Coquillett in California for further evaluation.Todd, 2002 Coquillett placed the vedalia beetles on an infested orange tree enclosed in a tent. In a few months, the beetles had multiplied prolifically and devoured the scale insects. When the tent was opened, the beetles spread to adjoining trees and soon the entire orchard was free of the cottony cushion scale. As word of the dramatic results spread, citrus growers from throughout the state came to gather the insects and release them into their orchards. The beetles spread rapidly and by 1890 California was almost entirely free of the pest. The introduction of vedalia beetles to combat cottony cushion scale is generally recognized as the first instance of successful biological control.Shelton Koebele in particular was hailed as a hero and the growers association awarded him with a gold watch and diamond earrings for his wife. Riley felt that his own role in the success was overlooked and he complained publicly of the perceived slight. Nevertheless, the growers pressured Riley to send Koebele on another expedition in 1891 to collect additional predatory insects from New Zealand, Australia and other Pacific islands. The friction between Riley and the Californians continued and he eventually ordered Coquillet and Koeble back to Washington. Instead, Koebele elected to resign his post and go to work for the Hawaiian provisional government. Hawaiian sugarcane For the next several years Koebele worked in Hawaii, first for the provisional government and then for the Hawaiian Sugar Planters' Association. Focusing on the biological control of insects that were harmful to the sugarcane industry, he traveled extensively looking for useful insects in Australia, Ceylon, China, Japan, Fiji, and Mexico. As a result of these trips he introduced numerous insects into Hawaii and had varying degrees of success in controlling sugarcane pests.Swezey, 1925 In addition to pioneering the use biological control on insect pests, Koebele is credited with the first attempt to apply biological control to an invasive plant species, Lantana camara. Koebele collected and released several insects from Mexico that used lantana as a host. The results were encouraging but he did not completely succeed in eradicating the weed in Hawaii.Pemberton, 1964 In 1908 Koebele returned to Germany in hopes of recovering from ill health and failing eyesight. For a time he continued to work for the planters' association, but poor health and then the outbreak of World War One forced him to remain in Germany. After the war his health continued to decline until he died on 28 December 1924.

Mataria ( ) is a district in the northern region of Greater Cairo, east of the Nile, in Egypt. The district is unrelated to the coastal town in the Dakahlia Governorate, that is also named El Matareya. The district's location was part of the ancient city of Heliopolis, one of the oldest cities of ancient Egypt.  Name  The name, Mataria, (30° 7'46.08\\"N 31°18'26.94\\"E) is thought to come from the Latin word Mater which means 'mother', and is from the presence of the 'tree of the Virgin Mary' in this district.  History  Mataria, with the nearby Ain Shams district, had a notable history during Egypt's Pharaonic period as a part of ancient Heliopolis. The district has archaeological sites of the period, some only recently discovered, beneath its current structures.Descubrimientos - Egipto - Junio / Diciembre 2004; \\"Pharonic tomb uncovered in Cairo, suburbs of Matareya\\"; August 26, 2004 . accessed 1.28.2011 In ancient Roman times Heliopolis belonged to the Augustamnica province.

The French naturalist Pierre Belon du Mans mentions visiting Mataria in his 1547 journey to Egypt.Culture musulmane en Égypte (Suite) Page 6. Mataria once had the villas of prominent people. The famous Egyptian poet Ahmed Shawqi lived in a villa he named ‘Karmet Ibn Hani’ or Ibn Hani’s Vineyard كرمة ابن هانىء here, near the palace of the Khedive Abbas II at Saray El-Qobba, until his exile from Egypt at World War I. \\"My Father Shawky\\" by Hussin Ahmed Shawky; 2nd edition, 2006 Cairo; (in Arabic) =Historic elements= Obelisk, in Mataria. The El Masalla area of the district contains the ancient Masalla Obelisk, or Misalla (, trans. obelisk), one of the Pharaonic era obelisks that still remain in Egypt. It is the only surviving element of Heliopolis standing in its original position, and of the great Temple of Re—Atum constructed by Pharaoh Senusret I (1971 BCE—1926 BCE) of the Twelfth Dynasty. The tall red granite obelisk weighs 120 tons—. A pink granite megalithic colossus statue, with features resembling those of the Pharaoh Ramesses II, was found in El Matareya in 2006, weighing five tons—. It was at the ruins of a sun temple dating back to the reign of Ramses II (reigned 1279 BCE—1213 BCE), at the site of later Souk El-Khamis. The underground tombs of High Priests of Re of the Sixth Dynasty (2345 BCE—2181 BCE) were found in the southeast corner of the Re-Atum Temple archaeological site in El Matareya. The Necropolis of Heliopolis, east of the Masalla obelisk in El Matareya, dates from the Middle Kingdom (c. 2055 BCE—1550 BCE) and New Kingdom (c. 1550 BCE—1069 BCE). A domed tomb made for a priest during the Twenty-sixth Dynasty (c. 685 BCE—525 BCE), was discovered under a construction site in 2004. Many funereal small figure statues were found inside (over 400), and hieroglyphic writing was on the tomb's walls from the 7th century BCE. In the incoherent district of El-Mataria, in Cairo, there stands an old sycamore tree that has been attracting thousands of pilgrims each Christmas, it's called the \\"Virgin's Tree\\". There are many sacred trees in Egypt, trees that have offered shelter for the Holy Family during their stay here, but the one in Mataria holds the highest regard of all.

Recurring barflies  A number of recurring characters were \\"barflies\\", i.e. they hung out at the bar nearly as much as Norm and Cliff. Generally speaking, the barflies only received a line or two in any given appearance, and did not figure in the plots—although there are exceptions to this rule, notably with the characters of Paul Krapence and Tom Babson. The character of Cliff was originally a recurring \\"barfly\\" character, but was quickly developed into a featured character. In the order in which they joined the cast, barflies who were seen in more than three episodes were: = Main = * Tom (Thomas W. Babson) appears in seasons 1-6. He is an aspiring lawyer who has failed the bar exam more than once. He finally passes the bar after his 11th try in season 5, and played a major role in the episode \\"Chambers Vs. Malone\\". In this episode, the character gives his full name as \\"Thomas Babson\\" (the same name as the actor that plays him). Previously, the credits had listed the character's name as \\"Barney\\",Season 1, Episode 16: The Boys in the Bar \\"Tom Sherry\\"Season 3, Episode 18: Bar Bet or \\"Tom Ballard\\",.Season 5, Episode 3: Money Deasrest Tom referred to himself as Thomas Babson, Esquire during the courtroom scene in \\"Chambers vs. Malone\\". * Harry The Hat (Harry Anderson), known as Harry The Hat for his signature fedora, is a con artist and frequent jailbird. An occasional visitor to Cheers, Harry often attempts to swindle its customers and employees with various short cons. Sam has standing orders to have Harry thrown out of the bar on sight, but Harry will help out the gang at Cheers upon occasion—partly out of sentiment, and partly to protect the Cheers gang from operators even more unscrupulous than himself. As Harry notes, \\"I don't like the idea of someone else plucking my pigeons.\\" Harry appeared four times in the series’ first and second seasons, after which he disappeared until season six's \\"A Kiss is Still a Kiss\\". This was actually due to the fact that the actor- magician had achieved fame in his own right by starring in his own series Night Court, which followed Cheers on NBC's Thursday night \\"Must See TV\\" line up. Harry casually explained his long absence—when asked how long it had been since his last visit to Cheers, he replied it had been \\"two to ten, with time off for good behavior\\". After another long layoff, his final appearance was in the eleventh and final season (\\"Bar Wars VII: The Naked Prey\\"), during which he swindles Gary out of his bar as an act of revenge for making the central characters perform naked. The character's last name was never spoken by any character, although he is referred to as \\"Harry Gittes\\" in the closing credits of one episode. He was referred to by Sam as Harry the Hat in the opening of \\"A Kiss is Still a Kiss\\". * Paul (Paul Vaughn) appeared during the first two seasons. He is a loud-voiced character with a distinct New England accent who particularly enjoys getting on Cliff's case. Not to be confused with recurring barfly Paul Krapence, a completely different character. *Tim (Tim Cunningham) is seen throughout the series run. He works as a janitor in a science lab. In several early appearances the character is referred to in the credits as first \\"Chuck\\", then \\"Greg\\", but he is only referred to as \\"Chuck\\" twice on the show, and he was always called \\"Tim\\" on-screen otherwise. * Paul Krapence (Paul Willson) was seen throughout the series run, although only very sporadically in the early years of the show. He made a total of seven appearances during seasons 1-6 (and none at all in season 3), then returned for seasons 9-11 as a frequent bar patron, appearing in close to 50 late-running Cheers episodes. He would generally hang around with Norm and Cliff in the hopes of being included in their activities. Paul was frequently not included with the rest of the group, something that upset him deeply. He was often treated as if he didn't matter, had no friends, and was generally used and mistreated by the rest of the series characters. He did, however, have a certain amount of success with women, and was seen on dates in a few episodes. In the final season, it was suggested in the episode \\"Is There a Doctor in the Howe?\\" that Paul may be gay, but in the episode \\"It's Lonely on the Top\\" (five episodes later) he has a passionate one night stand with Carla. The character was first called Paul in season four. In his first appearance, in season 1, Coach calls Willson's character \\"Glenn\\" (confusingly, the credits identify the character as \\"Gregg\\"), and in another early appearance, Willson is credited as \\"Tom\\", although this name is not spoken aloud in the episode. In the season 10 episode \\"The Norm Who Came to Dinner\\", Norm explains that Paul (years earlier) had been an athlete who had been brought into the bar to try to get him and Cliff into shape, implying that Paul instead conformed to become the frumpy, smoking bar patron we see throughout the show's run. It was later revealed that Paul works as a toll booth operator. Paul is mentioned in the Frasier episode \\"The Show Where Sam Shows Up\\". It is revealed that he had slept with Sam's then-fiancée, which did not bother Sam as much as learning that Cliff had also slept with her. This caused Sam to call off the engagement. He later features in the episode \\"Cheerful Goodbyes\\" with several other Cheers regulars. * Alan (Alan Koss) appears in seasons 1-8 and 11. The character of Alan is known to be single, and lives in a room with a Murphy bed. In an early appearance the character is referred to in the credits as \\"Mike\\", but this name is never spoken aloud, and he is always called \\"Alan\\" on-screen. *Al (Al Rosen) appears in seasons 1–8. He is an elderly man, always seen in a fedora and sports jacket (usually plaid). Despite his disheveled appearance, Al often implied he was a real ladies' man. Al had a distinct, gravelly voice and often unexpectedly interjected with a comedic one-liner relevant to what the characters were discussing, often leaving them speechless momentarily. It is mentioned by Phil in the Frasier episode \\"Cheerful Goodbyes\\" that Al had died 14 years earlier (1988). Rosen's last credited Cheers appearance was in season 8 episode 2, which aired in September 1989. In season 6 episode 11, Woody refers to Al as Michael. Al appeared in seventy-four episodes, more appearances than any other regular barfly.Al Rosen - IMDb * Steve (Steve Gianelli) appears in seasons 2–8 and 11. He is usually wearing a T-shirt and goading bar regulars or staff. *Larry (Larry Harpel) appears in seasons 3–5. He often asked Norm personal questions. * Phil (Philip Perlman) is an older gentleman with large glasses who would make the occasional acerbic comment. He is seen as an extra as early as season 4, though he did not receive a line until season 6. He later appeared in the Frasier episode \\"Cheerful Goodbyes\\". Philip Perlman is the father of Cheers regular Rhea Perlman. *Pete, (Peter Schreiner) appears in seasons 5–11. He usually sits beside Cliff. He loans Sam surveillance equipment in \\"Indoor Fun with Sammy and Robby.\\" *Hugh, (Hugh Maguire) appears in seasons 5–7. He is a balding man who usually wears a sports jacket. * Barry (Barry Zajac) appears in season 8. He is an effeminate, openly gay character who occasionally chimed in with a catty remark. Barry Zajac, who portrays the character, was a long-time producer on the show. = Others = *Jack, played by Jack Knight (season 1). *Jackie, played by Jacqueline Cassel (seasons 1–5). *Mark, played by Mark Arnott (seasons 3, 5–8). *Joe, played by Michael Holden (seasons 5–10). *Tony, played by Tony Di Benedetto (seasons 8–9).  Father Barry  Father Barry (Eric Christmas) was a priest who appeared in several episodes. He presided over Eddie LeBec's funeral and gave spiritual advice to the main characters, most notably when Sam swears to God he will forgo sex forever if the child of an ex-lover isn't his.Season 7, Episode 2: Swear to God  Boggs  Boggs (Duncan Ross) is the chauffeur to Diane's mother, Helen Chambers (Glynis Johns). In \\"Someone Single, Someone Blue\\" (1983), Boggs repeatedly asks Diane to be his wife to help Helen keep her inheritance under Diane's father Spencer Chambers's will. When the time expires and Diane is still single, Helen loses all the wealth. Fortunately, as he admits, Boggs embezzled a substantial amount of the Chambers fortune in the past and has money still remaining. Then he proposes to be Helen's husband, and Helen accepts. In season two, after Diane's huge breakup from Sam, Boggs takes Diane back from psychiatric hospital to her apartment. He notifies her that Helen felt uncomfortable contacting Diane while Diane was in the ward.  Kelly Boyd  Kelly Susan Gaines Boyd (Jackie Swanson) is Woody Boyd’s love interest (and later wife) from the seventh season. She appeared in twenty-four episodes. Kelly and Woody first meet in the thirteenth episode of the seventh season. Woody and Sam are bartending at a private party to celebrate Kelly’s return from Europe. Kelly is a rich and sheltered girl, but Woody is able to open her eyes to new experiences, the first being a monster truck pull. Again in Kelly’s third appearance in the nineteenth episode of the seventh season, Woody teaches her a lesson from his world. Instead of buying her an expensive gift for her birthday, he writes her a memorable song. Kelly and Woody marry in the tenth season’s finale episode. The marriage, at the Gaines' mansion, was a fiasco: The minister died; Kelly's flirtatious cousin Monika (Colleen Morris) teased Sam until her fanatically- jealous husband brandished a sword; Rebecca's petulance caused the French chef to quit, leaving her in charge of the food; Carla kept getting pushed down the shaft in the dumbwaiter; Woody could not keep his hands (and other things) off Kelly before the ceremony; and two attack dogs (cf. \\"The Lads\\" on Magnum, P.I.) menaced everyone who dared exit the kitchen to the patio, until the super-infuriated Carla chased them inside, at which time they whimpered like puppies and scampered away. To top it off, the dead body of the minister tipped over and toppled the wedding cake to the floor. Kelly and Woody were expecting their first child when Cheers ended. In the sixteenth episode of the second season of Frasier, Sam visits and it is revealed that Kelly and Woody's first child was a baby boy. In the thirteenth episode of the sixth season, Woody visits Seattle and reveals that he and Kelly have had another child, a girl.  Robin Colcord  Robin Colcord (Roger Rees) was an English multi- millionaire industrialist, who spent most of his time on Cheers as a love interest for the gold-digging Rebecca Howe. This led to his developing something of a rivalry with Sam Malone because of Sam's own romantic interest in Rebecca. In season 8, Rebecca and Sam discovered that Robin was plotting a hostile takeover of the company for which Rebecca worked,Season 8, Episode 25: Cry Hard and to aid him, had been secretly and illegally using Rebecca's access to the company's confidential information. Rebecca chose to conceal Robin's activities for the sake of their relationship. However, Sam discovered that the company suspected Rebecca of being a willing corporate spy. To protect her, Sam revealed Robin's crimes. Amidst the ensuing scandal, Robin was arrested and briefly sent to prison as well as losing his business positions and money. He and Rebecca planned to marry on his release, despite his new humble status. She chose not to go through with this. He then revealed that he still had some of his fortune in a secret stash, but that he would go away if she still had not changed her mind. Believing this to be a bluff, she refused yet again, and watched as he walked out of her life carrying a moneybelt which he had concealed in her desk. He appeared a final time in the last season, claiming to be a broke but humble vagabond and petty fugitive, asking to reunite with Rebecca. The episode ended with him and Rebecca attempting to hitchhike out of town, Rebecca convinced that this was a second test and that he was still wealthy.  Corinne  Corinne (Doris Grau) is a waitress who worked at The Hungry Heifer, a restaurant frequented by Norm Peterson, who would then turn up at Cheers and bemoan about the indigestion he received from the meals there. Woody Boyd hired Corinne as a cover waitress in season four when Diane called in sick one day, although Sam was originally adverse to her as she looked more like a waitress from a truck stop than a cocktail waitress. She was later hired as a cover waitress in season five and appeared on a film in the same season. Corinne told Norm that all the waitresses at The Hungry Heifer had a nickname for him: \\"The Guy Who Comes Back\\". While covering for Diane, Corinne manages to catch the eye of barfly Al (Al Rosen). As well as appearing in the show, Doris Grau was script supervisor for five episodes.Doris Grau - IMDb  Esther Clavin  Esther Clavin (Frances Sternhagen) is Cliff's overprotective mother. She is first mentioned in the second season episode \\"Just Three Friends\\", when Cliff and Norm Peterson make a prank call to her. It is first mentioned in the third season that Cliff lives with his mother, for which the other barflies often mocked him. In the episode \\"Coach in Love Part 2\\" (season 3), Cliff's mother is first heard in a voice-over at Cliff's house. When she asked if she could stop by and meet the gang, Cliff whispered under his breath \\"When hell freezes over\\". Regardless, Esther showed up at the bar in season five, when Cliff tries to set her up with wealthy Cheers patron Duncan Fitzgerald (Richard Erdman). She appeared numerous times afterward through to the final season. In season six, it was revealed that Cliff, contrary to his usual know-it-all personality at the bar, is actually quiet at home and his mother is actually \\"the real yapper in the family\\".Season 6, Episode 7; Last Angry Mailman Cliff, after listening to his mother drone on and on, shares his mother's knowledge with the gang at the bar. This gives the gang the source of all Cliff's \\"knowledge\\" and the font from which it came. This gives them valuable insight into Cliff's infamous know-it-all personality. After meeting Cliff's mother, Frasier Crane remarks that he's beginning to see that Cliff is actually almost heroically well- adjusted.  Frederick Crane  Frederick Gaylord Crane (Christopher and Kevin Graves in Cheers, Luke Tarsitano in 1995, Trevor Einhorn from 1996 until 2003) is the son of Frasier and Lilith Sternin. \\"Freddy\\" made his first appearance as a baby on Cheers, while his parents were still married; he appears in several episodes throughout the show's run. Frederick was born during eighth season episode The Stork Brings a Crane. He was delivered in a taxicab while Lilith was on her way home from the hospital after an episode of false labour. Lilith tolerated the pain by biting down on one of the cab driver's fuzzy dice.  Beth Curtis  Beth Curtis (Amanda Wyss) is Woody's old-time girlfriend from Indiana. In season 4, Beth is reunited with her old-time friend Woody. During high school, both Woody and Beth were overweight. In the intervening years, both had slimmed down. After their reunion, they end up overeating, and people unsuccessfully attempt to help them overcome it. Frasier tells Woody that he and Beth are substituting overeating for premarital sex due to their religious backgrounds. Although Sam and Diane take the couple to dinner to help them control their eating habits, Woody and Beth end up taking Frasier's psychological advice and plan to have sex.Season 4, Episode 2; Woody Goes Belly Up In her second and last episode, Beth becomes engaged to her fiancé Leonard Twilley (John Brace), much to Woody's disappointment.Season 5, Episode 11; The Book of Samuel Beth confesses that she and Woody are two different people who are not meant for each other; Woody is adventurous, while she settles down into commitment.  Captain Dobbins  Captain Dobbins (Robert Machray) is a fire marshal who was often the victim of pranks at Cheers. He appeared in several \\"Bar Wars\\" episodes, in which the Cheers gang thought he was from Gary's Olde Town Tavern, only to be proved wrong. He also appeared in the final season, when the Cheers gang suspected Robin Colcord of hiding money belts at Cheers. They suspected Captain Dobbins of stealing the money belts, only to be proved wrong yet again. He appeared in four episodes.Robert Machray - IMDb  Evan Drake  Evan Gregory Drake, portrayed by Tom Skerritt, appearing as Rebecca Howe's boss when she was first introduced in 1987, it was revealed she had an unrequited crush on him for two years, so extreme that she had stopped dating. She wanted desperately to impress him enough that he would notice her on a romantic level. Rebecca became increasingly neurotic around Mr. Drake, and she found herself having to explain herself out of ridiculous situations. For example, Drake made her hire a young woman as a waitress, and Rebecca assumed she was his mistress. After confronting her and hitting her across the face, it was revealed that the woman was Drake's daughter, not his lover. She explained away the punch with a phony \\"nerve disorder\\" diagnosis. Another time, when Norm was hired to paint Drake's bedroom, Rebecca came along to see \\"where he sleeps,\\" in a vain effort to be closer to him. When Drake came back unexpectedly from a business trip, Rebecca was forced to stay in the closet while he slept. When trying to escape, she only got as far as his bed, where she had to roll under and stay captive again. She was finally freed after she climbed out a window when Norm persuaded a delirious Drake to \\"let [him] carry a rich man across the lawn in his pajamas.\\" Rebecca never got to tell Drake how she felt, as he left for a job in Japan with his new lover. She did, however, drive his limousine to the airport and crash into a 7-Eleven when she was blinded with jealousy (she had seen him make out with his companion).Season Six, Episode 25: Backseat Becky, Up Front  Walter Gaines  Walter Gaines (Richard Doyle) is Kelly Gaines's divorced father. Mr. Gaines usually acted very high-class and snobbish, and would tend to look down upon lower-class people, like Woody and Sam. He appears in eight episodes.Richard Doyle - IMDb Mr. Gaines is revealed to be having an affair with his brother's wife in the episode \\"Ill-Gotten Gaines\\" and due to a misunderstanding, mistakenly believes Woody had found out and is attempting to blackmail him. He later learns that Woody knew nothing of the affair and that Woody would never stoop to blackmail, however Mr. Gaines' butler Hives overhears the entire conversation and proceeds to blackmail him. Mr. Gaines's ex-wife and Kelly's mother, Roxanne Gaines (Melendy Britt), appears only in the episode \\"Woody or Won't He\\" (185). Unlike her ex-husband, she does not even come to Kelly and Woody's wedding. She is a very attractive high-society lady and a sexy, flirtatious upper-class cougar. Although she is also a bit snobbish, she tries to seduce Woody. Later Kelly tells Woody that her mother flirted with all her boyfriends, \\"just for fun, and because it keeps her young.\\" In this episode, we also learn that Kelly has a sister, but her name and the name of actress who plays her are not mentioned.  Gary  Gary was the owner of Gary's Old Towne Tavern, Cheers' prominent rival business. After the rivalry was established in season four, beginning in season six one episode per year — generally called \\"Bar Wars\\" – featured a contest between the two drinking holes for customers. The Cheers gang almost invariably lost to Gary, with the exception of season four's bowling competition, season seven's Bloody Mary contest, season nine's basketball competition, and season eleven's Bar Wars finale, in which Harry tricked Gary into demolishing Gary's Olde Towne Tavern.Season 11, Episode 19; Bar Wars VII: he Naked Prey Gary was played alternately by both Joel Polis and Robert Desiderio.  Henri  Henri (Anthony Cistaro) was Kelly Gaines's French friend, who would often mock Woody with the phrase, \\"I'm going to steal your girlfriend!\\". Kelly repeatedly tried to convince Woody that Henri was merely joking, but it was later revealed that he wasn't joking, and that he did indeed intend to steal Kelly away. Henri first appeared in the ninth series when Kelly got back from France and brought Henri along with her. Henri later mocks Lilith's French pronunciation — he affects not understanding her poor pronunciation and corrects her « très bien » with a better accent.Season 9, Episode 20; It's a Wonderful Wife Henri and Sam were good friends until the final season, when Henri challenged Sam to a contest; whoever got the most phone numbers of women by midnight would be \\"acknowledged as the world's greatest ladies' man\\". Henri ended up winning by just one point, only to have Sam walk out with three more women.Season 11, Episode 4; The Magnificent Six  John Allen Hill  John Allen Hill (Keene Curtis) is the owner of Melville's, the seafood restaurant located directly above Cheers. Though Melville's was mentioned a lot throughout the series, Hill did not first appear until season nine, during which he bought the restaurant and first became its owner. Hill is a pompous man who has a disdain for the Cheers gang, and considers them to be low-class. In the season nine, Sam dated Hill's daughter ValerieSeason 9, Episode 14; Achilles Hill as a way to get back at Hill for his evil attitude towards the Cheers bar. He and Carla have a complicated love-hate relationship; they frequently insult and curse at each other even during their frequent bouts of sex.  Joanne  Joanne (Catherine MacNeal) is a local newscaster, appearing only when someone, usually Norm Peterson, is watching the bar's television. In her first episode \\"'I' on Sports\\" (1987), her short-time co-newsanchor Sam Malone flirts with her, but she resists and turns him down. In \\"Christmas Cheers\\" (1987), she reports a raging lunatic (presumably Cliff Clavin) throwing canned foods at the airplane. In her last episode \\"Where Nobody Knows Your Name\\" (1990), she (inadvertently) informs the bar that an imprisoned Robin Colcord cheated on Rebecca Howe with another woman.  Eddie LeBec  Guy Edouard \\"Eddie\\" LeBec (Jay Thomas) is a Boston Bruins ice hockey player who has an endless winning streak and a French Canadian background. He meets Carla when he walks into Cheers one day and the two begin dating. However, Eddie's streak soon comes to an end. Since both are superstitious, they conclude that Carla is a \\"jinx.\\" They end their relationship in order to avoid ruining Eddie's ability to play. Nevertheless, they reconcile shortly thereafter and promise to break up repeatedly before every game to avoid the \\"curse\\". In \\"Home Is the Sailor\\", Carla is revealed to be several months pregnant with Eddie's twins (incorporated by another of Perlman's pregnancies). In two-part episode \\"Little Carla, Happy at Last\\", Carla and Eddie wed. She almost quits her waitressing job because Eddie said that he would take care of her financially. However, the Bruins released him from his contract due to his age and declining athletic performance, and he could not find another team. In \\"Airport V\\" (1988), Eddie ends up as a penguin mascot for a traveling ice show in another state. Later in the 1987–88, Carla gives birth to their twin boys, named Elvis and Jesse. In \\"Death Takes a Holiday on Ice\\" (1989), Eddie was killed by a Zamboni when he saved the life of another member of the ice show. At the funeral, it was revealed that he had concurrently married another wife Gloria, when he got her pregnant while the ice show was visiting Kenosha. Carla changes her surname back to Tortelli to avoid being confused with the other \\"Mrs. LeBec\\". In Little Carla, Happy at Last, the vicar conducting Carla and Eddie's wedding refers to Eddie as Edward Raymond LeBec. The demise of Jay Thomas's character Eddie LeBec has been claimed to stem from Thomas' comments \\"about\\" Perlman on a radio show. However, Thomas denied this and declared that he was referring only to the Carla character. Despite Ken Levine's praise on Thomas's acting and pairing of Eddie and Carla, Eddie was written out of the show because Perlman thought that the pairing would make her \\"not part of the people in the bar.\\"  Lewis  Lewis (Sam Scarber), an African-American \\"large, athletic male\\" postal worker. In his very first episode \\"Cliff's Rocky Moment\\" (1984), Cliff attempts to have Lewis brawl with Victor (Peter Iacangelo) without avail. In fact, both Lewis and Victor cannot stand Cliff because of his know-it-all behavior, and Lewis finally exits the bar. In his second and final episode \\"I Call Your Name\\" (1984), Lewis is fired from his job for stealing fragrant samples from people's mail. (Unbeknownst to him, Cliff has reported Lewis.) Lewis wants to find out an identity of the claimant to physically spite him, but then he decides not to do so. Therefore, he chooses to seek other jobs. In the book The Sitcom Reader, Robert S. Brown called him a stereotype to African Americans.  Maggie O'Keefe  Margaret Catherine \\"Maggie\\" O'Keefe (Annie Golden) was Cliff's love interest from the seventh season onward. Maggie first appeared in season seven as a rookie postal carrier who was to be trained by Cliff.Season 7, Episode 12; Please Mr. Postman Maggie asked Cliff out, and he accepted. However, Maggie was later caught taking a postal vehicle to a motel, and was fired from the post office. She then left Cliff to go to Canada, to join the Canadian post office. She made regular appearances from then on, which led to her and Cliff's on-again off-again relationship. Maggie reappeared in season eleven and informed Cliff that she was pregnant with Cliff's child.Season 11, Episode 5; Do Not Forsake Me, O' my Postman This forced Cliff to admit that he and Maggie never had sex, causing the other barflies to mock him. Cliff agrees to marry Maggie but before they depart she decides to call her child's real father so he won't worry anymore. She then tells Norm that the father is upset someone else will be raising his child and that he wants to marry her and Cliff is off the hook. However, as she leaves she tells Cliff they did have sex, twice, though he was apparently inebriated and didn't remember.  Vera Peterson  Vera Peterson (née KreitzerSeason 8, Episode 5: The Two Faces of Norm), the wife of Norm Peterson, is never fully seen onscreen, despite a few fleeting appearances and vocal cameos. Her body is seen in the fifth season episode \\"Thanksgiving Orphans,\\" but her face is covered by pie filling. In the ninth season episode \\"It's A Wonderful Wife\\" her legs can be seen through the Cheers front window as she sits crying on the steps after being fired from her job as Melville's hat check girl. Although she is often the butt of Norm's jokes when he visits Cheers, he professes a deep love for her. When setting up his own decorating business, Norm scares his employee Rudi (Eric Allen Kramer) by using an alternate personality, harsh-hearted Anton Kreitzer, to scare them into shape. When asked by Frasier where he came up with the name Kreitzer, Norm reveals that it was Vera's maiden name. Vera has a sister, Donna Kreitzer, who occasionally stays with Norm and Vera. Norm claims to dread these visits because, while he considers her younger and more attractive than Vera, Donna relentlessly hits on Norm, much to his dismay, and he says that he once walked in on Donna while she was naked and she tried to cover herself up with an emery board. Whether any of this is true is unclear as none of it takes place on screen. In \\"One Hugs, The Other Doesn't\\", Norm mentions that Vera has nieces and nephews, which means she must have at least one brother, another sister, or that Donna has children. Vera is played by Bernadette Birkett, the real-life wife of George Wendt, who played Norm. Birkett's only credited Vera appearance is in Season 11's Look Before You Sleep.  Dave Richards  Dave Richards (Fred Dryer) was an old teammate of Sam's and sports reporter on television. He appeared in the first season, in which he offered to interview Sam for his \\"Where are They Now?\\" show.Season 1, Episode 4; Sam at Eleven Carla later learned that he only chose Sam to interview because no other famous athletes were available. He reappeared in the second season, hoping to chase women with Sam. But after learning that Sam was dating Diane, he tried to break them up, to no avail. He was briefly heard in the third season on the radio, and finally reappeared in the sixth season, offering Sam a temporary job on his sports report show.  Andy Schroeder  Andrew Schroeder (Derek McGrath), better known at the bar as Andy Andy, is a psychopathic ex-con that murdered a cocktail waitress at Via Milano, an Italian restaurant. Sam hired Andy to date Diane without knowing his past.Season 1, Episode 17; Diane's Perfect Date He appeared in two more episodes through the show's first four seasons. He returned again during the final season in an opening tease strapped with dynamite. Overall, McGrath appeared as Andy in four episodes.Derek McGrath - IMDb  Professor Sumner Sloan  Sumner Sloan (Michael McGuire) is a college English literature professor for whom Diane Chambers worked as a teaching assistant. Divorced, Sumner was engaged to Diane, whom he left to return to his ex-wife, Barbara.Season 1, Episode 1: Give Me a Ring Sometime Sumner tried secretly to win Diane back while she was seriously dating Sam, that attempt which ultimately failed, Diane stating not because Sam read War and Peace, but that he read it for her.Season 2, Episode 5: Sumner's Return Sumner eventually reconnects with Diane professionally as he thought one of her unfinished manuscripts was publishable if she would invest six months of her time into the endeavor of finishing the book (the six months which she took away from Sam, but with her both not finishing the book or returning to the bar).Season 5, Episode 26: I Do, Adieu Sumner is an intellectual snob.  Anthony and Annie Tortelli  Anthony Tortelli (Timothy Williams) is the eldest son of Nick and Carla Tortelli and his wife is Annie (Mandy Ingber). The two first appeared in season four when they wanted to be married at 16, but Carla refused and tried to keep the two apart.Season 4, Episode 4; The Groom Wore Clearasil However, Annie's cousin Gabrielle (Sherilyn Fenn) walks into the bar, and Anthony becomes attracted to her, much to Annie's dismay. Anthony and Annie reappeared in season six after being kicked out by Nick and then decide to live with Carla. At the bar, they meet pregnant Carla's new husband Eddie LeBec and then openly disdain him for getting Carla pregnant. Later in the series, Annie finds her husband Anthony lazy because he has no job. Therefore, she works as a temporary waitress (working just for tips) and then tries to flirt with the bartender Sam Malone repeatedly without avail.Season 6, Episode 15; Tale of Two Cuties Then, finally, Anthony finds a job and works at a burger joint. At the end, he walks in the bar with his work uniform to prove himself to Annie, who becomes flattered and then praises him for that. In their final appearance, Anthony and Annie reveal that they were expecting a baby. Outraged and horrified that Annie was pregnant at such a young age (and at the prospect of becoming a grandmother), Carla kicked them out and neither were heard from ever again, destroying the couples plans to live with Carla and Eddie after their baby arrived.Season 6, Episode 22; Slumber Party Massacred Neither Anthony or Annie appeared in season eleven for Anthony's sister Serafina's wedding, but in Season 10's \\"Unplanned Parenthood\\", Gino mentions that Anthony is in prison. Nobody mentions Annie. Anthony and Annie also appear as regular characters in the short-lived spin-off The Tortellis (1987) and live with Nick and his wife Loretta.  Nick and Loretta Tortelli  Nick Tortelli (Dan Hedaya) is Carla's first husband, and Loretta (Jean Kasem) is his bimbo second wife. They occasionally stop by Cheers. He has made no attempt to support his children financially and barely has any contact with them. Nick is loud, unkempt, and extremely unsophisticated; despite these tremendous flaws, he has at times exercised an inexplicable romantic power over Carla (which, years before, resulted in their marriage when Carla was only 15). Nick married Loretta in the season two episode \\"Battle of the Exes\\", and Carla becomes friends with Loretta as she begins to notice Nick's horrible characteristics. Before marrying Nick, Loretta had dreamed of becoming a singer; she once described herself as a \\"taller, blonder, less Mormon Marie Osmond\\". Although she lacked talent, she performed with two groups: \\"The Grinning Americans\\" (described as an Up with People-type group), and The Lemon Sisters (deliberately named to be confused with The Lennon Sisters). Loretta was also featured in Nick's short- lived spin-off series, The Tortellis. Loretta briefly left Nick when she joined \\"The Grinning Americans\\", resulting in Nick appearing at Cheers and taking on job as the general dogsbody, referring to the waitresses as \\"Miss Carla\\" and \\"Miss Diane\\". He does briefly rekindle his flame with Carla and visits his children, but runs back to Loretta when she tells Nick that she loves him.  Carla's kids  * Serafina McDougall (née Tortelli) (Leah Remini)– Carla's eldest daughter. She is made pregnant by a retired police officer who she later marries and has the reception at Cheers, but is worried about her parents arguing with each other. * Gino Tortelli (Josh Lozoff) – To keep the family peace between Carla and her mother, he agrees to keep the family tradition alive and change his name to Benito Mussolini, but Carla refuses. In the first season, Carla tells a drunk Diane Chambers that Gino was the result of a one-night stand between Carla and Sam Malone. Diane is horrified at the thought, but this later turns out to be a malicious lie told by Carla to annoy Diane. In Season 10, he wanted to become a priest, but changed his mind and became a male model. * Anne Marie Tortelli (Risa Littman) - Originally the youngest Tortelli child, Anne Marie was kept behind in the same year at school for so long that Carla described her class photograph as akin to Snow White and the Seven Dwarves. On one occasion, Carla summons one of Anne-Marie's potential boyfriends, Vito Ragazoni (Adam Carl), to the bar and takes mugshots of him and takes a glass Vito used to be DNA tested - all Vito wanted to do was to take Anne-Marie to see One Hundred and One Dalmatians. Later on in the series, Anne-Marie gets braces that give her a severe lisp causing her siblings to mock her. * Lucinda Tortelli (Sabrina Wiener) - The youngest child of Nick and Carla, conceived during one night of passion before her parents' divorce. * Bennett \\"Lud\\" Ludlow, Jr. (Jarrett Lennon)- Carla's son with Dr. Bennett Ludlow, Frasier Crane's mentor; Carla does not accept Ludlow's marriage proposal, although Ludlow vowed that he would financially support the child. Later on in the series, Frasier and his wife Lilith decide to try and forge a connection with Lud, who is lacking in physical prowess and excels in studies. Frasier cuts all bonds with him after Lud acts up in a posh restaurant, setting fire to Frasier's trousers and hiding under the table. * Elvis and Jesse Lebec (Danny Kramer and Thomas Tulak) - Carla's twin sons with Eddie Lebec, using the Christian names of Carla's idol, Elvis Presley, and his stillborn twin.  Walt Twitchell  Walter Q.Season 5, Episode 8; Knights of the Scimitar \\"Walt\\" Twitchell (Raye Birk) was Cliff's rival at the post office. He first appeared in season 3 when their rivalry was established, making occasional appearances from then on. Years later, he appeared on the Frasier episode \\"Cheerful Goodbyes\\" (Season 9), at Cliff's retirement party, where he and Cliff made up.

The analysis begins with listing and counting all the combinations of variables observed in the data set, followed by applying the rules of logical inference to determine which descriptive inferences or implications the data supports. The technique was originally developed by Charles Ragin in 1987. Summary of technique In the case of categorical variables, QCA begins by listing and counting all types of cases which occur, where each type of case is defined by its unique combination of values of its independent and dependent variables. For instance, if there were four categorical variables of interest, {A,B,C,D}, and A and B were dichotomous (could take on two values), C could take on five values, and D could take on three, then there would be 60 possible types of observations determined by the possible combinations of variables, not all of which would necessarily occur in real life. By counting the number of observations that exist for each of the 60 unique combination of variables, QCA can determine which descriptive inferences or implications are empirically supported by a data set. Thus, the input to QCA is a data set of any size, from small-N to large-N, and the output of QCA is a set of descriptive inferences or implications the data supports. In QCA's next step, inferential logic or Boolean algebra is used to simplify or reduce the number of inferences to the minimum set of inferences supported by the data. This reduced set of inferences is termed the \\"prime implicates\\" by QCA adherents. For instance, if the presence of conditions A and B is always associated with the presence of a particular value of D, regardless of the observed value of C, then the value that C takes is irrelevant. Thus, all five inferences involving A and B and any of the five values of C may be replaced by the single descriptive inference \\"(A and B) implies the particular value of D\\". To establish that the prime implicants or descriptive inferences derived from the data by the QCA method are causal requires establishing the existence of causal mechanism using another method such as process tracing, formal logic, intervening variables, or established multidisciplinary knowledge.qualitative comparative analysis - History Of qualitative comparative analysis  Encyclopedia.com: Dictionary Of Sociology The method is used in social science and is based on the binary logic of Boolean algebra, and attempts to ensure that all possible combinations of variables that can be made across the cases under investigation are considered. Motivation The technique of listing case types by potential variable combinations assists with case selection by making investigators aware of all possible case types that would need to be investigated, at a minimum, if they exist, in order to test a certain hypothesis or to derive new inferences from an existing data set. In situations where the available observations constitute the entire population of cases, this method alleviates the small N problem by allowing inferences to be drawn by evaluating and comparing the number of cases exhibiting each combination of variables. The small N problem arises when the number of units of analysis (e.g. countries) available is inherently limited. For example: a study where countries are the unit of analysis is limited in that are only a limited number of countries in the world (less than 200), less than necessary for some (probabilistic) statistical techniques. By maximizing the number of comparisons that can be made across the cases under investigation, causal inferences are according to Ragin possible.J. Goldthorpe, \\"Current issues in comparative macrosociology\\" in Comparative social research, 16, 1997, pp. 1–26. This technique allows the identification of multiple causal pathways and interaction effects that may not be detectable via statistical analysis that typically requires its data set to conform to one model. Thus, it is the first step to identifying subsets of a data set conforming to particular causal pathway based on the combinations of covariates prior to quantitative statistical analyses testing conformance to a model; and helps qualitative researchers to correctly limit the scope of claimed findings to the type of observations they analyze. Criticism As this is a logical (deterministic) and not a statistical (probabilistic) technique, with \\"crisp-set\\" QCA (csQCA), the original application of QCA, variables can only have two values, which is problematic as the researcher has to determine the values of each variable. For example: GDP per capita has to be divided by the researcher in two categories (e.g. low = 0 and high = 1). But as this variable is essentially a continuous variable, the division will always be arbitrary. A second, related problem is that the technique does not allow an assessment of the effect of the relative strengths of the independent variables (as they can only have two values). Ragin, and other scholars such as Lasse Cronqvist, have tried to deal with these issues by developing new tools that extend QCA, such as multi-value QCA (mvQCA) and fuzzy set QCA (fsQCA). Note: Multi-value QCA is simply QCA applied to observations having categorical variables with more than two values. Crisp-Set QCA can be considered a special case of Multi-value QCA. Statistical methodologists have argued that QCA's strong assumptions render its findings both fragile and prone to type I error. Simon Hug argues that deterministic hypotheses and error-free measures are exceedingly rare in social science and uses Monte Carlo simulations to demonstrate the fragility of QCA results if either assumption is violated. Chris Krogslund, Donghyun Danny Choi, and Mathias Poertner further demonstrate that QCA results are highly sensitive to minor parametric and model-susceptibility changes and are vulnerable to type I error. Bear F. Braumoeller further explores the vulnerability of the QCA family of techniques to both type I error and multiple inference. Braumoeller also offers a formal test of the null hypothesis and demonstrates that even very convincing QCA findings may be the result of chance. Response to criticisms QCA can be performed probabilistically or deterministically with observations of categorical variables. For instance, the existence of a descriptive inference or implication is supported deterministically by the absence of any counter- example cases to the inference; i.e. if a researcher claims condition X implies condition Y, then, deterministically, there must not exist any counterexample cases having condition X, but not condition Y. However, if the researcher wants to claim that condition X is a probabilistic 'predictor' of condition Y, in another similar set of cases, then the proportion of counterexample cases to an inference to the proportion of cases having that same combination of conditions can be set at a threshold value of for example 80% or higher. For each prime implicant that QCA outputs via its logical inference reduction process, the \\"coverage\\" — percentage out of all observations that exhibit that implication or inference — and the \\"consistency\\" — the percentage of observations conforming to that combination of variables having that particular value of the dependent variable or outcome — are calculated and reported, and can be used as indicators of the strength of such an explorative probabilistic inference. In real-life complex societal processes, QCA enables the identification of multiple sets of conditions that are consistently associated with a particular output value in order to explore for causal predictors. Fuzzy set QCA aims to handle variables, such as GDP per capita, where the number of categories, decimal values of monetary units, becomes too large to use mvQCA, or in cases were uncertainty or ambiguity or measurement error in the classification of a case needs to be acknowledged.

Today they are used as social, professional, and honorary groups that promote varied combinations of community service, leadership, and academic achievement. History and development Before 1776 in what would become the United States of America, collegiate student fraternal organizations that promoted scholarship, rhetoric, and ethical conduct existed only at Yale, the College of William and Mary, and The College of New Jersey. Thereafter, literary societies came into existence at virtually all the colleges and universities in America. The Latin Societies were formal organizations, often with large assembly rooms. These organizations typically existed in pairs (two competing organizations on a campus), and took roughly half the students as members. At some colleges, students would even be assigned to a society by lot. The literary exercises of these societies usually consisted of a debate, and the meetings were open to the public. In addition to a debate, members could be assigned original poems, essays, fiction, to both compose and deliver. Each society had distinctive meetings, with more or less political, social, or religious discussion.For a fictional account of a Latin society meeting, see http://theamericanminerva.com/Articles/LongstreetDebatingSociety.html. These organizations also often adopted mottoes in Greek or Latin, and some had Greek letter names, such as Phi Kappa society at the University of Georgia. These organizations figure prominently in the development of fraternities and sororities because many early fraternities were considered simply 'private' versions of the 'open' Latin societies, and the format of the meetings was derived from the Latin societies exercises. The Latin Societies thrived until the American Civil War. It is suggested that the later college fraternities undermined them. There were attempts to restore some of these organizations in the 1870s. A few do survive, either in the original society, or with one or more breaks in their history, at the University of Georgia and Yale. =Phi Beta Kappa= The Phi Beta Kappa Society, founded on December 5, 1776, at the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia, was the first fraternal organization in the United States of America, established the precedent for naming American college societies after the Greek letters. The group consisted of students who frequented the Raleigh Tavern as a common meeting area off the college campus. There is a persistent rumor that a Masonic lodge also met in the same place, but there was a different building used by the Freemasons at Williamsburg. Whether the students organized to meet more freely and discuss non-academic topics, or to discuss politics in a Revolutionary society, is unknown; the earliest records indicate only that the students met to debate and engage in oratory, and on topics that would have been not far removed from the curriculum. Hastings, William T., Phi Beta Kappa as a Secret Society. Washington, D.C.: United Chapters of Phi Beta Kappa, 1965, 83–85, see also . There were Latin-named literary societies at William & Mary, which were large debating societies, which, according to the founders of Phi Beta Kappa \\"had lost all reputation for letters, and [were] noted only for the dissipation & conviviality of [their] members.\\" The new society was intended to be \\"purely of domestic manufacture, without any connection whatever with anything European, either English or German.\\" The founders of Phi Beta Kappa declared that the society was formed for congeniality and to promote good fellowship, with \\"friendship as its basis and benevolence and literature as its pillars.\\" At first the only secrets were the mysterious letters used on the badge. The society was given the motto, Philosophia Biou Kubernētēs or \\"Philosophy is the helmsman of life,\\" now officially translated as \\"Philosophy is the guide of life\\". Greek was chosen as the language for the motto because Heath, \\"was the best Greek scholar in college.\\" One official historian of the society, William T. Hastings, and others, believes that the \\"S\\" and \\"P\\" on the badge, which meant Societas Philosophiae, Philosophical Society, was the original name of the Society and that the name Phi Beta Kappa only came to be taken as the society name over time. The heading on the original list of members states: \\"A List of the members, who have been initiated into the S.P. alias Phi Beta Kappa Society.\\" Later, in May 1777, two new signs of recognition were designed: \\"a salutation of the clasp of the hands, together with an immediate stroke across the mouth with the back of the same hand, and a return with the hand used by the saluted\\"; these new gestures were for the purposes of distinguishing Phi Beta Kappa members \\"in any foreign country or place.\\" By a stroke of good fortune, the society initiated a Yale student before disbanding at the advance of British forces. This student brought Phi Beta Kappa to Yale and Harvard, and from there the society was able to continue. As Phi Beta Kappa developed, it came to be a very influential association of faculty and select students across several colleges. The chapters became larger and focused on rhetoric and class elections while abandoning the close social bond that had defined the first chapter. Membership was becoming more of an honor and less part of a functioning society. However, Phi Beta Kappa was very different from a typical college fraternity of today in that the membership was generally restricted to upperclassmen, if not seniors, and faculty, (made members earlier in their careers) played an active role. The annual Phi Beta Kappa exercises at Yale were public literary exercises, with as many or more faculty members of the society than undergraduate. =Early groups= No other Greek letter student society was formed until the inception of Chi Delta Theta, a senior class society at Yale, in 1821. This group, like Phi Beta Kappa had now become, was largely focused on literary debates and elections. Similar groups without Greek letter names (but still clearly inspired by the Greek language) had already been formed like Hermesian, Adelphi, and Philalethean. The social fraternity Chi Phi, although officially formed in 1854, traces its roots to 1824Chi Phi, and oldest.org considers it the oldest social fraternity. =The fraternity system develops= The first general Greek letter fraternity is considered to be the Kappa Alpha Society, established at Union College in Schenectady, New York, on November 26, 1825, by John Hart Hunter. Kappa Alpha's founders adopted many of Phi Beta Kappa's practices (Phi Beta Kappa had been established at Union College in 1817), but formed their organization around fellowship, making the development of friendship and brotherhood their primary purpose. Students liked the organization but the faculty was opposed to the small secret society. Following the establishment of Kappa Alpha Society, an untimely event occurred that would come to shape the public perception of fraternities for decades. In 1826, a man named William Morgan professed himself to be a high-ranking member of the Freemasons and said he intended to publish their secrets. He then disappeared and was assumed murdered or abducted. Public interest in the case led to a severe anti-secret society sentiment. Fraternity members faced expulsion and general suspicion which only increased the secrecy of the early organizations. Meanwhile, Union College was firmly established as the birthplace of the North American fraternity and sorority system when the Sigma Phi Society formed in March 1827, followed by Delta Phi in November. Kappa Alpha Society, Sigma Phi, and Delta Phi would constitute the so-called Union Triad. Sigma Phi became the first \\"national\\" fraternity when it opened a satellite chapter at Hamilton College in 1831. A failed 1830 attempt by Kappa Alpha to expand to Hamilton sparked the founding of Alpha Delta Phi, the first Greek letter fraternity founded outside Union. The trajectory of national expansion continued with Kappa Alpha Society's successful expansion to Williams College in 1833. The Mystical 7 at Wesleyan (1837) expanded to Emory University and the University of Georgia in the early 1840s, spreading the concept to the South, where for two decades before the Civil War, these kinds of organizations were called \\"Mystic Associations\\". The Mystical 7 was also the first society to initiate women as members. In 1833, the Skull and Bones Society was organized at Yale University among members of the senior class as a burlesque of Phi Beta Kappa. This spawned other similar secret societies that differentiate themselves from Greek-lettered societies. The incidents involving William Morgan had not been forgotten, however, and Phi Beta Kappa came under public scrutiny. The increasing influence of the society came to seem undemocratic and contrary to the free flow of intellectual ideas in American academia, and under great pressure, the undergraduate members at Harvard revealed the secrets of Phi Beta Kappa in 1831. In 1833, the Order of Skulls and Bones Society was organized at Yale University among members of the senior class to carry on the legacy of Phi Beta Kappa. An unofficial but still very clear line was drawn between future secret societies and future Greek- lettered organizations. In 1834, Delta Upsilon fraternity was founded at Williams College. Delta Upsilon was established as the nation's first open, non-secret fraternity in that it still to this day does not maintain secret admonitions, handclasps, etc. and does not safeguard its rituals, which are open to public speculation. Delta Upsilon was founded to counter what was believed to be the unjust dominance by secret societies of the time over the student affairs at Williams college. Beta Theta Pi was founded at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, in August 1839, in response to the chartering of the west-most chapter of Alpha Delta Phi. Phi Delta Theta (1848) and Sigma Chi (1855), also founded at Miami University, emulated Beta Theta Pi's focus on establishing new chapters. These three constitute the so-called Miami Triad. Zeta Psi, founded in 1847 at New York University, similarly pursued expansion. Meanwhile, Theta Chi was founded at Norwich University in Norwich, VT, and Sigma Alpha Epsilon was started at the University of Alabama in 1856. Union College continued its role as the Mother of Fraternities by establishing a second triad. This triad consists of Psi Upsilon (1833), Chi Psi (1841) and Theta Delta Chi (1847). With this second triad, Union College can claim the foundation of nearly half of the first 13 secret social national fraternities in the country. Influences from Freemasonry would still be explicitly clear in the development of fraternities such as Phi Kappa Sigma, founded 1850, and Delta Tau Delta, founded 1858. Organizations such as Zeta Psi, Tau Kappa Epsilon, Psi Upsilon, and Delta Psi would be similarly influenced by and all without officially retaining any ties to Freemasonry. As with men's fraternities, women's fraternities would largely be inspired or preceded by student societies with Greek-inspired names but without Greek letters. The Adelphean Society was established in 1851 at Wesleyan College in Macon, Georgia, making it the first secret society for collegiate women. The Philomathean Society (not associated with the Philomathean Society of the University of Pennsylvania) was also founded at Wesleyan College in 1852. The first Greek letter women's fraternity, Chi Theta Delta, was formed in 1856 at Troy Female Seminary. It was formed by female students who had become so intrigued and impressed by the fellowship displayed by the men's fraternity Theta Delta Chi that they sought membership. This being an impossibility, the Delta chapter of Theta Delta Chi helped them form their own group which would last only a few years when Troy Female Seminary ceased being a board school. 1856 would also see the establishment of Kappa Sigma (not to be confused with Kappa Sigma fraternity) at Elmira College. =The Golden Age of Fraternities= The early 1860s were unsurprisingly uneventful when it comes to fraternities due to the American Civil War. Many colleges, and subsequently undergraduate chapters, would temporarily close during the war. Only one organization, Theta Xi, was founded (at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in 1864) and it was the first professional fraternity. One very important event during the war was the passage of the Morrill Act of 1862. This act would lead to new colleges, new educational opportunities, and greater student enrollment. After the war, the system would begin encountering racial, religious, and gender diversity and new colleges would be founded or reformed throughout the south and west. Growth in the fraternity system overall during this period would lead some to label the last third of the 19th century as \\"The Golden Age of Fraternities.\\" right The so-called Lexington Triad would begin its formation when Alpha Tau Omega was founded in 1865 at the Virginia Military Institute. Fraternities being founded at military-oriented schools in the south was unsurprising given the recent end of the war. The founding of Kappa Alpha Order at Washington and Lee University in 1865 and Sigma Nu at VMI in 1869 would complete the triad. Fraternity creation would slow for a time after 1873 when the third of three secret societies was formed at Massachusetts Agricultural College. The existing fraternities would now seek to expand. Sororities The founding of the Adelphean Society (later Alpha Delta Pi) at Wesleyan Female college in 1851 marks the establishment of the first secret society for women. Shortly after came the Philomathean Society (later Phi Mu) also founded at Wesleyan in March 1852. In 1867, a society called I. C. Sorosis was founded as the nation's first women's fraternity at Monmouth College in Illinois, and later became known as Pi Beta Phi. It was the first to begin expanding to different chapters, although a few unauthorized city chapters existed for a short time in its early years. In 1870, Kappa Alpha Theta was founded, and was the first women's fraternity founded with Greek letters. The 1870s would also host the founding of Kappa Kappa Gamma in 1870, Alpha Phi in 1872, Delta Gamma in 1873, and Gamma Phi Beta and Sigma Kappa in 1874. In 1888 the women's fraternity of Delta Delta Delta was established at Boston University. The 1890s saw the founding of Chi Omega now the nation's largest women's fraternal organization. With Alpha Xi Delta founding in 1893. Sororities had, from the beginning, the difficult objective of proving the viability of coeducational studies. That women could perform academically as well as or better than men while maintaining the Victorian ideals of womanhood was a tall order. Sororities created high academic standards and monitored the social activities of their members from their inception. Gamma Phi Beta would gain notoriety in 1882 as the first organization to be called a sorority. Their advisor was a male Latin professor who coined the term. The terms sorority and women's fraternity have always since been interchangeable with some using one or the other in only formal or informal contexts. The social sororities were one of the few social outlets at most universities. While enrollment had opened to women at most institutions, student organizations like literary societies, student government, and other clubs were still free to restrict membership. Intense curriculum and mandatory religious involvements limited free time but the social sororities and social fraternities began a tradition of interaction. They would put together skits for entertainment, hold events for singing and waltzing after meetings were over, and held socials at the houses of local members. Professional and honorary fraternities Theta Xi was the first Greek letter professional fraternity but it would eventually become social. These groups would gain popularity before and increasingly after the turn of the 20th century. Membership in them could be coveted a great deal on some campuses. The membership requirements and purposes of honorary and professional fraternities would often overlap. =Religious Organizations= While the late 19th century held tremendous growth for the fraternity system, it was also a time of great discrimination against the minorities who were increasingly entering the universities. Informal agreements were often codified in bylaws to restrict membership only to white Christians (but not necessarily all Christian denominations). Christianity was huge part of college life at this time. Training for the ministry was a common application of time in a university and attending chapel was often mandatory. Jewish students could rarely gain entry into any fraternities as, at the time, just one member could often block the initiation of any new member. Even Christianity was not enough for many as there was also much discrimination against Irish Catholics. Catholic students at Brown University would create Phi Kappa Sigma (not to be confused with the national Phi Kappa Sigma) in 1889. Three Jewish students, upset at any idea of religious discrimination, would found the non-sectarian (no discrimination against race, religion, or color) Pi Lambda Phi at Yale University in 1895. On the other end of the spectrum, fourteen students would form the Z.B.T. Society (later Zeta Beta Tau) in 1898 which was only open to Jewish students. =African-American Organizations= The establishment and evolution of fraternities and sororities for African-Americans partially mirrored the development of social fraternities and sororities. Literary societies with Greek letters came first: the Alpha Phi literary society was founded at Howard University in 1872. Sigma Pi Phi, a non-collegiate fraternity for professionals, was founded in 1904. Next there were unsuccessful attempts to create collegiate fraternities, such as Gamma Phi fraternity at Wilberforce University (first official campus recognition in 1923; a 1923 yearbook entry reported operation as early as 1905), Alpha Kappa Nu at Indiana University (formation attempted in 1903, but involved too few registrants to assure continuing organization), and Pi Gamma Omicron at Ohio State University (formation reported in the Chicago Defender in 1905; organization failed to receive school recognition). In 1906, Alpha Phi Alpha was formally established as a fraternity at Cornell University by CC Poindexter, though it operated as a social study club in 1905. The eight organizations which made up the National Pan-Hellenic Council until 1996 would be formed over the next decade and a half. Black fraternities and sororities were based on existing fraternities and sororities but cultural additions were made including calls, open hand signs, and step shows; though social in nature, many African- American fraternal organizations were formed with an emphasis on public service and civil rights. =Organization= The first attempt at organization between different fraternities began as a recommendation from members of Beta Theta Pi. Men representing thirteen fraternities officially and others present unofficially met in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 1883. They had intentions of having a conference the following year and several edits formed the Inter- Fraternity Press Association. Neither of these two ideas lasted. Kappa Kappa Gamma began the process of attempting to organize sororities in 1890. The first Panhellenic Convention of Woman's Fraternities was held in August 1891. Committees were created and reports were drafted but little was done to continue the organization. Fraternities and sororities united their efforts to make an appearance at the upcoming World's Fair in Chicago in 1893. They formed the Columbian Exposition Committee on Pan-Hellenism (the Chicago World's Fair was officially called the World's Columbian Exposition) and held a number of meetings on how to put together a joint exhibit. The exhibit never came together. Alpha Phi would take the initiative to inspire the first Inter- Sorority Conference in 1902. The conference was attended by representatives from Delta Delta Delta, Gamma Phi Beta, Alpha Phi, Kappa Alpha Theta, Kappa Kappa Gamma, Delta Gamma, and Pi Beta Phi in Chicago. The next few conferences would establish rules and standards such as a student-run Panhellenic Association on college campuses with two or more sororities and the rotation of officers in these associations and in the conference. The next decade would add many more sororities to the organization and it would be renamed the National Panhellenic Conference. The decade would also hold a new emphases on community service, standardized house rules, fairness policies for member recruitment, and an official stance against all secondary school sororities. The social fraternities would create small Pan-Hellenic organizations in various cities in the late 1890s and early 20th century. George D. Kimball of Sigma Alpha Epsilon would take initiative and call for a true national Pan- Hellenic group during a meeting of the National Religious Education Association in Chicago in February 1909. The Inter-Fraternity Conference would begin with twenty-six organizations that November in New York City. Like the sororities, the conference would call for local student-run Inter-Fraternity Councils on college campuses with more than one member organization. =Changes in the new century= As fraternities grew, new issues appeared. Ideas over who should be a member (often tied to racial or cultural background) differed between chapters which now spread throughout the United States and Canada. The undergraduate membership continued to grow but alumni membership had grown even more. Alumnae of women's sororities who had fought hard to help establish the idea of coeducation now questioned whether the new generation of women really understood the value of the sorority. There were always those against the fraternity and sorority system but it was not until the early 20th century that a real impact was made on chapters at some campuses. In some cases, the development of fraternity and sorority housing is all that saved Greek life as some universities had far outgrown their student housing capacities. Some campuses would ban Greek letter organizations and others would study their merits. Detractors argued that the groups hurt intellectual development, affronted religion with secret oaths, and fostered inappropriate behavior. The validity of these claims varied between campuses and organizations and, in many cases, the criticisms would remain but without any significant action for decades.

The business outcomes, on which IBP processes focus, can be expressed in terms of the achievement of the following types of targets: * Revenue & demand * Service levels * Inventory levels * Profits & margins * Cash flow  Integration elements  Integrated Business Planning is often defined in different ways. One challenge in developing a common definition of IBP is that there is no universally agreed way of describing different degrees and forms of integrated processes. Mature IBP processes enable organizations to bring together different elements of planning into a single process. This includes, but is not limited to, the following: * Supply & demand * Finance & operations * Functions & business processes * Strategy / Outcomes & business processes * Financial and non financial measures * Cash flow, costs and revenues The role of an IBP process is balance these different objectives in a way that achieves the best overall result. One way of accomplishing this is with prescriptive analytics. These tools are often employed in these processes to mathematically optimize parts of a plan, a classic example of which is inventory investment. The most mature IBP processes leverage IBP to mathematically optimize all aspects of a plan.  History  The term integrated business planning is an outgrowth of sales and operations planning (S&OP;) a term referring to processes that balance demand with manufacturing resources. There has been a lot of focus on integrated business planning in the context of sales and operations planning. Gartner refers to a 5-stage S&OP; maturity model wherein IBP is referred to as the Phased 4 & 5. Integrated Business Planning however is broader than S&OP.; It is an approach that combines Enterprise Performance Management (EPM) and S&OP; to provide incremental capabilities that neither provides individually. In so doing, IBP platforms address long-standing challenges that financial and operational professionals have struggled to overcome. The result: opportunities for step change improvements to how manufacturers plan, manage and govern their business. Here, the focus is on strengthening the financial integration and reconciliation of plans, as well as increasing the responsiveness of the supply chain using ad-hoc reports and what-if scenario analyses. To better predict customer demand, machine-learning technology helps to identify correlation patterns and automate the detection of demand changes.  Components  Integrated Business Planning requires the following capabilities to be enabled: a) Enterprise Model * Ability to create a demand chain model * Ability to create a supply chain model * Ability to create a finance chain model b) Integrated Planning * Ability to create a plan across multiple functions * Ability to create predictive and collaborative plans c) Enterprise Optimization * Ability to create optimized plans across multiple constraints * Ability to create financial integration across optimization  Applications  IBP has been used to model and integrate the planning efforts in a number of applications, including: * Product profitability * Customer profitability * Capital expenditures * Manufacturing operations * Supply chain * Business processes (human and information-based) * Business policy * Market demand curves * Competitive strategy All of the above can be summarized as Enterprise Optimization use cases.  Criticism  Some argue that IBP is not any different from S&OP.; Patrick Bower has described IBP as a marketing hoax,http://www.jaguar-aps.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IBP-is-a-Hoax.pdf a name developed to create confusion and sell consulting and system services. The main proponents of IBP are consulting companies. In response to this criticism it has been asserted that IBP is not a marketing hoax,http://www.industryweek.com/software-systems/integrated-business- planning-not-just-marketing-hoax but an important part of Enterprise Performance Management (EPM) system. Another criticism is that IBP is not academically definedhttp://supplychaintrend.com/2015/02/28/the-rise-and-fall- of-sop/ and is supply chain biased in its definition. The lack of academic standard leaves room for interpretation to what IBP is, which is confusing practitioners. In a 2015 S&OP; survey,https://supplychaintrends.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/supply-chain- trend-sop-pulse-check-2015.pdf 32% of participants answered that there is no difference between S&OP; and IBP, 20% \\"did not know\\", and 71% of participants answered that there is a need for more industry standards around S&OP.; It has been called out that IBP has a lack of governance and in need of an industry group to create a unified definition. Due this lack of academic and industry standards, there has been an attempt to create an open source definition for IBP.http://supplychaintrend.com/2015/11/25/a-new-definition-for-integrated- business-planning/ This definition is as follows: Integrated Business Planning (IBP): A holistic planning philosophy, where all organizational functions participate in providing executives periodically with valid, reliable information, in order to decide how to align the enterprise around executing the plans to achieve budget, strategic intent and the envisioned future.

Moving between countries and cultures – he has lived in Spain, the United Kingdom, Ireland, and finally outside of Tampa, Florida, in the United States– and although eventually distanced from the MADI movement's official conservative views, he remained always faithful to its concepts of ludic invention and whimsical humor within the boundaries of colorful geometric abstraction. > \\"Roitman is considered one of the great MADI creators.

The entity which Arden Quin and Roitman formed in 1951 eventually evolved into MADI International, that today comprises some sixty artists working on four continents. MADI Museum (Dallas, Tx.) 2002-2003. Facades designed by Volf Roitman Early years In 1951, Roitman moved to Paris, where he met the founder of the MADI movement, the Uruguayan master painter Carmelo Arden Quin. Following Roitman's proposal, both artists created the MADI Research and Study Center (for experimental art), which functioned through the 50s in Arden Quin's Montparnasse studio, an open workshop and research facility which significantly influenced the work of numerous European and North and South American artists then studying and working in the confines of the School of Paris. The Center promoted (1) non-figurative works with irregularly-shaped forms in flat, sharply defined colors; (2) the systemization of articulated, transformable and mechanized sculpture; and (3) an interdisciplinary approach to the arts first promoted by the Futurists but systemized, starting in the 40s, by MADI and by other groups such as Fluxus. In the field of MADI sculpture, massive structures are replaced by a dynamic relationship between the liness and planes of solid forms and the openings with which these forms are pierced. Space thus becomes an integral and equally important part of the work.Goodman, Shelley: Carmelo Arden Quin, When Art Jumped Out of Its Cage Madi Museum and Gallery, Dallas, Tx, 2004. Roitman navigated through the Parisian avant-garde scene of cafes, studios and galleries where he drew his main inspiration during those years from the Belgian master George Vantongerloo. He was also inspired with a work from the Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris: Malevich's 1915 seminal work '. \\"Already plunged into the worlds of Celtic myths, alchemy, and Zen Buddhism, Roitman believed that somewhere in this pale world of absent color, he might discover the absolute. From the beginning, his personal style involved a predominant use of circles, a complete break with Piet Mondrian’s sacrosanct straight linear structures and his orthogonal rigidity, a heresy for which he, like Georges Vantongerloo would often be signaled out and, on occasion, rebucked.\\" Roger Neyrat, a French artist and a veteran of MADI in the 50s, still remembers: \\"I held this work (a Roitman painting, called The Lost Triangle -1953) above myself, ready to make it circulate among the few dozens of people assisting at my reading at Claude Dorval Gallery (1995)…It's the most beautiful MADI work, repeated Carmelo several times. We haven't ever gone so far in our abstract works!\\" Roger Neyrat continues: \\"But beginning in 1956, Roitman initiated a series of more complex compositions where the design became more dynamic, the curves more playful and dancing. Two years later, in New York City, this process led to his series of “Memories of Balanchine” (1958–1960), real MADI ballets...A pure joy and an example for new generations. There is so much of joyful emotion on these works, a rare gift even with the great abstract masters. Roitman has gone even further!\\" During this period, Roitman's paintings were exhibited at the following venues: *Salon des Réalités Nouvelles, Paris: 1952 – 53 – 54 – 55 -56. *Galerie Suzanne Michel, Paris, February 1953 *Cercle Paul Valéry, La Sorbonne, Paris, 15 June 1953. *Galerie de l’Odéon, Paris February 1954. *Galerie Cimaise, in the show \\"14 Abstract Artistes\\", Paris, January 1955 acquis les bases solides de l’évolution picturale qui se manifestait alors. *In November, 1955, Volf Roitman's exhibition at the Galérie de Beaune in Paris constituted the first solo show by a MADI artist in Europe. *Galerie Denise René, Paris, a group show in April 1956 . From 1961 to 1982, Roitman consecrated himself mainly to literature and other creative activities.See further below The Renaissance Man The Var – Barcelona – 1979–1998 In 1979, although retaining his near Paris residence until 1984, Roitman started progressively to live most of the year in Montauroux, a village in the Var, behind the French Riviera. In 1982, Roitman produced his first 3-dimensional collages. That same year, from 12 February to 10 March, the Espace Donguy, Paris, presented Mouvances MADI, Lieu 5, a group of artists which included works by Roitman, together with A.Q. Nunez, Neyrat, Alocco, Asis, Belleudy, Blaine, Bory, Chubac, Fejer, Monticelli and Vardánega. This exhibition marked the beginning of Roitman's return to the visual arts, even though he was also still writing and working in the film business. Since then, Roitman's work has been featured in over 100 MADI group and one-man shows, gallery and museum exhibitions, art fairs and auctions on four continents. Among the most important shows and events: 4–30 November 1984: Exhibition of Arte MADI, 1946–1984, Attualita de un Movimento, variation on the de la Salle show in Oct., held at Il Salotto Gallerie d’Arte, Como, Italy. Manifesto called Perchè Arte MADI written by Salvador Presta and signed by A.Q., Presta, de la Salle, Roitman and Esposito. April 1991: Inauguration of Arte Concreto Invención, Arte MADI, an important historical book and retrospective organized by Miklos von Bartha at the Haus für Konstructive und Konkrete Kunst in Zurich, Switzerland. MADI historical artists in show are Arden Quin, Volf Roitman, Juan Bay, Martín Blaszko, Gyula Kosice, and Rhod Rothfuss. (see this Book) April 1992: Abstraction Geometrique show at the Galerie de la Salle, St-Paul-de-Vence.

From this period on, he will again show his work on a regular basis with the MADIstes. From 1992-2005, Roitman became both head of Communication and Archivist for the MADI Movement. April 1993 : One-man show of Roitman's recent decoupages and his historical pieces from the 50s inaugurated at the St. Charles de Rose Gallery in Paris, and from May 7 to June 5 at the Helios Gallery in Calais, France. From 10 June to 15 September 1993, Roitman was one of the main organizers of a MADI show at the Chateau St- Cirq-Lapopie (Lot), France, a space formerly devoted to André Breton and the Surrealists, with 40 MADI artists participating. Painting, sculpture and poetic acts. (See catalogues) 9 April 1994: Inauguration of the one-man show Volf Roitman, Obras MADI at Centro de Arte La Rectoria, St-Pere-de-Vilamajor (Greater Barcelona), Spain, curated by Josep Plandiura. A room at the show is devoted to an introduction of the MADI concept to the Spanish public, and it was here that Roitman first showed his Proteus sculptures – cardboard decoupage encased in molded plastic frames and suspended from large metal stands. 1995: 8 June: In conjunction with Carmelo Arden Quin: 44 Ans Après, exhibition at Claude Dorval Gallery, Paris. Show commemorates meeting in Paris, 44 years earlier, of Arden Quin and Roitman and their founding of the MADI Research and Study Center in Arden Quin's Montparnasse studio. A conference, attended by Tomás Maldonado, founder of the Argentine movement, Asociación Arte Concreto-Invención, and a former member of MADI Argentina, is given by Roger Neyrat and Volf Roitman in the Dorval gallery on June 18. 6 October: Inauguration of Continuidad MADI show at the Centoira Gallery in Buenos Aires together with works by A.Q., Blaszko, Bolivar and Laperèyre. Oct. 30-Dec. 30: MADI, Anterioridad y Continuidad MADI exhibition at Museo Torres García - Montevideo., Montevideo, Uruguay. Historical and recent works with Arden Quin and Bolivar. 1996: 7 March– 3 April: MADI Internacional, 50 Ans Despuès, a groundbreaking international exhibition curated by Cesar Lopez- Osornio and shown at the Centro de Exposiciónes y Congresos of the Ibercaja Bank in Zaragoza, Spain. Roitman writes the historical section of the catalogue and the MADI chronology, and he shows his works with 56 MADI artists from France, Belgium, Italy, Hungary, Spain, Japan, Argentina, Venezuela, United States and Uruguay which officially introduces MADI art in Spain. March 28–May 10: Inauguration of MADI: Dopo Il Rettancolo show at Arte Struktura Gallery in Milan, focused on the works of three MADI artists: Arden Quin, Salvador Presta and Roitman. 20 September, at the Albuquerque Museum, Roitman gave a conference in which he introduced his philosophy of MADI-Ludico architecture, the ideas for which grew out of his works with 3-dimensional collages and laser-cut sculpture: \\"Strictly polygonal design of asymmetric façades ...geometric forms with sharply defined colors and contours, tri- dimensional surfaces, a clearly 'ludico' (playful) spirit...the same basic computer program can produce an almost inexhaustible series of different exterior panels. This system provides us with the means to overthrow the tyranny of the module which has, with few exceptions, ruled architecture from the time of ancient Egypt...\\" The same day, in the same city, he inaugurated a solo show at the Arte Struktura Gallery. In October 1996, Roitman obtained a commission to design and build a model for his project of a MADI-Ludico building designated for a site in downtown Dallas. 1997: 30 June to 20 October: \\"Arte MADI\\", a vast retrospective curated by Maria-Lluisa Borràs for Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía, Madrid, with a 300-page catalogue in Spanish and English chronicling MADI history from its origins to the movement's present activities on 4 continents. Historical works by Roitman from the 50s and 2 contemporary sculpture pieces. In addition, an entire room at the Reina Sofía is devoted to a Roitman architectural model – his vision of a MADI building “where constant interplays of light and shadow situated the edifice in a chimerical constructivist category ... a game of spatial echoes”. Extracts of Roitman “Manifesto in favor of a MADI-Ludico Architecture” were published in the 300 page catalogue (see catalogue) 26 September to 31 October: Hors Cadre, exhibit of the works of Arden Quin and Volf Roitman, curated by Roberto Vignola for the Galerie Alexandre Mottier in Geneva. Da MADI à MADI, vast retrospective held at the Civica Galleria d’Arte Moderna in Gallarate (Greater Milan), Italy, curated by Emma Zanella Manara and Anna Canali and featuring works of 44 artists working today in MADI International and a historical section spotlighting the works of Arden Quin, Blaszko, Presta and Roitman. This Milan contemporary museum has since opened a new wing designed to display its permanent collection of MADI works. Between Florida and West Cork (1998- ) Since 1998, Roitman works out of studios in Tampa, Florida and West Cork, Ireland. In November 1999, he presented a solo show at the Sarasota Visual Art Center, about which the renowned art critic Marcia Corbino wrote: “The Sarasota Visual Art center has mounted a MADI festival which may earn the Arts Center a niche in the history of 20th century art.” One month later, Roitman unveiled a large metal wall relief commissioned by the Palmer Foundation of Houston, for the north wall of the Sarasota Center. Roitman originated and helped to organize the first North American exhibition exclusively devoted to MADI: \\"Outside the Box: Eleven International MADI Artists Featuring Carmelo Arden Quin and Volf Roitman From the Masterson and The Lenherr Collections,\\" shown at the Polk Museum in Lakeland, Florida from August to October 2001 and at the Gulf Coast Museum in Largo, Florida, from November to January 2002. Starting in January 2002, he created the entrance facade of the MADI Museum and was named its Artistic Director. The Museum and Gallery in the Uptown quarter of Dallas was inaugurated on 22 February 2003. The building's two principal facades were completely transformed by two-store high sculptural works specially created by Roitman during a fifteen-month period – asymmetrical pieces of the bright colors, drenched in ludic or whimsical cuts and folds and bolted to a mirrored background. This lightning bolt transformation of a pedestrian office building into a sculptural work is considered by Roitman to be the culmination of his own life devoted entirely to the arts. For the Museum's opening exhibition, a cornucopia of Roitman works was also on show – a mechanized moving tower, an explanatory mechanized sculpture entitled What Is MADI?, a wall of metal and Plexiglas \\"portholes\\", his abstract and stylized version of \\"the Movies\\", and other important pieces. Roitman also designed the museum's interior, including the transformation of an interior wall of the building's great hall into a unique sculptural piece of color and metal decoupages. From 9 November 2002 to 5 January 2003 \\"Heart and Mind – The Art of Volf Roitman,\\" featured at the Leepa-Rattner Museum of Art in Tarpon Springs, Florida. From July 9 to August 20, 2006, The Leepa- Rattner Museum presented \\"The Moving MADI World of Volf Roitman.\\" \\"The Roitman Gallery provides the real playground\\" (Lennie Bennet in the St. Petersburg Times of 9 July 2006.) The Renaissance Man =Theatre, literature and movies= > As both an artist and a man, Uruguayan-born, Argentine-educated, and > Parisian-nurtured Volf Roitman is as difficult to seize as a woodland faun; > as impossible to define as his multi-faceted, constantly changing kinetic > sculptures. Since his childhood, Roitman was attracted by the arts. Child-actor, he played in radio theater and recited poems for the benefit of the Allies of World War II during World War II. From 1946 to 1950, he was member of theatre groups \\"Tinglado\\" and \\"La Cima\\". Roitman began his professional life prosaically enough as a Buenos Aires architectural student. With a degree in hand, however, he quickly morphed into a poet, acting as the co-editor of a cutting- edge magazine called Poesía Buenos Aires. Still only 21 and sponsored by the French Embassy in Buenos Aires, he next found himself on a liner bound for France. Architecture, poetry and theater were cast to the ocean winds. Once in Paris, he decided, he would perfect his French at the Sorbonne and become a novelist as famous as Sartre or Camus, with the vitriol of Alfred Jarry thrown in for good measure. Fate in the form of fellow Uruguayan Carmelo Arden Quin would decide otherwise. Although master painter Arden Quin was 18 years older than his newest protégé, the duo soon functioned as complementary pieces of an avant-garde puzzle. Starting at the end of the 60s, MADI zigzagged in and out of Roitman's life; on occasion, he wrote the prefaces for Arden Quin shows and mulled over the idea of making collages. Mostly, however, he returned to writing – turning out plays, novels and satirical political pamphlets. His childhood and teen's love for the theatre stroked again and he wrote from 1956 to 1958 two experimental plays: Cesquetucroy and The Professor Omnium. About these works, André Breton, wrote \\"As much on the dramatic as the poetic level, your creation has made me discover a spring of utter beauty, one which is both wonderfully enveloped and 'effervescently new'.\\" During a three-year stint in the United States, from 1958 to the end of 1960 he and his first wife Rita Parr formed the Ion Theatre Group. At the Orpheum Theater in New York, in October 1960, Roitman produced the prelude to his quirky MADI play Thaswachuthink! His New York paintings, including the series of Memory of Balanchine, the last visual works he produced until 1982, were shown in the hall of the theater. (Certain scenes of play Thaswachuthink! were staged once more, by Diana Forgioni, at the Leepa Rattner Museum in July 2006.) Following his return to Paris, at the end of 1960, and until 1970, Roitman supported his artistic activities by forming a company specialized in model-making and design and in the installation of booths. He built three models reproducing Normandy's beaches and villages where Dwight D. Eisenhower's Army invasion took place, for the 20th Century film The Longest Day, and later, some of the largest (up to 55 square meters) architectural projects of this period. In 1962, under the pseudonym Alvar Dazil, he published the novel The Liquid Wall, dealing with the plight of European refugees in South America after World War I. The same year, Roitman and Arden Quin launched Ailleurs (8 issues until 1966), a French revue which published the latest in experimental art; and in the seventies, he also became involved in Parisian avant-garde film and literature. In 1969, under the pseudonym Guillaume Roux, he wrote the play Blue Like An Orange, a prize-winner in the 1969 Enghien (France) Dramatic Art Competition. In 1972, again under the pseudonym Guillaume Roux, he published the novel The Amerloques (The Yanks), a story of expatriate Americans in Paris, Presses de la Cité, Paris. From 1970 to 1982, together with his second wife Shelley Goodman, he was director of their film company Shelltrie Productions. An eclectic cinematographic career (productions of short films, script writing, introduction into France of films from Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Iran, Kuwait, etc., distribution; owner of a 2-screen art house in the Beaubourg section of Paris) 1981: Published Don Quixote and Sancho Panza in Feudal Country, a pamphlet that became famous in the cinema profession, where Roitman denounced the abuses of the monopolistic cinema system of distribution circuits: In 1985, under the pseudonym Dupond Dupont, he published another pamphlet: D'Où Vient la M… ( From Where the Sh...is Coming.) Roitman, invoking illustrious examples as Rabelais, uses the entire word. (Certain scenes of play Thaswachuthink! were staged once more, by Diana Forgioni, at the Leepa Rattner Museum in July 2006.) Return to visual arts The siren song of MADI called again. All of Roitman's frenzied activity gradually gelled into an enduring passion for a particular style of architectural sculpture where each morsel of his past experience found its niche. Starting with a two-dimensional surface and using only a box-cutter and his own dexterity, he arrived at three-dimensionality – complex abstract sculpture pieces formed from a single sheet of paper. On the surface, this cutout and folded work from the early 80s and 90s might seem a derivative of Japanese origami, but in reality its complex and whimsical nature is closer to children's pop-up books of the Victorian era. The magic of laser cutting soon led to metal sculptures so delicately and intricately delineated that they were often mistaken for the paper collages that had preceded them ten years before. Roitman's obsessions with asymmetry and the ludico whimsical also found their way into MADI new concepts that he kept mastering. This led to the kinetic pieces he showed at the Leepa-Rattner Museum of Art in 2002 and 2006...rotational towers and mural works, as geometric in form as sea anemones, swaying and grasping to the rhythm of unseen currents while curious organic parts open and close...The spectator has no need to walk around these sculptures; every facet will be revealed as color-drenched undulating forms change with each 360 degree turn the piece. Roitman's interests in literature, cinema and politics also came together in his newest Project – large MADI \\"books\\" dedicated to The Celebration of Dissent, with Mae West and Groucho Marx sharing places of honor with other revolutionaries – the serious and the less so.

Founded in 1973, Inform has published more than 100 reports covering chemical hazard prevention, solid waste prevention, extended producer responsibility, and sustainable transportation. Inform uses media, such as video, to educate the public about the environmental effects of various consumer products.  History  Inform was founded in 1973 by Joanna Underwood in order to document the environmental impact of business practices and identify practical options for change. Inform's research has been cited as providing \\"the intellectual underpinning for other advocacy groups\\". During 1976-1978, Inform investigated the land sales industry. The investigation led to proposed consumer amendments in the Federal Interstate Land Sales Reform Act. In 1986, recommendations made by David Sarokin and Warren Muir, researchers at Inform, resulted in the United States Environmental Protection Agency's creation of the Toxics Release Inventory.Too Little Toxic Waste Data New York Times, Oct 7, 1985, pg A31 Chemical research done by Inform on the benefits of waste prevention helped lead to the federal Pollution Prevention Act of 1990. Dow Chemical Company named Joanna Underwood to serve as part of its seven-member Corporate Environmental Advisory Council in the early nineties. By creating this council, Dow aimed to allow environmental advocates to examine its business practices. In 1995, Inform published a Toxics Watch report, which revealed that a significant portion of the toxic waste released into the environment originates from consumer products instead of chemical manufacturing plants. In 2000, Inform's Bus Futures report concluded that investment in natural gas buses is crucial in the development of cleaner buses and air. Between 2004 and 2005, Inform had assisted more than 77 institutions in the Northeastern United States prevent more than 56,000 pounds of toxic chemicals from reaching the waste stream.  The Secret Life Series  Part of Inform's Media Project, The Secret Life Series consists of several videos examining the environmental impacts of everyday items. The goal of this series is to increase awareness about the ways that production and consumption affect the environment and public health. On January 17, 2008, Inform released The Secret Life of Cell Phones online. This video details the implications of disposed unrecycled cell phones and the benefits of recycling old cell phones. The video has reached an audience of over 25,000 people in 87 countries and has been discussed on over 50 blogs. In August 2009, Inform released The Secret Life of Paper. The video has won the \\"Rethinking Resources Award\\" at the Ninth Annual Media That Matters Film Festival. Future videos in the series will deal with beef, antibacterial soaps, jeans, and plastic bags.

It was previously known as Bass River Light. It is owned by and sits on top of the Lighthouse Inn, a seasonal hotel. Creation During the early 1800s Bass River was an important safe harbor for schooners and fishing ships in Nantucket Sound. At that time, a small light was placed in the upper window of a private home to help mariners in the area. In 1850, the federal government of the United States appropriated $4000 to build a lighthouse near the breakwater at the mouth of Bass River. In 1854, construction began on the light and keepers home. As was typical of early Cape Cod style lighthouses, the light tower was an integral part of the keepers house, centered atop the dwelling's roof. Because most of these structures leaked significantly, they were replace with self-standing towers; the West Dennis Light is the only remaining lighthouse on Cape Cod built with this design. The light was lit in 1855, and continued in service until 1880, when the Lighthouse Service decided the Bass River Light was no longer necessary since a new light had been built at Stage Harbor in Chatham. After many complaints, the light was relit a year later. The Lighthouse Inn Deactivation and hotel use The Lighthouse Inn in 2017. The light was discontinued again in 1914. The opening of the Cape Cod Canal had substantially reduced traffic in Nantucket Sound and an automatic beacon, the Bass River West Jetty Light, had been installed at the entrance to Bass River. After being sold at auction, the Lighthouse property was purchased by Harry K. Noyes of the Noyes Buick Company in Boston. Noyes enlarged the Main House, built several cottages, and landscaped the grounds. After his death in 1933, the property was on the market for five years until State Senator Everett Stone purchased it. Stone was a developer from Auburn, Massachusetts who planned to develop the land and sell it. The papers on the land were passed too late in June to begin any construction, so he decided to take in overnight guests to help pay the mortgage. So many of the 1938 guests asked to return, Stone changed his mind about developing the land and began the Lighthouse Inn, which continues in the Stone family. Relighting Contemporary view of the light. After being dark for 75 years, the light itself was relit as one of a very few privately owned, privately maintained working lighthouses in the country. The light was relit on August 7, 1989, on the 200th anniversary of the U.S. Lighthouse Service, the U.S. Coast Guard. The light is lit only while the inn is open, from May 1 to October 31.

Its fossil remains have been found in Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay, Venezuela, Bolivia, and Brazil. Measuring approximately from snout to tail tip, it is estimated to have weighed .Farina, Richard A., Ada Czerwonogora, and MARIANA DI GIACOMO. \\"Splendid oddness: revisiting the curious trophic relationships of South American Pleistocene mammals and their abundance.\\" Anais da Academia Brasileira de Ciências 86.1 (2014): 311–331. . It was a herbivore and primarily fed on the grasses on the South American plains and is thought to perhaps have used its semi-bipedal stance to obtain foliage from trees. Lestodon is placed as member of the Mylodontidae as indicated by the lobed form of the last tooth in the dentition.  Etymology  The genus name Lestodon derives from the Greek for \\"robber tooth\\".  Evolutionary adaptations  = Cranial = Mounted skeleton of Lestodon armatus on display at the Museo de La Plata The skeleton morphologically reflects its evolutionary history as well as its daily activities. At the caudal end, the sloth’s head connects to its neck with a class one lever. The skull is two to three orders of magnitude larger than that of living species of sloth, but the muzzle itself shows highly positive allometry to the size of the skull in comparison to modern sloths and even other megafauna of the same order Pilosa. L. armatus had a large, blunt, and square mandible well adapted for foliage consumption. Its muzzle and dentition show a significant adaptation to this diet. The shape of the muzzle aided the ground sloth in the grazing necessary to sustain the metabolic activity of its large body; square, flat muzzles are associated with bulk feeders while pointed snouts are adaptive features of precision eaters, like the long sloping snout of modern anteaters, which are also in the same class Xenarthra (Bargo et al., 2006). The mandible, a class three lever, has a shape that indicates evolutionary pressure for strength over speed. To sustain its caloric needs with only plant matter, the sloth would have needed to be able to consume a high quantity of food with little precision. The species would dig for its food, and would have accidentally ingested a large amount of gritty dirt and soil particulate. This gives them a large crown height, called hypsodonty, that is unsuitable for strong bite forces. While the mandibular muscles would have been well developed to support the allometrically positive jaw of L. armatus, they would have also been extremely weak (Bargo et al., 2006). = Appendicular skeleton= The pursuit of bulk plant matter is reflected in the stance, movement, and total bone structure of the ground sloth. In order to dislodge a large amount of foliage from the earth, L. armatus would have used its flat, spade-like phalanges in a hook-and-pull fashion to turn over soil and vegetation. Once again, the evolutionary design of the giant sloth favors quantity and force to quality and speed in its manus. While the giant sloth was not fully bipedal, its forelimbs show evolutionary pressure for specialized functions over walking and could easily shift its center of gravity. The olecranon of L. armatus, for example, is longer allometrically than species whose forelimbs are primarily adapted for movement; the longer olecranon on the ulna maximizes the leverage to the moment arm of the triceps, the extensor of the forearm, but is proportionally much longer than is necessary for walking (Bargo et al., 2000). The extension of the forearm would have been very strong, but not very fast. Triceps are the primary muscle activated during the digging motion, but the odd articulation of the scapula to the humerus, and therefore the orientation of the teres major, also strengthens the force during pulling. Compared to humans, the scapula is tilted laterally, with the medial margin at a higher elevation than the acrimonion. This orientation maximizes the power of the teres major during digging. Energy storage is possible in the tendons of the triceps, produces power necessary to execute the digging behavior Lestodon armatus uses to acquire the bulk of its diet. The spinal column of L. armatus is arranged parallel to the ground, making the angle between the femurs and the majority of the mass of the megafauna slightly more than orthogonal. On the femur, the femoral condyles have a large articulated range, which helps them to extend their posture vertically from their normal quadrupedal position.Nick Milne, Nestor Toledo, Sergio F Vizcaino (2011). \\"Allometric differences in the xenarthan femur\\", Journal of Mammal Evolution, Published Online. Extant related species of the magnorder Xenarthra, like anteaters, show a similar design. All species within this order have specialized forelimbs and a center of gravity shifted caudally towards the pelvis from other quadrupeds, but rostrally when compared to fully bipedal humans. The lumbar vertebrae are said to be xenarthrous, the eponymous characteristic of the magnorder, and that means that they come into contact with each other at more points to stabilize the pelvis and the bulk of the caudally shifted mass. It would have been unable to gallop. In humans, pelvic bones are not fused together in a solid block, and this allows us greater variability of motion from side to side. Though there is reduced mobility, xenarthrous fusion provides a stable platform for digging.  Distribution  Fossils of Lestodon have been found in:Lestodon at Fossilworks.org * Luján, Pampean and Monte Hermoso Formations, Argentina * Tarija Formation, Bolivia * Rio Grande do Sul and São Paulo, Brazil * Paraguay * Dolores and Sopas Formations, Uruguay * Urumaco Formation, Urumaco, Venezuela (L. urumaquensis)  Evidence of hunting  Researchers working at the Arroyo del Vizcaíno site near Sauce, Uruguay e suggested that Lestodon was hunted by humans about 30,000 years ago. This was based on analysis of Lestodon bones. Deep slash markings on some of them were suggested to be from the use of human stone tools.Richard A. Fariña et al., Arroyo del Vizcaíno, Uruguay: a fossil-rich 30-ka-old megafaunal locality with cut-marked bones, Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, Published 20 November 2013, However, the date is significantly older than the oldest accepted dates for humans in South America around 15,000 years ago, and there is no evidence for stone tools at the site, making a natural origin for the marks more likely. { Skull of Lestodon armatus at the Harvard Museum of Natural History Phalanges of L. armatus at the Harvard Museum of Natural History Right foot of L. armatus }  References  Category:Prehistoric sloths Category:Prehistoric mammal genera Category:Pliocene xenarthrans Category:Pleistocene xenarthrans Category:Pliocene mammals of South America Category:Pleistocene mammals of South America Category:Lujanian Category:Ensenadan Category:Montehermosan Category:Huayquerian Category:Neogene Argentina Category:Neogene Venezuela Category:Fossils of Venezuela Category:Pleistocene Argentina Category:Fossils of Argentina Category:Pleistocene Bolivia Category:Fossils of Bolivia Category:Pleistocene Brazil Category:Fossils of Brazil Category:Pleistocene Paraguay Category:Fossils of Paraguay Category:Pleistocene Uruguay Category:Fossils of Uruguay Category:Fossil taxa described in 1855 ","title":"Lestodon"},{"id":"18134492","text":"Ein 'Arik () is a Palestinian town in the Ramallah and al-Bireh Governorate, located 7 kilometers west of Ramallah in the northern West Bank.

Taxonomy and etymology  The scientific name is derived from the Greek word \\"chaíti\\" meaning \\"mane\\" and \\"dipteros\\" meaning \\"with two fins.\\" The Atlantic spadefish belongs to the genus Chaetodipterus, which includes two other species: the West African spadefish (Chaetodipterus lippei) and the Pacific spadefish (Chaetodipterus zonatus). The genus Chaetodipterus belongs to the family Ephippidae, which includes spadefish and batfish. Chaetodipterus faber is known by numerous other colloquial names, including angelfish, white angelfish, threetailed porgy, ocean cobbler, and moonfish.  Description  The disk-shaped body is very deep and compressed, and the snout is blunt. There are 9 dorsal spines and 21-24 soft dorsal rays, and there are 3 anal spines and 17-19 anal rays. The second dorsal and anal fins of adults have long, trailing anterior lobes, giving an \\"angelfish-like\\" appearance. The body is silver in color with irregular black vertical bands that fade gradually with age. There are 4-6 black vertical bands on each side, with the first running through the eye and the last running through the caudal peduncle. The mouth is small, with the maxilla of adults ending beneath the nostrils. The teeth are small and brushlike, and there are no teeth on the roof of the mouth. The head and fins are covered with ctenoid scales. Specimens commonly weigh from 3 to 10 pounds (1.4 to 4.5 kg), although individuals as large as 20 pounds (9 kg) have been recorded. Their maximum length is about 36 inches (91 cm).  Diet  A large Atlantic spadefish caught off the coast of Virginia. Atlantic spadefish feed on small, benthic invertebrates including crustaceans, mollusks, annelids, and cnidarians. They also feed on plankton in the water column.  Distribution and habitat  The species is endemic to the western Atlantic Ocean. They are found off the coast of the southeastern United States as far north as Massachusetts, the Gulf of Mexico, and in the Caribbean. They are also found in Bermuda and the eastern coast of Brazil. The fish inhabits marine and brackish waters typically in subtropical climates. They are common in shallow waters along coastlines with depths of 3–35 meters. Juveniles commonly inhabit estuaries until maturity and adults prefer mangroves, beaches, and harbors.  Reproduction and life cycle  Spawning season occurs from May to September. A female can release up to one million eggs per season. The eggs hatch after 24 hours and the larvae feed on a yolk for two days before actively feeding.  Importance to humans  Atlantic spadefish are not of much commercial value. Due to their reputation as strong fighters, they are popular game fish, especially during the summer months when they are most active. The Atlantic spadefish has become a popular target species for sportfishermen due to their abundance and the strong fight they have for their size. They are good table fare, especially if smoked or grilled. A common method of catching involves using small pieces of clam on a small circle hook.

Her stage debut was in 1775 in Pasquale Anfossi's opera La finta giardiniera. This was followed by Ignaz Umlauf's Singspiel Die Bergknappen in 1778 and the role of Fräule Nannette in Salieri's Der Rauchfangkehrer on 30 April 1781, a role specifically written for her to display her virtuosity. Similarly, Mozart wrote the role of Konstanze in his Singspiel Die Entführung aus dem Serail for her, which she premiered on 16 July 1782. On 1 June 1785 she sang the role of Enrichetta in the première of Stephen Storace's Gli sposi malcontenti. On 7 May 1788, Cavalieri sang the role of Donna Elvira in the Vienna première of Mozart's Don Giovanni. Other works by Mozart written for her are Davide penitente (1785) and the role of Mademoiselle Silberklang in Der Schauspieldirektor (1786). After 1790, Cavalieri gradually withdrew from the stage and retired on 1 March 1793. She died unmarried in Vienna in 1801, aged 46. Cavalieri is a nonspeaking role in Peter Shaffer's play Amadeus. The speaking role of Cavalieri in the 1984 Oscar-winning film based on that play is played by Christine Ebersole and sung by Suzanne Murphy.

The new provisions in Title VII of FISA were scheduled to expire on December 31, 2012, but two days before the U.S. Senate extended the FISA Amendments Act for five years, which renewed the U.S. government's authority to monitor electronic communications of foreigners abroad. In January 2018 this was extended by six more years. Section 702 permits the Attorney General and the Director of National Intelligence to jointly authorize targeting of persons reasonably believed to be located outside the United States, but is limited to targeting non-U.S. persons. Once authorized, such acquisitions may last for periods of up to one year. Under subsection 702(b) of the FISA Amendments Act, such an acquisition is also subject to several limitations. Specifically, an acquisition: * May not intentionally target any person known at the time of acquisition to be located in the United States; * May not intentionally target a person reasonably believed to be located outside the United States if the purpose of such acquisition is to target a particular, known person reasonably believed to be in the United States; * May not intentionally target a U.S. person reasonably believed to be located outside the United States; * May not intentionally acquire any communication as to which the sender and all intended recipients are known at the time of the acquisition to be located in the United States; * Must be conducted in a manner consistent with the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Section 702 authorizes foreign surveillance programs by the National Security Agency (NSA), like PRISM and some earlier data collection activities which were previously authorized under the President's Surveillance Program from 2001. Legislative history * June 20, 2008: Passed the U.S. House of Representatives, by a 293 to 129 vote. * June 26, 2008: A Senate vote was delayed by a filibuster spearheaded by Senators Russ Feingold and Chris Dodd. Feingold said the bill threatened civil liberties in the United States; Dodd has said granting retroactive immunity would undermine the rule of law. * July 9, 2008: Dodd's amendment calling for a striking of Title II (the immunity provisions) was rejected 66 to 32. The bill itself was then put to a vote and passed 69 to 28. * July 10, 2008: President George W. Bush signed the bill into law. * September 12, 2012: The House of Representatives voted, 301 to 118, to extend the FISA Amendments Act for five years, after the act was to expire at the end of 2012. * December 28, 2012: By a vote of 73 to 23, the U.S. Senate voted to extend the FISA Amendments Act for five years until December 31, 2017 * December 30, 2012: President Barack Obama signed the bill into law.FISA Warrantless Wiretapping Bill Poised For RenewalStatement by the Press Secretary on H.R. 5949 * January 18, 2018: The Senate approved a six-year extension of Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. * January 19, 2018: President Donald Trump signed S. 139, FISA Amendments Reauthorization Act of 2017, into law. =Netroots opposition to the bill= A group of netroots bloggers and Representative Ron Paul supporters joined together to form a bipartisan political action committee called Accountability Now to raise money during a one-day money bomb, which, according to The Wall Street Journal, would be used to fund advertisements against Democratic and Republican lawmakers who supported the retroactive immunity of the telecommunications company. Provisions Specifically, the Act: * Prohibits the individual states from investigating, sanctioning of, or requiring disclosure by complicit telecoms or other persons. * Permits the government not to keep records of searches, and destroy existing records (it requires them to keep the records for a period of 10 years). * Grants telecommunications companies immunity for cooperation with authorities – **\\"Release from liability.—No cause of action shall lie in any court against any electronic communication service provider for providing any information, facilities, or assistance in accordance with [an order/request/directive issued by the Attorney General or the Director of National Intelligence]\\"\\"FISA Amendments Act of 2008\\" – Section 702, subsection h, paragraph 3; Section 703, subsection e. * Removes requirements for detailed descriptions of the nature of information or property targeted by the surveillance if the target is reasonably believed to be outside the country. * Increased the time for warrantless surveillance from 48 hours to 7 days, if the FISA court is notified and receives an application, specific officials sign the emergency notification, and relates to an American located outside of the United States with probable cause they are an agent of a foreign power. After 7 days, if the court denies or does not review the application, the information obtained cannot be offered as evidence. If the United States Attorney General believes the information shows threat of death or bodily harm, they can try to offer the information as evidence in future proceedings. * Permits the Director of National Intelligence and the Attorney General to jointly authorize warrantless electronic surveillance, for one-year periods, targeted at a foreigner who is abroad. This provision was set to sunset on December 31, 2012; however, on December 30, 2012, President Obama signed a bill to extend this provision until December 31, 2017. * Requires FISA court permission to target wiretaps at Americans who are overseas. * Requires government agencies to cease warranted surveillance of a targeted American who is abroad if said person enters the United States. (However, said surveillance may resume if it is reasonably believed that the person has left the States.) * Prohibits targeting a foreigner to eavesdrop on an American's calls or e-mails without court approval. * Allows the FISA court 30 days to review existing but expiring surveillance orders before renewing them. * Allows eavesdropping in emergencies without court approval, provided the government files required papers within a week. * Prohibits the government from invoking war powers or other authorities to supersede surveillance rules in the future. * Requires the Inspectors General of all intelligence agencies involved in the President's Surveillance Program to \\"complete a comprehensive review\\" and report within one year Effects * The provisions of the Act granting immunity to the complicit telecoms companies create a roadblock for a number of lawsuits intended to expose and thwart the alleged abuses of power and illegal activities of the federal government since and before the September 11 attacks. * Allows the government to conduct surveillance of \\"a U.S. person located outside of the U.S. with probable cause they are an agent of a foreign power\\" for up to one week (168 hours) without a warrant, increased from the previous 48 hours, as long as the FISA court is notified at the time such surveillance begins, and an application as usually required for surveillance authorization is submitted by the government to FISA within those 168 hours ACLU lawsuit The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) filed a lawsuit challenging the FISA Amendments Act of 2008 on the day it was enacted. The case was filed on behalf of a broad coalition of attorneys and human rights, labor, legal, and media organizations whose ability to perform their work—which relies on confidential communications—could be compromised by the new law. The complaint, captioned Amnesty et al. v McConnell and filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, argued that the eavesdropping law violated people's rights to free speech and privacy under the First and Fourth Amendments to the Constitution. The case was dismissed from the district court on the grounds that the plaintiffs could not prove their claims, but was revived in March 2011 by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, which disagreed.\\"Amnesty et al. v. Blair: Victory in FISA Amendment Act Challenge\\", ACLU. March 21, 2011. Accessed March 22, 2011 The subsequent citation was Amnesty v. Blair. Comparisons In an internet broadcast interview with Timothy Ferriss, Daniel Ellsberg compared the current incarnation of FISA to the East German Stasi. Ellsberg stated that the powers which were currently being given to the federal government through this and other recent amendments to FISA since the September 11 attacks opened the door to abuses of power and unwarranted surveillance.
