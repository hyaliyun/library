Its vehicles are assembled in both the US and China with assembly shops in the US, Australia, and Vietnam. ZEV says its electric scooters are the world's most powerful, fastest, and have the longest range. History Zev began as a garage project for Darus Zehrbach Jr., in his home garage in 2006. He saw the potential for a global market, while traveling the world as a mechanical engineer. In 2009 operations moved to an airport hangar in Waynesburg, PA before moving back to Morgantown, WV in 2013 where the company is currently located. Zehrbach's son, Darus Zehrbach III, joined the family business at age 24 after earning an MBA from West Virginia University. Scooters and motorcycles ZEV T series ZEV has 19 electric scooter models The scooters range from the ZEV 3600 with a top speed of and a range of , to the 10 LRC, with a range (at 65% power) of , and a top speed of . ZEV also makes a line of electric motorcycles, full fairing sports bikes referred to as their M-S line. ZEV hub motor ZEV uses a gearless electromagnet powered hub style motor and powers its scooters with lithium batteries, as well as less costly lead/sodium silicate batteries. ZEV's large- diameter, multiphase motors, are cooled using an oil bath arrangement, which lets ZEV run a large motor at high speeds without the power sapping and motor- destroying effects of excess heat. ZEV claims that its motors are among the world's most efficient in that they have more range than other competing bikes with up to 30% more battery capacity. ZEV competed in the 2016 Vetter Challenge, an Ohio efficiency rally‚Äîthough ZEV's scooters were disqualified for failing to finish.The Vetter Challenge is a set course fuel economy contest, which in 2016 pitted electric versus gas powered motorcycles and scooters. \\"What we try to do is offer higher speeds and performance than the competition, generally at 25 percent less price. We're the only company that uses hub motors, built in the back wheel. There's no chain, there's no belt drive and no air being forced through the motor, so you'll find our bikes are significantly quieter than anybody else's electric bike,\\" said Zehrbach. Markets In addition to sales in the US, as of 2013 ZEV was exporting scooters to 24 countries worldwide, and has won awards for exports and marketing. With 19 models of scooter, and a motorcycle, ZEV is reported to have the widest range of models of any electric motorcycle and scooter manufacturing company in the world. Past convictions of founder  In 1994 a court upheld the conviction of Darus Zehrbach and an associate on charges of bankruptcy fraud dating back to 1989. Mr. Zehrbach was accused of rigging an auction of the assets of a bankrupt aircraft manufacturing company, by paying off others to refrain from bidding. Mr. Zehrbach was sentenced to imprisonment for 21 months, followed by three years of supervised release. In 2004 a court confirmed another conviction of Mr. Zehrbach and an associate of conspiracy to defraud buyers of aircraft kit engines between 1994 an 1996. Zehrbach was found to have promised to deliver aircraft engine kits that did not yet exist. The court concluded the engines did not exist, he had no intention of delivering them, and simply took the buyers‚Äô money and never repaid it. The court affirmed his sentence of 54 months imprisonment, and required restitution of $224,148.10. In April 2019 Zehrbach was again sentenced to prison time; this time for lying to a federal agent about his violation of economic sanctions against Iran by exporting scooters there.

Now a popular fixture of the park, its placement there was originally controversial. In 1855, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow published a book-length poem entitled The Song of Hiawatha. Longfellow never visited Minnesota, but he set his poem among the Ojibwe and Dakota of the region. The poem's story line was based on traditional Haudenosaunee (Iroquois) tales, as recorded, sometimes incorrectly, by Henry Rowe Schoolcraft. The Song of Hiawatha was widely read and had significant cultural influence in the United States through the rest of the nineteenth century and into the twentieth century. Accomplished Norwegian sculptor Jacob Fjelde immigrated to Minnesota in 1887, following family members to the area. He established a studio in Minneapolis and began receiving public and private commissions. One commission was to create a sculpture for the Minnesota Building at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago. Fjelde chose to create Hiawatha and Minnehaha, a plaster sculpture illustrating a particular section of Longfellow's poem, The Song of Hiawatha. This work was installed at the entrance of the Minnesota Building for the duration of the 1893 Exposition. Then, it was put on display in the Minneapolis Public Library. Fjelde's expenses for Hiawatha and Minnehaha were paid for by small donations collected from Minnesota schoolchildren. Mrs. L.P. (Lizzie) Hunt, a founding member of the Mankato Art History Club and later an official art critic for the state, organized the fundraising drive. Beginning in 1902, an informal public campaign was launched to cast Fjelde's original plaster Hiawatha and Minnehaha sculpture in bronze and place it in Minneapolis's Minnehaha Park, near the falls mentioned in Longfellow's poem. Critics of the move said that the piece was \\"flawed,\\" specifically that the features of Hiawatha and Minnehaha were not Indian enough. Fjelde had struggled to find American Indian people to model the faces after, and he relied on photographs to guide his work. The sculptor died in 1896, so significant changes to the sculpture were no longer possible by 1902. The debate continued until 1912, when the sculpture finally was cast, then installed and unveiled in a public ceremony at Minnehaha Park on October 5. Charles M. Loring, the first president of the Board of Park Commissioners for the Minneapolis Park System, gave a dedicatory speech. Local schoolchildren sang and recited parts of Longfellow's poem as part of the program. Fjelde's Hiawatha and Minnehaha soon became a visitor attraction in the park, and postcards depicting it were widely available. As of 2011, the sculpture remains in its location along Minnehaha Creek and is one of Fjelde's best- known works.

The program is administered by Master Instructors LLC of Longmont, Colorado, and is open to all qualified aviation educators regardless of their other affiliations. MICEP designations identify and recognize educators who have demonstrated an ongoing commitment to excellence and professional growth in, as well as service to, the aviation community. Accreditations are valid for 24 calendar months and are renewable based on documenting activity in five broad, aviation-related categories: Educator, Service to the Aviation Community, Creator of Media, Continuing Education, and Participant. MICEP is approved for credit under the FAA WINGS Pilot Proficiency Program, and can be used to renew an unexpired flight instructor certificate. Designations :* Master Aviation Educator (MAE) :* Master Certificated Flight Instructor (MCFI) :* Master Certificated Flight Instructor-Aerobatic (MCFI-A) :* Master Certificated Flight Instructor-Helicopter (MCFI-H) :* Master Ground Instructor (MGI) :* Master Instructor Emeritus (MIE) Designees According to the General Aviation Awards Program, from 1998 through 2014, 25 of the 31 combined National winners in the Certificated Flight Instructor of the Year and the FAA Safety Team Representative of the Year categories were MICEP designees. In a survey of designees, the majority of program participants reported a corresponding 10‚Äì40 percent increase in income as a result of their MICEP designation. Derivative Programs MICEP was the first such accreditation program for aviation educators. The program‚Äôs underlying principles coupled with its success have been the model for at least two other similar programs. The Soaring Society of America (SSA), for example, instituted a Master Instructor Cross-Country Program ‚Äúin response to member demands for better access to cross country instruction.‚Äù A program offered by the National Association of Flight Instructors (NAFI) draws heavily on MICEP‚Äôs original concepts, formatting, and in many cases, even its wording. In contrast to the derivatives, membership in a particular organization is not a prerequisite to apply for a MICEP designation. History 1995: Longtime aviation educators JoAnn and Sandy Hill (the Hills) initiated research, development, and vetting of the Master Instructor Continuing Education Program. At the time, the Hills were also serving as volunteer board members with NAFI. 1997: MICEP was launched through NAFI, allegedly under a non-exclusive, royalty-free, implied license with the Hills. Under a separate agreement, the Hills received a portion of application fees collected by NAFI as nominal compensation for administering the program as well as reimbursement of administrative costs. 2009: Since its debut in 1997, the Hills had continuously administered, improved, and expanded MICEP. In early 2009, the Hills severed their ties and terminated the implied license with NAFI. The Hills then formed Master Instructors LLC to provide the ‚Äúautonomy and independence to ensure the continued development and integrity of the Master Instructor Program.‚Äù After failed attempts to get NAFI to cease its alleged continued misappropriation of the Hills‚Äô intellectual property, a copyright infringement lawsuit was filed against that organization. 2010: A year after filing the copyright infringement lawsuit, the Hills agreed to dismiss the case, citing among other things that they felt ‚Äúvindicated by the response of the marketplace to our program. Moreover, events of the last year have simply rendered many of our concerns irrelevant to the continued prosecution of our case.\\" 2013: MICEP transitioned to an Internet-based application and review process automated using Fluidreview's online application management system. The program‚Äôs web presence was enhanced with an overhaul of its web and social media sites.

Both nations are members of the Organization of Ibero-American States and the United Nations. History=Colonial times= The territory that became Colombia was first visited by Europeans when the first expedition of Alonso de Ojeda arrived at the Cabo de la Vela in 1499. The Spanish made several attempts to settle along the north coast of today's Colombia in the early 16th century, but their first permanent settlement, at Santa Marta, was not established until 1525. Cartagena was founded on June 1, 1533 by Spanish commander Pedro de Heredia, and grew rapidly, fueled first by the gold in the tombs of the Sin√∫ culture, and later by trade. The Spanish advance from inland from the Caribbean coast began independently from three different directions, under Jimen√©z de Ques√°da, Sebasti√°n de Belalc√°zar and Nikolaus Federmann. Although all three were drawn by the Indian treasures, none intended to reach Muisca territory, where they finally met.Lonely Planet, \\"History of Colombia\\", http://www.lonelyplanet.com/colombia/history. Accessed 6 May 2013. In August 1538 Ques√°da founded Santa Fe de Bogot√° on the site of Muisca village of Bacat√°. In 1549, the Spanish Royal Audiencia made Bogot√° the capital of New Granada, which comprised in large part what is now territory of Colombia. In 1717, the Viceroyalty of New Granada was originally created, with Santa F√© de Bogot√° as its capital. This Viceroyalty included some other provinces of northwestern South America which had previously been under the jurisdiction of the Viceroyalties of New Spain or Peru and correspond mainly to today's Venezuela, Ecuador and Panama. Bogot√° thus became one of the principal administrative centers of the Spanish possessions in the New World. =Independence= The battle of Boyac√° was the decisive battle which would ensure the success of the liberation campaign of New Granada. A movement initiated by Antonio Nari√±o, who opposed Spain's centralism and led the opposition against the viceroyalty, leading to the independence of Cartagena in November 1811, and the formation of two independent governments which fought a civil war ‚Äì a period known as La Patria Boba. The following year Nari√±o proclaimed the United Provinces of New Granada, headed by Camilo Torres Tenorio. Despite the successes of the rebellion, the emergence of two distinct ideological currents among the liberators (federalism and centralism) gave rise to an internal clash which contributed to the reconquest of territory by the Spanish. The viceroyalty was restored under the command of Juan de Samano, whose regime punished those who participated in the uprisings. Renewed rebellion, combined with a weakened Spain, made possible a successful rebellion led by the Venezuelan-born Sim√≥n Bol√≠var, who finally proclaimed independence in 1819. The pro-Spanish resistance was finally defeated in 1822 in the present territory of Colombia and in 1823 in Venezuela. The territory of the Viceroyalty of New Granada became the Republic of Colombia organized as a union of Ecuador, Colombia (including modern-day Panama) and Venezuela. The Congress of C√∫cuta in 1821 adopted a constitution for the new Republic, and Sim√≥n Bol√≠var became the first President of Colombia. However, the new republic was unstable and ended with the rupture of Venezuela in 1829 and Ecuador in 1830. =Post-independence= Colombia and Spain officially established diplomatic relations in 1881 when representatives of both nations signed a Treaty of Peace and Friendship in Paris. During the years, relations between the two nations decreased as Spain lost its importance in the region, especially after its defeat in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War and Spain's influence in the region diminished. During the Spanish Civil War, many in Colombia supported the Nationalist faction led by General Francisco Franco against the Republican faction.Trazos y trozos sobre el uso y abuso de la Guerra Civil Espa√±ola en Colombia (in Spanish) During this time, some Spaniards immigrated to Colombia to flee the war. However, they were not large in number relative to the Spanish immigration to Argentina, Mexico and Uruguay during the same period. After the war, Colombia maintained diplomatic relations with the Spanish government under General Franco. In October 1976, Spanish King Juan Carlos I paid an official visit to Colombia, his first as King of Spain.Los Reyes de Espa√±a viajan hoy a Colombia (in Spanish) Since then, the Spanish royal family has paid several visits to Colombia and several Colombian presidents have paid official visits to Spain. Over the years, both nations have signed agreements and treaties on judicial cooperation, dual nationality, extradition, social security, guarantee of intellectual property, promotion and protection of investments, tourisim, avoidance of double taxation and agreement for resident citizens of both nations to vote in local municipal elections.Instrumentos y Acuerdos suscritos entre Colombia y Espa√±a (in Spanish) Transportation There are direct flights between both nations with Air Europa, Avianca and Iberia.

He was a right-handed tail-end batsman and a right-arm fast-medium bowler. He was born at Binley, Coventry and died at Coventry. Cricket career Thompson made his debut in first-class cricket as a 16-year-old in 1949 and the following year created something of a stir by taking five Gloucestershire wickets ‚Äì the top five in the batting order, including Test players Jack Crapp and Tom Graveney ‚Äì for just 16 runs in a County Championship match. In 1951, he played half a dozen games and improved his best bowling analysis in the match against Leicestershire with six wickets for 63 runs. From 1952, he was on National Service in the Royal Air Force for two years, but in the first of those seasons he played a few games for Warwickshire and against Nottinghamshire, still aged only 19, he took nine first-innings wickets for 65 runs, which were the best innings figures of his career. Following discharge in 1954, Thompson returned to Warwickshire and was a full-time professional cricketer for the next eight seasons. Yet injury, variable form and fickle selection policies meant that in only four of those eight seasons could he be regarded as a regular first-team player, a fact much commented on in his obituary in Wisden Cricketers' Almanack. His contemporary and fellow opening bowler Jack Bannister was quoted as saying that Warwickshire \\"did him no favours\\" by preferring short-term imported players \\"just at a time when an extended run in the first team would have benefited club and player\\". Thompson had two very good seasons: 1955, when he was awarded his county cap and took 92 wickets, and 1959, when his 97 wickets cost only 17.96 runs apiece and placed him sixth in the first-class averages at the end of the season. He did not improve on his 1952 bowling figures, but against Hampshire in 1959 he took four for 48 and eight for 94 for his best match figures of 12 for 142. Later in the same 1959 season, he took eight Gloucestershire wickets for 40 runs, bowling for 25 consecutive overs from the start of the innings. In between those two successful seasons, however, in 1957 he played only six first-team matches and took just nine wickets. He played in three-quarters of Warwickshire's matches in the 1961 season and took 77 wickets. But at the end of that season, not guaranteed a secure place in the team, he took a job at the Lockheed automotive components factory in Leamington and rejected terms for the 1962 season. In the event, he was persuaded to return for the second half of the 1962 season to give an attack over-reliant on medium-paced bowling an extra edge, but he took only 23 wickets and that was the end of his first-class career. Thompson was no batsman and always batted at No 10 or No 11 for Warwickshire; his highest score in first-class cricket was 25 which he reached twice, both times remaining not out.

The Benedictine Rule was declared the universally valid norm for communities of monks and nuns, while canonical orders were distinguished from monastic communities and unique regulations were laid down for them: the Institutio canonicorum Aquisgranensis. The synods of 817 and 818/819 completed the reforms. Among other things, the relationship of church properties to the king was clarified. Manuscript of the canonical regulations laid down at the Synod of Aachen (Dombibliothek W√ºrzburg M.p.th.q.25 Concilium Aquisgranense a. 816. Institutio sanctimonialium Aquisgranensis)  Background  The monastic life played an important role in spiritual and intellectual life in the Frankish realm. The orders had important tasks in church life. But they were also significant for the economic and intellectual integration of new territories, such as Saxony into the empire; several cloisters were closely connected with the ruling house. However, the orders were not uniformly organised. In the previous centuries, mixed rules (regula mixta) dominated. Such a mixed rule was even imported to Monte Cassino after its refoundation in the eighth century. In the Frankish realm the Benedictine Rule was frequently mixed with the Columbine Rule. Furthermore, orders of canons and canonesses had developed alongside the orders of monks and nuns. There were also mixtures between these two basic types of holy order. Charlemagne began to regulate the monastic life in 789, with the Admonitio generalis. Among other things, it declared that obedience to the Benedictine Rule should be central for the orders. The decisions of a synod in Aachen in 802 built on that. Visitations to the orders followed. A court day (Hoftag) held in the second half of the year ruled, that in future the Benedictine Rule should be the sole binding rule for monastic orders. Nevertheless, there continued to be a number of orders following other regulations.Gudrun Gleba: Kl√∂ster und Orden in Mittelalter. Darmstadt, 2008 S.66‚Äì68  Proceedings  Louis the Pious appointed Benedict of Aniane to enforce the Benedictine Rule throughout the empire, shortly after his accession. The Emperor summoned an imperial synod at Aachen in August 816. The main issues of this synod were the reform of the monastic life and the regulation of the canonical life. The synods were preceded by very intensive preparations, including a list of the issues to be addressed which Benedict of Aniane had collated. According to the imperial capitulary in which the results were published, the discussion took place in the Royal Palace of Aachen. Abbots and monks participated and the Emperor himself was personally present, even intervening in the debates. Bishops and important secular officials took part as well. A list of the participants does not exist. Among them was Hetto of Trier and Adalhoh of Strassbourg. Hildebold of Cologne, as archchaplain, was probably present. Magnus of Sens and Agobard of Lyon left early. The Abbots in attendance included Ando of Malmedy Stablo in Aachen and Helysacher of St Maximin in Trier, who was also in charge of the Imperial chancellary. Ratgar of Fulda might have been present as well, since his abbey was very well informed on the results of the synod. = Monastic lifestyle = Only minimal notes exist about the course of the synod. A central point was the orientation of the monastic life along the lines of the Benedictine Rule. As important as Benedict of Aniane's role was, he was not always been able to prevail despite his position. An important point was the plan to force monasteries' to conform to the liturgical practice of the Benedictines. The bishops who would not tolerate any deviation from the Roman rite, opposed this. Eventually a compromise was reached on this point. There was also controversy about whether the property of novices should be taken by the monastery or returned to their families. There was discussion on other technical issues as well. But in the core matters, Benedict of Aniane took on an authoritative role. He explained the Benedictine Rule to the participants, clarified doubts, and refuted errors of interpretation. He said that everything which conformed with the rule was good. He succeeded in making the Benedictine Rule the general norm for the monastic life in the Frankish realm. The decisions made in Aachen deviated from the original rule only in minor details. These were mostly traditions built up over the preceding centuries. Benedict of Aniane himself did not dare to make a radical break with tradition and, as a result, some non-Benedictine elements were maintained, but he tried to make the regulations enacted come as close to the original Rule as possible. Overall, the regulation of the Benedictine Rule was a significant step. This is sometimes seen as the real beginning of the Benedictine order. All orders founded in the following centuries were organised in accordance with the principles of this rule. The rules of the mendicant orders founded in the thirteenth century were the first to diverge from this basis. = Canons and canonesses = Another important aspect was to define monks and canons in relation to one another and to end the mixing of the two lifestyles which had begun in the eighth century. There had been attempts at this for some time already - the rule of Chrodegang of Metz issued around 755 had closely anticipated this standardisation - but there had been only limited success. In Aachen, Louis the Pious demanded that the rules for the communal life of canons should be collected from the old books. Some bishops were not convinced of the necessity of this, but such a collection was nevertheless created, which was agreed to by the council. This consisted of a rule for canons (Institutio canonicorum) and one for canonesses (Institutio sanctimonitalium). The canons were required to celebrate general services and the liturgy of the hours and to maintain a communal life in an enclosed area, which was required to include a common dormitory and a common dining hall. Unlike monks and nuns, canons were permitted to keep personal possessions, though personal poverty was to be the ideal for them too. They would not be allowed to lay aside any lifelong vows. Provosts would oversee canonical communities. In many respects, the lives of canonesses was similarly regulated, but their communities were to be led by Abbesses. The first Stift communities were established in 816 and 817. In the following two centuries it was often unclear in practice whether a particular Stift was an order of canonesses of a nunnery.Stift In. Theologische Realenzyklop√§die. Bd.32 Berlin, New York, 2001 S.160f. = Completion and publication = On account of the numerous areas of the monastic life to be regulated, the discussions were not simple and they lasted for a long time, before the participants could summarise their decisions in thirty six canons and submit them to Louis for confirmation. These canons were published and made binding for the empire in a capitulary of 23 August 816. Various participants had already publicised partial results before this. The enforcement, or rather the monitoring of implementation was carried out over the following years by missi dominici and ecclesiastical representatives. The archbishops of the realm were especially involved.  Synods of 817‚Äì819  The synod of 817 built on the decisions of the previous year. On 10 July it adopted a capitulare monasticum (Monastic capitulary), containing the rulings of the previous year. From the end of 818 to the beginning of 819, a further synod was held in Aachen. It produced the Notitia de servitio monasteriorum, a list of reformed monasteries and the services they owed the crown. This brought the monastic reforms to an end. A Hoftag was held in parallel with this synod. Among other things, the relationship between the ruler and the church was clarified. Monasteries and bishoprics were granted voting rights, but the king held the customary rights and the right of investiture. He was allowed to continue to appoint the leaders of canonical orders. The power of ecclesiastical institutions in the Empire was thus further enshrined.Deutschland I. In Theologische Realenzyklop√§die. Vol. 8 Berlin, New York, 1993 p. 570 Overall, the rulings marked the end of the variety of earlier monastic lifestyles in favor of a uniform standard. Uniform structures marked a strengthening of the Imperial church. This was a factor in the maintenance of Imperial unity.

He is the senior research advisor in the Bank of England's research hub. He is most known for his research into the financial system, income inequalities and the oil supply. In his previous work at the IMF, he was responsible for developing the International Monetary Fund‚Äôs Global Integrated Monetary and Fiscal Model (a Dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model). The model is used for IMF policy and scenario analyses in multilateral and bilateral surveillance, for the World Economic Outlook, and for G20 work. It is also used by several central banks. As a researcher, one of Kumhof's most noticed publications is probably the IMF working paper The Chicago Plan Revisited, in which he and co-author Jaromir Benes use modern tools to analyse the Chicago plan, a collection of banking reforms suggested by University of Chicago economists in the wake of the Great Depression. It has been called IMF's epic plan to conjure away debt and dethrone bankers. Other noticeable publications are: the IMF working paper \\"Inequality, Leverage and Crises: The Case of Endogenous Default\\", in which the authors Kumhof et al. studies how crises can arise as a result of increasing income inequalities; And the IMF working paper \\"The Future of Oil: Geology versus Technology\\", in which the authors presents a new model for forecasting oil prices and oil output, based on both the geological and technological view, and it performs far better than existing empirical models, one of the more important conclusions is that they predict a near doubling of oil prices in the next decade.

Opel also adds the marketing term \\"Whisper Diesel\\" in some markets, claiming relatively low levels of noise, vibration, and harshness. Production commenced in late 2013 at Szentgotth√°rd, Hungary. The MDE is Opel's first all-aluminum diesel engine and offers a power density of per liter in its most powerful version. Maximum power and torque have been increased versus the previous-generation 1.7-liter engine, while fuel consumption has been reduced by up to 10 percent compared with a 2.0-liter CDTI engine of similar power output. This new 1.6 CDTI engine will replace the current 1.7-liter and lower-powered 2.0-liter diesel engines in a wide range of Opel models, with more- and less-powerful versions to come. The most powerful version of this engine, delivering at 3,500‚Äì4,000 rpm and at 2,000 rpm, was first introduced in the 2013 Opel Zafira Tourer, and later in the 2014 Opel Astra J and restyled 2014 Opel Meriva B. In 2014, versions were released with power outputs of . The engine's displacement is and it has a bore/stroke ratio of , attaining cylinder pressures of and a compression ratio of 16.0:1. It uses an aluminum engine block, die-cast aluminum bedplate, and an aluminum cylinder head. A chain driven dual overhead camshaft, employing weight-saving hollow sections and lobes, operates four valves per cylinder with low-friction, hydraulic roller finger followers. The pistons are made from aluminum for reduced reciprocating mass, feature a concave, shallow-bowl profile to facilitate efficient combustion, and are cooled by under-skirt oil spraying. The crankshaft employs four counterweights to minimize mass, and both it and the con-rods are made of forged steel. The engine features multiple improvements to reduce NVH, such as a cam cover made of GRP and fully decoupled from the engine to reduce noise and vibration, while also saving weight compared to aluminum; a composite intake manifold encapsulated in acoustic padding as well as an external plastic shield that both significantly reduce noise emissions; a mechanical crankshaft isolator which reduces radiated noise and torsional vibrations in the accessory drive system; and scissor gears for the timing drive system, incorporating tooth profiles ground with a Low Noise Shifting (LNS) process for optimal noise reduction. More than 150 patented diesel control functions are deployed by the engine's ECU, which was developed in-house by General Motors and jointly engineered in Italy (by GM Powertrain Torino), Germany, and the United States, and will be used in all future GM four-cylinder diesel engines. Low fuel consumption and Euro 6-standard emissions (effective from September 2015) are also made possible by the use of Opel‚Äôs ‚ÄúBlueInjection‚Äù selective catalytic reduction (SCR) system, which injects AdBlue, a urea-and-water solution, into the exhaust stream. The solution decomposes into ammonia, which is then stored on a catalyst substrate. When nitrogen oxide () from the exhaust gases enters the catalyst, it is then selectively reduced to nitrogen and water. From 2013, this engine replaced the 1.7 L CDTI as well as lower-powered variants of the 2.0 L CDTI Ecotec engines in Opel cars, and also superseded the 1.3 L CDTI engines in the Corsa, Meriva and Astra.

He became the superintendent of the Dahlonega Mint in 1853 and remained in the position until 1860. Biography=Career= In 1857, the Dahlonega Mint caught fire and Julius headed back to New York where he was from. The Dahlonega Mint was shut down for the remainder of the year and San Francisco Mint was charged to take on the remaining commission of Dahlonega, as they were the only Mint presently ahead of schedule at the time. The San Francisco Mint managed to finish the commission in time and loaded all the gold onto the S.S. Central America, nicknamed the Ship of Gold. The S.S. Central America was to head for New York. While at San Francisco, Julius' private Iron Box of Gold was accidentally opened and restruck. There were approximately 20 coins in the box, including one Specimen Strike he personally hand struck at Dahlonega. Once it was realized that the coins belonged to Julius Patton, they were identified and collected and returned to his Iron Box where it was then relocked. The S.S. Central America was said to be carrying over 4 tons of American Gold Coins and Bars. It fell upon a hurricane early in its voyage and was torn apart by winds exceeding 105 mph. The ship went down on 9/11/1857 but was declared lost on 9/12/1857. Legacy In the late 1980s, when Treasure Hunter Tommy Thompson claimed to have found the ship, he is said to have hid the iron box of Julius during the first salvage. Returning to the shipwreck 19 years later and claiming it is partially linked to his ultimate downfall and capture. Between October of 2016 and October of 2017 a representative of Tommy Thompson privately sold the coins in Elite Private Auctions around the world; including the legendary hand struck coin. A Canadian entrepreneur luckily secured three of the coins, including the hand struck coin by happenstance. As of February 2018, the entrepreneur claims his son has sold the coins for what he originally purchased them for in order to buy into a friend's nightclub. He claims the coins are no longer in Vancouver but somewhere down in Texas.

Xian ling () is the notion of a numinous, sacred (ling) presence of a god or gods in the Chinese traditional religion. The term can be variously translated as \\"divine efficacy\\", \\"divine virtue\\", or also \\"efficacious response\\"; these terms describe the manifestation and activity of the power of a god (, \\"divine energy\\" or \\"divine effervescence\\", see qi). Within the context of traditional cosmology, the interaction of these energies constitutes the universe (the All-God, Tian), and their proper cultivation (bao ying) upholds the human world order. Reciprocity to divine response: rite and virtuous deed The relationship between men and gods is one of reciprocal exchange of energy and the cultivation of godly energy. Through rituals of worship and proper conduct, people acquire and maintain a sense of stable world order, peace, and balance (bao ying). Violating the rule of reciprocity may undermine the balance and invite chaos. The attitudes of the people towards their deities is one of awe and apprehension. Through devotional practices, a person strives to secure balance and protect himself and the world in which he is located from the power of unfavorable forces. In this sense, the traditional Chinese view of human life is not fatalistic, but is one in which one is the master of his own life through his relationship with the divine energies. Within temples it is common to see banners bearing the phrase: \\"If the heart is sincere, god will reveal his power\\" (). This implies the belief that gods respond to the entreaties of the believer if his or her religious fervor is sincere (). If a person sincerely believes in the gods' powers and accumulates the energy of piety, the gods are confident in his faith and reveal their efficacious powers. At the same time, for faith to strengthen in the devotee's heart, the deity must prove his or her efficacy. Worship consists of the display of reverence or respect (j√¨ngsh√©n ) for the gods, honoring them through the fulfillment of vows (). In most of the cases, vow-fulfillment is expressed in material form, for example jingxiang offering rituals. Many people repay vows to the gods by contributing incense, oil, candles, and money. Religious devotion may also be expressed in the form of performance troupes () involving stilt walkers, lion dancers, musicians, martial arts masters, yangge dancers, and story-tellers. Some gods are considered carnivorous, for example river deities (h√©sh√©n ), or the Longwang ; offerings to these require an animal sacrifice (shƒìngs√¨ ), while other deities, for example Zhenwu, do not ask for animal sacrifice. A deity may also require, in exchange for his or her help through divine effervescence, that people act morally and perform good works, virtuous deeds (sh√†nsh√¨ ), and practice self-cultivation (xi≈´x√≠ng ). To this end, some forms of local religion develop prescriptions for believers, such as detailed lists of meritorious and sinful deeds in the form of \\"books of virtue\\" (). This usually refers to religious booklets distributed for free.) and \\"ledgers of merit\\" (). This refers to a kind of log which one uses to record good and bad deeds he or she has done every day. This is arbitrary for some Quanzhen Daoist priests). Involvement in the affairs of communal or intra-village temples are perceived by believers as ways of accumulating merit (g≈çngd√© ). \\"Doing good deeds to accumulate virtue\\" () is a common formula for religious practice. Virtue is believed to accumulate in one's heart, which is seen as the energetic center of the human body (z√†i j≈´n xƒ´n zu√≤ f√∫ ti√°n ). Temples and holy locations: shrines of divine effervescence The term xian ling may be interpreted as the god revealing his divine presence in a particular area and temple, through events perceived as extraordinary, miraculous, and filling the place of their ling qi. Divine power usually manifests in public; once the event is witnessed and acknowledged, reports about it spread quickly and the cult of the deity establishes itself and grows in popularity, and temples are built. Scholar Zavidovskaya studied the ways the incentive of temple restoration since the 1980s in northern China was triggered by numerous instances of gods becoming \\"active\\" and \\"returning\\", and claiming back their temples and places in society. She cites a Chenghuang Temple in Yulin, Shaanxi Province that, during the Cultural Revolution, was turned into a granary; in the 1980s the temple was restored to its original function because the seeds kept in the temple always rotted. This event was recognized as a sign from the god Chenghuang to empty his residence of grain and let him back in. The (), divine energy, is believed to accumulate in certain places, such as temples, making them holy. Temples with a long history are considered holier than newly built ones, which still need to be filled by divine energy. Zavidovskaya also cited an example of the cult of the god Zhenwu in Congluoyu Town (, Lin County, L√ºliang), Shanxi Province. The temples were in ruins and the cult was inactive until the mid-1990s, when a man with terminal cancer prayed (b√†i ) to Zhenwu. The man began to recover, and after a year he was completely healed. To thank the god, he organized an opera performance in his honor. A temporary altar with a statue of Zhenwu and a stage for performances were set up in an open space at the foot of a mountain. While the opera was being performed, large, white snakes appeared; they were unafraid of people and did not attack them, seemingly watching the opera. The snakes were considered by locals as incarnations of Zhenwu, who came to watch the opera held in his honor. Kinds of efficacy The most common display of divine power is the cure of diseases after a follower asks for aid. Another manifestation is the fulfillment of a request by children. The deity may also manifest through media, entering the body of a shaman-medium and speaking through his or her lips. There have been cases of people curing illnesses \\"on behalf of a god\\" (t√¨ sh√©n zh√¨ b√¨ng ). Gods may also speak to people when they are asleep ( ).

A group of NGO's (non-government organizations) and UNICEF worked informally to continuously develop CRIN until 1995. After the Geneva years, in 1995, CRIN was formally established. In the following years (1996-1997) the first big steps were taken as an organization. Newsletters were published, a website was made, CRIN published the directory of Child Rights Organizations. The Child Rights International Network now includes over 1200 organizations and is a viable information resource for the public. It has more than 2,000 members in 130 countries, mainly in Africa. Its founders have included the European Union, Save the Children Sweden and the Sigrid Rausing Trust. Child Rights International Network is currently partnered with many different NOGs around the world. For example, CRIN is a member of Consortium for Street Children. Other partners like, the Swedish government, the Tides Foundation, the Oak Foundation, and many more NGOs help fund CRIN. The CRIN has a yearly budget around 200 000 euros. Since CRIN is based out of Europe they operate in four main languages: English, Arabic, French, and Spanish. Mission The network believes that everyone needs works together to advocate for child rights. Hopefully with enough child rights activists globally, one day all child rights will be enforced = The network currently has five core goals = #rights not charity #we are stronger when we work together #information is power and it should be free and accessible #societies, organizations, and institutions should be open, transparent and accountable #we believe in promoting children's rights, not ourselves. = Goals for the future = * Try to incorporate professionals to help the organization grow, by expanding the knowledge of the community and members in hopes others will be able to further our intentions. They hope that will create change in the system. * Keep track of violations against child's rights around the world * Introducing discussions about the CRINs policies * Use legal advocacy and campaigns to confront violations towards child's rights These are just a few of the goals that the CRIN has in their sights in hopes to create opportunities for change.  Member Organizations = Consortium for Street Children = The main focus of this organization is to get children who live on the streets voices heard. They follow four core values; ‚ÄúChallenging‚Äù, ‚ÄúProgressive‚Äù, ‚ÄúCollaborative‚Äù, and ‚ÄúAccountable‚Äù. April 12 is International day for Street Children. = Save the Children = Focused around getting children better opportunities in the subjects of: Education, Economic, and Health Care opportunities. As well as Helping out in natural disasters. = Child Workers in Asia = Non-Governmental Organization - started off just five organizations, grew to 50 different organizations in 14 countries. These organizations were focused on stopping child labor.  Forms of advocacy  In order to create change in public systems and institutions they need to be advocated for. Advocacy is the mission of the Children's rights international Network and how they get their message of children's rights across the globe. Advocacy means they see the basic forms of advocacy helpful, but not the most effective when implemented alone. * Writing letters * Protesting * Report writings * Digital advocacy They do not feel these are enough to make the impact they desire and need. They want to encourage people to take the next step. They believe the strongest form of advocacy would be taking the legal route. This means that you are able to represent a person that is not able to on there behalf in the legal system. Examples: * Legal advocacy * Strategic litigation * Legal representation * Quasi-legal representation Laws When human rights laws are enforced strictly they help people to claim their eligibility for freedom. Laws concerning children are taken into account and have to be legalized in child's rights laws under CRIN. Research is conducted by the CRIN to solidify child's rights laws. Anyone is able to replicate this research because the CRIN provides guidelines on how their research is conducted. The legal report has general common laws for areas like violence towards children. The CRIN's goal is to create a better understanding and enforcement of child rights by using legal advocacy. CRIN advises people to take all legal complaints concerning child rights to local or international legal personal. = Childs Rights reforms the CRIN follows up on = Inhuman Sentencing of Children  This reform is to stop children from being prosecuted wrongly. The CRIN does intense legal research on the states that have yet to remove these horrific sentences. In 40 states the Justice system exposes the children to Flogging, Amputation, and even Caning. These forms of punishment is referred to as Corporal Punishment . The Death Penalty on children is continued to be used today in 14 different countries. They can undergo Shootings, Hangings, Stoning, and the most popular/well-known one of all Lethal Injection. The research being conducted and the tabs being kept on the countries are all efforts in ending these cruel punishments. Key component ‚Äònaming and shaming‚Äô campaign.  Children‚Äôs Rights Case Database  This database holds all the information for the CRIN to scan through and help get promote awareness of any case that has to do with the convention on the rights of a child.  More states criminalizing more children  This area of child's rights is kept a close eye on because states have not been advancing in the category of juvenile justice. This is a major problem; it goes against the rights of all children. States are not evolving they are actually demoting. The CRIN wants to help advocate for the children and help get the criminal age of responsibly lowered. To do this they gathered very upsetting information and they will continue. This will raise awareness of the issue. Good example of the CRIN advocating for the children.  Areas of concerns = Child Sex Trafficking = This is a major concern for the CRN, Organizations like this are what help bring awareness of these issues society tries to ignore. This makes sure this children have a voice. This is a major concern for the CRN, Organizations like this are what help bring awareness of these issues society tries to ignore. This makes sure the children are represented for. Sex trafficking can cause lasting effects mentally on a child not just physical. Studies show that 70-85% of the time the victims know who is assaulting them. There is a common misconception that these two are the same thing. There is a difference between Child Sex Trafficking and Sale of a Child. Child Sex Trafficking can be conducted with out any money at all. Nobody can even be involved its more of the physical aspect of transporting the child.

It is based on the banner of the arms of the former Bedfordshire County Council, which was granted the arms in 1951 by the College of Arms. This design was adopted as the flag of the historic county in September 2014, with the support of the High Sheriff of the county. When flying, the top corner, nearest the flagpole, should be gold. __TOC__ History left Bedfordshire County Council had its coat of arms created in 1951 as part of the Festival of Britain celebrations. The coat of arms became the symbol of the county being placed on many public buildings and signs. The council used the banner of arms as a flag until it was abolished in 2009. In 2014, the Friends of Bedfordshire Society began a successful campaign to have a slightly modified version of the former council's banner of arms registered with the Flag Institute as the flag of the county. The minor modification was to transpose the blue and white wavy lines on the left side of the banner, preventing blue from touching red and white from touching yellow on the adopted flag, in line with the heraldic rule of tincture. The adopted design also has a lighter shade of blue than the banner of arms, to better contrast the parts of the design. The campaign to see the flag registered was supported by the High Sheriff of the county. Design The design of the flag is a composite of several symbols significant to the county. In heraldic terms the design is Quarterly Or and Gules a Fess wavy barry way of four Argent and Azure surmounted by a Pale Sable charged with three Escallops of the third. The yellow and red quadrants (Quarterly Or and Gules) are taken from the arms of the Beauchamp family, powerful in the county after the Norman conquest of England and constructors of Bedford Castle. The blue and white wavy lines (a Fess wavy barry way of four Argent and Azure) are symbolic of the Great Ouse, which flows through the county, including the county town of Bedford.

The USS Washington sank the Japanese battleship Kirishima, using primarily 16-inch gunfire, and simultaneously engaged the Japanese cruiser Atago, using 5-inch gunfire. The Atego was damaged and returned to Japan for repairs. In the months before the battle, Hooper had uncovered and corrected small systematic errors in the fire control of the 16-inch guns and, as a result, very accurate naval gunfire led to the rapid sinking of the Kirishima. Hooper was awarded the Bronze Star for the Guadalcanal Battle, was promoted and made gunnery officer on the USS Washington ‚Äì the most junior U.S. officer to hold that position in World War II. In 1944, Hooper served as gunnery officer on the .

Five years later the complete treasure was sold to the English collector Richard Payne Knight, who bequeathed it to the British Museum in 1824. Provenance of the Find For many years the hoard was assumed to have been discovered in Caubiac. However, in 1988 scholars challenged the original provenance of the find. According to handwritten records kept at the Academy of Toulouse, the treasure was actually found at the nearby village of Thil. The error appears to have originated from the fact that the owner of the field where the treasure was found lived in Caubiac, while the field itself was located in the town of Thil, on the site of an ancient castle named Mouillat. Description The entire hoard is made of silver. It includes a saucer and three dishes, some of which are decorated with Bacchic scenes, a large plate inscribed with the name 'Benignus', an ornamented cup and a (now badly damaged) fluted bowl with a central medallion of Venus with Cupid and Priapus, which was used for washing hands. The whole set dates from between the late 2nd century and the early 3rd century and probably served to celebrate the cult of Bacchus. At the base of one of the dishes is inscribed the name 'Benignus Victori Victoris', who was almost certainly the original owner of the treasure. At the foot of the fluted bowl is engraved the name 'Eugrafi' which may refer to a Greek craftsman called Eugraphios, who made the set.

Olympius orchestrated the fall and execution of the capable general Stilicho, who had effectively been ruling the Western Roman Empire as regent of Honorius for over twelve years. Germanic tribes invaded Italy in 405. Honorius and the court took refuge in Ravenna, now the capital of the Western Roman Empire. Stilicho defeated the invaders in the mountains of F√¶sul√¶ (Fiesole) near modern-day Florence. The Vandals, Alani, and Suevi poured over the Rhine into the interior of Gaul, followed by Franks, Burgundians, and Alemanni, who settled permanently on the left bank of the Rhine. Stilicho entered into negotiations with Alaric, holding out promises of Eastern Illyria to secure his aid. Thereupon the Roman general Constantine, who had crossed over from Britain, appeared in Gaul, and proclaimed himself Emperor. The negotiations with Alaric failed and Alaric demanded an indemnity of 4000 pounds in gold; Stilicho, who had twice saved Italy from barbarian incursion, was suspected by the court of entertaining treasonable plans. The weak-willed Honorius listened to the insinuations of the chancellor Olympius and proceeded to have Stilicho and his family put to immediate execution.Hoeber, Karl. \\"Flavius Honorius.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 7. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 19 Jan. 2014 After Stilicho's execution, Olympius prompted Honorius to take a more hostile stance toward the Goths, mostly notably Alaric I, who had previously been cooperating with the Romans. Olympius, through Honorius, orchestrated the massacre of tens of thousands of wives and children of Goths serving in the Roman military. Subsequently, around 30,000 Gothic soldiers defected to Alaric and took part in the first sack of Rome in 800 years, a key event in the fall of the Western Roman Empire. When Constantius, who had been a friend and supporter of Stilicho, became magister militum in 410/11, he had Olympius clubbed to death.Peter Heather, The Fall of the Roman Empire: A New History of Rome and the Barbarians, (Oxford University Press, 2006), p. 237.

Toponymy  The names \\"Hackett Lake\\" and \\"Hackett (township)\\" evoke the memory of Michael Felix Hackett (1851-1926), secretary and \\"registrar\\" in the firm Edmund James Flynn, Prime Minister Quebec in 1896 and 1897. After his studies at the McGill University, Hackett is admitted to the Bar of Quebec in 1874. Thereafter, it will be mayor of Stanstead Plain from 1890 to 1904, Conservative MP for the Legislative Assembly from 1892 to 1900, then a judge of the Superior Court of the District of Bedford from 1915. The toponym \\"Lake Hackett\\" was officially registered on December 5, 1968, at the Bank of place names in Commission de toponymie du Qu√©bec (Geographical Names Board of Qu√©bec).  Geography  Lake Hackett (Mekinac) has a length of 4.8 km in the north-south axis (and a maximum width of 1.7 km), including the long strait in the southern part, resulting into the \\"Lac du Canard\\" (Duck Lake) which as a large area consisting of marshes. The headwaters of the subwatershed is Calau lake (1 km long) which flows to the north-east into the Su√®ve lake (710 m long). The discharge of the later flows over 1.25 km to the northeast and empties into \\"Lac du Canard\\". A strait of 2.8 km at northeast (which forms the lake logic) connects the Hackett Lake to Garneau Lake (2.6 km long, shaped like a \\"U\\"). South of the later, the Heloise lake (1.8 km long) connects the Garneau Lake with a short Strait. The Heloise lake straddles the township Hackett and Marmier. Dam of type \\"concrete-gravity\\" that was built on the rock by Hydro- Qu√©bec in 1995 at the mouth of Lake Hackett, creates the great reservoir \\"Hackett\\" an area of 438.8 ha with a holding capacity 19,305,000 m¬≥. With a length of 20 m., the dam has a height of 5.5 m and a height of 4.4 m holding. Coordinates of the dam: latitude: 47¬∞ 05'; longitude: - 72¬∞ 27' Located in the Zec Tawachiche, its mouth flows into the \\"Ruisseau des √Æles\\" (Stream of Islands), which course on 3.25 km north-west and flows into the Rivi√®re aux eaux mortes (M√©kinac). The latter flows into the Rivi√®re du Milieu (M√©kinac) which goes south to empty into the northern part of M√©kinac Lake. Starting at Hervey-Jonction, visitors can travel 30 km to reach the southern part of Lake Hackett. A visitor has just to take the Tawachiche road leading to Zec Tawachiche (in north-east), through the Audy sector; then take the Tawachiche East road, passing near the Lake Terrien (M√©kinac).Geographical researches conducted in January 2014 by historian Ga√©tan Veillette (Saint-Hubert, QC), using Google Map.

McDougall & Secord  In the 1970s McDougall joined the family business where his father was President. McDougall & Secord specializes in real estate, development, and investment. McDougall was still working for the family business in 2003. McDougall is the titular head of McDougall and Secord. Irene McDougall operates McDougall & Secord. Fifteen family members are shareholders.  Dalcor Innoventures Ltd.  He established his own consulting company Dalcor Innoventures Ltd. in 1975http://www.manta.com/ic/mtq6lfq/ca/dalcor-innoventures-ltd which specialized in large projects ($100 million) in Alberta and around the world undertaking \\"research, proposals, regulatory approvals, public and stakeholder relations, management,and construction\\" in \\"offshore oil, transportation, ports, pipelines, synthetic materials, and coal.\\"  Poole Chair for Engineers at the University of Alberta While continuing to manage Dalcor, McDougall was Poole Chair from 1991 to 1997.  Alberta Research Council  In 1997 McDougall became president and CEO of the Alberta Research Council (ARC) and remained there for 12 years. ARC was first established in 1921 as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Alberta Science and Research Authority (ASRA). By 2005, ARC with an $80 million in 2003, focused on developing and commercializing technology including \\"tire recycling, chemical technologies, fuel-cell technology, aviation safety standards, heavy oil extraction technology, pest management, pulp and paper manufacturing, nutraceutical and pharmaceutical chemistry.\\" In 2003 the ARC McDougall argued that by 2013 parts of the technology to make clean energy would be available. He believed there would be technological changes in place for the whole system by 2023-2028. By 2003 ARC had initiated \\"integrated resource management\\" to take into account \\"the interaction between the different uses of air, water and land resources.\\" In 2005 McDougall was also \\"McDougall is chairman of CFER Technologies, a director of PFB Corporation, a member of the management board of the Alberta Science and Research Authority, director of the Canadian Academy of Engineers, director of St. John Ambulance, past-president of the Canadian Council of Engineers and past-president of the Edmonton Chamber of Commerce.\\" ARC was one of the developers of a technology that \\"transforms manure into green electricity, heat, organic fertilizers, and reusable water, while reducing greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental impacts.\\" ARC \\"validated a new steam assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) process and undertook collaborative research and technology improvements in Canada's wood products industry.  I-CAN  McDougall founded Innoventures Canada, a not-for-profit organization incorporated in 2006 that focuses on commercializing research. and served as its President and CEO before his appointment to the NRC. In his role as President of Innoventures, McDougall used a market-based competitive business model and focused on results-orientated research that reduced business risk.  Pine beetle research  ARC is a member of I-CAN, a not-for-profit organization incorporated in 2006that focuses on commercializing research. In his role as President of Innoventures, McDougall used a market-based competitive business model and focused on results-orientated research that reduced business risk. Major projects included a project on utilization of pine beetle damaged wood. I-CAN and the Alberta Research Council (ARC) are part of a $28-million research project with the Government of Alberta contributing $11 million and the Alberta Newsprint Company contributing $17 million, initiated in 2008 that transforms beetle-killed wood into newsprint. = Carbon Algae Recycling System (CARS) = In 2008 researchers from five I-CAN organizations were developing a Carbon Algae Recycling System (CARS) to \\"feed waste heat and flue gas containing CO2 from industrial exhaust stacks to micro-algae growing in artificial ponds.\\"  NRC  From 2002 to 2006 McDougall was on NRC-Industrial Research Assistance Program (NRC-IRAP) Advisory Board. = Change in research direction = In 2011, NRC President John R. McDougall, began to oversee a change in research focus away from basic research and towards industrial-relevant research. This included the development of several \\"flagship programs\\", shifting research budget out of existing research and into a few focused programs. One flagship program, \\"Algal Carbon Conversion\\", is related to prior interests of Mr. McDougall, as he previously headed Innoventures, a company involved in lobbying for the development of an algae system to recycle carbon emissions. The Algal Carbon Conversion Pilot Project, with plans for a $19 million facility to be constructed in Alberta, is a partnership between the NRC and industry partners, Canadian Natural Resources Limited (Canadian Natural) and Pond Biofuels. The NRC was not involved in this area of research prior to the arrival of Mr. McDougall. In a press conference held in Ottawa, 7 May 2013, with Gary Goodyear, Minister of State (Science and Technology) and Deputy Leader of the Government at the Senate, Claude Carignan, John R. McDougall announced the transition of the NRC to an industry-driven, program-based research and technology organization. = Tim Hortons Gift Card Controversy = A minor controversy early in John R. McDougall's presidency attracted media attention. In June 2012, 65 NRC employees who had just been laid off received $3 gift cards to be spent at the Tim Hortons chain of coffee shops. The cards were accompanied by a letter from Mr. McDougall reading in part: \\"Thank you for the contribution you have made in helping NRC successfully work through our massive transformation. To celebrate our success in gaining government support, here is a token of appreciation: have a coffee and a doughnut on me.\\" Although the gift cards and letters were sent to all NRC employees, some of those who had just been laid off reacted negatively. One employee described the gift card as \\"a kick in the teeth\\". 47 of the employees who were laid off worked at the NRC's Winnipeg location, many of them scientists carrying out research in magnetic resonance imaging.https://www.winnipegfreepress.com/local/nrc-staff-enraged-by-gift- cards-161407515.html = Cyberintrusion = Following the announcement on July 29, 2014, that the NRC had been the victim of a major cyberintrusion,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/chinese-cyberattack-hits- canada-s-national-research-council-1.2721241 the NRC embarked on an overhaul of its IT infrastructure with an original estimated cost of $32.5 million.https://ottawacitizen.com/news/politics/cyber-attack-at-nrc-kept- secret-from-other-departments The actual cost turned out to be much higher, on the order of hundreds of millions of dollars.https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/federal-documents- say-2014-china-hack-cost-hundreds-of-millions-of-dollars/article34485219 = John R. McDougall's Impact on Research = There was a steep drop in research publications and new patents from NRC during John R. McDougall's stint as President; scientific staff was cut significantly. An article published in April 2016 and based on information from the office of the Science Minister gave the following figures for the period 2011-2015: \\"In the five years from 2011 through 2015, the number of studies in academic journals were 1,889, 1,650, 1,204, 1,017 and 549, respectively. (Figures from 2010 and earlier are generally in the 1,200 to 1,300 range.) The number of patents over the period 2011 to 2014 (with no figure available for 2015) are: 205, 251, 128 and 112, respectively. The years before 2011 averaged 250 to 300 patents per year\\".https://ottawacitizen.com/news/local-news/science-minister-responds- after-nrc-shakeup-but-with-few-details Thus, the decline in the number of academic journal papers by NRC authors over the period 2011-2015 was 71%, and the decline in the number of new patents with NRC inventors over the period 2011-2014 was 45%. In September 2016, the office of the Science Minister released figures showing that from 2010 to 2015, the number of research officers at NRC fell by 26 percent, and the number of scientists and engineers of all kinds fell by 22 percent. \\"The job losses generally parallel the presidency of John McDougall\\".https://ottawacitizen.com/news/local-news/nrcs- five-year-brain-drain-dealt-a-serious-whack-to-research = Water Contamination = During John R. McDougall's stint as NRC President, there was a period during which NRC management was aware that NRC was contaminating the water table in a small Ontario community but did not inform that community's inhabitants. In January 2014, NRC employees at the fire-safety testing facility in Mississippi Mills were told to start drinking bottled water. 23 months later (December 2015), residents of Mississippi Mills with homes near the facility were warned by NRC that their well-water was contaminated with toxic chemicals called perfluorinated alkyl substances, often found in firefighting foam.http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/nrc-drinking-water- mississippi-mills-toxic-chemicals-1.3601591 = Departure from NRC and Aftermath = In March 2016, John McDougall sent a three-sentence email to NRC employees, announcing that he was going on personal leave.https://ottawacitizen.com/news/local-news/national-research-council- president-on-leave-no-reason-given Subsequently, NRC management announced that two major projects he had led would be abandoned: re-branding the NRC as \\"CNRCSolutions\\" ‚Äì though colourful \\"CNRCSolutions\\" T-shirts and \\"branding books\\" had already been distributed https://ottawacitizen.com/news/local- news/nrc-not-quite-rebranded ‚Äì and re-organizing its three research divisions into five research divisions.https://ottawacitizen.com/news/local-news/nrc- president-mcdougall-officially-departs-but-reasons-are-still-secret In July 2016, Acting President Maria Aubrey formally acknowledged that the NRC's National Fire Laboratory was the source of the groundwater contamination in Mississippi Mills.https://ottawacitizen.com/news/local-news/mayor-says-nrc- admits-its-the-source-of-mississippi-mills-water-contamination Effective August 24, 2016, Iain Stewart became the new President of the NRC.https://www.nrc- cnrc.gc.ca/eng/about/corporate_overview/biographies/iain_stewart.html The reasons for John R.

She was among the first women to obtain a doctorate in Germany. Her doctoral work was on the topology of algebraic curves.  Life and work  Margarete Kahn was the daughter of Eschwege merchant and flannel factory owner Albert Kahn (1853‚Äì1905) and his wife Johanne (n√©e Plaut, 1857‚Äì1882). She had an older brother Otto (born 1879). Five years after the untimely death of his wife Johanne, their father married her younger sister Julie (1860‚Äì1934), with whom he had a daughter, Margaret's half-sister Martha (born 1888). After attending elementary school from 1887, and the Higher School for Girls from 1889 to 1896, Kahn until 1904 took private lessons to prepare for her Abitur, because few high schools for girls existed at that time in Hesse, Germany. In 1904 she was given permission to take her Abitur at the Royal Gymnasium in Bad Hersfeld. Thus she belonged to the small elite of young women in Germany at the beginning of the 20th century who were allowed to take the Abitur externally at boys' schools. Konrad Duden signed her Abitur certificate as school principal. Since Prussia began to allow women to formally attend university only from the winter semester of 1908‚Äì09, Kahn and her friend Klara L√∂benstein first attended the universities of Berlin and G√∂ttingen as guest students. In addition, Kahn attended lectures and tutorials in mathematics at the Technical University of Berlin. They studied mathematics, physics, and propaedeutics at Berlin and G√∂ttingen. At the University of G√∂ttingen she attended lectures given by, among others, David Hilbert, Felix Klein, Woldemar Voigt, and Georg Elias M√ºller; in Berlin she attended lectures by Hermann Amandus Schwarz and Paul Drude at the Royal Prussian Academy of Sciences. Her field of expertise was algebraic geometry. Together with L√∂benstein she made a contribution to Hilbert's sixteenth problem. Hilbert's sixteenth problem concerned the topology of algebraic curves in the complex projective plane; as a difficult special case in his formulation of the problem Hilbert proposed that there are no algebraic curves of degree 6 consisting of 11 separate ovals. Kahn and L√∂benstein developed methods to address this problem. Against opposition in particular from the Berlin faculty, but supported by the University of G√∂ttingen and Felix Klein, Kahn obtained a doctorate in 1909 under David Hilbert in G√∂ttingen, with a dissertation titled Eine allgemeine Methode zur Untersuchung der Gestalten algebraischer Kurven [A general method to investigate the shapes of algebraic curves] and was therefore one of the first German women to obtain a doctorate in mathematics (the mathematics division was part of the faculty of philosophy then). She took her oral examination ‚Äì again, along with L√∂benstein ‚Äì on 30 June 1909. Kahn could not pursue a scientific career because women in Germany were not admitted to habilitation before 1920. She therefore sought a career as a schoolteacher, and in October 1912 she obtained a job in the Prussian school system, where she worked as a teacher for secondary schools in Katowice, Dortmund, and from 1929, in Berlin-Tegel. As a Jew, she was forced to go on leave by the Nazis in 1933, and was dismissed from the school in 1936. She was forced to work as a factory worker at the Nordland Schneeketten (Nordland snow chains) factory. On 28 March 1942, Kahn was deported to Piaski and is considered missing since then. On 13 September 2008, a Stolperstein was laid at 127 Rudolst√§dter Stra√üe in Wilmersdorf in memory of Margaret Kahn. In 2013, a street in Leverkusen was named after her.

It operated from 1936 to 1980, eventually becoming one of the busiest general aviation airfields in the United States. History The first airfield was created at the site north of Amityville by farmer Joseph Zahn, who cut a dirt strip from his apple orchard. He returned the land to agriculture during World War II, but reopened the airfield after the war. One of the largest post-war tenants was the Amityville Flying School (AFS), which was created to train pilots on the G.I. Bill. AFS was founded by aircraft mechanic Jack Looney, operations manager Walter Hoffman, and pilot Ed Lyons. Lyons (a New Yorker born Edwin Leibowitz) had flown for the Republicans during the Spanish Civil War and in 1939 had helped to establish the Palestine Flying Service in Mandatory Palestine; the PFS became a precursor of the Israeli Air Force. In 1950 Joe Zahn sold the airfield to AFS, which continued to improve it through that decade. When Roosevelt Field closed in 1951, Zahn's became the busiest general aviation airfield in the State of New York. For a time it was the largest privately owned airport in the United States. During the 1950s it was the home of the New York Yankees' private Douglas DC-3, a Grumman G-73 Mallard owned by the New York Daily News, and dozens of privately owned light aircraft. It featured two paved runways, with the longer one (in a north‚Äìsouth orientation) being long. The aviation section of the 42nd Infantry Division (part of the New York Army National Guard) was based at Zahn's Airfield from 1951 (moving from Roosevelt Field) until 1963. It also hosted a detachment of the Civil Air Patrol; from 1961 to 1970 Ed Lyons was Colonel commanding the CAP's Northeast Region. As its popularity increased through the 1960s, the condition of the airfield deteriorated. When Republic Aviation allowed other aircraft to use their factory airfield (Republic Airport, half a mile north of Zahn's) in the late 1960s, much of Zahn's traffic moved there. Scenes for the 1957 James Stewart movie The Spirit of St. Louis were filmed at Zahn's, taking the place of Roosevelt Field.

Foundation  Variation of Rabia sign showing solidarity of Egyptian Christians with the numerous victims of pro-Morsi sit-ins dispersal, and hence showing their opposition to the recent coup d'√©tat in Egypt. The Egyptian Christian journalist and activist Ramy Jan founded Christians Against the Coup movement after then-General El-Sisi (Field Marshal since January 2014) declared ouster of President Morsi on July 3, 2013, claiming that he had taken this critical decision in response to large anti-Morsi protests which were held in many parts of Egypt, June 30, which demanded early presidential elections. Pro-Morsi protests, however, were held as well few days before then. The movement states that its members, who are solely Christians, still support Morsi, and that there had been no sectarian violence against the Christian minority in Egypt in the one-year reign of the Muslim Brotherhood. The movement adopts the belief that violence against Christians was either individually-based, or rather fabricated. On the other hand, 'June-30' protesters, as being called in the local media, expressed that Morsi encouraged violence against non-Muslims; hence the motto of the CAC, ‚Ä≤The matter is not about the Brotherhood; it is rather about the dishonoured people.‚Ä≤ Accusations were made against the movement, the most common of which is the belonging to the Muslim Brotherhood. The CAC assures that its members do not belong to any political stream. Like many other anti-coup movements, the CAC works alongside the Anti-Coup Alliance, where the latter represents the broadest anti-coup assembly.  Goal  The movement declared the aim of re-establishing the legitimacy awarded to President Morsi through the elections/referendums held in the past two years. The movement also aims to rewind the coup, cancel all its traces, and put Field Marshal El-Sisi, military officers of the SCAF, senior police officers and others to trial. Jan, the founder, describes the idea of the movement by comparing it to the role the Coptic leader Makram Ebeid (1879‚Äì1961) played at the time of Hassan al-Banna (1906‚Äì1949), the founder of the Muslim Brotherhood. Ebeid denied accusations of terrorism that were made against al-Banna. He also took part in al-Banna's burial, defying strict measures imposed on taking part in it. Today, the movement plays the same role Ebeid played: defending the Brotherhood against accusations of terrorism, and standing in support of Mohamed Morsi, who is accused of treason. Controversy In late 2013, a minor controversy occurred when it was revealed that founder Ramy Jan was also a member of the Egyptian Nazi Party.

The economy of this sector is based on the forestry and railways activities, as well as tourist activities, including hunting, fishing, ATVs and snowmobiles. Since the early 20th century, this area is served by the Canadian National Railway between Hervey-Jonction and La Tuque. A very long railway bridge spans the ‚ÄúRivi√®re du Milieu‚Äù. In the past, a small hamlet existed around the station at Rivi√®re-du-Milieu.  Geography  The ‚ÄúRivi√®re du Milieu‚Äù flows entirely in forest land. The route starts near the river (southeast) of Lake Wayagamac. Much of its course is located in the Zec de la Bessonne, but the last kilometers through the Zec Tawachiche. From the railway of Canadian National, the very serpentine river crosses several wetland areas, a distance of about 5.8 km (direct line) to fund a flared valley to its mouth. Aerial maps do seem dozens of small lakes on either side of the river. A small delta appears at the mouth of the ‚ÄúRivi√®re du Milieu\\" which empties into the north-east of M√©kinac Lake. The ¬´Rivi√®re √† l‚Äôeau morte‚Äù (River in the dead water) which is the main tributary (East Bank) of ‚ÄúRivi√®re du milieu‚Äù, flows first to the southwest, turns north, past the hamlet ¬´Doheney¬ª and then redirects westward. The mouth of the ¬´Ri√®re √† l‚Äôeau morte¬ª is located 4 km (measured in a straight line) upstream of the mouth of the ¬´Rivi√®re du Milieu\\" or 2.1 km downstream of the railway bridge crossing the ‚ÄúRivi√®re du milieu‚Äù. With their boat, boaters can navigate in part in the meander path of the Middle River. The Government of Qu√©bec recognized one of the few sanctuaries for reproduction of aquatic fauna, covering a segment of the river, the fishing activities are therefore prohibited throughout year.  Toponymy  The name \\"Rivi√®re du Milieu‚Äù (Mekinac) means that this river is midway on the rail route between Hervey- Jonction and La Tuque. This name was officially registered on December 5, 1968 in the register of place names of the Commission de toponymie du Qu√©bec (Geographical Names Board of Qu√©bec).

A. J. Waddington was a police officer and later an academic at the University of Wolverhampton Professor Peter Waddington obituary , in the United Kingdom. He is known for his research and works on policing and social policy; in particular he is credited for inventing the controversial police tactic of kettling. Academic career Waddington began his career in 1963, as a Police Cadet and later Police Constable, in Birmingham City Police. He left in 1969, after gaining a BSc in Sociology from the University of London. He continued his studies in sociology at the University of Leeds in 1970, and after attaining his master's degree, became a Research Officer (1970‚Äì73) and later Research Fellow (1973‚Äì74) at Leeds. By 1974, he was lecturing at the university. He completed his PhD in The Occupational Socialization of Prison Governor Grades, at Leeds in 1977. In 1976, Waddington left for a new post at the University of Reading, where he lectured in sociology until 1992. He then became a reader, and by 1995, was a Professor in the Department of Sociology. He became the Professor of Political Sociology in 1999. In 2005, Waddington moved to the University of Wolverhampton, where he took up the post of Professor of Social Policy, as well as becoming Honorary Director of the Central Institute for the Study of Public Protection, and Director of the History and Governance Research Institute. Views on public order policing Speaking at the British Criminology Conference in 1989, Professor Waddington said that he was in favour of the use of CS spray and water cannon as a less violent alternative to the traditional police baton charge, which he saw as of doubtful legality and possibly dangerous. In a comment piece in The Independent in 1993 after the murder of Patrick Dunn, a police constable in London, Waddington spoke out against calls to arm the police, saying that \\"Genuine protection is not offered by weaponry, but by the conditions in which the police carry out their task.\\" In 2009, Waddington wrote about his view of the difference between the 1990 poll tax riots and the 1999 May Day protests. He noted that the use of kettling in 1999 resulted in an orderly dispersal with very few arrests and no injuries: compared to the poll tax riots, this was a good conclusion. In a piece in the Birmingham Post he wrote, \\"I remain firmly of the view that containment succeeds in restoring order by using boredom as its principle weapon, rather than fear as people flee from on- rushing police wielding batons.\\" Bibliography *Protest, Policing and the Law (1985) *Arming an Unarmed Police: Policy & Practice in the Metropolitan Police (1988) *The Strong Arm of the Law: Armed and Public Order Policing (1991) *Calling the Police: the Interpretation of, and Response to, Calls for Assistance from the Public (1993) *The Policing of Mass Demonstration in Contemporary Democracies (1997) *Policing Citizens: Authority and Rights (1999) *Liberty And Order: Public Order Policing In A Capital City (2002) *Policing Citizens: Police, Power and the State (2002) *What is Policing?

The death of her husband, Nako Spiru, in 1946, an alleged suicide, led to her dismissal from her role and she was sent from Tirana to Berat to teach. After Nako Spiru was rehabilitated, as a result of the Yugoslav-Albanian split, in 1948, Belishova was rehabilitated as well, and became a member of the Politburo of the Party of Labour of Albania from 1948-60.

In 1960, during the Soviet‚ÄìAlbanian split, Belishova was arrested on charges of being pro-Soviet and a friend of Nikita Khrushchev. She, her husband √áomo and old communist Ko√ßo Tashko had protested against Enver Hoxha's unilateral decision to take a pro-Chinese stance, warning about the consequences of a split with the Soviets. She was purged as a traitor and enemy of the Party and people. On 9 November 1960, her family was moved to a state-owned farm in Gjirokast√´r District, where she worked as a teacher and her husband as the farm director.

Concept  The market for 3D printers has grown tremendously over the past several years. According to Wohlers Report 2018, 3D printer Market reached 7.3 billions $ in 2017, with +21% growth over the previous year. The market is mostly B2B right now, because 3D printing is still a complex process. But even for SMB or freelance, they cannot develop all the knowledge around this technology, that's why 3D printing Marketplace have been developing for last years.  How 3D printing marketplaces work  3D printing marketplaces are a combination of file sharing websites, with or without a built in e-commerce capability. Designers upload suitable files for 3D printing whilst other users buy or freely download the uploaded files for printing. The marketplaces facilitate the account management, infrastructure, server resources and guarantees safe settlement of payments (e-commerce). Some of the marketplaces also offer additional services such as 3D printing on demand, location of commercial 3D print shops, associated software for model rendering and dynamic viewing of items using packages such as Sketchfab . The most widely used 3D printable file formats as of 2020 are STL, OBJ file, AMF, and 3MF.  Type of 3D printing marketplaces  There are different varieties of 3D printing marketplaces. Some of them like Thingiverse are dedicated to free sharing of 3D printable files. Others, like Shapeways offer a 3D printing service for objects which have been provided for sale by designers. MyMiniFactory offers a combination of these two: their main activity being the free sharing or 3D printable files, they also offer print-on-demand and design-on-demand services. Another category are websites exemplified by Threeding. These offer free and commercial exchange of digital 3D printable files for use on 3D printers but do not directly include 3D printing services themselves. These marketplaces do however, offer integration to databases of 3D printers provided by third parties. These three resources each contain geo-location services to several thousands of registered 3D printers. The two largest personal 3D printers manufacturers Makerbot (part of Stratasys) and Cubify (subsidiary of 3D Systems) offer their own file repositories for sharing, respectively Thingiverse and Cubify Store. For professional 3D printing needs there are platforms which offer a reverse-bid style auction interface, an integrated escrow payment system and many features specifically tailored for B2B transactions.  Copyright concerns  Current intellectual property (IP) legislation in the developed countries does not explicitly regulate 3D printing. This creates numerous questions about the IP status of 3D printing marketplaces. Some analysts predict that 3D printing marketplaces will be \\"the next Napster\\". Most marketplaces remain conservative on this topic. Most large 3D printing marketplaces also have procedures for copyright complaints. Further development of 3D printing and more new marketplaces for file sharing will most probably cause copyright to become a significant issue in them.

It is one of the most competitive high schools in Kosovo, with annual applications far exceeding the available spots. The alumni of the gymnasium hold important roles in government offices, teaching roles at Universities, and in the public scene, making the school one of the most successful of its kind. The gymnasium has 2 pathways, Social Sciences (Albanian: \\"Shkenca Shoqerore\\") located in the former technical school and Natural Sciences (Albanian: \\"Shkenca Natyrore\\") located in the original building. The subjects taught are mathematics (Analysis & Algebra), the native language, one to three foreign languages, history, geography, informatics (computers), the natural sciences (biology, chemistry, physics), history of art, music, philosophy, logic, physical education and the social sciences (sociology, ethics or religious education, psychology, politics and economy). History Founded in the early 1900s as Kosovo's first Albanian language high school. =Pre 1913: As a Turkish Gymnasium= \\"Sami Frash√´ri\\" Gymnasium is the first gymnasium teaching in the Albanian language in Kosovo. The school was established at the end of the 19th century to the beginning of the 20th century, during the Ottoman Empire. Although the majority of students and teachers were Albanian, classes were taught in the Turkish language, because the Ottoman power did not allow Albanian language to be taught. =1913‚Äì1941: Prishtina Gymnasium under Serb rule= In 1912, after the First Balkan War, Kosovo was brought under Serbian rule, and the first Gymnasium of Prishtina was opened in 1913, although this time, in the Serbian language. The Serbian Gymnasium in Prishtina was functioning with a few interruptions until 1941. During this period, most of the faculty were Serbs, whereas there was a mixture in ethnic groups among the students, but mostly Serb students. Classes were taught in Serbian. During these hard times, a number of Albanian students were able to finish the Gymnasium and were able to finish university in Belgrade, Zagreb and other countries. =1941‚Äì1945: \\"Sami Frash√´ri\\" Gymnasium, General School= In 1941, after Germany and Italy took power over Yugoslavia, Albanians who lived under the Serbian rule, new and better conditions were made for their education. A large part of Kosovo and other Albanian lands, who were under Serbian rule until 1941, joined Albania in an Italian Occupied zone. These places were brought into the jurisdiction of the Albanian government in Tirana. the Ministry of Education, led by Professor Ernest Koliqi, in the Summer of 1941, created a project which sought the expansion of Albanian elementary schools through all Albanian lands, whereas in capital cities, the opening of Albanian high schools. With this framework, Prishtina opened 1 high school with 2 branches: 1\\\\. General (Normal) Branch, similar to the General (Normal) School of Elbasan. 2\\\\. Liceale (High School) Branch or Gymnasium. This mixed school opened with the name \\"Sami Frash√´ri\\" and began functioning in 1941 in the Albanian language and was the first school of its kind in Prishtina and Kosovo =1945‚Äì1955: Real Albanian Gymnasium & Real Serbian Gymnasium= From 1945 to 1955, the gymnasium functioned in 2 languages, Albanian, with the name Real Albanian Gymnasium and Serbian, with the name Real Serbian Gymnasium =1955‚Äì1990: \\"Ivo Lola Ribar\\" Mixed Gymnasium= From 1955, the Gymnasium was established as a mixed gymnasium with the name \\"Ivo Lola Ribar\\" Gymnasium. During this period, there was a lot of discrimination against the Albanians, where they were forced to take many classes in the Serbian language. From 1960, the school began giving classes in the Turkish language, whereas from 1978, the school included the reform, Oriented Learning. After the failure of this reform, the school continued as a classical gymnasium, with 2 pathways lasting 4 years. =1989‚Äì1999: \\"Sami Frash√´ri\\" Gymnasium= From 1990, Albanian students and teachers were forced removal from the school. The gymnasium was continued in the home-school of Mehmet Aliu, where they established the school as \\"Sami Frash√´ri\\" =1999‚Äì2007: After the Kosovo War, \\"Sami Frash√´ri\\" Gymnasium= After the Kosovo War in 1999, the school continued to operate in the original school building, where classes were taught either in the Albanian language or the Turkish language. \\"Sami Frash√´ri\\" Gymnasium can be seen as a very old school with many traditions, that has made a huge contribution to the education of Albanians in Kosovo. =2007 to present: \\"Sami Frash√´ri\\" Gymnasium= The \\"Sami Frash√´ri\\" Gymnasium continues its tradition in many different conditions, but nevertheless the school manages to overcome many different situations as a growing school and among the best gymnasiums in the Balkans.

This has the consequence that if one component is removed, the remaining two comprise an unbound resonance, so that the original nucleus is split into three parts. The name is derived from the Borromean rings, a system of three linked rings in which no pair of rings is linked. Examples of Borromean nuclei Many Borromean nuclei are light nuclei near the nuclear drip lines that have a nuclear halo and low nuclear binding energy. For example, the nuclei , , and each possess a two-neutron halo surrounding a core containing the remaining nucleons. These are Borromean nuclei because the removal of either neutron from the halo will result in a resonance unbound to one-neutron emission, whereas the dineutron (the particles in the halo) is itself an unbound system. Similarly, is a Borromean nucleus with a two-proton halo; both the diproton and are unbound. Additionally, is a Borromean nucleus comprising two alpha particles and a neutron; the removal of any one component would produce one of the unbound resonances , , or . Several Borromean nuclei such as and the Hoyle state (an excited resonance in ) play an important role in nuclear astrophysics. Namely, these are three-body systems whose unbound components (formed from ) are intermediate steps in the triple-alpha process; this limits the rate of production of heavier elements, for three bodies must react nearly simultaneously. Borromean nuclei consisting of more than three components can also exist. These also lie along the drip lines; for instance, is a five-body Borromean system with a four-neutron halo. It is also possible that nuclides produced in the alpha process (such as and ) may be clusters of alpha particles, having a similar structure to Borromean nuclei. , the heaviest known Borromean nucleus is . Heavier species along the neutron drip line have since been observed; these and undiscovered heavier nuclei along the drip line are also likely to be Borromean nuclei with varying numbers (3, 5, 7, or more) of bodies.

Background  Over the past 50 years, the European Union has expanded from 6 founding members to 27; additionally there are 7 candidate and potential candidate countries waiting to join: Albania, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Serbia and Turkey, which are candidates, and Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo, which are potential candidates. A number of European countries are integrated economically, as part of the European Single Market and using its single currency, the euro. Through its High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, the EU has the capability to speak with one voice on the world stage and has established association and free trade agreements with many states. Furthermore, through the European Neighbourhood Policy and Union for the Mediterranean it is creating closer ties with countries on its borders; while developing ties with other former European colonies, the ACP countries. Countries seeking membership in the EU must undergo a great deal of reform, for example the reforms seen in Turkey, such as the abolition of capital punishment.EU-Turkey relations euractiv.com The emergence of the Union's global influence, and the draw of membership, has been the subject of a number of academic writings. Mark Leonard describes the area of EU influence as the \\"Eurosphere\\".  Countries within the Eurosphere  EU regional initiatives; current enlargement agenda (SAP and candidate countries), ENP; Eastern Partnership, Euromediterranean Partnership and EU- Russia Common Spaces According to Mark Leonard, the Eurosphere includes 109 countries. In Europe, this includes the 27 member states of the EU, applicant countries wishing to join the EU, the Western Balkans and European Commonwealth of Independent States countries (including Armenia, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova, Ukraine and transcontinental Kazakhstan). Curiously, he does not mention Western European countries such as Norway who are already integrated into the EU's single market. Outside of Europe, he lists every African country and every Middle Eastern country, as well as the countries forming the eastern border of the Eurosphere such as Iran, Azerbaijan and Russia.Leonard, M. Why Europe will run the 21st century (2004, Fourth Estate). Appendix: p.145-146. Other countries that could be said to be within the Eurosphere include European countries belonging to the European Economic Area, such as Iceland or Liechtenstein, states using the euro as their currency, such as Andorra, Monaco and San Marino, or the EU's Outermost Regions (OMR) in the Caribbean, South America and in the Atlantic, such as French Guiana, Guadeloupe, La R√©union, Martinique and Saint Martin. In addition, the Overseas Countries and Territories (OCT) closely associated with the EU in the Atlantic, Caribbean, Pacific and Southern oceans are generally included in the Eurosphere such as Aruba, Bonaire, Cura√ßao, French Polynesia, Greenland and Saint-Pierre-et-Miquelon. The above-mentioned groups all have strong economic and political links with the EU today.

New York in the 1980s Leatherdale started his career in New York City during the early eighties. Leatherdale first served as Robert Mapplethorpe's office manager for a while and was photographed in the nude by the master, grabbing a rope with his right hand and holding a rabbit in his left.Patricia Morrisroe: Mapplethorpe: A Biography. New York: Random House 1995. Thereafter he worked as an assistant curator to Sam Wagstaff. He soon became a darling of the then vibrant club scene and the fashionable media: Interview, Details, The New Yorker, Vanity Fair and Elle Decor presented his work. Later on he was featured in artsy publications as Artforum, Art News and Art in America. He documented the New York life style, the extraordinary people of Danceteria and Club 57 where he staged his first exhibits in 1980. Leatherdale was an acute observer of New York in the eighties. His models were the unknown but exceptional ones ‚Äì like Larissa, Claudia Summers or Ruby Zebra ‚Äì or well known artists ‚Äì like Madonna, Winston Tong and Divine, Trisha Brown, Lisa Lyon, Andr√©e Putman, Kathy Acker, Jodie Foster and fellow photographer John Dugdale. For quite a while Leatherdale remained in Mapplethorpe's shadow, but was soon discovered as a creative force in his own right by Christian Michelides, the founder of Molotov Art Gallery in Vienna. Leatherdale flew to Vienna, presented his work there and was acclaimed by public and press. This international recognition paved his way to museums and permanent collections such as the Rheinisches Landesmuseum Bonn, the Art Institute of Chicago, the Australian National Gallery in Canberra, the London Museum in Ontario and Austria's Albertina. Above all, his arresting portraits of New York City celebrities in the series Hidden Identities aroused long-lasting interest amongst curators and collectors. In India In 1993, Leatherdale began spending half of each year in India's holy city of Banaras. Based in an ancient house in the centre of the old city, he began photographing the diverse and remarkable people there, from the holy men to celebrities, from royalty to tribals, carefully negotiating his way among some of India's most elusive figures to make his portraits. From the outset, his intention was to pay homage to the timeless spirit of India through a highly specific portrayal of its individuals. His pictures include princesses and boatmen, movie stars and circus performers, street beggars and bishops, mothers and children in traditional garb. Leatherdale explores how essentially unaffected much of the country has been by the passage of time; this approach is distinctly post- colonial. In 1999, Leatherdale relocated to Chottanagpur (Jharkhand) where he has been focusing on the Adivasis. His second home base is now Serra da Estrela in the mountains of central Portugal. Leatherdale's matte printing techniques, which adapt nineteenth-century processes and employ half black, half sepia colorations, reinforce the timelessness of his subjects. Tones and matte surfaces effectively differentiate his portraits from the easy slickness of fashion photography. Charity The Medical Care Team in Chottanagpur was created by Amit and Ilona Ghosh, Nilika Lal, Marcus Leatherdale and Jorge Serio in 2002; it is a private service to help the local people medically and financially. As many people in India suffer needlessly due to misfortune and ignorance, the project helps to salvage lives which have been devastated by accidents or illness. By connecting patients with the appropriate doctors and proper facilities, the project helps get people back on their feet and regain their lost dignity. Major exhibitionsBooks *New York 1983.

Crimes, Arrests and Escapes  Marcellus is believed to have been born in the village of Nievern an der Lahn, five miles [seven kilometers] southeast of Koblenz, in Germany. It is from this birthplace that he had his Latin surname, Niveriis [\\"from Nievern\\"]. Nothing else is known about his origins. He was apparently very well educated. The first known mention of Marcellus was in 1426, when he was arrested in L√ºbeck for selling forged letters of mortgage and subsequently escaped from prison. He then pretended to be a monk of the Church of the Holy SepulchreThe Franciscan monks had been looking after the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem since 1342. until he met a fellow Franciscan friar. Then, with the help of his new friend, he pretended to be a Knight of St. John throughout northern Germany to collect the money for ransoming the King of Cyprus from Turkish captivity.The Turks did not have Janus of Cyprus. He was actually held in Cairo by the Mamluks of Egypt for ten months before he was ransomed. He was again arrested but escaped. He was next found in the service of Henry Cardinal Beaufort, who was the envoy of Pope Martin V in Germany. When it came out that Marcellus was an escapee, he was arrested and imprisoned. He then escaped and fled, only to return and engage in strange behaviour, such as running naked through the streets and staging a symbolic hanging. In August 1428, he was sentenced to imprisonment for life. He was kept in the tower of the Prince- Archbishop of Cologne's prison in Br√ºhl, 12.5 miles (20 kilometers) south of Cologne. The conditions of his cell were so bad that he wrote and sent letters, which have been preserved, to the officers of the Prince-Archbishop to beg for his freedom. He was redeemed and freed after allegedly curing the Prince-Archbishop, Dietrich II of Moers, of a dangerous illness. By then, his deeds were so notorious that rumors of them were heard at the Council of Basel. In 1431, he was assigned to Neuss as a priest and canon but he was not happy there. In 1439 he fell into debauchery but he continued to minister until 1442. He seemed to have enjoyed great popularity in the parish. He then settled in Cologne and lived there for a while.  The Bishop and the Archbishop  In 1447, Nicholas V was Pope. Marcellus hurried to Rome and paid homage to him. He was able to persuade him to appoint him, on 15 April 1448, as the 26th Bishop of Sk√°lholt, the Papal Nuncio of Iceland, and the Collector of Papal Revenues for Scandinavia. But Marcellus did not leave immediately for Iceland. He seemed to have stayed for a while in Rome, where he had encounters with many notables. He then went to Denmark, where Christian I of Denmark had become the King, introduced himself as the Pope's representative and quickly charmed the young king. He followed the King to Norway in the summer of 1450 and crowned him as the King of Norway on 29 August in the Cathedral of Nidaros in Trondheim. He even managed to get the new King to void the election of the new Archbishop of Nidaros and appoint Marcellus as the replacement. Marcellus went back to Rome to have the Pope confirm his new position. But when Marcellus arrived, he heard that Nicholas V had just gotten a lengthy report about his crimes and sins. He fled from Rome to avoid arrest and imprisonment and went north to Cologne, where he owned a house. There he faked the Pope's letters of introduction and protection to support himself. He was arrested in the autumn of 1451 but he managed to escape yet again. He was still the Bishop of Sk√°lholt but was replaced on 13 June 1450 as the Collector of Papal Revenues for Scandinavia by Birger M√•nsson of Uppsala,Jensen, Denmark and the Crusades\\", pages 74. the future Bishop of V√§ster√•s. In the spring of 1452, Marcellus was back in the good graces of the Pope, who immediately sent the invitation to Christian I. He told the King that he would give him special treatment if Marcellus was restored as the Archbishop of Nidaros. At that time, the Archbishop was Heinrich Kalteisen (Henrik Kalteisen in Norwegian and Danish, Hinrik Kaldaj√°rn in Icelandic), one of the most respected scholars in Germany. He also happened to be from Koblenz, just five miles (7 kilometers) northwest of Nievern an der Lahn. He was the Pope's man, sent to remedy the problems caused by Marcellus, but he was not the King's man. Nevertheless, he went to Copenhagen and managed to convince Christian to keep him as the Archbishop instead of Marcellus. However, as soon as Heinrich was gone, Marcellus arrived. He quickly gained the trust of the King again and presented letters to show that he had been greatly disrespected and mistreated. But these letters were actually forged by Marcellus himself. After a great deal of conflict and political maneuvering, the dispute ended in the summer of 1454, when Kalteisen resigned and went south to Rome. But Marcellus did not get the Archdiocese of Nidaros; it went instead to Olav Trondsson ‚Äì the choice of the Cathedral Chapter.  The Chancellor and the King  Marcellus went to Rome to press his claim with the Pope on the Archdiocese but he was not successful. On his way back to Copenhagen, he was attacked, robbed and imprisoned in Cologne, perhaps with the encouragement from the Papal authorities, but he managed to get himself released from the prison.Willson, Church and State in Norway, pages 282. To avenge the mistreatment of his friend, Christian I confiscated all the assets of the Archbisophric's people who were living and visiting within his kingdom. His actions set off a series of conflicts that did not finish until the late 1470s, when Marcellus had already been dead for more than a decade. Marcellus stayed at the court of the King of Denmark and Norway. With the titles of the King's Chancellor, the Royal Councilor and the Bishop of Sk√°lholt, he was one of the most powerful and influential men in Denmark and indeed all of Scandinavia. The Danish historian, Johannes Peder Lindb√¶k, believed that Marcellus was the main architect of Denmark's policies and attitudes towards the Catholic Church so much that he labelled the first twelve years of Christian I's reign as \\"Marcellus's Time\\".Lindb√¶k, Pavernes Forhold til Danmark, pages 13-53. The very first chapter of this book is titled \\"Christian I's first 12 reigning years : Marcellus's Time\\" [Kristiern I's 12 f√∏rste regerings√•r. Marcellus' tid]. In Iceland, however, Marcellus was anonymous. He never came to Iceland and he didn't much impact on its affairs. He collected his income from the church chapter of Sk√°lholt, was the master of the Vestmannaeyjar (Icelandic, \\"Westmann Islands\\", Vestmanna√∏erne in Danish, a gift from King Christian) manor, and had the authority to sell trading and fishing licenses to the English in Iceland.Seaver, \\"Frozen Echo\\", page 196. He was able to win most of the Icelandic h√∂f√∞ingjar [chieftains] over to his side but he is known to have banned the priest-poet, J√≥n \\"Mar√≠usk√°ld [Mary's Poet]\\" P√°lsson, but the reasons are not known. To oversee his diocese in Iceland, Marcellus had Andrew, already the Bishop of Gar√∞ar in nearby Greenland, appointed as the Vice-Bishop (or Vicar) of Sk√°lholt. But, for commercial and financial matters in Iceland, Marcellus had two other assistants, Bjorn Thorleifsson and Daniel Kepken, who were as unscrupulous as he was.Seaver, The Frozen Echo\\", page 197. In 1457, Marcellus was the master of ceremonies when the first known investiture of the Order of the Elephant was made. It is possible that he might have helped King Christian with the details of the founding of the Order.Dybdahl, \\"Marcellus\\", Norsk Biografisk Leksikon. Meanwhile, King Christian remained loyal to Marcellus until 1468, when Pius II was elected as the new Pope, he realized that Marcellus had become a political liability. So he quietly dropped Marcellus and the latter's influence declined at the Court.Jensen, Denmark and the Crusades\\", pages 73.Willson, Church and State in Norway, pages 285. Sometime between 27 February 1460Dybdahl, \\"Marcellus\\", Norsk Biografisk Leksikon. and October 1462, Marcellus fell out of a ship off the coast of Sweden and drowned. 1462 is the more likely year because in October 1462 King Christian recognized the election of J√≥n Stef√°nsson Krabbe, a Dane, as the new Bishop of Sk√°lholt.

It is named after the English modernist architect Jane Drew. Background The Jane Drew Prize began with discussions in 1997 between the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) Women Architects Group and the Arts Council of England. The new prize was launched in January 1998 with a ceremony held at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London. The award was created to recognise promotion of innovation, diversity and inclusiveness in architecture. It was named after the English architect Dame Jane Drew (died 1996) who, among other achievements, had tried to set up the first all-women architecture practice and had been the first female full Professor at Harvard University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Originally published by ArchDaily 12 April 2012. Nominations were invited by the RIBA, after which a jury selected the winner who received a prize of ¬£10,000. The 1998 winner also received a sculpture by Eduardo Paolozzi. Problems were encountered with the initial award, primarily in finding suitable candidates that met all three criteria. A forum was held on 19 May 1998 where the four shortlisted candidates (client Jane Priestman, artist Martin Richman, landscape architect Kathryn Gustafson and architectural practice Fashion Architecture Taste) were asked to give a ten-minute presentation. The evening was described as \\"tedious\\" and Gustafson didn't even turn up. The award was finally presented to Gustafson on 4 June after strong disagreements and near-resignations amongst the judging panel. The prize has subsequently come under the jurisdiction of the Architects' Journal. Winners are chosen by the AJ Women in Architecture Judging Panel. According to the 2013 entry guidelines, the prize recognises a \\"contribution to the status of women in architecture\\".

(Nepali: ‡§ó‡•ã‡§µ‡§ø‡§®‡•ç‡§¶ ‡§ï‡•á.‡§∏‡•Ä.) is the legend people of Nepal, He is Nepali orthopedic surgeon and philanthropic activist. He is a professor of orthopedics at Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital, part of the Institute of Medicine, Nepal. He is known for humanitarian work in Nepal and internationally, and for his activism in favor of independent academic functioning of the government medical institutions in Nepal, notably the Institute of Medicine and Patan Academy of Health Sciences. His non-violent protests and fasts have successfully pressurized the government and stakeholders.Lone hunger striker spurs Nepal to action Nature 506, 279 (20 February 2014) doi:10.1038/506279a  Early Life and Schooling  Govinda K.C. initially studied at the Institute of Medicine to be a Health Assistant (H.A.), which is the equivalent of a Physician Assistant in the US after completing his high school. He had been unaware that this was a step in potentially becoming a doctor but on completing his H.A. he won a Ministry of Education scholarship to study for a M.B.B.S. in Bangladesh at Rajshahi Medical College. After graduation, he returned to Nepal and served in Bir Hospital. He then received further study (M.S.) in Bangladesh at Dhaka University to become an orthopedic surgeon. Although he wanted to serve in a tertiary hospital and there was a shortage of orthopedists in Kathmandu, plans were made to transfer him to a rural hospital where there would be no facilities to practice orthopedics. He resigned from Bir Hospital and joined the Institute of Medicine as a volunteer in 1994.  Humanitarian Works  K.C. has preferred to use his salary to provide services in remote areas in Nepal, and has also traveled internationally in response to natural calamities. He has not taken funds from any non-governmental organization (NGO) or international NGO to provide these services. Apart from the earthquake in Nepal, he has financed his own way on these Nepalese and international humanitarian services. Professor Govinda K.C. crossing flooded river = Nepal = TUTH offers K.C. a few weeks of vacation every year. He goes to the most rural clinics of Nepal, far from public transportation, often traveling there on foot. He trains health workers in rural Nepal to identify orthopedic emergencies, to provide emergency treatment and if necessary provide timely referrals. He organizes health camps in remote places. He gives medications to these people and makes necessary arrangements to give free medical treatment when they come for further treatment in Kathmandu. He has faced allegations of being a spy or an insurgent when he worked during the Maoists' insurgency. The rural districts of Nepal had an outbreak of cholera some years ago. Many doctors refused to go there, even if paid. K.C. carried medicine on his back to provide humanitarian aid. = International = K.C. has traveled extensively to assist victims of natural disasters. In 2001, he spent three weeks in the Bhuj region in Gujarat, India after the earthquake. In 2005, he served in Northwest Pakistan for around 20 days after a disastrous earthquake. After a cyclone in Myanmar in 2008, the government of Myanmar prevented foreign aid agencies from entering the country, but admitted him for two weeks. In 2010, he went to Haiti in the wake of the disastrous earthquake and served for three weeks. In 2011, he served flood victims in Pakistan for two weeks. In 2013, he went to the Philippines to treat people affected by the Tsunami.  Medical Activist  KC has been a prominent campaigner for medical sector reform in response to public allegations of both corruption and of undue political pressure to give medical college affiliation to facilities with inadequate infrastructures. His ongoing advocacy over several years has included several lengthy personal hunger strikes, which have received extensive media coverage, and successfully pressurized the authorities to make some changes. In January 2014, K.C. launched another hunger strike, campaigning against the political appointment of a new dean of IoM, which did not reflect seniority, as well as several other grievances. Supporting this cause, the medical association of Nepal shut down hospitals, except the emergency services, across the country. The Nepal Medical Association called for mass resignation of doctors across the country and almost a hundred doctors and professors resigned. The doctors announced free medical camps at public places. These collective actions appear to have been successful, so K.C. broke his fast.  Fifth and sixth fast-unto-death coming to eighth fast  Dr. Govinda KC on the 13th day of his eighth hunger strike at Institute of Medicine, Maharajganj. K.C. announced a fifth hunger strike after the Nepalese government retracted from its agreement with him and his movement. He and the government of Nepal came to an agreement that the opening of new medical colleges would be based on the report to be presented by a team of specialists led by Kedar Bhakta Mathema. Chitralekha Yadav, minister for Education, was accused of having made key amendments to the law to make way for the new Devdaha and Birat Medical colleges to be granted affiliation. Law-makers led by CPN UML leader Rajendra Pandey staged protests in the Constituent Assembly demanding the affiliation to be granted before the report would be presented to the government. They also threatened with the signatures of 146 lawmakers, mostly from the CPN UML, that they would topple the government if affiliation was not granted. These lawmakers had cited that their investment would go in vain if they were not allowed to run a medical college. Several independent observations cited that none of the medical colleges had enough manpower. Most of them did not have infrastructures and did not have adequate patient flow. When his demands were not met, the professor protested peacefully with a hunger strike. The movement got widespread support from social sector activists, medical professionals and students, artists including Nepathya and \\"Maha\\". However, there was a latency in exhibiting support from Nepal Medical Council and Nepal Medical Association. The prime minister, Koirala, was confronted with K.C.'s degrading health. To this the PM replied, \\"So what?\\" This further incensed the movement. The government of Nepal responded with a committee composed of the ministers for education Chitralekha Yadav, for health Khagaraj Adhikrai and the Chief Secretary Lilamani Paudel. The professor refused to hold talks with the ministers as there were concerns of creating loopholes and forcing a way out of the existing rules to grant new medical colleges affiliation. Meanwhile, the medical fraternity, various leaders and celebrities expressed support for the movement. Nepal Medical Association urged all medical services to be halted except for the emergency services. K.C. maintained that he was against the strike. Meanwhile, the professor's health deteriorated further. When the government of Nepal succumbed to mounting pressure and agreed on most of the agenda, he broke his fast, and the Nepal Medical Association and other supporters of the movement retracted the proposed protest measures. He sat on sixth fast unto death from 24 August 2015 to 6 September again as the government heavily influenced by unscrupulous politicians and merchants with wrong intention tried with all means to let the medical colleges go unregulated by undermining the Mathema report. The fast again ended with 11 commitments from the government.He sat on eighth fast against wrongdoings of CIAA and for reform of medical education since 10 July 2016 which continues till date as government and legislators have failed to act in public intetest. Eleventh Hunger Strike Dr. KC sat on his Eleventh fast unto death from 24 July 2017 with seven point demand of medical education reformation. He has demanded to incorporate the Kedar Bhakta Mathema led committee's recommendation in the forthcoming Medical Education Bill. Fourteenth Hunger Strike On 8 January 2018, following the decision of the Supreme Court to reinstate Dr. Shashi Sharma as Dean of the Institute of Medicine, Dr. K.C. called a press conference to condemn the move and began his 14th hunger strike. Dr. K.C. accused the court of \\"selling justice\\" and began his hunger-strike to demand the resignation of Chief Justice Gopal Parajuli. He alleged the Chief Justice was \\"a corrupt individual having links with the mafia\\". Since 2014, Parajuli has ruled in favor of private medical colleges and against the Nepal Medical Council, the regulatory body governing medical education in the country, and the rulings have favored seven for- profit medical colleges in the country. Later that evening, the Supreme Court ordered his arrest for contempt of court. He was arrested by the Kathmandu Metropolitan Police from TU Teaching hospital, where the hunger strike was being staged, and taken to the Singha Durbar Police Circle. Nepal Medical Association (NMA) demanded instant release of Dr. K.C. and condemned the incident as being gravely sad. NMA stated that Dr. K.C. has brought positive changes in the medical sector through his hunger strike. On 9 January 2018, K.C. was presented before the SC and a hearing was scheduled for 10 January. K.C. remained in the custody till the hearing. In his statement at the court, KC stated that \\"CJ Parajuli had lobbied and secured a job for his nephew at the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) as the commission‚Äôs legal counselor following a SC decision in favour of the former CIAA chief commissioner Lokman Singh Karki.\\" On 10 January 2018, he was released on general date without bail by the Supreme Court. The Court ordered to enquire the controversy of Chief Justice Gopal Parajuli's citizenship and the case of Dr. Shashi Sharma would be reopened. Dr. K.C.'s lawyer Surendra Bhandari told on K.C.'s behalf that K.C. had accused the Chief Justice Parajuli of his corrupt actions. Similarly, K.C. on his release told:  Fifteenth Hunger Strike  Dr Govinda KC initiated his 15th fast-unto-death, in Jumla on June 30, 2018 to protest against alternations made to the Medical Education Ordinance Replacement Bill, among other issues by the government led by K P Oli.  Personal Life  K.C. is unmarried and lived within the hospital quarters until his retirement from IOM. His family includes his mother and two brothers. When asked by Vijay Kumar Pandey in a television interview to list three priorities in his life, he listed service to patients and his students- and no third priority. Now, he has been living with his relative in Kathmandu.  References  Who is Dr. Govinda KC?

He completed an apprenticeship as a bricklayer and later worked as a construction inspector. In 1852, he passed the Master Craftsman examination. That same year, his employer sent him to manage construction of the Circus Renz building in Vienna, where he decided to remain and become an architect, although his plans to attend the Academy of Architecture in Berlin had to be abandoned. Initially, he concentrated on contracts for industrial buildings, but soon developed connections with wealthy German immigrants who admired his classical, monumental style. He became involved in the Ringstra√üe project and eventually produced 36 luxurious buildings in its vicinity. By 1869, overwork began to have an effect on his health and he took several trips to Italy with his wife, but to no avail. In 1870, following the collapse of a wall at one of his buildings that killed eight people, he became mentally ill (or had a stroke; it's not clear which).

The project was financed by the Edith and Isaac Wolfson Trust. Location Kiryat Wolfson is situated on a ridge at the western edge of Sha'arei Hesed, northwest of Rehavia. The towers overlook the Valley of the Cross, the Knesset, and the Israel Museum. History In the early 1960s, Jerusalem Mayor Mordechai Ish-Shalom sought entrepreneurs to improve Jerusalem's cityscape. He approached Mordechai and Moshe Meir of Israel, business partners with Sir Charles Clore of England and Sir Isaac Wolfson, to invest in the city. With Ish-Shalom's assistance, Mordechai Meir selected a plot overlooking the Valley of the Cross for an apartment project. The land was purchased from the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate and the Israel Land Administration for $1.2 million. To overcome the topographical drawbacks of the ridge, the developers applied for taller building rights. To convince the members of the Jerusalem planning committee to agree to the taller-than-normal construction, they hired a world-renowned architect, I. M. Pei, to design it. In 1967 Pei submitted his design, which called for three towers of 29 stories each. The local planning committee responded with \\"total opposition\\", claiming that the towers would \\"dwarf the Knesset\\", which faced it across the valley. The committee rejected the design but said it would be prepared to issue permits for towers no higher than 16 stories. Pei refused to downsize the towers and resigned (or was fired) from the project. The five towers of Kiryat Wolfson (left), and adjacent high-rises (right), completely obscure the rural neighborhood of Sha'arei Hesed when viewed from the west. Architect Yitzhak Perlstein, a brother-in-law of Mordechai Meir and architect in Meir's company, was tapped to produce a new design. Perlstein expanded the project to five towers averaging 16 stories each. He added 50 terraced apartments and a shopping center at the base of the buildings to accommodate the topographical contours. The revised plan raised another round of opposition when it was presented to the Jerusalem district planning committee. Kadish Luz, Speaker of the Knesset, claimed that \\"from the height of the towers, it would be possible to snipe at the Knesset, and even to bomb it\\". Ish-Shalom persuaded Luz to retract his opposition, and hinted to the committee that a few small apartments could be set aside for committee members if they would approve the five towers, which they did. The first two towers were constructed between 1970 and 1972. After their completion, a public outcry ensued. Jerusalem Mayor Teddy Kollek appealed to Meir to change the plans for the three remaining towers to a series of low-rise, terraced buildings, but Meir refused. Besides completing the three remaining towers, Meir erected six more high-rises on adjacent land a few years later. The finished towers of Kiryat Wolfson present a long, 16-story-high \\"wall\\" that completely obscures the rural landscape of Sha'arei Hesed when viewed from the west. Description Kiryat Wolfson comprises 300 apartments and 50 terraced apartments, or \\"villas\\". The units are spacious, ranging from for a two- bedroom apartment to for a four-bedroom unit. Apartments regularly sell for over $1 million. A professional management company oversees the cleanliness and security of the grounds, entrance lobbies, and underground parking areas. The buildings are wheelchair-accessible and have Shabbat elevators. The commercial center located on the lower levels of one of the buildings features a supermarket, retail shops, restaurants, and the Shalom Mayer Medical Center, which includes an English-speaking family clinic and many specialists. Demographics Most residents of the Wolfson Towers are foreign retirees. A 2006 Israel Central Bureau of Statistics survey reported that 22.1% of residents of Kiryat Wolfson were aged 70 or older. (press release) Kiryat Wolfson consistently logs the highest median age of any Jerusalem neighborhood, religious or secular, in the annual Jerusalem Institute for Israel Studies (JIIS) survey. In 2010 the median age in Kiryat Wolfson was 66, down from 68 in 2009. (subscription) Kiryat Wolfson also has the lowest housing density in Jerusalem. A JIIS survey reported a housing density of per person in Kiryat Wolfson in 2005, compared to an overall housing density of per person in Jerusalem.

He was one of the best horses of his generation in Germany at the age of two winning three races including the Zukunfts Rennen. In the following year he won the Dr. Busch-Memorial, Union-Rennen, Grosser Preis von Berlin and Preis von Europa as well as finishing second to K√∂nigsstuhl in both the Deutsches Derby and the Aral-Pokal. Nebos emerged as the best racehorse in Germany in 1980, winning five races including the Gerling-Preis, Grosser Preis von Dortmund, Grosser Preis von Baden, Grosser Preis von D√ºsseldorf and the Grosser Preis von Berlin for the second time as well as being beaten less than two lengths in the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. He later became a successful breeding stallion. Background Nebos was a dark bay or brown horse with no white markings bred in Germany by his owner Countess Margit Batthy√°ny. He was sired by Caro, an Irish-bred, French-trained stallion whose wins included the Prix d'Ispahan, Poule d'Essai des Poulains and Prix Ganay. He later became a successful breeding stallion in both Europe and North America, siring many good winners including Madelia, Cozzene, Winning Colors, Turgeon, With Approval and Golden Pheasant. Nebos' dam Nostrana won two races and came from a branch of Thoroughbred family 4r which also produced many successful German racehorses as well as the 2000 Guineas winner Island Sands. The colt was trained throughout his racing career by Hein Bollow and ridden in most of his races by Lutz M√§der. Racing career=1978: two-year-old season= As a two-year-old, Nebos won his first three races, all of them over a distance of 1200 metres. His most important success came at Baden-Baden where he won the Group Three Zukunfts-Rennen. On his final appearance of the season he was moved up in distance for the Preis des Winterfavoriten at Cologne and finished second to Esclavo. =1979: three-year-old season= On his three-year-old debut, Nebos reversed the form of his only defeat to beat Esclavo in the Dr. Busch-Memorial over 1700 m at Krefeld Racecourse. He was then moved up in distance in June for the Union-Rennen (a trial race for the Deutsches Derby) over 2200 m at Cologne and won from K√∂nigsstuhl. Nebos and K√∂nigsstuhl met again in the Deutsches Derby a month later, with the latter prevailing by a short head. Later in July, Nebos was matched against older horses and recorded his first Group One win in the Grosser Preis von Berlin over 2400 m at D√ºsseldorf, winning by four lengths from the British-trained Obraztsovy who had won the Hardwicke Stakes at Royal Ascot. In August, Nebos finished second to K√∂nigsstuhl in the Aral-Pokal at Gelsenkirchen. Nebos ended his season in the Group One Preis von Europa over 2400 m at Cologne. He won by three quarters of a length from the Polish horse Czubaryk, with the British colt M-Lolshan (who had beaten K√∂nigsstuhl in the Grosser Preis von Baden) a length away in third. =1980: four-year-old season= As a four-year-old, Nebos won his first four races, starting with the Gerling-Preis at Cologne. He then won the Grosser Preis von Dortmund by three lengths before defeating Konigsstuhl by two and a half lengths in the Grosser Preis von D√ºsseldorf. In July he won the Grosser Preis von Berlin for the second time, beating the Italian Derby winner Marracci by three and a half lengths. After five consecutive victories, Nebos' winning run came to an end at Gelsenkirchen when he was beaten a nose by the three-year-old Wauthi in the Aral-Pokal. On 7 September, Nebos was matched against an international field in the Grosser Preis von Baden over 2400 m at Baden-Baden. He won by a length from Cherubin, with Marracci in third: the unplaced horses included Argument, Nicholas Bill and Cracaval. On 5 October, Nebos raced outside Germany for the first and only time when he was sent to France for the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe over 2400 m at Longchamp Racecourse. He was well-supported in the betting and started at odds of 7/1 in a field of twenty runners. He appeared to be outpaced in the early stages but made up a great deal of ground in the straight to finish fifth behind Detroit, Argument, Ela-Mana-Mou and Three Troikas, beaten less than two lengths by the winner. Nebos returned to Germany for the Preis von Europa, but failed to reproduce his earlier form, finishing third behind Pawiment. Assessment and honours In 1980, the independent Timeform organisation gave Nebos a rating of 129, eight pounds below their top-rated horse Moorestyle. In the official International Classification he was rated the ninth-best horse of any age in Europe. He was also voted German Horse of the Year. Stud record At the end of his racing career, Nebos was syndicated with a value of ¬£650,000 and became a breeding stallion at the Gestut Erlenhof, near Frankfurt, beginning his stud career at a fee of 15,000 deutschmarks a mare. He sired several good winners including: *Antic Boy, foaled 1984, won Leopardstown Stakes *Gondola, 1984, won Deutsches St. Leger *Lebos, 1984, won Deutsches Derby *Zohar, 1989, won Union-Rennen *Pinot, 1990, won Deutsches St. Leger, Prix de Barbeville *Laroche, 1991, won Deutsches Derby, Premio Ellington, Gerling Preis *First Hello, 1992, won Deutsches St. Leger *Night Devil, 1995, won Grosser Preis von Dahlwitz *Golden Goal, 1996, won Scilly Isles Novices' Chase, Pendil Novices' Chase Nebos was the leading Sire in Germany in 1987. He died in 1999 at the age of twenty-three.

This was the fourteenth of fifteen in which Lionel Barrymore starred as Dr. Leonard B. Gillespie. The film following was Dark Delusion (1947), which was the last in the Dr. Kildare series released by MGM. This was the last of Van Johnson's character, Dr. Randall 'Red' Adams, also seen in three previous Kildare films. Plot summary This episode in the series should have been called Between Three Women, because there are plot strands involving three, not two, women. Dr. Gillespie's (Lionel Barrymore) assistant, Dr. Red Adams (Van Johnson), is still fending off the romantic advances of beautiful blond socialite and social worker Ruth Edley (Marilyn Maxwell), who finally succeeds in winning Red's heart. The second woman is a pretty night club singer Edna (Gloria DeHaven), who collapses suddenly one night after a show and cannot understand why she is no longer able to eat. Red finds out that a complicated subconscious obsession is the cause. The third woman is Sally (Marie Blake), the reliable and wise-cracking switchboard operator in all of the episodes. Sally is stricken with Bright's Disease and refuses to let anyone besides Red operate on her ailing kidney. Things turn out well for Red and all three women. There are some scenes in the singer's night club that draw inspiration from the country's immersion in the Second World War. As part of a \\"home front\\" money raising contest to help the war effort, Ruth bids extravagant amounts of money for the chance to kiss Red in public.

They are usually found in burial sites but are found in habitation sites as well. They are tentatively dated from 1000 BCE to 300 CE marking the transition of the proto-historic period into the historic period of South Asia. A number of scholars have tried to decipher the symbols since 1878, and currently there is no consensus as to whether they constitute un-deciphered writing or graffiti or symbols without any syllabic or alphabetic meaning. From archaeological stratigraphy, potsherds with and without symbols are usually found at the lowest level, followed by potsherds with mixed symbols and Brahmi or Tamil Brahmi and eventually at the highest level potsherds are only found with Brahmi or Tamil Brahmi etchings. From around 300 CE, they disappear from grave sites. Scholars such as Iravatham Mahadevan have tried to link the symbols directly to Indus Valley script or as derived due to lingering influence, whereas others such as K. Rajan see the symbols as the genesis of the later Brahmi script. Yet many others see no particular alphabetic value in them only as graffiti symbols used for socio-religious purposes.

The village of East Litchfield sits at the crossroads of the highways that connect Waterbury and Torrington; Hartford and Litchfield and the Naugatuck River that connects communities from Bridgeport to Winsted. East Litchfield, like Bantam, Milton and Northfield are parts of the town of Litchfield and have been since the town was settled in 1721. Over 3,000 years ago Native Americans found East Litchfield to be a hunting ground rich with wild game. They used the outcroppings of soapstone to make various vessels for food and drink. The area was also rich with quartz that was used for arrowheads and centuries later sent to Massachusetts for sandpaper production. When Europeans settled in the area it became a community of farmers and mill workers. Naugatuck Valley Railroad built a depot in 1849 and extended the train to Winsted. The mills along the Naugatuck River were able to load their freight and passengers could disembark at East Litchfield and get a stage coach to Litchfield center where they could take their summer retreats. Harwinton Fair attendees would take the train to and from East Litchfield where they would catch the shuttle to the Fair Grounds. In 1849 the Naugatuck Valley Railroad extended their rails to Winsted, Connecticut. A depot was built in East Litchfield. Passengers could ride all the way to New York City without changing trains. Along the sides the Naugatuck River in East Litchfield were many mills; the Paige and Dains Paper Mill and Baldwin's Saw Mill were two. Ice was harvested from the Naugatuck River and stored in an icehouse built by the railroad company. After the establishment of the depot East Litchfield had a hotel and restaurant (Scovill House), a post office, blacksmith shop, harness shop, livery service to Litchfield center, Ferncliff Farm with a store and cheese factory, Mrs. Mark's variety store across from the depot, a chapel, one-room schoolhouse, icehouses, a baseball field, lumber mill, grist mill, cider mill and a paper factory. This photograph from the late 1800s shows the village of East Litchfield with Harwinton in the background. All of the above-mentioned business establishments disappeared after the depot closed; the chapel is still there and just a few of the original village homes. The East Litchfield Chapel was built by local residents in 1868. It still stands today. Illustration of the East Litchfield village circa 1880. There are no known photos in existence showing the depot from this perspective. This illustration was created by East Litchfield resident and artist Jesse Richard by referencing several old photos of the area. The East Litchfield Chapel. The history of the Chapel begins in 1865, when the ladies of East Litchfield formed a Sunday school that met in the one- room 1790 schoolhouse. Sarah and Dwight Kilbourn, newly wed in 1866, purchased property and moved to East Litchfield. Sarah, a deeply religious woman was instrumental in the management of the chapel from the time of its inception to her death in 1938. Dwight, a Civil War veteran, historian, clerk of the county court, member of the school board, station master for the East Litchfield depot and leading member of the committee that created the Connecticut 2nd Heavy Artillery monument at Arlington Cemetery, led the effort to save the John Brown House (burned in 1918) in Torrington, CT and purchased the building that housed the first law school in Connecticut. By 1868, Hector Barber, a local citizen, had donated a small parcel of land (24 x 36 feet) next to his home and solicited money, materials and labor to build a Union Mission Chapel. The building would be plain, 24 x 36 feet in dimension and be built close to the street. The men of East Litchfield cut wood from their properties, had it milled locally, then set about to build themselves a chapel. The Ladies Sewing Society, that planned to meet in the new chapel, used their funds to decorate the interior. Seventeen years later (1885) an alcove and storage closets were added to the south wall. The ladies of East Litchfield put on oyster suppers to help pay for the improvement. Funeral services for Dwight C. Kilbourn were held at both the East Litchfield Chapel and the Litchfield Congregational Church in 1914. The Torrington Register proclaimed him to be the ‚ÄúBest Known Man in Litchfield County.‚Äù Mr. and Mrs. Kilbourn were prominent in Litchfield, East Litchfield and the chapel. The fifty-seventh annual reunion of the Second Connecticut Heavy Artillery; originally the 19th Connecticut Volunteer Infantry of the Civil War was hosted by Sarah Kilbourn (widow of Dwight Kilbourn) in 1922. The various events were held at the East Litchfield Chapel and the Kilbourn Home (next door.) The East Litchfield community prepared and served dinner to the veterans and their families; and provided entertainment in the form of patriotic songs‚Äîall in the chapel. A newspaper reporter from the Torrington Register attended and wrote an article recording the day's events, noting the generous help of the local citizens. By the mid 1920s the congregation of the East Litchfield Chapel included ninety percent of the community. In addition to religious functions, the chapel was a community gathering place. It was decided that the most economical way to gain space for preparing and serving meals would be to add an addition in the form of a walk- out basement with a wood-burning cook stove and a dry sink. Water would be brought in from nearby homes. In 1930, the adjacent landowners each donated a small portion of their land so that the basement could be dug out and walls erected behind the original building. All the work was to be done by members of the community. They created a new foundation and basement directly behind the chapel, rolled the building south and placed it on the concrete brick foundation, added an 8 x 28 foot vestibule to the front with stairs on the east side to access the basement. Three stained glass windows were placed on the front/north, one on the west side and two on the south side. The actual work started and ended in 1933. They were still raising money to pay for it in 1935. Evelyn Goodwin who was the Litchfield Town Clerk for over 60 years, remembered that the chapel was not for any particular denomination. ‚ÄúThey would have the Trinity minister one week and the next the Congregational and the next week it might be the Methodist, but they used to have Sunday school, church services and Christian Endeavor meetings. When I was a little girl Mrs. Kilbourn was principal of the Sunday school and my grandmother Naser was a Sunday school teacher. We used to go with her on Sunday afternoons; she would hitch up her horse and wagon and we'd drive down and go to Sunday school.‚Äù When the East Litchfield community organized a volunteer fire company in the 1940s, meeting were held in the chapel while the fire truck was kept in a privately owned barn across the street. But when the firehouse was built (by members of the community on donated land) it became the community center with all the space and utilities that the chapel lacked. As new families moved into the area they maintained their relationships with churches from their former homes. With dwindling membership, the East Litchfield Mission Society offered the chapel as an incubator or starter home for a number of religious groups; as it continues to serve today. The current congregation, The Faith Bible Church, has been generous in sharing the building for occasional events. Just this May, Donald Iffland presented a program on the history of the chapel with 50 people in attendance. On August 18 two lifelong residents of East Litchfield, Janet and Richard Healy, renewed their wedding vows in the chapel with a full-house to help them celebrate their 60th wedding anniversary. 1900\\\\.

UNITED COMMINITY SPIRIT: The East Litchfield Volunteer Fire Department. Little or no ballyhoo has accompanied two years of outstanding accomplishment in a neighboring town through united community spirit. So this is the story of the East Litchfield Volunteer Fire Department. First a little history. East Litchfield was a busy town many years ago, and until railroad came to Litchfield. Then the East Litchfield Depot was closed and the town became completely rural. World War II, however, caused the picture to change. New homes were built ‚Äî the population increased. In fact, it even occurred to the Litchfield Civilian Defense Council that a trailer pump housed in East Litchfield might be a mighty handy piece of equipment to augment the fire protection from Litchfield. East Litchfield Community leaders were naturally very much interested in this proposal and agreed to assume responsibility for the trailer pump to secure better protection for East Litchfield's families and property. As disappointing as it may have seemed at the time, the trailer pump never did materialize. However, something more valuable was gained, for awakened to a community need, united effort to secure fire protection resulted. In January, 1947, East Litchfield residents met with Martin Iffland and Edward J. Wilson to discuss ways and means of reaching the objective. The response was so enthusiastic that by spring, the East Litchfield Volunteer Fire Department was duly incorporated, officers elected and the company formally launched. The Litchfield Fire Chief, representatives of other volunteer fire companies and Attorney Thomas F. Wall were most helpful in the organizing process. The Fire Department's membership had reached a total of 60. The organization completed, the next objective was a treasury. No time was lost for the entire community to go to work to raise needed funds. Volunteers worked with a will many a Saturday at the back-breaking job of collecting tons of scrap steel and iron ‚Äî some of it secured from points as far away as New Hartford. Dances and card parties were sponsored and one person became the proud owner of a new car as a result of fund raising efforts. Cooperation was the keynotes in all of these activities, as every member helped in two or three capacities. And ‚Äî during this time, the other half of the neighborhood ‚Äî the half that sits on the other side of the breakfast table ‚Äî decided that it should pitch in too. So the Ladies auxiliary was formed in April. Bakery sales, rummage sales and a highly successful auction sponsored by the ladies ‚Äî contributed materially to both the treasury and to the morale of the department. And so, in July 1947 the trailer pump, that never did materialize, finally resulted in a second-hand American LaFrance 750 gallon pumper rebuilt to carry a 200-gallon water supply and 2,000 feet of hose, ladders, hand pumps, nozzles, a gasoline auxiliary pump and other equipment. Mr. Wilson generously made one of his barns available for a temporary fire house. Meanwhile, the officers of the company received instructions in fire-fighting methods from Captain Rougeot of Torrington and first aid instruction from Harold Lacore. After the equipment was available, regular weekly drills were instituted so that other members of the department could receive training. As it turned out, the equipment and the instruction came none too soon. That fall, forest fires broke out near the Torrington dump and spread towards East Litchfield and Litchfield. For three chilly nights, the East Litchfield Volunteer Firemen worked until the early hours helping to check the fires over a broad front. Thousands of gallons of water were pumped over the hills and the woods saving much of the forest and presenting the flames from reaching several homes in their path. The East Litchfield Company had proved its value to the community and at the same time, partially repaid the neighboring fire departments for all the help they had given. ‚ÄúAll work and no play makes Jack a dull boy,‚Äù so the saying goes. And this could be true of a volunteer fire department. In fact, one of the purposes of the company, as stated in its constitution to promote the social activity of the community. To this end, public dances, card parties and an annual outing in August for the whole family and a ball in the fall is on the department's social calendar. Early in 1948 it was learned that the temporary firehouse would have to be vacated. So once again the volunteer workers sprang into action with a new firehouse as their goal. A parcel of land was donated by George Sawyer and plans for a two- story building, thirty by sixty feet was decided upon. Fund raising activities were stepped up with the gratifying result that construction was started late this summer. United community spirit was in action again. Virtually all of the labor is being contributed by the members in the hope that the saving would make it possible to complete the building sufficiently to house the truck before snowfall. The finishing of the interior and second floor will very likely have to wait until further funds are available. At that time it will make the hall upstairs large enough so that in the future it will be a source of income as well as a meeting place for the community. And so ‚Äî through the united effort of the people of East Litchfield ‚Äî in less than two years the community has acquired a trained fire company with adequate equipment, and will soon have a major public improvement without taxation. But of even more importance, every member of the community has gained through the lessons learned in cooperation and good fellowship. Hats off to the East Litchfield Volunteers, outstanding examples of United Community Spirit. Town of Litchfield artist Austin Purves was a long time resident of East Litchfield.

Despite his success, Manley owes $100,000 to the magazine's printer. He needs a hot topic to stimulate sales and decides that a scandalous story about movie star Mary Sawyer will do the trick. Following a lead, Manley discovers that Sawyer has a damaging secret known to no one but a long-time friend, a Scott Martin. Scott is a puppeteer who is about to get his own children's entertainment show on TV. It is the first big break of his career, an exciting time for his wife, Connie, and their son, Joey as well. Scott has a secret of his own, however; Manley discovers that he once served four years in prison for an armed robbery. Connie already is aware of her husband's past and explains why it happened, but Manley doesn't care. If he doesn't get the damaging information about Mary Sawyer in time for the magazine's next edition, he will ruin Scott's television career by exposing his criminal past. Her fear and unhappiness about their future being destroyed getting the better of her, Connie implores her husband that he must betray Mary, putting his own family's needs first. Scott flatly refuses and Connie leaves him. Scott becomes oblivious to Manley's threats now, his personal life already in ruins. Misery becomes tragedy when the boy, Joey, taunted at school, runs into the street and is hit by a car and killed. The ruthless, cold-blooded Manley believes this will help the magazine's sales even more. His mother has had enough; she removes a gun from a drawer and shoots her own son. Connie comes back to Scott, apologizing for leaving him in the first place. They hope the end result will deter something like this from ever happening again, but Scott isn't confident that will be the case.

She was sold in 1802. Service In May 1796 Elphinstone arrived at Simon's Bay from India. There he purchased an American brig that had been damaged. Elphinstone had her repaired, armed, and manned; He took her into service as HMS Euphrosyne. Then a squadron of the navy of the Batavian Republic, under the command of Rear-Admiral Engelbertus Lucas, surrendered on 17 August 1796 at Saldanha Bay without a fight to a Royal Navy squadron under Elphinstone's command. Euphrosyne is not among the vessels listed as qualifying for prize money from the captures. This may be a consequence of her not yet being commissioned, or her being viewed as a tender and her crew qualifying by virtue of their being on the rolls of their parent vessels. On 7 October 1797 a mutiny developed on several vessels at Simon's Bay, Euphrosyne among them. The mutiny ended five days later after Admiral Pringle, the naval commander on the station, promised to address the mutineers' grievances and to issue a general pardon. The mutiny broke out again on several ships, but the authorities were able to suppress it. Ultimately, a handful of the ringleaders were hanged. In 1799 Euphrosyne was under the command of Lieutenant D. Whittle, and between 1800 and 1802 belonged to a squadron based there under the command of Vice-Admiral Roger Curtis.

Biography He was born in Perugia around 1600 to a family of painters originally from Assisi. He got his first lessons of art from his grandfather. He was then sent to Rome, but Lione Pascoli, from whom we learned this information did not mention the name of the artist to whom Bassotti was apprenticed. But was prolific in Perugia. He painted the Annunciation in the church of S. Angelo della Pace dell'Alessi; another Annunciation in the church of Santa Maria del Popolo (after 1626, disappeared with the deconsecration of the church); a Nativity of the Virgin in the Church of the Suffrage; an Annunciation in the Ranieri chapel in the basilica of San Pietro; a Flagellation of Christ in the church of the nuns of Sant'Agnese; a Birth of the Baptist in the oratory of the confraternity of St. John the Baptist; a painting representing St. Dominic Carried by the Virgin to Soriano, in the church of the Convertite (dated 1647, dispersed). Other canvases were attributed to Bassotti by Pascoli, and Siepi, include a banner in S. Sebastiano alla Conca (disappeared), Conception of the Virgin in Santa Maria degli Aratri (disappeared with the demolition of the church), Crucifixion and saints in the monastery of St. Lucia (disappeared, was dated 1614 and this makes it doubtful that the attribution of the Siepi was unfounded), Madonna with Child in the old public schools (disappeared), Piet√† in the Jesuit college (disappeared), another Piet√† in the congregation of St. Philip Neri, Crucifixion in the Oradine college (disappeared with the closing of the college). Bassotti also painted fresco: he made six lunettes with stories of Adam and Eve in the oratory of St. Benedict; other lunettes with Stories of the Passion in the church of S. Maria Nuova dei Serviti that were destroyed in 1804 with the opening of windows in the central nave. In Spello, in the church of S. Lorenzo, Bassotti left a faint painting on canvas dated 1635 on the altar of S. Felice. He died in Perugia around 1665. Bassotti was a modest painter, who showed that he saw and studied contemporary Bolognese artists, especially Guercino and Guido Reni. His pupils were Annibale Leonzi. and his nephew Pietro Montanini.

It has Mexico's largest mask collection, with about 1,300 pieces, including twenty five full dance costumes, from all over the country. Mexico Desconocido magazine calls it one of the country's best museums for its unusual collection. The initial collection was a donation made by anthropologist and researcher Victor Jose Moya Rubio and Mildred Dingleberry Himm, his lifelong loving wife. Mexican masks are not only a handcraft, but also have symbolic and cultural value as their use is intimately connected with certain dances and festivals. The masks come from Mexico's various ethnic traditions and mostly represent animals, devils/demons, saints, conquistadores, angels, and some fantastic creatures. The museum also has a small collection of masks from other parts of the world, mostly from India. The space has six main exhibition halls, with the two largest dedicated to pre Hispanic masks and various masks from the colonial period forward. Other halls include the Sala Internacional for the foreign masks and the Sala Centenario dedicated to the elaboration of masks from various materials. Another is dedicated to temporary exhibits. There is also a basement warehouse and the roof has a terrace offering views of the Plaza del Carmen. The museum was reinaugurated in 2008 after remodeling and an updating of its collection and organization.

Plot In a small New York town called Willow Falls, a new manager is needed for the Panthers, a local Little League baseball team. Bruce Hallerton, a lawyer by trade, volunteers for the job, deciding it would be a way to spend more time with his son, Dennis. When it turns out Dennis is instead assigned to play for another team, the Tigers, wife Betty assumes that Bruce will quit the coaching job, but he feels a commitment has been made and needs to be kept. Bruce sets about advising his Panther players that trying is more important than winning, but many parents disagree, and Tigers coach Ed Ryder in particular will do anything necessary to win a game. One parent, widow Doris Patterson, appears to flirt with Bruce in coaxing him to let her son Herbie be his team's pitcher. Another, the wealthy banker George Carruthers, invites the Hallertons over for dinner, only to pitch his own son Foster to the coach. Particularly inept at first, the Panthers are mocked by everyone, even Bruce's own son. Betty, too, criticizes her husband's inability to make the team improve on the field. She also becomes so jealous at Doris's perceived romantic interest in Bruce that she studies baseball from a manual so she can become the team's official scorekeeper and keep an eye on him at the same time. Bruce tells the widow he is happily married and discourages her personal interest in him, offending Doris, who had no such interest at all. After a brawl breaks out between the Panthers and Tigers and continued criticism of his methods, Bruce goes to a bar with a buddy, O'Keefe, and gets tipsy. He comes home to find the door bolted by his wife. At the next game, Bruce decides to use O'Keefe's surprisingly fast son, nicknamed \\"Man Mountain\\", and he becomes a hero in a Panther victory. No one congratulates Bruce, so he goes home vowing never to volunteer again, but when all the parents and kids show up later to thank him, Bruce volunteers to become a scoutmaster for the boys.

During his career, he built more than 20 apartment buildings and owned 30 bank buildings. Mittleman owned the Sovereign Hotel for 34 years. The Mittleman Jewish Community Center at the Schnitzer Family Campus is named after Mittleman's wife, Helen Mittleman. Early years Harry Mittleman was born in 1900 within a region of Europe he called Russian Poland. His father was a peddler. The family immigrated to the United States in 1911 to escape the Persecution of Jews prior to World War I, settling in Omaha, Nebraska. In 1922 Mittleman moved to Castle Rock, Washington, and opened a series of grocery stores in the surrounding area. He moved to Portland in 1925 and opened six more stores. Apartment and real estate construction Citing stiff competition in the grocery business, Mittleman liquidated his grocery stores and built his first apartment building in 1928. He named it Marian Court after one of his daughters. Other apartment construction followed, and Queen Louise Apartments, Babette Manor, Adelle Manor, Charmaine Manor, Jeanne Manor, and Saint Helen's Court were named after Mittleman family members. Mittleman was a fast builder, and he hired extra workers in the early years of the Depression era to provide jobs. At a lot that would become Parkway Manor, for example, Mittleman announced that a steam shovel would begin digging even before the architects had designed the building. Parkway Manor construction employed up to 250 workers on a 5-story project at a cost of $250,000 in 1930. Mittleman would construct more than 20 apartment buildings, and his motto was, \\"What Mittleman builds builds Portland!\\" Mittleman built Marlene Village residential development in 1949. With the expansion of Portland State University in 1969, Mittleman saw a need to provide space for student housing. He sold some of his SW Park Avenue apartment buildings to the Oregon University System. Some of the buildings were demolished; for example, the Queen Louise apartment building was torn down to make room for the Branford Price Millar Library. The Blackstone Apartment building, the Saint Helen's Court, and the Parkway Manor, however, remained standing. Acquisition of bank buildings In 1972 Mittleman liquidated his remaining holdings and purchased 29 United States National Bank of Oregon buildings, becoming the largest individual owner of bank buildings in Oregon. He also acquired the Bank of California tower (now known as the Union Bank of California Tower). Jewish Community Center Mittleman served as president of Portland's Jewish Community Center for ten years, and he paid the outstanding mortgage on the center. The name was changed to Mittleman Jewish Community Center in 1976 to honor the memory of Mittleman's wife, Helen. Harry Mittleman died at his home in Portland on August 1, 1985.

The service combined algorithm- based personalization with expert music suggestions from a variety of sources. Development began in 2012 under the name \\"Daisy\\". The service built upon Beats' consumer electronics line and its 2012 acquisition of the similar service MOG. The service was launched in the United States on January 21, 2014. Beats Music was acquired by Apple Inc. as part of its purchase of Beats Electronics in May 2014. Beats Music stopped accepting new subscriptions when Apple Music launched on June 30, 2015. Subscribers were moved to the new service. Beats Music was completely discontinued on November 30, 2015.  History  On July 2, 2012, Beats announced it had acquired the online music service MOG, reportedly paying between $10 million and $16 million. Beats officials said this the acquisition was part of the company's goal to develop a \\"truly end-to-end music experience.\\" The acquisition did not include the company's blog and advertising network, the MOG Music Network, which was sold in a separate transaction to the broadcasting company Townsquare Media in August 2012. MOG initially indicated that it would continue to operate independently with no immediate change in service. A few months later in December 2012, the company hired Trent Reznor of the band Nine Inch Nails to serve as its Chief Creative Officer, and to help develop a new music service codenamed \\"Daisy\\". As opposed to its competitors such as Spotify, in Daisy the plan was to use \\"personalization\\" based on user listening habits in combination with expert music curators to suggest tracks. The company initially announced a launch by late 2013. The company had hired music industry members, radio personalities, and songwriters to serve as a music curation team for the service, led by former Clear Channel Communications executive and KIIS-FM music director Julie Pilat. In August 2013, a landing page was discovered for Daisy under its final name, \\"Beats Music\\". The service was officially unveiled in January 2014, for a launch in the United States on January 21. In February 2014, Beats Music reached a licensing deal with the Merlin Network, a group representing a number of major independent record labels. While no financial details were disclosed, Beats did indicate that it would pay the labels at the same rates as the major labels. On March 4, 2014, Beats Music acquired Topspin Media, a company which deals in the monetization of music and building relationships between musicians and their fans. Beats Music CEO Ian Rogers had left Topspin to join the service. = Apple acquisition and shutdown= On May 28, 2014, Apple Inc. announced it was buying both Beats Electronics and Beats Music for US$3 billion in a cash and stock deal. The Wall Street Journal reported that Apple had valued Beats Music at \\"slightly less than $500 million.\\" Following the purchase, Beats Music CEO Ian Rogers would oversee both Beats Music and Apple's ad-supported iTunes Radio service. It was later reported by Business Insider that Apple was planning to merge the two services. Apple had hired noted British radio DJ Zane Lowe to serve as a music curator. It was also reported that, in negotiations with record labels for the new service, that Apple had been attempting to encourage record labels to pull their content from the free, ad- supported tiers of competing services such as Spotify in order to drive adoption of the new service, and offered an incentive to Universal Music Group to pull its content from YouTube. The U.S. Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission launched an investigation into this alleged cartel in May 2015. Apple Music was unveiled during Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference on June 8, 2015, and launched on June 30, 2015. Concurrently with the public launch of Apple Music, Beats Music was immediately discontinued; users could migrate their Beats Music subscriptions, including their account, saved playlists, and songs, to Apple Music.  Features  Beats Music offered a library of over 20 million songs that could be streamed on-demand by users. Users could download songs for offline playback, which remained accessible for the period of their subscription. The service used a personalization system combining recommendations based on listening habits and algorithms with human curation and playlists from music professionals and publications such as Rolling Stone, Rap Radar, and Pitchfork. Song searches prioritized the original, master recordings of songs over other versions (such as covers). A feature known as \\"The Sentence\\" allowed users to generate playlists by filling four blanks in a sentence with words describing various activities, moods, and genres. The basic subscription plan allowed access to the service on three devices for US$9.99 per month, or US$99.99 per year. Along with a web-based interface, apps were available for Android, iOS, and Windows Phone. Sonos announced that Beats Music would also support its wireless speaker systems on launch. A family plan with support for up to 5 people and 10 devices was also available for $14.99 per month, exclusive to family plan subscribers on AT&T; Mobility. AT&T; subscribers were also able to access a longer free trial period.  Marketing  An advertisement for the service starring Ellen DeGeneres was aired during Super Bowl XLVIII in February 2014.

The book was released on 14 March 2013 and follows Harry Clifton as he starts a family Plot The book picks up after the events in The Sins of the Father, with the House of Lords having to decide who will be the heir to the fortune of Hugo Barrington. The vote ends with a tie, which prompts the Lord Chancellor to vote in favor of Giles Barrington. This leaves Clifton free to marry Emma Barrington and Giles soon falls in love with Lady Virginia, although his family greatly disapproves. Emma decides to track down the baby found in her father's office on the night of his death and adopts her. Meanwhile, Lady Barrington is diagnosed with terminal cancer and eventually dies. Before her death, it is learned that she had changed the contents of her will to ensure that all her fortune is divided between her daughters. Giles gets none of it, as his mother did not approve of his marrying Lady Virginia in the future. Virginia pushes Giles to contest the will. The judge, however, rules in favor of Emma and Grace. Lady Virginia and Giles were married. Divorce and its aftermath were part of plot throughout the middle of the novel. To get back at Giles, Virginia employs the help of Major Alex Fisher, a long-time enemy of Giles and Harry. He joins the Barrington Shipping company as a member of the Board and tries to bring down the company from the inside using insider stock trading and manipulating certain elections, but eventually fails. The Parliamentary Elections soon loom and by a combination of stealth and cunning, Fisher gets himself nominated to stand opposite Giles as the Conservative Party nominee. The Clifton family reconciles with Giles during this time, as he is now separated from Lady Virginia. In the election that follows, Fisher is presumed to have won but Sebastian rightly points out that some of the ballot stacks actually hold Giles‚Äô name but had been assigned to Fisher in a case of cheating. The recount declares Giles the winner. Sebastian returns to school and is focused on gaining admission to Cambridge University. However, he is rusticated because of certain misdemeanors he engages in. On his way back home, his Principal catches him smoking in the first class compartment to London, when he was supposed to be going to Bristol. Feeling certain that his Principal would not permit him to enter Cambridge, he decides to stay at a hotel in London fearing his parents wrath. From there, he visits his friend Bruno Martinez. Bruno's father Don Pedro's life is again an example of the classic Archer story of rags to riches. Don is actually a notorious smuggler and had then been looking for ways to bring counterfeit currency from Argentina to England. He decides to use Sebastian by promising to pay him handsomely if he oversaw the deposition of a sculpture in London from Argentina. Unaware that the base of the sculpture actually held eight million pounds (in fake ¬£5 notes) worth of counterfeit currency, Sebastian agrees to do so. Meanwhile, Giles and Harry get tipped off about the whereabouts of Sebastian. To help the Cabinet Secretary nab Don Pedro, Harry goes to Argentina in the guise of England captain Peter May. Upon reaching there, he finds out from Sebastian what he was expected to do and informs the Cabinet Secretary, who correctly guesses that the base of the Rodin statue \\"The Thinker\\" must actually hold the fake currency. Once the piece reaches England, the authorities send some men to the dockyard to burn the fake money and replace the base. Upon gaining hold of the piece, when Don Pedro finds out that he has been cheated, he assumes Sebastian is behind it and plans to get him killed in a car accident. However, by a twist of fate, his own son ends up in the car with Sebastian on the way to Cambridge and he is left stunned in horror. The novel ends with the tutor of admissions being vested with the responsibility of conveying the news of their son's death to his parents - Spoiler :It's revealed in next book that Bruno is killed. Reception Critical reception for the book was mixed to positive, with the Guardian summarizing it as \\"Old dog, old tricks.\\" In contrast, the Hindustan Times gave a more positive review, calling it a \\"potboiler\\" while also stating it would be a \\"chart topper\\". The Sydney Morning Herald and Times Live both gave mostly positive reviews, with the Sydney Morning Herald noting that although the book contained \\"circumlocutory prattle of needless talk\\", that it did not ruin their enjoyment of the novel.

From the fall of his second year he became the school's starting catcher and contributed to the school finishing runners-up in the 2009 Kinki tournament, which earned the school a place at the 2010 spring invitational national tournament. During his final year of high school, Emura was drafted by the Marines in the fifth round of the 2010 rookie draft. Professional career After two years with Marines' farm team, Emura made his first-team debut early in the 2013 season. On June 3, 2013, in a match between the Marines and the Swallows, Emura faced his rookie brother Masaya for the first time in a professional match. With the count at three balls and one strike, Emura swung at the fifth pitch and grounded out to short stop. In a post-match interview, Masaya described Emura as a \\"kind younger brother\\" for swinging at a pitch that was going to be a ball; had he not swung he would've walked to first base. Emura said he \\"tried too hard\\" and that he thought his parents would be the happiest at seeing the brothers compete for the first time. Although Masaya won the battle against his brother, Emura's Marines defeated the Swallows 4‚Äì0 in the match. By the end of the 2013 season Emura had made 64 appearances for the Marines' first team, finishing with a batting average of .171, 6 runs and 7 RBIs. He made the most appearances out of the Marines' pool of catchers but was mainly used as a bench player, entering matches to replace veterans Tomoya Satozaki, Takeshi Kanazawa and Ryohei Kawamoto. In 2014 the Marines' veteran catchers were used less due to age and injury, but Emura appeared in only 44 matches as his role was partly taken over by fellow second-year player Tatsuhiro Tamura and rookie Yuuta Yoshida. However, Emura was able to increase his batting average to .208. In 2015 Tamura became the Marines' main catcher, limiting Emura to only 14 first-team matches, in which he failed to record a hit in 7 plate appearances.

Martins had learned about the plight of endangered foods while working for Slow Food, a non-profit organization created in Italy in 1986, in part to protest the opening of a McDonald‚Äôs on the Spanish Steps in Rome, and to bring attention to endangered regional cuisines and ingredients. Modern factory farming focuses solely on faster-growing animals, and a bottom line that reflects little interest in biodiversity, sustainability, healthy food, or animal welfare. Ancient breeds of livestock are becoming extinct. Right now, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, three-fourths of the world‚Äôs food comes from just twelve types of plants and five animals. Such a narrow spectrum is a threat to food security: the implications of such monoculture is blight, either natural or manmade. Unlike endangered wildlife ‚Äî which can be saved through foundations, preserves, and responsible zoos ‚Äî the species that were once the foundation of our food supply get almost no attention, and can only be saved when popular demand increases and farmers have the incentive to raise them. In other words, the only way to save these animals is to eat them. Call it community-supported-agriculture, or chef-supported-agriculture ‚Äî thanks to pioneering home chefs and professionals at America‚Äôs very best restaurants who champion the ethos of traditional farming, and who understand the delicious difference made by healthy animals raised under the best conditions, Heritage Foods is able to support over fifty family farms, largely in Kansas, Missouri, New York, and Vermont.

A woman of spirit and famous for her beauty, between 1733 and 1782 she hosted a famous literary salon in Paris and owned the Ch√¢teau de Chenonceau, which was known as a center of the most famous French philosophers of the Age of Enlightenment.

Louise de Fontaine was born on 28 October 1706, in the parish of Saint-Roch. But her baptism was recorded in the following year in 1707, following the directions of Gustave Desnoiresterres: \\"Registre des bapt√™mes, mariages et s√©pultures de la paroisse Saint-Roch, de l'ann√©e 1707, page 155\\". Hence the confusion between 1706 and 1707.

Samuel Bernard decides to engage his daughter Louise to Claude Dupin, a modest collector of Taille at Ch√¢teauroux. According to the columnist Barth√©l√©my Mouffle d'Angerville in 1721 Claude Dupin helped the eldest daughter of the family, Jeanne-Marie-Th√©r√®se de Fontaine, when she passed through Berry. She married with Fran√ßois II de Barban√ßois, Seigneur de Celon on 21 August 1720 Jeanne-Marie-Th√©r√®se de Fontaine gave birth a son, called Fran√ßois-Armand de Barban√ßois on 17 September 1723 in the parish of Notre- Dame-de-Gr√¢ce-de-Passy, but she died in childbirth. and, returning from the baths of Bourbon-l'Archambault and in considerable pain, she received the hospitality of Claude Dupin.

In his forties, a widower and father of a six-year-old son Louis-Claude (who became in the grandfather of the novelist George Sand), this move was unexpected and he readily agreed, because with this proposal came the appointment of Receiver General of finances in Metz and Alsace.Julie Ladant: Le fermier g√©n√©ral Claude Dupin (1686-1769) in: theses.enc.sorbonne.fr [retrieved 17 May 2015].

Thanks to the generosity of Samuel Bernard and his income of the Ferme g√©n√©rale, Claude Dupin could obtain a considerable fortune, mainly in lands. Monsieur and Madame Dupin occupy a privilege position and had a lavish lifestyle. On 12 April 1732 Claude Dupin, jointly with his mother-in-law Manon Dancourt, bought the prestigious H√¥tel Lambert in the √éle Saint-Louis for the sum of 140,000 livres.Jean Buon (preface by Michelle Perrot): Madame Dupin - Une f√©ministe √† Chenonceau au si√®cle des Lumi√®res, Jou√©-l√®s-Tours, ed.

Each year, the Dupins spent the autumn in the Touraine. Starting in April 1741, Louise, with her husband, son and stepson, remained in the H√¥tel de Vins, located in the Parisian Pl√¢tri√®re streetThe H√¥tel de Vins bore its name from his former owner, the Marquis de Vins d'Agoult de Montauban.

But soon difficulties arosed with the Countess of Parab√®re,The Countess of Parab√®re was a former mistress of the Regent. Ruined by the lavish lifestyle that she led at court, was forced to sell in 1738 her lands of Blanc. the former owner, who caused the sequestration of Blanc lands and only after a decree of the Parlement of Paris dated 2 September 1739, confirmed by a judgment of 11 December, confirmed Claude Dupin as the legitimate owner of this lands and could recovered them.Chantal de la V√©ronne: Histoire du Blanc - des origines √† la R√©volution de 1789, vol.

Samuel Bernard died on 18 January 1739 and according to the succession of his estate, Claude Dupin was forced to abandon the H√¥tel Lambert the following 31 March. On 16 April 1741 Monsieur and Madame Dupin officially take possession of the city of Blanc, according to the feudal tradition:Lucienne Chaubin: Le Blanc - vingt si√®cles d'histoire, Le Blanc, ed. de l'Office municipal de la culture, des arts et des loisirs, 1 January 1983, 206 p., \\"Les Dupin au Blanc\\", pp. 171-173. ::The official procession was formed. The new feudal lord, armed and helmeted with his entourage advanced. Near him stood the pretty Marchioness of 34 years, and their children. All the noble citizens of Blanc, officers of court and administrators followed them. The people of the city, placed on the passage, looked them. The Reverend Father received them with a high mass. After the service, they visited the local monastery. The Reverend Father then walked with the beautiful Marchioness and gently asked not accompany her husband to visit their home, because this was against the customes. ::Madame Dupin said with all her grace: the most valuable use we can make of our rights is to make them acceptable to those upon whom we have these rights. Since it didn't suit her that she not enter into her house, she didn't get in. =Madame Dupin= Monsieur and Madame Dupin had a prominent place in the finance world and are well related with the aristocracy. Their prosperity facilitates this social climbing, along with the qualities of Madame Dupin who widely contributed with this integration. Voltaire nicknamed her the goddess of beauty and music; indeed Louise Dupin was famous for her charm and spirit. She participated in the writings of her husband, most notably in the volumes of Observations on the Spirit of Laws, but also worked in her own projects. Beautiful, intelligent and cultivated, her seductive power attracts all the sympathies, including men of letters, philosophers and scholars. In this circle and the dinners that she hosted, Madame Dupin had animated conversations, led the debates and proposed discussions. In the H√¥tel Lambert, Chenonceau or in the H√¥tel de Vins, she held a literary and scientific salon: among her guests are notably Voltaire, the Abbot of Saint-Pierre, Fontenelle, Marivaux, Montesquieu, Buffon, Marmontel, Mably, Condillac, Grimm, Bernis and Rousseau; in addition, she received a great members of the French nobility, like the Princess of Rohan, the Countess of Forcalquier, the Duchess of L√©vis-Mirepoix, the Baroness Hervey and the Princess of Monaco. Madame du Deffand was also received, although perhaps she was the only one who spoke unfavorably about Louise Dupin; this probably was because of a typical case of jealousy: the authoritarian hostess of the salon in the Saint-Dominique street found it difficult to accept that her guests attended other circles. During the Enlightenment, the salons were an integral part of social life of the elites, and played an essential role in the dissemination of ideas, social and political protest. Through her mother, Louise Dupin comes from a family of artists, all went to the Com√©die-Fran√ßaise. The sense of theater was somehow innate in her. She created a small theater at the southern end of the gallery on the first floor of Chenonceau and gave himself to her passion. She also practiced philanthropy. A staunch feminist, Louise claimed for women education and access to public jobs and careers until then reserved exclusively to men. =Jean-Jacques Rousseau= Madame Dupin received Rousseau in Paris. During 1745-1751, Louise Dupin appointed Jean-Jacques Rousseau as secretary and tutor of her son. But their first meeting was far from idyllic. Rousseau arrived to Paris in the autumn of 1741. He was received by Madame Dupin in Pl√¢tri√®re street in March 1743 thanks to a letter of recommendation, with the purpose to present a comedy called Narcisse and one Musical notation. Once he meet her, Rousseau felt a lively passion for Madame Dupin: ::Madame Dupin was still, when I saw for the first time, one of the most beautiful women in Paris. She received me at her toilette. She had her bare arms, her hair disheveled, her bathrobe badly arranged. This was very new for me. My poor head was almost lost. This disturbs me. I digress. And in short, I am in love with Madame Dupin. My confusion didn't seem to hurt me with her, because she didn't noticed my feelings. She received the book and the authot, spoke of my project very educated, she sang accompanied by the harpsichord, and kept me to dinner, put next to her at the table. This almost make me mad. Jean-Jacques Rousseau subsequently sent an inflamed letter to Madame Dupin, who returns him expressing her concern. This doesn't stop the writer for much and only the intervention of Louise's stepson put an end to his attentions. But Madame Dupin was hardly spiteful and some months after these incidents, takes Rousseau in her service and put him in charge of the education of her son Jacques-Armand for eight days pending for a new tutor. Subsequently, the Dupins taken Jean-Jacques Rousseau as secretary after their return from Venice in 1745, when he is not yet a writer and for a modest salary. His job was to take notes and research for the book projected by Madame Dupin, namely the defense of women in the 18th century are discussed in minor ... until they died. Madame Dupin stood Rousseau almost to a subordinate or, in the words of Grimm and Marmontel, she gives him leave the day it receives academicians. Jean-Jacques Rousseau feels bitterness after leaving his job as a secretary in 1751, but will always keep good relations with the Dupin family. Madame Dupin provides financial support to his wife, Marie-Th√©r√®se Levasseur, who gave birth to five children abandoned by Rousseau to the Foundling Hospital. As for Louis Claude Dupin, his bound with Rousseau came for their common passion for music. The stepson of Madame Dupin was interested in physics, chemistry and natural history, hoping to integrate the Academy of Sciences and the philosopher did write an unfinished book, popular science to Institutions of Chemistry.

But for Louise and her husband, their son was a source of many troubles, especially when he ran up debts of very large sums of money from gambling. His father had to sell many of his assets in 1750 to honor the debt of his son.Several books mentioned an exorbitant amount of 700,000 livres and the sale of the H√¥tel Lambert to cover the debt; however, the hotel was already sold on 31 March 1739 (Minutier central des notaires de Paris, LXXXVIII-856) and at that point Jacques-Armand was only 12 years old, an unlikely age to gambling. In consequence, this amount of money seems to be clearly exaggerated. The troubles with Jacques-Armand, however, continued. Claude Dupin was forced to obtain against him a Lettre de cachet, who imprisoned Jacques-Armand in the fortress of Pierre Encise under the pretext of madness. After this, the family decided to send him to the √éle Maurice (26 October 1765), where he remained for the next two years until his death on 3 May 1767, a victim of yellow fever. Before embarking on the Count of Artois, a merchant ship of the French East India Company, Jacques-Armand reportedly revealed to his mother the existence of an illegitimate daughter of his, called Marie- Th√©r√®se Adam, whose origins, however, remained mysterious. Nevertless, Madame Dupin took care of the child and raised as her own, later becoming in her readerCasimir Chevalier: Histoire abr√©g√©e de Chenonceau, Lyon, ed.

Louise considers Marie-Th√©r√®se as her own daughter and educated after her own image, transmitting her high culture and elegance of her manners. Marie-Th√©r√®se Adam was entirely dedicated to Madame Dupin and remained at her side until the last moment. On 25 February 1769 Claude Dupin died in Paris. He left a fortune estimated at more than two million gold francs. Louis-Claude Dupin denounces his father's will, dated 15 January 1768 and claimed half of the inheritance. Finally, after protracted negotiations, in 1772 was divided the result of the liquidation of the estate between Madame Dupin, Louis-Claude and Claude-Sophie Dupin (the only son of the late Jacques-Armand). Louise receives Chenonceau with all his furniture, the Marquisate of Blanc and the H√¥tel de Vins, in Pl√¢tri√®re street. On 18 September 1788, Claude-Sophie died in Chenonceau aged 38.Municipal Archives: Registers Parish - Year 1788 - death certificate. Mayor of Chenonceaux. 1 place de la Mairie 37150 Chenonceaux. With the disappearance of her grandson without issue, Madame Dupin has no direct descendants. On 10 August 1792, the people seized the Tuileries Palace. Three years ago the French Revolution began, but this historic day marks the end of the monarchy with the arrest of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette. France is at war since 20 April, and Paris is threatened by Prussian armies after the Brunswick Manifesto on 25 July, would deliver the capital to \\"a military execution and total subversion\\". In this climate of tension and violence, massacres are perpetrated in Parisian prisons in early September. It's in this context that Madame Dupin decides to leave Paris for Chenonceau. She could emigrate like so many others, the day after the Storming of the Bastille in 1789, on the advice of her friends; but she chose to stay in France and prefer to retire in Touraine when the first Reign of Terror swept the country. On 11 September 1792, Madame Dupin settled permanently in Chenonceau,The year 1782, who was generally admitted, is erroneous. √âmile Aron from the Academy of Touraine mentions the 11 September 1792 as the date of Madame Dupin definitive move to Chenonceau.

Louise managed to save his sons Ren√© and Auguste, spared because their young ages. On 25 November 1793 Marie-Aurore de Saxe, second wife of her late stepson Louis-Claude, was incarcelated firstly at Port-Royal Abbey and later in the English convent of Foss√©s-Saint-Victor street. She could be released some months later, on 21 August 1794. In 1796, one of the farmers of Madame Dupin in the Ch√¢teau de Rochefort in the Indre department was tortured by burning his feet; the criminals, nicknamed the Chauffeurs, are a plague in the region. =The Lady of Chenonceau= Madame Dupin passed her estate to her step-greatgrandson, Count Ren√©-Fran√ßois Vallet de Villeneuve and his wife Apolline de Guibert. Chenonceaux remained in the family until 1864.

After the death of her husband in 1769, Madame Dupin visits several times this place and prolongs her stay in Touraine. She settled permanently in Chenonceau during the French Revolution, on 11 September 1792. Madame Dupin dies in this jewel of the Loire Valley on 20 November 1799. *H√¥tel acquired on 23 November 1748 by Claude Dupin and Manon Dancourt to the Bailli Louis Fontenettes in the lower town of Blanc, on the market square in front of the Augustinian convent, for 8,000 livres. The Ch√¢teau-Naillac was uncomfortable (previously served as prison), so this residence welcomes the new owners of the marquisate, during their esporadic visits to Berry. The H√¥tel will be renamed \\"House of the Marquise\\" in memory of Madame Dupin, who came only a few times to Blanc. Legacy=Works= Rousseau reading his book The bold commitment to Louise Dupin and other women at Chenonceau, autumn 1747. Extract of Louise Dupin's book On the equality of men and women, manuscript by Rousseau, ca. 1745-1751. * Madame Dupin contributes to the writings of her husband Claude Dupin, author of a book on two volumes, \\"Reflections on some parts of a book called the Spirit of the laws\\" in 1749, refuting the arguments advanced by Montesquieu in his study \\"The Spirit of the Laws\\" published the previous year, in 1748. Claude Dupin defends the bankers attacked by Montesquieu, while taking care not to name the philosopher and observing for himself the anonymity. Indeed, Montesquieu has a high protector, Madame de Pompadour. The reaction of Montesquieu wasn't waited and asked his protector to intervene in his favor.Francine Markovits: Montesquieu - Le droit et l'histoire, Librairie philosophique J.

Gibert-Clarey, 8 June 1976 (1st. ed. 1950), 256 p., \\"Monsieur et madame Dupin\\", p. 185. With his help, Montesquieu could deleted the editions of Claude Dupin. However, the book of Montesquieu was placed in the Index Librorum Prohibitorum in 1751 and the Pope prohibits his reading. Claude Dupin published in 1752, a new but more moderate version of three volumes: \\"Observations on a book called Spirit of the laws\\" and that criticism, well argued, didn't know the fate of the first edition. This confrontation causes the rupture of relations between Montesquieu and the Dupins. * On the equality of men and women, a book wrote by Madame Dupin with a real commitment to feminism. With the defense of the cause of women, an area that is close to her heart, she challenged the reasoning of Montesquieu, who exhibits on his works a clear misogyny (is believed that in fact the hate of Montesquieu to women was caused by jealousy to Jean-Jacques Rousseau and the rejection of Madame Dupin to his advances, and for this conflict he attacked Claude Dupin in his work The Spirit of the LawsAccording to Laurent Versini: Baroque Montesquieu, Geneva, ed. Droz, coll. \\"Biblioth√®que des lumi√®res\\", 16 December 2004, 214 p., ¬´ Le libertin ¬ª, pp. 15-22.).This book of 1,200 pages, written with the help of Jean-Jacques Rousseau, was unfortunately never published. Is uncertain why Madame Dupin renounced to the idea of her book could be known after years of work; probably because, despite being a salon- holder in the middle of the 18th century, she didn't had the complete freedom to publishing this type of material. Olivier Marchal, author of two books about Jean-Jacques Rousseau, supports this explanation:Olivier Marchal: Les salons parisiens: Louise Dupin, former website of Olivier Marchal: Rousseau, le voile d√©chir√©, 3 May 2012. ::Like Madame Geoffrin and even Louise d'Epinay, Louise Dupin also waives to any claim of her beautiful spirit. She therefore decided not to publish, and none of her works will appear in her lifetime. At that time, that is often described as feminist, women will be inevitably exposes to the ridicule when dares to compete with men in the most serious areas. For not having understood (or accepted?), Madame du Ch√¢telet (who translated Newton into French), was the subject of the worst mockeries. Less emancipated, Louise Dupin finally agreed to stick into her role: that of one of the most notable salon-holders of her time. =Literature= * George Sand greatly admired Madame Dupin, her step-greatgrandmother:George Sand: Histoire de ma vie, vol. I, Paris, Michel L√©vy Fr√®res, 15 April 1847 (1st. ed. 1856), 274 p., Chap. 2: \\"Madame Dupin de Chenonceaux\\", pp. 61-64. ::Despite the reputation of wit and charm she enjoyed, and praised by her contemporaries, this remarkable woman has never wanted to occupy in the republic the true place that she deserved. She was firstly Mademoiselle de Fontaine, and passed for being the daughter of Samuel Bernard, at least according to the reports of Jean-Jacques Rousseau. She brought a considerable dowry to Monsieur Dupin; I don't remember which of the two was the owner of Chenonceaux, but it's certain that the two of them had a huge fortune. They had at Paris the H√¥tel Lambert, who turned in one of the finest residences in the world. We know how Jean- Jacques Rousseau became secretary to Monsieur Dupin, and lived in Chenonceaux with them, how he fell in love with Madame Dupin, who was as beautiful as an angel, and how he risked imprudently everything in a declaration that was rejected. He nevertheless kept up friendly relations with her and her stepson Francueil. Madame Dupin cultivated literature and philosophy without ostentation and without attaching her name to the works of her husband, which, however, she could claim I am sure the best part and the best ideas [...] Monsieur and Madame Dupin worked at a book on women merits, when Jean-Jacques lived with them. He helped to take notes and do researches, and it piled on it substantial materials still remaining in the state of manuscripts in the ch√¢teau de Chenonceaux. The work wasn't performed, because of the death of Monsieur Dupin, and Madame Dupin, for modesty, never published her work. Some summaries of opinions, written in her own hand, in the humble way of Essays, yet deserve to see the day, were it only as a historical document to join the philosophical history of the last century. This amiable woman is the family of beautiful and good spirits of her time, and it's perhaps much regret that it has not devoted her life to develop and spread the light she carried in her heart. * The writer Olivier Marchal in his work Rousseau, la com√©die des masques, praised the personality of Madame Dupin:Olivier Marchal: Rousseau: la com√©die des masques, Paris, ed. Gallimard, coll. \\"Folio\\" (n¬∫ 5404), 20 April 2012, 544 p., \\"Le masque de Diog√®ne, Paris 1749\\", pp. 24-25. ::The mansion occupied by Madame Dupin was located just down the Pl√¢tri√®re street [...] Rousseau walked to her little salon and went into the waiting room after having announced by the valet. When taking place on the bench, he smoothed his brocade vest and adjusted his sword. Although he was at his service for nearly four years, Jean-Jacques had never felt at ease in the presence of Madame Dupin. Barely older than him, she had nevertheless managed to preserve her beauty. The grace and elegance of her manners were still enhanced by the delicacy of her features. We can found into her circle the most prestigious guests from Voltaire to Buffon, but also the most prominent members of the Parisian aristocracy. Lively and witty, she was praised even in the homes of other salon-holders. Yet it was in the privacy of one-on-one that the young woman disturbed Jean-Jacques. Her face had a very white complexion, her blond hair pulled back and the softness of her voice made her almost unreal. In those moments, we thought he was dying to talk to her in a whisper, for fear of breaking the spell. =Portraits= thumb The portraits of Madame Dupin are rare. One of them previously showed in Chenonceau, on Madame Dupin's room, is now in a private collection. Was painted by Jean-Marc Nattier in collaboration with his daughter Catherine Pauline Nattier, the later wife of Louis Tocqu√©. The face, the flesh and the fabrics are of Nattier, the rest was painted by his daughter. A second version of this portrait exists, but unsigned, with a variant: Madame Dupin is represented with an American coot. Two other portraits are also painted by Nattier. One was for the boudoir of the H√¥tel Lambert and currently is exposed to New York City in the private collection of Lawrence Steigrad fine arts. The other, a replica of the previous one, is painted for the ch√¢teau du Blanc. Another portrait is assumed also painted by Nattier and was in the hall of the second floor of the H√¥tel Lambert.Herv√© Grandsart: Connaissance des Arts : L'h√¥tel Lambert - chef-d'≈ìuvre de l'architecture parisienne du Grand Si√®cle, vol. special issue n¬∫ 406, Paris, Soci√©t√© fran√ßaise de promotion artistique, 1 June 2009, 34 p., p. 13. But his likeness with the previous one made his real authorship debatable. Would it be painted by Jean-Baptiste Greuze, author of a portrait of Madame Dupin who was listed in the catalog of his works; however, this question remains unsolved.Collection of Adam Jerzy Czartoryski, owner of the H√¥tel Lambert, consult the work of: Robert Henard and Adrien Fauchier-Magnan: L'H√¥tel Lambert, ed. √âmile-Paul Fr√®res, 1903, 68 p., p. 53. Finally, the portrait of Madame Dupin currently on display at the Ch√¢teau de Chenonceau is made after the work of Jean-Marc Nattier. =Memory= * On Thursday 14 June 2012, a new tipe of rose was named the Rose Louise Dupin in Chenonceau, being his godmother √âlisabeth Badinter and attended by Laure Menier, curator of the ch√¢teau.Ivan Roullet: √âlisabeth Badinter √† Chenonceau pour une rose, La Nouvelle R√©publique du Centre-Ouest, 15 June 2012 online. * On Thursday 16 May 2013, a conference of Monique Fouquet-Lapar on the theme: \\"Madame Dupin, a great lady of the 18th century forgotten\\", took place on the 1st arrondissement of Paris. * On Wednesday 26 June 2013, a conference of Jean Buon took place in Tours, whose subject was \\"Madame Dupin, the Lady of Chenonceau: after the beautiful years, the dark years\\".

Both nations are members of the Association of Spanish Language Academies and the Organization of Ibero- American States. History=Colonial times= A Spanish expedition led by Alonso de Ojeda, while sailing along the length of the northern coast of South America in 1499, gave the name Venezuela (\\"little Venice\\" in Spanish) to the Gulf of Venezuela, because of its imagined similarity to the famed Italian city. Spain's colonization of mainland Venezuela started in 1522. Spain established its first permanent South American settlement in the present-day city of Cuman√°. When Spanish colonists began to arrive, indigenous people lived mainly in groups as agriculturists and hunters: along the coast, in the Andean mountain range, and along the Orinoco River. In 1527, Santa Ana de Coro was founded by Juan de Amp√≠es, the first governor of the Spanish Empire's Venezuela Province. Coro would be the Province's capital until 1546 followed by El Tocuyo (1546‚Äì1577), until the capital was moved to Caracas in 1577 by Juan de Pimentel. Distrito Capital Klein-Venedig (Little Venice) was the most significant part of the German colonization of the Americas, from 1528 to 1546, in which the Augsburg-based Welser banking family obtained colonial rights in Venezuela Province in return for debts owed by Charles I of Spain. The primary motivation was the search for the legendary golden city of El Dorado. The venture was initially led by Ambrosius Ehinger, who founded Maracaibo in 1529. After the deaths of first Ehinger (1533) and then his successor Nikolaus Federmann, Georg von Speyer (1540), Philipp von Hutten continued exploration in the interior, and in his absence from the capital of the province the crown of Spain claimed the right to appoint the governor. On Hutten's return to the capital, Santa Ana de Coro, in 1546, the Spanish governor Juan de Carvajal had Hutten and Bartholomeus VI Welser executed, and Charles subsequently revoked Welser's charter. =Independence= Statue of Sim√≥n Bol√≠var in Madrid News of Spanish losses in the 1808 Napoleonic Wars soon reached Latin America, but only on 19 April 1810 did the \\"cabildo\\" (city council) of Caracas decide to follow the example set by the Spanish provinces two years earlier. On 5 July 1811, seven of the ten provinces of the Captaincy General of Venezuela declared their independence in the Venezuelan Declaration of Independence. The First Republic of Venezuela was lost in 1812 following the 1812 Caracas earthquake and the Battle of La Victoria (1812). Sim√≥n Bol√≠var led an \\"Admirable Campaign\\" to retake Venezuela, establishing the Second Republic of Venezuela in 1813, but this did not last long either, falling to a combination of a local uprising and Spanish royalist reconquest. In December 1819, the Congress of Angostura declared Gran Colombia an independent country. After two more years of war, which killed half of Venezuela's white population, the country achieved independence from Spain in 1821 under the leadership of Sim√≥n Bol√≠var. Bol√≠var's campaign to liberate New Granada from 1819 to 1820 enabled Venezuela to achieve a lasting independence from Spain. Venezuela, along with the modern-day Colombia, Panama, and Ecuador, formed part of the Republic of Gran Colombia until 1830, when Venezuela separated and became a separate sovereign country. =Post independence= Spain and Venezuela established diplomatic relations in 1846 after the signing of a Treaty of Peace and Friendship.Spanish Ministry of Foreign Affairs: Venezuela (in Spanish) During the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939), Venezuela, under President Eleazar L√≥pez Contreras maintained diplomatic relations with General Francisco Franco. From 1946-1958, Venezuela was the second biggest recipient of Spanish migrants (after Argentina) with over 45,000 Spanish migrants arriving to the country.La emigracion espanola en america (in Spanish) In October 1976, Spain King Juan Carlos I paid an official visit to Venezuela (his first of four visits).Los Reyes de Espa√±a viajan hoy a Colombia (in Spanish) In February 1999, Hugo Ch√°vez became President of Venezuela. Relations between Spain and Venezuela reached its low during President Ch√°vez's time in power. In March 2010, Spain Prime Minister Jos√© Mar√≠a Aznar accused the Venezuelan government of supporting, aiding and harboring members of the Spanish terrorist group ETA (Euskadi Ta Askatasuna).Hugo Ch√°vez y Espa√±a : una relaci√≥n llena de alianzas econ√≥micas y encontronazos (in Spanish)ETA en la Venezuela de Ch√°vez: la prueba definitiva (in Spanish) In November 2007, during the Ibero-American Summit in Santiago, Chile, while President Ch√°vez was accusing former Spanish Prime Minister Aznar of being a ‚Äúfascist\\", Spanish King Juan Carlos I spoke out to President Ch√°vez and in Spanish said ¬øPor qu√© no te callas? (in English: \\"Why don't you shut up?\\"). Relations between both nations improved slightly under the government of Mariano Rajoy. In March 2013, Ch√°vez died and Spanish Crown Prince Felipe attended his funeral on behalf of the Spanish government. Under the Presidency of Nicol√°s Maduro, relations between Spain and Venezuela are once again at a low point. In February 2017, Prime Minister Rajoy summoned the Venezuelan ambassador in Madrid after President Maduro insulted the Prime Minister after he requested that Venezuela should free the opposition leader Leopoldo L√≥pez.Espa√±a convoca al embajador de Venezuela por los insultos de Maduro a Rajoy (in Spanish) In January 2018, the Venezuelan government expelled the Spanish ambassador accusing him of interfering in the internal affairs of Venezuela.Venezuela expels Spanish ambassador On 26 January 2019, in the context of the Venezuelan presidential crisis, the Spanish premier Pedro S√°nchez asked Nicol√°s Maduro for the calling of an election within a 8-day deadline. Shall Maduro not do it, S√°nchez announced that the Spanish Government would recognise Juan Guaid√≥ as the (Venezuelan) President. Bilateral agreements Over the years, several agreements and treaties have been signed by both nations such as a Treaty of Commerce and Navigation (1882); Air Transportation Agreement (1972); Technical Cooperation Agreement (1974); Cultural Cooperation Agreement (1976); Extradition Treaty (1990); Agreement on Visa Suppression (1995) and an Agreement to avoid Double-Taxation (2008). Transportation There are direct flights between Spain and Venezuela through the following airlines: Air Europa and Iberia.

The party changed its name to the Young Australia Party in 1911 and announced the four points of its platform as unification, White Australia, compulsory defence, and transcontinental railways.http://members.webone.com.au/~markld/PhD/Apps/App3C.pdf The Labor Party adopted unification as part of its platform after Billy Hughes succeeded Andrew Fisher as party leader, and the YAP faded out of existence.

Origins Born at Redfern, Sydney, in 1870, he was a son of Cornelius Stanley McGlew (1839‚Äì1924), an English-born mining surveyor and inventor who is notable for his mineral discoveries in N.S.W. and Queensland, particularly of tin deposits, and whose name is perpetuated in McGlew Street, Stanthorpe, Queensland. Standard Salt Company As a youth he was apprenticed as a shipbroker for the Orient Steam Navigation Company. He moved to South Australia in 1900 and commenced trading as a merchant and exporter. McGlew was a pioneer in the salt industry in South Australia, having established in 1903 the Standard Salt Company which from 1912 operated a busy refinery at Edithburgh, exporting to Russia among other places.Chronicle (Adelaide), 31 December 1931, p.33. In 1911 he purchased the rights to salt deposits at Esperance, W.A., establishing operations there also.Kalgoorlie Miner, 10 May 1911, p.5. This company was amalgamated with the Australian Salt Company in 1930. War Service, 1916-20 In 1912, because of his export links, he was appointed Russian Consul for South Australia. In 1916, during World War I, at the age of 46 and despite having lucrative business interests, McGlew enlisted in the A.I.F. and was sent abroad as a second lieutenant with reinforcements of the 27th Battalion. He claimed that by volunteering his example secured 300 to 400 Russian recruits to the A.I.F. In France, a short term of service with the transport details of the battalion was terminated by exposure to gas and the rigors of the French winter, from which he never properly recovered.Obituary, Chronicle (Adelaide), 31 December 1931, p.33. His services were retained in munitions and arsenal base depots of England and the Australian Commonwealth repatriation office in London after the cessation of hostilities, and he was promoted to the rank of captain before returning to Australia in 1920. Grain and Wool Merchant Returning from the war, McGlew expanded his commercial interests as a grain merchant, wool broker, and stock agent, opening branches in Melbourne, Perth, Brisbane, and London.The Mail (Adelaide), 23 January 1932, p.2. A new company, McGlew & Co. Limited, was incorporated at Adelaide on 16 February 1924, he being the chairman. In the mid-1920s barley growers on Yorke Peninsula became dissatisfied with the service provided by grain traders, especially the Adelaide Steamship Company. To compel change they formed two trading companies of their own and then sought McGlew‚Äôs assistance to use a cooperative similar to the wheat pools of Canada and the Cooperative Wheat Pool of Western Australia. Together with the barley growers, in 1925 McGlew purchased and imported the 722-ton steamship Broadway. McGlew used this ship to export the growers‚Äô barley, for which he became known as the first person to export barley from Australia.The Mail (Adelaide), 23 January 1932, p.2. Although uneconomical to continue beyond one season, this bold action was sufficient to bring about the market reforms desired by growers. Liberty Motor Oil Company Based on his experiences with motorised transport on the Western Front, in the late 1920s McGlew‚Äôs company were Australian agents for the Atlantic Union Oil Company, leading to his establishment of the Liberty Motor Oil brand in 1930, with head office at 15 Waymouth Street, Adelaide. With great promise, the company advertised ‚ÄúLiberty oils for every use: Liberty Motor Oils, Liberty Agricultural Oils, Liberty Tractor Oils, Liberty Industrial Oils, Liberty Diesel Oils. Liberty Greases for every purpose.‚ÄùLIBERTY brand motor oil can, 4 gallon (20 litre), vintage c.1931, McGlew & Co Ltd, Adelaide S.A.. However, by now McGlew was suffering much illness from the effects of gassing in the war and the Liberty Motor Oil Company collapsed soon after his death at North Adelaide on 28 December 1931, aged 63. He was interred at West Terrace Cemetery. Oil stocks on hand were remaindered, mainly to Riverland motor dealers. His estate was valued for probate at ¬£7,656. Family McGlew married Alice Walker, of Sydney, who survived him. Estranged in later life, they divorced in 1929.NSW State Records, Matrimonial Causes, No. 932/1929. Their daughter was the prominent medical practitioner and journalist Dr Phyllis Cilento, mother of actress and author Diane Cilento, who married actor Sean Connery.

She was one of the greatest slave planters of the island after she was widowed in 1800 and until death, and played a significant role in the economy and slave industry of the colony. She became an important figure in the local folklore, and one of the most well-known figures of the history of the island. Life Ombline Desbassayns was born in Saint-Paul on La R√©union. In 1770, she married the planter Henri Paulin Panon Desbassayns (1732-1800) and became the mother of Philippe, Charles and Joseph Desbassayns. When she was widowed, she took over the business of her late spouse and enjoyed a long and successful career in managing and expanding the sugar and coffee plantation industry on the island with the help of slave labour. Desbassayns is not noted to have been cruel during her own lifetime - it was for example noted that she founded a hospital for the use of slave patients. After her death, Ombline Desbassayns came to be a symbol of the epoch of slavery on the island (slavery was abolished in 1848, only two years after her death), and it became common to reproach people who acted cruelly by saying that the epoch of Madame Desbassayns was long gone and cruel behaviour was no longer acceptable. A legend claimed that the volcano of Piton de la Fournaise once erupted because Desbassayns had buried her sins in it.Val√©rie Magdelaine-Andrianjafitrimo, ¬´ Histoire et m√©moire : variations autour de l'ancestralit√© et de la filiation dans les romans francophones r√©unionnais et mauriciens ¬ª, Revue de litt√©rature compar√©e, no 318, 2006 In local folklore, Ombline Desbassayns became associated with the demon witch Grand-m√®re Kalle.Val√©rie Magdelaine- Andrianjafitrimo, ¬´ Histoire et m√©moire : variations autour de l'ancestralit√© et de la filiation dans les romans francophones r√©unionnais et mauriciens ¬ª, Revue de litt√©rature compar√©e, no 318, 2006 ( References * Le Fils √† la patte, Jean-Louis Faurous * √éle de la R√©union: regards crois√©s sur l'esclavage, 1794‚Äì1848.

After a Scotland Yard agent (John Burton) is killed investigating sabotage of merchant ships in the Panama Canal, the insurance company become alarmed. Carter is, at first, apprehensive and turns down the contract. Once he discovers that lovely Cora Barnes (Florence Rice) works as a dispatcher for the Morris Shipping Company, one of the companies that is being attacked, his attitude changes. Assisted by Bartholomew, Nick soon learns who is behind the mysterious sinkings. Al Taurez (Joseph Schildkraut), an American gangster who has moved his operations to Panama, is running a marine insurance racket. When a ship is declared missing, Taurez collects the insurance on the ship's falsified cargo.

Nick learns that Cora is supplying information to Taurez on ships passing through the Panama Canal, and that Ramsell, Sr., has also been coerced into signing indemnity claims for Taurez whenever one of his father's ships is sunk. With the help of Bartholomew posing as a maddened gunman, Taurez is held hostage and Nick searches the gangster's office to find a remote control detonator used to send high frequency radio signals that explode bombs hidden on ships. When Nick activates the device, the building next door, the explosives lab, blows up. Taurez and his partner, Dr. Grisson (Thomas W. Ross), who have taken over the Morris Company, attempt to force company owner, Franklin Morris (Cecil Kellaway) to order Ramsell, Jr., to send the next ship through the canal, Morris refuses, then is stabbed by a someone hidden in the shadows. Ramsell, Jr., is arrested for the murder, but Nick soon unravels the racket making Taurez go aboard a ship as it is about to be blown up.

The service allowed modem-equipped personal computer users to dial-in and access a range of information and messaging services including chat, forums, email and a variety of content. There were several other companies offering paid/subscription services as the time like The Source, CompuServe and Boston-based Delphi. Boston Citinet was unique since it was free to access and was supported by advertising. Messaging services such as email and chat required registration and a monthly fee of $9.95 - an early example of the now popular freemium business model. Originally launched in 1982 under the name YellowData (\\"let your modem do the walking\\"), the service was renamed Boston CitiNet in 1985. The software platform for the service was developed by Considine Computing Services (CCS), a DEC system integrator. It initially ran on a DEC micro- PDP/11 computer with over 100 dial-up phone lines coming into the basement of a former A&P; store on Trapelo Road in Belmont. In 1985, it was upgraded to run on a DEC Micro-Vax II. The founders of AVS were Thomas Considine and Richard Koch who were joined by Myron Kassarabahttp://www.linkedin.com/in/myronkassaraba and John Pollock. One of the sources of CitiNet's success was that it was \\"FREE, EASY and ASCII\\". This compared to some of the more graphically based systems that required special hardware to access. Viewtron, an early videotex service offered by Knight- Ridder and AT&T; required a special $900 terminal called a Sceptre for access. CitiNet was a prototype of the future Internet portals, with daily content, online shopping, and social activities. Some of the early advertisers were several local employment agencies, auto leasing agencies, magazine publishers such as Byte Magazine and a large movie theater chain (Sack Theaters). Online vendors sold cheese, cookies, music disks, VCRs, fax machines, and groceries. One of the more popular services was the Daily Horoscope by astrologer Lillian Bono. A partnership made CitiNet the \\"official online service for the Boston Computer Society (BCS)\\", also, the official videotex service of the World Trade Center (Boston). Sports was covered by reporters (like today's bloggers) and Richard Koch could be found in the Boston Celtics or Red Sox locker rooms and posting updates from the press box using a TRS-80 Model 100. Then as now, social interaction led the day, with free email, multi-user chat, and dozens of forums (from cat lovers to vcr help). There were several pioneering services developed by AVS or their partners such as: * SKIDATA - this was a service that provided ski conditions from a data feed supplied by New England Ski Areas Council (NESAC) that we accessible online via modem, using a 24-hour ski conditions line that was powered by DECTalk or at a laser-disk kiosk, developed by Telematic Systems, that was located in the flagship SkiMarket retail store on Commonwealth Ave. in Boston. The service was a smash hit and was featured in Businessweek. * REALNET \\\\- an online real estate service developed through a partnership with Tom Pfau. * BOCOEX - an online computer marketplace for Alex Randall‚Äôs Boston Computer Exchange. * TRADECARD INTERNATIONAL - Online barter exchange In 1985, CitiNet had over 5,000 paying subscribers. In the period from 1985-1989, AVS and CitiNet participated in NYNEX's Info-Look and Bell Atlantic‚Äôs Information Gateway projects as well as being contracted by Pacific Bell to provide the local information services for Project Victoria, an early trial of ISDN services to the home tested in the community of Danville, CA. CitiNet also pioneered the practice of ‚Äúclick- stream analysis‚Äù to support the advertising business. which is the basis of modern predictive analytics. AVS through their franchises and gateway projects produced some of the very first newspaper ‚Äúonline versions‚Äù ‚Äì Newsday Online, Globe Entertainment, Philadelphia Inquirer, and the Omaha World Herald. In the mid 1980s the Regional Bell Operating Companies (RBOCs) had installed packet- switching (X.25) networks, from Siemens and Northern Telecomm, and wanted to encourage the burgeoning dial-up community to find a home on regional networks. CitiNet provided and operated the information hosting service for Project Victoria, with PacBell providing X.25 transport and trialing ISDN over twisted pair, Apple provided Macintoshes for each home, and the San Francisco Chronicle provided news stories. Considine designed the gateway architecture for NYNEX's \\"Information Gateway\\", in which a Siemens EDX-P network provides a virtual portal to manage all session switching between services. And AVS stood up a \\"Gateway Service Bureau\\" in Pennsylvania for Bell Atlantic, and put the Philadelphia Inquirer online in 1988, and other local Pennsylvania services. Boston CitiNet's user base peaked at approx. 45,000 users. It continued to operate until 1990.  Footnotes  References  * Banks, M.

In the heightened tensions prior to World War II, Hollywood developed many films in the spy film genres such as Nick Carter, Master Detective. In this film, Carter investigates espionage at an aircraft factory. Pidgeon and Donald Meek went on to reprise their roles in two sequels, Phantom Raiders (1940) and Sky Murder (1941). Plot Detective Nick Carter boards an airliner with John Keller, the inventor of a revolutionary new aircraft at the Radex Aviation Company. The pilot makes an unscheduled landing so that his confederates can try to steal Keller's plans, but Carter holds them off, and stewardess Lou Farnsby manages to fly them to safety. Carter, posing as \\"Robert Chalmers\\", the new assistant to Hiram Streeter, the boss of the California factory, has Lou reassigned to the infirmary. During his investigation, Carter receives the unwanted help of his companion, Bartholomew. His friend fancies himself an amateur sleuth. A test flight of the new aircraft ends in disaster; the wings are ripped off during a high-speed dive, and the test pilot is killed. It is found that bolts attaching the wings were cut. Later, Carter finds Keller's body in a running car in a closed garage. Carter suspects Keller was strangled, and the scene staged to look like a suicide. Finally, Carter notices that each time a part of the blueprints goes missing, a worker has a serious accident and is sent home by company doctor, Dr. Frankton. He surmises that sections of the plans have been photographed, with photos hidden under bandages. He goes to apprehend the Frankton. Unable to leave the factory in time, he has the unsuspecting Lou escort a \\"patient\\" home. When Carter arrives, Frankton tells him that Lou will be killed unless the doctor shows up at a prearranged rendezvous soon. Carter lets him leave, but secretly has the roof of Frankton's car painted with a white cross. This enables Carter to track the doctor in an aircraft to a section of the Los Angeles docks. Frankton, his associates, the complete plans and Lou race to a waiting ship. Carter engages in a firefight with the crew using a Tommy gun borrowed from the police. Although his aircraft is shot down, Carter prevents their getaway. At the instigation of Bartholomew, a harbor patrol gunboat arrives and the villains are forced to surrender. CastProduction The \\"high speed\\" aircraft in Nick Carter, Master Detective was a Ryan ST c/n NC17344. Most of the aerial footage was staged in the studio backlots and incorporated into background scenes.Santoir, Christian. \\"Ryan ST (1934).\\" Aeromovies, September 9, 2015. Retrieved: June 15, 2019. Reception According to MGM records, Nick Carter, Master Detective earned $276,000 in the US and Canada and $180,000 elsewhere, making a loss to the studio of $93,000. Film reviewer Frank S. Nugent in his review of Nick Carter, Master Detective, wrote in The New York Times, \\"No, this isn't Nick Carter as we remember him, but it's an amusing fiction for all that, with enough action to compensate for the arch unoriginality of the plot and with pleasantly casual performances all around. ... They [Pidgeon and Meek] make a gay crime-solving combination\\".Nugent, Frank S. \\"The screen: 'Nick Carter, Master Detective' belatedly joins the ranks of the Hollywood spy-chasing fraternity at the Miami Theatre.\\" The New York Times, December 14, 1939. Reviewer Tom Milne in Time Out (magazine), more recently stated, \\"Tourneur's second film in Hollywood, it's briskly and competently done, but the best thing about it is Donald Meek's performance as Bartholomew, the Bee Man, a mousy little apiculturist who fancies himself as a private eye.\\"Milne 2004, p. 830.

She has written for Science Magazine and wrote two weekly columns for The Philadelphia Inquirer, including one on sex and one on evolution. Flam wrote a book on the influence of sex on human evolution and society. She teaches science writing and lectures on communication to scientific forums, and is a journalism critic for the MIT Knight Science Journalism Tracker. Education Flam chose a top-ten ranked American university to pursue her interest in science and engineering, attending the California Institute of Technology, where she earned a B.Sc. degree in Geophysics in 1985. During this program she discovered that she \\"loved science, but... you [need a specific career goal] to succeed.‚Äù and instead pursued a career in science writing. She also completed a one-year graduate certificate program in UCSC Science Communication. Later she participated in a one-year study project on the implications of science on personal identity as part of a University of Michigan Knight-Wallace fellowship. Professional experience Flam was awarded The Richard Casement internship and completed internship assignments at The Economist London newsroom in 1988 and Science News in 1989, then, from 1991 to 1995, worked as a columnist for the journal Science, covering particle physics and cosmology topics. In 1995, she left Science to become a staff writer for The Philadelphia Inquirer. In addition to science news articles, she wrote a column titled Carnal Knowledge which explored the science of sexuality, then a column and blog titled Planet of the Apes, which covered evolution. During this time she also returned to the UCSC Science Communication Program as a visiting instructor. In 2012, Flam left the Inquirer to become a science journalism critic for the Knight Science Journalism Tracker at MIT, where she is still a contributor, and \\"has weathered storms in Greenland, helicoptered into equatorial cloud forests, gotten frost nip at the South Pole and floated weightless aboard NASA‚Äôs astronaut training plane.\\" From 2012 to 2013 she was the author of the Lightning Rod Blog for WHYY FM in Philadelphia where she wrote on a wide range of science topics. In 2013 she became ‚Äúscience writer in residence‚Äù at Ursinus College, where she teaches science writing. Flam hiking with Richard Dawkins and Sean Faircloth. Book: The Score In 2008, near the end of her term as author of the Carnal Knowledge column, Flam published a book, The Score: How the Quest for Sex has Shaped the Modern Man, a scientific review of the evolution of sex and of the sexual behaviour of the human male. (In some countries, the book is published with the alternate title, The Score: The Science of the Male Sex Drive.) Psychology Today described the book \\"not only...highly entertaining and titillating\\" but \\"scientifically rigorous and informative\\", while New Scientist called The Score \\"at its best when it is exploring the advantages or peculiarities of other species\\". Flam took part in several interviews associated with the release of the book. In a Salon interview she discussed the evolution of human gender roles, including the theory that risk-taking behavior in men evolved through sexual selection. In an audio interview on the Radio Times program on WHYY-FM, Flam revealed that her original plan for the book had it starting with evolutionary theory, but that the receipt of a book on the \\"Mystery method\\" from a publicist gave her the idea to start with the lighter subject of the visit to the \\"seduction boot camp\\". In discussing the topics taught at the boot camp, she explained that one of the proposed methods - making a first appearance at social events in the company of other women, in order to appear more acceptable and less threatening - may have some scientific validity, in the theory of mate choice copying. Flam realized that elements of mate choice copying were also employed by other animals, a concept that is now generally accepted in the field. In another audio interview, she also discussed the plausibility of other popular sexual evolutionary and behavioural theories, such as Testosterone poisoning. Publications Flam published regular articles in the journal Science from February, 1991 until March, 1995. While her primary topics were described as particle physics and cosmology, she also covered news and events in astronomy, genetics, evolution, and medicine. While a science writer for The Philadelphia Inquirer, Flam wrote a regular column titled Carnal Knowledge, which ran from 2005 to 2008 and dealt with the science of sexuality, and with the evolution of sex. She then wrote a column on evolution, titled Planet Of The Apes, which ran from April, 2011 to October, 2012, when she left the Inquirer. In a National Association of Science Writers review of one of the articles in this series, she was called \\"one of the best science journalists/bloggers around\\" and \\"the only one I know of who's taken on the challenging assignment of teaching the general public about evolution in a daily newspaper\\". Flam's publications with Knight Science Journalism Tracker began in 2012 with an article about science broadcaster Bill Nye's recent comments on teaching creationism. She continues to write for Knight, reviewing and criticizing science journalism, focusing on media coverage of controversial topics and uncritical reporting on questionable research. She also wrote a blog called Lightning Rod for the NewsWorks web site of WHYY public radio. This blog was launched in 2012 with a review of the controversy among historians over whether Ben Franklin's famous experiment with a kite in a lightning storm ever really happened. She regularly writes articles on astronomy, conspiracy theories, biology, and pseudoscience. Flam's articles have frequently been republished by other journals and sites, including The Washington Post, the News Herald, The Japan Times, and the Richard Dawkins Foundation. While writing the Planet Of The Apes blog for the Inquirer, Flam wrote an article about evolution as though the responses had been written by her cat, Higgs, to emphasize the simplicity of the reasoning. The article was reviewed favourably by other bloggers, notably Jerry Coyne in Why Evolution Is True. This approach continued, with Higgs guest-authoring other posts in the Planet Of The Apes blog, and \\"Higgs, the Science Cat\\" publishing his own science articles in Parade, with Flam calling herself \\"assistant to Higgs\\". The Parade articles ran from April to June of 2013, and covered primarily biology and astronomy topics. Public speaking Flam is a frequent speaker at conferences. At first her appearances were related to her book, The Score, such as when she discussed it as part of the 2008 Wistar Author Series, and her talk, Are Males the More Interesting Sex? at The Philadelphia Science Festival. More recently, she has spoken to promote science journalism and communication skills to scientific and skeptical forums. In 2012 she participated in a panel discussion, Telling the Stories of Science at the Academy of Natural Sciences of Drexel University. In 2013 she presented a series of 3 lectures on science communication at the Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics of University of California, Santa Barbara. In Life on Mars and Neanderthal Clones: Why Weird Science Gets on the Front Page and What You Can Do About It, she discussed the motivation of journalists, explaining to the scientist audience why certain stories garner a majority of attention from popular media. In How To Sell Your Science Without Selling Your Soul: How To Get The Media To Work For You, she reviewed what scientists and journalists have in common, and recommended effective ways for scientists to communicate with journalists. Finally, in Salacious Science: What I Learned from Writing an Infamous Sex Column she discussed her long-running column and the broad range of reactions it received. She presented a similar talk to The Center for Science and the Common Good at Ursinus College later that year. Flam was a presenter at the 2013 edition of The Amaz!ng Meeting, speaking on the importance of countering misleading and uncritical media coverage, and later blogged about her experience interacting with the skeptics, magicians, and scientists who attended. In 2014 she made a presentation on science in the media on the topic of genetically modified organisms, to the Philadelphia Association for Critical Thinking. Awards In 2014, Flam received the Friend of Darwin award from the National Center for Science Education for her 2010-2012 The Philadelphia Inquirer column Planet of the Apes, for being \\"the only newspaper column dedicated to evolution\\". The award was presented April 26, 2014, at the Academy of Natural Sciences of Drexel University in Philadelphia. Flam won 1st place in the Special Projects category of the Pennsylvania NewsMedia Association's 2011 Keystone Press Awards for her article Faulting the Forensics. Flam has been nominated for a Pulitzer prize for work in The Philadelphia Inquirer. Controversies Flam's Planet of the Apes series drew criticism from Creationists. In an interview with Discover magazine, Flam indicated that the most intense criticism of her work came from coverage of climate change.

Porter was described by the police as being a \\"mid-level crack dealer\\" who \\"sold about $50 thousand worth of crack a week\\". The 2002 film Paid in Full was based on Rich and his partners Azie Faison and Alpo Martinez. Life Born Richard Porter in the Harlem section of New York City, Porter was the oldest of three children born to Velma Porter. Porter began selling drugs at the age of 12, rising through the ranks of the drug trade in Harlem. He became known for his flamboyant and high-profile lifestyle and was rumored to have never worn the same outfit twice and that he owned over a dozen luxury vehicles that he kept in a garage in Manhattan during the height of his career as a drug dealer. Death He was murdered on January 3, 1990 and his body was found the next day in the vicinity of Orchard Beach, Bronx. He had been shot several times in the head and chest, and police found $2,239 in his pocket. His friend and former drug dealing partner Alpo Martinez was charged and convicted of his murder. On December 5, 1989 his 12-year-old brother William Porter was kidnapped in Harlem on his way to school and then had his finger cut off in order to extort $500,000 in ransom money from Rich. He was eventually killed and his body was found on January 28, 1990, a mile away from where Rich's body was found and less than a month after Rich's murder. In popular culture The 2002 film Paid in Full was based on the life and death of Rich, and his involvement in drug dealing along with Azie Faison and Alpo Martinez.

He was Minister of Public Works during the French Second Republic, and served as Minister of Finance from 1852 to 1855 under the Emperor Napoleon III. He pushed through measures to increase revenues and contain expenditures in the face of opposition from the legislature. Early years Jean-Martial Bineau was born in Gennes, Maine-et-Loire, on 28 Floreal year XIII (18 May 1805), son of Jean Ren√© Bineau (1767‚Äì1814) and Adelaide Papot (1770‚Äì1850). His father had studied medicine, then became commander of the National Guard of Gennes in 1790‚Äì91, lieutenant of the grenadiers in 1792 and Commissioner of the Departmental Management Board from 1797 to 1800. Bineau studied at Saumur, Angers and Paris. In 1824 he was admitted to the √âcole Polytechnique. He moved on to the School of Mines in 1826, and at the age of 25 became a chief engineer. He specialized in the manufacture of iron. He visited England in 1840 and published a book on the English railways. He vigorously lobbied for giving France a network of railways along the English model. In 1841 he was elected a deputy for Angers with 80% of the vote. Second Republic Cartoon by Honor√© Daumier decrying Bineau's 1848 report on the Fine Arts Budget After the February Revolution of 1848, by a decree of 30 March 1848 Bineau was appointed special commissioner for the railway companies of Orl√©ans and Centre, which were both in receivership. Bineau was elected to the Constituent Assembly later that year, where he voted for the Constitution of the French Second Republic. In 1848 Bineau also taught general and statistical economics at the School of Administration. Bineau was reelected to the Legislative Assembly in 1849, where he supported all the measures of the Bonapartists in the legislature. He participated in the work of the Finance committee. He reported on a draft law of 6 June 1848 on nationalization of the railways, proposed by Duclerc, the Minister of Finance. He was strongly opposed to the measure. He was also involved in debate about the amended budget submitted by Duclerc on 28 September 1848 which called for a drastic reduction of staff in all ministerial departments. Bineau was given the portfolio of Minister of Public Works on 31 October 1849. In this role he continued to promote development of the railways. He implemented a policy favorable to railway companies that gave them long-term concessions so they could extend the amortization period of shares and bonds issued to finance the work, and encouraged development of secondary lines. He resigned after General Changarnier was dismissed on 9 January 1851. Bineau supported the coup of 2 December 1851 which led to the restoration of the Empire. Second Empire - Minister of Finance Bineau as an \\"Ioway\\" and thumb After the coup Bineau supported Louis Napoleon Bonaparte and became a member of the Consultative Commission. He was appointed Minister of Finance on 22 January 1852. He replaced Achille Fould, who had resigned after the decree confiscating the property of the House of Orl√©ans. During his tenure Bineau tried to restore fiscal balance by reducing the state's deficits and debts, and by calling for public loans. On 3 March 1852 Bineau reached an agreement with the Bank of France over extending the terms of repayment of loans made to the Treasury. On 14 March 1852 he obtained a reduction in debt payments by offering creditors a choice between repayment at par or accepting a reduction of interest from 5% to 4.5%, secured for ten years. Almost all of the debt was converted to the lower rate. On 17 March 1852 a budget was set for the remainder of 1852 without being submitted to the newly elected legislature. Although a deficit was forecast, the budget included a large increase in indirect taxation that was expected to generate a major reduction in the deficit by the end of the fiscal year. The budget for 1853 was smaller than that of 1852, but still showed a deficit of 43 million. The effect of the debt conversion was offset by an eight-fold increase in the salary of the President of the Republic and an increase in the floating debt, rising from 630 million on 1 April 1852 to 891 million by year end. The budget was voted on 8 July 1852, but only after a stand-off between the government and the legislative body which was to cause a reduction of the power of the legislature to allocate the budget. The legislature also forfeited the right to control commercial treaties and special appropriations for major public works. On 23 December 1852 Bineau told the senate it was for the legislature to vote for the tax, but for the Government to decide how to best use the revenue. Bineau as a butcher, cartoon by Cham By an act of 6 May 1852 all coins were to be withdrawn from circulation, some of which dated to the 17th century, and replaced by standard new copper coinage. The Cr√©dit Foncier de France was authorized by decree of 28 February 1852, but ran into difficulty and on 6 July 1854 was placed under the authority of the Minister of Finance. The Cr√©dit Mobilier was created by a decree of 18 November 1852 as an investment bank to promote development of industry and public works. On 7 February 1853 Bineau reported that the financial position of the Empire was good. Budget deficits were reduced, tax revenues increased and the floating debt had declined. The 1854 budget showed an increase in revenues and a smaller increase in spending. The budget was passed, but the government was criticized by the \\"budgetarians\\" for overspending and for its links to the business community. A revised law on civil service pensions was passed on 9 June 1853. On 8 March 1854 a bill was passed to float a loan to fund the expenses of the Crimean War. The loan was raised through issuance of bonds to the public, an innovation. Demand greatly exceed the amount required. To meet payments on the war bonds, the 1855 budget had to increase the floating debt, and was passed with difficulty. A second war loan was authorized on 31 December 1854, and was again successful. The size of subscriptions was limited to encourage large numbers of small subscriptions by the supporters of the emperor. With deteriorating health, by the end of 1854 Beneau was forced to hand over control of the Finance ministry to Baroche. Final year Bineau was made a senator on 27 March 1852. He chaired the General Council of Maine-et-Loire from 1852 to 1855. He resigned from the Finance ministry on 3 February 1855. He was made Inspector General of Mines. Napoleon paid a tribute to Bineau in a letter published in the Moniteur on the day of his resignation. Early in 1855 Bineau was forced to spend time in the south of France due to health problems. He returned to Paris for the summer, then moved to Chatou, Yvelines. He died in Chatou on 8 September 8, 1855, aged 50.

Their 1997 album The Courier was accompanied by a tour of Europe and the United States. The Many Moods EP appeared in June 1999, followed in October by the album Vertigo on Apricot Records. The album was mixed by producer Bertrand Burgalat and was a success. Their final release was the 1999 EP Against the World, containing two cuts from Vertigo and three new songs, which was followed by a 2000 tour.

Two other units, the Digest and the Institutes, were created during his reign. The fourth part, the Novellae Constitutiones (New Constitutions, or Novels), was compiled unofficially after his death but is now also thought of as part of the Corpus Juris Civilis.See generally, Honor√©, 2003  Creation  Shortly after Justinian became emperor in 527, he decided the empire's legal system needed repair. There existed three codices of imperial laws and other individual laws, many of which conflicted or were out of date. The Codex Gregorianus and the Codex Hermogenianus were unofficial compilations. (The term \\"Codex\\" refers to the physical aspect of the works, being in book form, rather than on papyrus rolls. The transition to the codex occurred around AD 300.)Jolowicz, 1972, p. 463 The Codex Theodosianus was an official compilation ordered by Theodosius II. In February 528, Justinian promulgated the Constitutio Hac quae necessario, by which was created a ten- man commission to review these earlier compilations as well as individual laws, eliminate everything unnecessary or obsolete, make changes as it saw fit, and create a single compilation of imperial laws in force.Jolowicz, 1972, p. 479. The commission was headed by the praetorian prefect, John of CappadociaCaroline Humfress, \\"Law and Legal Practice in the Age of Justinian,\\" in The Age of Justinian 161, 163 (Michael Maas ed. 2005). Humfress also describes the diverse forms of imperial enactments that were included. and also included Tribonian, who was later to head the other Corpus Juris Civilis projects.Honor√©, 2003, supra note 1 The commission finished its work in 14 months, and the compilation was promulgated in April 529 by the Constitutio Summa.Honor√©, 2003, supra note 1 at 803 However, this compilation did not eliminate all the conflicts that had arisen over the years in Roman jurisprudence, and the constitutions in the Code were to be used alongside the conflicting opinions of ancient jurists. \\"The citation of the said constitutions of Our Code, with the opinions of the ancient interpreters of the law, will suffice for the disposal of all cases.\\"Humfress, supra note 5 at 165, quoting the Constitutio Summa. Justinian attempted to harmonize these conflicting opinions by issuing his \\"Fifty Decisions\\" and by passing additional new laws. This meant that his Code no longer reflected the latest imperial law. Thus, Justinian ordered a new compilation to supersede the first, and this Codex was published in 534.Honor√©, supra note 1 at 804. For an English translation of the law putting this second edition into force, see \\"Concerning the Correction of the Justinian Code, and the Second Edition Thereof\\" (November 16, 534), translated by Justice Fred Blume in the Annotated Justinian Code at page 4. No copies of the first edition of the Code have survived; only a fragment of an index of contents on an Egyptian papyrus remains.Wolfgang Kunkel, An Introduction to Roman Legal and Constitutional History 166 (J.M. Kelly trans. 2nd ed. 1973). Known as the Codex Repetitae Praelectionis, this second edition of the Code was published on November 16, 534, and took effect on December 30.Jolowicz, 1972, supra note 2 at 494. The Codex consists of twelve books: book 1 concerns ecclesiastical law, sources of law, and the duties of higher offices; books 2‚Äì8 cover private law; book 9 deals with crimes; and books 10‚Äì12 contain administrative law. The Code's structure is based on ancient classifications set out in the edictum perpetuum (perpetual edict), as is that of the Digest.  Rediscovery  Excerpt from the manuscript \\"Codex Justiniani I-IX\\". Medieval copy of the famous Code of Justinian. Copied by Franciscus Accursius in the 13th century. Preserved in the Ghent University Library. In the West, Justinian's Codex was largely lost, or in many places never present, due to the limited western extent of the Byzantine territories. The Latin version known today was painstakingly restored over many centuries. The only known manuscript that once contained the entire Latin Codex is a Veronese palimpsest of the 6th or 7th century; it is now only fragments.Jolowicz, 1972, supra note 2 at 495Stephen L. Sass, Research in Roman Law; a Guide to the Sources and Their English Translations, 56 Law Library Journal 210, 225 (1963). Within its home in the Byzantine Empire, the code was translated into Greek, which had become the governing language, and adapted, in the 9th century as the Basilika. It appears as if the Latin Code was shortened in the Middle Ages into an \\"Epitome Codex\\", with inscriptions being dropped and numerous other changes made.Charles M. Radding & Antonio Ciaralli, The Corpus Iuris Civilis in the Middle Ages: Manuscripts and Transmissions from the Sixth Century to the Juristic Revival 133 (2007); pages 133-168 give a detailed account of the Code's transmission in this period. Some time in the 8th or 9th century, the last three books of the Code were separated from the others, and many other laws in the first nine books, including all of those written in Greek, were dropped.A. Arthur Schiller, Roman law, Mechanisms of Development 37 (1978). Substantially complete versions of Justinian's Codex were restored around the end of the 12th century, and the humanists of the 16th century added the laws originally promulgated in Greek.Jolowicz, 1972, supra note 2 at 496. Paul Kr√ºger created the modern, standard version of the Codex in 1877. Krueger, Paul (1877), Codex iustinianus (in German). English translations No English translations were made of the Codex until the 20th century. In 1932, the English translation of the entire Corpus Juris Civilis (CJC) by Samuel Parsons Scott was published posthumously. The Civil Law including the Twelve Tables, the Institutes of Gaius, the Rules of Ulpian, the Enactments of Justinian, and the Constitutions of Leo..., 17 vols. (1932). Reprinted in 1973 by the AMS Press. Unfortunately, Scott used the Kriegel brothers' edition of the CJC rather than that of Theodor Mommsen, Paul Kr√ºger, Rudolf Sch√∂ll and Wilhelm Kroll, which is accepted as the most reliable, and his translation was severely criticized.Timothy Kearley, \\"Justice Fred Blume and the Translation of Justinian's Code\\".Each of the units of Mommsen, Kr√ºger, Schoell and Kroll CJC .Miller and Kearley (2013) A selective English translation of Kroll's Preface to Novels. Reviewing Scott's work, the Roman law scholar W. W. Buckland wrote that Scott \\"...had at his disposal an adequate latinity and has produced a version written in an English which can be read with pleasure. But much more than that was needed, and the work cannot be said to satisfy these further requirements.\\"W.W. Buckland, \\"Book Review,\\" 7 Tulane Law Review 627, 629 (1932‚Äì33). Around the same time that Scott was active, Wyoming Supreme Court Justice Fred H. Blume was translating the Code and Novels, using the standard Mommsen, Kr√ºger, Sch√∂ll, and Kroll version.See Kearley, supra note 18. While this was not printed in his lifetime, in 2005 his translation of both the Code and the Novels was published on the Annotated Justinian Code website. For further discussion of the work of Scott, Blume, and Clyde Pharr on Roman law translation see Kearley, Timothy G., \\"From Rome to the Restatement: S.P. Scott, Fred Blume, Clyde Pharr, and Roman Law in Early Twentieth-Century\\". See also Timothy G. Kearley, Lost in Translations: Roman Law Scholarship and Translation in Early Twentieth-Century America 162‚Äì164 (2018).

A New Annotated Translation, with Parallel Latin and Greek Text (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2016), p. 2963,  Codex Repetitae Praelectionis  The Codex Repetitae Praelectionis was the second edition of the Code of Justinian. It came into force by the constitution Cordi on 16 November 534 and was necessary due to Justinian's own legislative activity in creating new laws since the original code was issued in 529. It consists of 12 books and was written mainly in Latin.\\"Codex Justinianus\\" in The Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium, Oxford University Press, New York & Oxford, 1991, p. 474.

In 1852 urgent accommodation was required for pensioner guards who had accompanied the first shipments of convicts to Western Australia and on to the Toodyay Convict Hiring Depot. Pensioner Guards were retired army or police officers who were given pay and benefits to travel with convicts on the transportation ships from England. Upon arrival most of them continued to serve the Convict Establishment (managed from the Fremantle Prison site) as guards. Land allotments were marked out on the northern portion of Toodyay's town site. This cottage, built for pensioner guard Owen Hackett, originally had two rooms with a shingle roof that is still intact under the newer corrugated iron roofing. Hackett arrived from Ireland in 1853 with his wife and two children. Five more children were born whilst they lived here. In 1862 Joseph T. Monger bought this property and the adjacent property to build the Newcastle Hotel (now the Toodyay Tavern). He chose to keep the cottage onsite. Later occupants were Ernest and Tom James. As is the case with the nearby Kirk's (Pensioner) Cottage (fmr) its original appearance has been modified. Today the single storey painted brick and iron cottage has a hipped roof front and rear verandahs and a side extension.

H. Asquith, Edward Grey and Henry Fowler as its vice-presidents.Robert Rhodes James, Rosebery (London: Phoenix, 1995), p. 438. It consisted largely of Liberal ImperialistsLeo McKinstry, Rosebery: Statesman in Turmoil (London: John Murray, 2006), p. 447. and its purpose was to give unity to those Liberals who disliked the policies of the Liberal leader, Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman.James, p. 439. A Liberal League candidate won the 1902 Leeds North by-election, turning a Unionist majority of over 2,500 into a Liberal majority of nearly 800.James, p. 440. By 1908 the League was almost moribund but on 12 March of that year Rosebery tried to revive it by delivering a speech in which he urged the League to rally to a programme of anti-socialism, anti-Home Rule, imperialism, free trade and reform of the House of Lords.McKinstry, p. 500. One member present said it was \\"the most dismal gathering he had ever attended; Lord Rosebery's audience was obviously ill at ease\\"; Rosebery himself wrote in his diary that his speech was \\"even worse than usual, partly from a clammy afternoon audience, partly from my being out of touch with politics\\".McKinstry, pp. 500-501. The Liberal government's revolutionary People's Budget of 1909 caused a storm of controversy. At League meetings of 25 and 28 June, members of the League were suspicious of following Rosebery in condemning the Budget due to his indecisive character and failure to lead.McKinstry, p. 505. On 9 September 1909 Rosebery resigned the presidency of the League. The next day, he delivered a greatly anticipated speech in Glasgow in which he condemned the Budget as the \\"negation of faith, of family, of property, of monarchy, of Empire\\".McKinstry, p. 506. Asquith wrote to him the day after the speech, declaring that it was impossible to serve under his presidency, not realising Rosebery had already resigned it.McKinstry, p. 507. The League was formally dissolved in May 1910.McKinstry, p. 507.

The torrential precipitation in Japan was considered some of the worst in the past century. Saomai, the second strongest typhoon in the western Pacific in 2000, developed from an area of disturbed weather in open sea on August 31\\\\. The system was initially quick to intensify, reaching an initial peak intensity as a typhoon on September 4\\\\. Wind shear caused a hiatus in Saomai's strengthening phase, and as a result Saomai weakened back to a tropical storm as it tracked northwest for the next few days. On September 9, the system regained typhoon intensity and began to rapidly intensify, reaching peak intensity on September 10 with maximum sustained winds of 175 km/h (110 mph). Over the ensuing two days Saomai would weaken slightly before making landfall on Okinawa Island. The typhoon later entered the East China Sea, where it recurved towards the northeast before making landfall on South Korea as a severe tropical storm, later transitioning into an extratropical cyclone on September 16\\\\. Saomai's remnants would move into Russia before dissipating three days later. As a developing typhoon, the outer rainbands of Saomai affected the Northern Mariana Islands and Guam, causing moderate damage. Localized power outages were reported, and damage totaled to US$650,000. Even before Saomai made landfall on Okinawa, the typhoon caused rough seas off the coast of Japan that resulted in several shipping incidents. Concurrently, the approach of a front into the country interacted with the typhoon, resulting in unprecedented rainfalls in Japan. Due to the floods, approximately 400,000 people were evacuated in three prefectures. In Nagoya, observed rainfall totals were the highest since records began in 1891. Despite making landfall on Okinawa, damage was not as severe, though several landslides and strong winds were reported. Overall, damage in Japan and its outlying islands totaled JP¬•24.8 billion (US$223 million) and eleven fatalities were reported. As Saomai tracked near China, its outer rainbands and strong waves prompted the evacuation of 20,000 people and caused record high stream heights. In South Korea, eight people were killed and damage figures equated to US$71 million. Widespread power outages took a toll on as many as 422,000 homes and heavy rains flooded numerous fields of crops. Minor damage occurred in North Korea, though the damage wrought by Typhoon Prapiroon earlier in the month was exacerbated by Saomai's impacts. In Russia, where the typhoon made landfall as an extratropical storm, nine people were killed due to car accidents spurred by rainfall caused by the Saomai. Overall, Saomai's effects resulted in the death of 28 people and roughly US$6.3 billion in damage. Meteorological history Typhoon Saomai emerged from an area of convection that developed well east of Guam in late- August. Though the disturbance was associated with a low-pressure area, the circulation center was too weak to support persistent shower activity. Despite the satellite presentation, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) classified the system as a tropical depression at 1800 UTC on August 31. Over the next few days, the system organized and curved towards the west from its initial northerly track. At 1200 UTC on September 2, the JMA upgraded the small depression to tropical storm intensity. Within Saomai, convection deepened near the center, signifying continued intensification. A cold central dense overcast eventually developed, and at 1200 UTC the next day, Saomai became a severe tropical storm. Early on September 4, the tropical cyclone intensified further into a typhoon. At the time, Saomai was still well northeast of Guam. Upon reaching typhoon strength, Saomai attained an initial peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 120 km/h (65 mph). Shortly after, despite the fact that a primitive eye had begun to develop, wind shear increased, shearing the storm's convection away. As a result, the JMA downgraded Saomai below typhoon strength on September 5, and at roughly the same time a subtropical ridge to the storm's southeast steered Saomai southward. This break in the storm's westerly course was short lived, and early on September 6, Saomai assumed its previous heading. Over time the shearing conditions gradually abated, and rainbanding about the cyclone was showing signs of organization and strengthening. On September 8, Saomai finally re-developed a central dense overcast, prompting the JMA to upgrade the tropical storm back to typhoon intensity at 0000 UTC the following day. Back in favorable conditions, the typhoon entered a phase of rapid intensification beginning six hours later. During this period a well-defined eye developed, and the storm's eyewall significantly intensified. At 1200 UTC on September 10, Saomai reached its peak intensity with sustained winds estimated at 175 km/h (110 mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 925 mbar (hPa; 27.32 inHg). The intense typhoon held this intensity for approximately nine hours before it began to weaken. Following peak intensity, Saomai's eye became cloud-filled, and the storm began to develop concentric eyewalls. Shortly after 1000 UTC on September 12, the typhoon made landfall on central Okinawa, Japan with sustained winds of 140 km/h (85 mph) and a pressure of 945 mbar (hPa; 27.91 inHg). Saomai quickly passed over the island, and concurrently its weakening phase came to a halt. After tracking into the East China Sea, the typhoon began to track towards the northeast in response to a mid-latitude trough. At its westernmost point along its track, Saomai was located approximately 345 km (215 mi) east of Wenzhou, China. Atmospheric conditions became increasingly more hostile as Saomai tracked northeast, and the typhoon became elongated and ragged in appearance. At 1200 UTC on September 15, Saomai was downgraded to severe tropical storm intensity as the cyclone began to undergo extratropical transition. At around 2030 UTC that day, Saomai made its final landfall as a tropical system west of Pusan, South Korea; after emerging into the Yellow Sea the storm was declared extratropical at 0600 UTC the next day. These remnants later tracked inland near Vladivostok, Russia before dissipating on September 19. Preparations, impact, and aftermath=Northern Mariana Islands and Guam= Early in Saomai's developmental history, the rainbands associated with the storm dropped heavy rain across the Northern Mariana Islands. Schools across the archipelago nation were closed, and ferry service between Saipan and Tinian was cancelled. Reports of flooding were widespread, including in Saipan. In Tianan, some banana trees were damaged by the storm's affects. Damage from the islands amounted to US$650,000, with $600,000 to infrastructure. The presence of the nearby tropical cyclone caused the delaying of two flights and the cancellation of another at Antonio B. Won Pat International Airport. On Guam, the United States Navy ordered the release of ships from the local harbor. There, peaked at 251 mm (9.90 in) over a 24-hour period at Piti. At the National Weather Service office in Tiyan, a gauge observed 100 mm (3.95 in) of rain. Gusty winds were also associated with Saomai's outer rainbands, with gusts peaking at a measured 105 km/h (66 mph) on September 4\\\\. The winds caused power outage in localized areas and downed two telephone poles. Severe flooding occurred in Merizo after a storm drain became clogged with debris, inundating six houses. =Japan= Typhoon Saomai nearing Okinawa on September 12 On September 10, rough seas caused by Saomai capsized a fishing boat off of Shizuoka Prefecture, causing one person to go missing. Another occupant of the boat was rescued three hours after the sinking by police helicopter. The waves also caused a dozen containers from the South Korean Heunga Nagoya to fall into the sea off the coast of Susami and Wakayama Prefecture. Off of Oita Prefecture, the waves were the impetus for red tides, resulting in significant marine loss. The approach of the typhoon towards Okinawa coincided with the approach of a weather front over mainland Japan, resulting in prolonged rainfall over the mainland. The rains caused extensive flooding, prompting the Cabinet of Japan to make reassurances in the repair of the ensuing damage. Rail service along the T≈çkaid≈ç Shinkansen between Tokyo and Osaka was suspended for more than 18 hours at one point, the longest delay to be enforced in the rail's service history. As a result, 50,000 passengers were forced to wait out the storm in the line's stopped trains. Toyota closed 24 of its manufacturing plants, resulting in the incompletion of 10,000 vehicles. Similarly, Mitsubishi stopped production at two of its facilities in Nagoya. Japan Airlines, All Nippon Airways, and Japan Air System cancelled a combined 114 fights, which adversely affected about 21,000 people. Across the country, rainfall peaked at 1,000 mm (39.37 in) in Miyagawa, Mie; the same station also recorded 522 mm (20.55 in) of rain in a single 24-hour period. As a result of the flooding in Mie, 2,819 homes were inundated and 25 landslides occurred. Several buildings succumbed to the water and thus collapsed. Extensive power outage occurred in Kagoshima Prefecture, affecting approximately 4,500 households. In addition, the heavy rains caused damage to agriculture, including sugar cane crops. Damage in the prefecture totaled . Similar effects were felt across Kyushu. Several flights into Nagasaki Prefecture were cancelled; the rains there also caused agricultural damage totaling JP¬•99 million (US$900,000). Flooding also occurred on Shikoku, where rainfall totals peaked at 976 mm (38.43 in) in Funato, K≈çchi. Severe damage occurred elsewhere in K≈çchi, where combined forestry and agricultural damage figures reached JP¬•2.1 billion (US$19 million). In Tokushima Prefecture, several landslides occurred, disrupting transportation routes. left Record rainfall was observed in Aichi Prefecture, with 511 mm (21.69 in) of rain in Tokai and 532 mm (20.94 in) of rain in Nagoya in a span of a single day; both observations were the highest since records began in 1891. Due to the threat of landslides in Nagoya, the municipal government ordered the evacuation of 140,000 families. In the ward of Nakagawa-ku, two rivers overflowed their banks and over-topped the surrounding embankment. Two tornadoes occurred in the prefecture, with one striking Mihama and another striking Minamichita; the former tornado injured 22 people, of which two were hospitalized. Another 41,000 families encompassing 400,000 people were evacuated across Aichi, Gifu, and Mie prefectures as a precautionary measure. Damage in Okinawa, the site of Saomai's first landfall, was considerable but not unprecedented. On September 10, the provincial government established a disaster warning headquarters on Daito Island to more efficiently deal with the typhoon's effects. Rainfall peaked on Mount Yonaha, where a station recorded 537 mm (21.14 in) of rain. During the storm, 31 roads sustained damage and 26 landslides occurred. Damage in Okinawa Prefecture reached JP¬•636 million (US$6 million). Overall, Saomai caused the destruction of 609 homes and the inundation of 70,017 others in Japan. Damage costs in the country totaled JP¬•24.8 billion (US$223 million). Eleven people were killed and 103 others suffered injury. At the height of the storm, over 17,000 people had been displaced in emergency shelters. =Korean peninsula= As Saomai approached South Korea, the typhoon forced the cancellation of flights beginning on September 12. Four airports had their air service suspended. Other suspensions of transportation included the refuge of 362 fishing boats in ports and the closure of 10 national parks and 43 mountain paths. As a result, about 16,600 campers and hikers were evacuated to safer areas. As a result of the inclement weather, the operation of 149 passenger ships were cancelled. On September 13, the Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA) issued a typhoon warning for waters south of South Korea and Jeju Province. The administration anticipated heavy rainfall, though not as much as what had taken place in Japan. Offshore, an Indonesian freighter with 39 crewmen became stranded by the typhoon in waters south of Pusan. The crew were rescued by maritime police, but 270 tons of oil spilled into the ocean from a broken oil container. In South Korea, the northern and southern Gyeongsang provinces were the most heavily impacted. At least 6,000 ha (15,000 ac) of paddy fields were flooded. Heavy rains caused the Nakdong River to breach a section of embankment, prompting the evacuation of 100 families. Flood warnings were issued by the KMA on sections of the river for the first time in 2000. In South Gyeongsang, an electricity pylon collapsed, cutting power supply to about 700 houses. Strong winds uprooted trees and destroyed homes and fishing boats in Pusan. Countrywide, losses were initially estimated at KR‚Ç©20 billion (US$18 million), though these figures later rose to US$71 million. As a result of Saomai, eight people were killed, and 411 others were displaced. More than 600 buildings were either inundated or destroyed entirely. At the height of the storm, roughly 422,000 households were without power, primarily in northern and southern Gyeongsang provinces. Relatively minor damage occurred in North Korea, previously impacted by Typhoon Prapiroon earlier in September. Rainfall peaked at 147 mm (5.79 in) in Kaesong. Saomai somewhat exacerbated the unprecedented damage caused by Prapiroon, and damaged maize crops which were set to be harvested in the coming weeks. =Elsewhere= At its closest approach to China, Saomai generated high waves that coincided with high tide, resulting in extensive damage. In preparation for the storm, schools in Ningbo were forced to close, and ferry service was discontinued. Over 20,000 people were evacuated by the Chinese government onto higher land. The most severely affected Chinese province was Zhejiang. A station in Dinghai District observed 102 mm (4.02 in) of rain in 18 hours, equivalent to more than half of that station's monthly average. In Zhoushan, 20,000 hectares of farmland were inundated and 2,500 homes collapsed. Off the island, ten fishing boats collided, and another oil tanker capsized. Areas in Gaoting were submerged under as much as 1 m (3.3 ft) of water. Off the coast, 225 boats and 130 piers were damaged. In Shanghai, 20 streets were flooded and hundreds of homes were flooded with water. At nearby Hongquiao Airport, an Airbus A340 bound for Paris slipped off the runway. Though no people were injured, the airport was closed for eight hours. The typhoon also caused the Huangpu River to rise to its third highest level in recorded history. Despite being a much weaker storm upon impacting Russia, Saomai's rains flooded coal retrieval sites, cutting down on electric power supplies in Primorsky Krai. Due to the shortages, electric power was transferred there from other surrounding areas. Furthermore, a 50 percent decrease in electricity output was documented at the local power station in Luchegorsk. To the south, an overflowing of the Kazachka River prompted the evacuation of over 60 people. Overall, 55 automobile accidents occurred in eastern Russia, leading to nine fatalities and 76 people injured.

The two-story building was constructed in a predominantly African American community along Guilford road, one of the \\"rolling roads\\" for hand-rolled barrel shipment of tobacco to market in Annapolis, Maryland. The building was constructed in conjunction with Asbury United Methodist Church built prior to 1860. The building is a wood sided two-story gable front building constructed on brick columns. The bottom floor was open for community use. The side yard has a shared cemetery for Lodge members with a mix of marked and unmarked graves. The building resides on a half acre lot provided by Cornelius and Catherine Mack for $16 in 1896. An adjoining lot to the church was set aside for a colored school, which was not built. The modern Maryland Route 32 built in the 1960s parallels Guilford Road and is considered detrimental to the historical character of the site. In a 2003 historical inventory, the building was listed as vacant and had significant roof damage from a fallen tree and the property boundaries were reduced to a quarter acre.

It was directed by Edwin L. Marin from a screenplay by Florence Ryerson and Edgar Allan Woolf, based on the 1934 novel of the same name by S. S. Van Dine. It was the ninth film in the Philo Vance film series.\\"Notes\\" on TCM.com Plot Gentleman detective Philo Vance (Paul Lukas) begins an investigation when he receives an anonymous letter stating that society man Lynn Llewellyn (Donald Cook) will be in danger when he appears at the casino owned by his uncle, Kinkaid (Arthur Byron). Vance visits the Llewellyn estate, which is run by Mrs. Priscilla Kinkaid-Llewellyn (Alison Skipworth), the matriarch of the household, and stumbles into one of the family's many quarrels. At the end of the bitter quarrel, which involves Mrs. Llewellyn's son Lynn and his wife Virginia (Louise Henry), Virginia announces that she has decided to leave the house and go to Chicago. During the tiff, Vance and Doris (Rosalind Russell), Mrs. Llewellyn's secretary, are introduced to each other, and Doris immediately takes a liking to Vance. Vance takes Doris to his home, where he and District Attorney Markham (Purnell Pratt) show her the mysterious letter. Doris immediately recognizes the return address as being that of the Llewellyn's townhouse in Closter, and notices that the letter was typed on her typewriter. Vance assigns Sergeant Heath (Ted Healy) to help stake out the casino that night, but their presence does not prevent Lynn from suddenly collapsing at the card table. At the same time, Doris informs Vance that Virginia has died at the Llewellyn house. Markham begins his investigation of the murder by questioning Mrs. Llewellyn, who recalls having quarrelled with Virginia before she was poisoned, and Amelia (Isabel Jewell), Mrs. Llewellyn's daughter, who admits that she too had a spat with Virginia. Meanwhile, Doris finds Mrs. Llewellyn's recently altered will, in which she disinherited Kinkaid, making it apparent that Lynn and Amelia would be the only ones who would benefit from Mrs. Llewellyn's death. Other clues begin to surface, including Kinkaid's unusual collection of books on chemistry and poisons, and a loaded gun found in Virginia's bedroom. Soon after Lynn's recovery, Mrs. Llewellyn is found dead of an apparent suicide, with a note, bearing her signature, in which she confesses to Virginia's murder. Not convinced that the mystery has been solved, Vance pursues his theory, and discovers a secret laboratory where Kinkaid has been making the newly discovered heavy water; it is not yet known whether this is a poison. Kincaid holds Vance and Doris captive at gunpoint, but they escape. Still, Vance believes that Kinkaid is not the murderer, but is merely one of many decoys set up by the real killer to lead the investigation astray. The real killer turns out to be Lynn, who gave himself a small dose of poison before. He lures Vance and Doris to the Closter townhouse to kill them. But before Lynn completes his \\"perfect crime\\", Vance reads from a letter he wrote earlier in which he detailed his theory about the killings. In it, Vance names Lynn as the murderer, calling him a rich, egomaniacal weakling, who, being tired of his wife, poisoned her and threw the blame on his uncle, whom he despised. After hearing Vance's summary of the murder plot, Lynn tells his captors that he has arranged to pin Vance and Doris' forthcoming murder on Kinkaid. However, when Lynn shoots Vance, Heath and others emerge from behind a door where they have been recording Lynn's confession and arrest him. After thanking Mrs. Llewellyn's maid Becky (Louise Fazenda) for loading Lynn's gun with blanks, Vance resumes his romance with Doris.

She wrote in her autobiography Life is a Banquet that MGM forced the role on her, and that afterward, her maid would tell her: \\"If you don't behave ... I'm going to tell people about that Casino Murder Case.\\" Production Originally William Powell and Myrna Loy were intended to star in The Casino Murder Case, but Powell was tired of playing Vance - he was the first actor to play the part on film,Steinberg, Jay S. \\"The Casino Murder Case\\" (article) on TCM.com and had played in the part in five earlier films\\"William Powell\\" on TCM.com - so MGM planned to use Otto Kruger, and then Fred Keating (who would have been borrowed from Columbia Pictures), Warren William, and Ricardo Cortez, before settling on Paul Lukas. Eugene Pallette was to have played the police sergeant, but was first replaced by Edward Brophy, and then Ted Healey. Constance Collier was to have played \\"Mrs. Llewellyn\\", before Alison Skipworth was borrowed from Paramount Pictures for the role. Critical response Andre Sennwald in the New York Times wrote \\"Paul Lukas just isn't the Philo Vance type and his reticent drawing-room manner seems a feeble substitute for the dashing qualities which made William Powell the best of the cinema Philos. Rosalind Russell works very hard at being agreeable in the Myrna Loy style, but with no vast success. Miss Skipworth, of course, is characteristically excellent as the foolish dowager, and there are good performances by Arthur Byron as the chief suspect and the comical Ted Healy as the halfwit detective. The best work in the film, though, is contributed by Isabel Jewell as the morbid and dipsomaniac daughter of the house.\\"Sennwald, Andre. \\"Philo Vance Solves the Big Poison Mystery in \\"The Casino Murder Case,\\" at the Mayfair.\\" New York Times (April 17, 1935) More recently, Turner Classic Movies called the film \\"a diverting series entry that was faithful to Van Dine's original story,\\", and Allmovie agreed that Paul Lukas \\"is simply not the right type for the part\\" and that \\"it is largely because of Lukas that the film is not one of the better entries in the series.\\" The review characterizes the work of Alison Skipworth and Isabel Jewell as \\"excellent\\" and Eric Blore and Charles Sellon as \\"strong\\" performances, but says that Rosalind Russell \\"hasn't quite yet hit her stride here.\\" As a result, the mix of comedy and mystery in the film \\"isn't as smooth as one might wish.\\"Butler, Craig. \\"Review\\" on Allmovie.com ReferencesExternal links  * Category:1935 films Category:American films Category:American mystery films Category:American black-and-white films Category:English-language films Category:Films scored by Dimitri Tiomkin Category:Films based on American novels Category:Films based on mystery novels Category:Films directed by Edwin L.

The railroad's nicknames were the Columbia Tap and the Sugar Road. The railway absorbed track from an earlier short-lived line and reached West Columbia in 1860. After the American Civil War, the railroad ran into serious financial difficulties and was sold to the Houston and Great Northern Railroad. It was the only railroad that failed to repay money borrowed from the Special School Fund and the only railroad that could trace its title to the State of Texas. The line operated as part of the Missouri Pacific Railroad until 1980 when it was bought by the Union Pacific Railroad. In 2014, the part of the line closest to downtown Houston existed only as the Columbia Tap Rail-Trail, the portion of the line between Houston and Arcola was still in service and the section between Arcola and West Columbia was abandoned. History 1871 map showing the Houston Tap and Brazoria Railway in Texas, along with other railroads In 1850 the Buffalo Bayou, Brazos and Colorado Railroad was chartered and in 1852 the company started construction. In 1853 the line reached Stafford and by January 1, 1856 the railroad ran from Harrisburg to Richmond. Worried that their city was being bypassed, the authorities in Houston desired to connect their city with Richmond by tapping into the B.B.B.&C.; This was accomplished by building of the Houston Tap Railroad from Houston south to Pierce Junction. Originally known as Peirce Junction, this location was named for Thomas Wentworth Peirce, a wealthy businessman who owned a plantation near Arcola. Incorporated on September 1, 1856, Houston Tap and Brazoria Railway was authorized to start in Houston and run south to West Columbia, then called Columbia. The charter also called for the line to continue from Columbia into Wharton County and to take over existing track from the Houston Tap Railroad. Construction on the Houston Tap started on April 7, 1856 and the completed line opened on October 21. The Houston Tap and Brazoria Railway purchased the Houston Tap from the city of Houston in June 1858 for $130,000 in stock and a loan of $42,000. The $42,000 loan was to be made once the railroad got its own loan from the state's Special School Fund. Houston was responsible for repayment of the loan. The line reached Sandy Point in 1859 and East Columbia in 1860. Present day right-of-way Diamond cross where the BNSF Railway intersects the ex-Missouri Pacific in Arcola, Texas. The view is to the west along the BNSF from the grade crossing at FM 521. A hike and bike trail in Houston is called the Columbia Tap Rail-Trail. It starts at Dowling and Walker Streets near downtown Houston and heads to the southeast. The trail turns southwest along Velasco Street and continues in the same direction under Interstate 45, past Texas Southern University, across Braes Bayou and ends at State Highway 288 (South Freeway) and Dixie Drive. The railroad terminus is located at 3131 Holcombe Blvd. a short distance south of the trail's end. From there, the line continues southwest across U.S. 90 Alternate before curving to the south- southwest so that it parallels Farm to Market Road 521 (FM 521) or Almeda Road. Without deviating from the same heading, the railroad tracks follow FM 521 under Interstate 610, through Central Southwest Houston, under State Highway Beltway 8, through Fresno and end just south of Arcola. At Arcola, the line connects with the east-west BNSF Railway. The former right-of-way ran along FM 521 from Arcola south through Juliff, Sandy Point, Rosharon, Bonney, Chenango, and Anchor. At Anchor, the line curved to the southwest and then west, parallel with State Highway 35, before reaching West Columbia.

Universal Music Group (UMG) released it as a promotional single on 30 September 2013. Written and produced by Lorde and Joel Little, \\"Ribs\\" is an electronica and electropop song discussing Lorde's stress over ageing. Music critics gave \\"Ribs\\" generally positive reviews praising its lyrical content. Commercially, the track appeared on record charts in Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States. Lorde performed the song on numerous occasions, including on the Late Show with David Letterman, and on her debut concert tour in 2014. Production and composition \\"Ribs\\" was written by Lorde ‚Äî credited under her birth-name Ella Yelich-O'Connor ‚Äî and Joel Little who also handled production, engineering, instrumentation and mixing. It was recorded at Little's Golden Age Studios in Auckland, New Zealand. On 30 September 2013, Universal Music issued \\"Ribs\\" as a promotional single on the iTunes Store. Lorde said ageing, which she described as \\"a big stress\\" of hers, and \\"this big party I had when my parents went away\\" inspired her. \\"Ribs\\" was written on the day of the January 2013 Auckland Laneway Festival. \\"Ribs\\" is composed in the key of E major with a tempo of 128 beats per minute. Lorde's vocals span a range of B2 to B4 and its chord progression follows a sequence of A‚ÄìE‚ÄìFm7‚ÄìCm7. \\"Ribs\\" is a deep house-influenced electronica and electropop song, which starts ambiently and, according to Jason Lipshutz of Billboard, features an \\"exhausted-sounding Lorde growing more frantic with each passing second,\\" with lyrics that include the singer discovering her maturity and \\"grown-up problems.\\" In \\"Ribs\\", she references Canadian indie rock band Broken Social Scene's 2002 song \\"Lover's Spit\\". Consequence of Sound noted how Lorde's minimal production allowed her to sing in any melody, creating a \\"choral effect.\\" Live performances Lorde first performed \\"Ribs\\" and \\"400 Lux\\" at the Greenwich Village club Le Poisson Rouge. She also performed the song during a free concert on 7 September 2013 at the 5000 seat Vector Arena. On 24 September 2013, she performed the track at The Fonda Theatre in Los Angeles, California, and at a concert at the Warsaw in Brooklyn on 3 October 2013 along with other material from her album Pure Heroine. On 26 November 2013, Lorde performed the song on the Late Show with David Letterman, backed by a drummer and a keyboard player. Canadian producer Ryan Hemsworth remixed the track and released it under the subtitle \\"Let's Have a Sleepover Version\\". Lorde performed this version at the Coachella Valley Music Festival and other festivals in 2017, and on her debut Pure Heroine Tour (2013‚Äì2014); while a reworked version of the song was performed during the North American leg of her Melodrama World Tour (2017‚Äì2018). Reception \\"Ribs\\" received favorable reviews from music critics on its release. Mike Wass of Idolator praised the song's \\"vulnerability\\" and called it an \\"obtuse offering\\". Lindsay Zoladz of Pitchfork opined that \\"Ribs\\" was the best song Lorde had written so far. Pretty Much Amazing wrote a mixed review of \\"Ribs\\", describing it as a song with \\"slower, driving beats\\" that go nowhere. While the publication praised its \\"dark and cold\\" chorus, it was also critical of the \\"same stacked vocals, hypnotic percussion, and synthesized production\\" that made the track repetitive. Evan Sawdey of PopMatters called it one of the album's highlights, with the lyrics describing a \\"specific mood and atmosphere\\". Sawdey also compared the \\"steady club beat\\" that plays \\"underneath her words\\" to that of a heartbeat. The A.V. Club called \\"Ribs\\" the \\"best illustration of [Lorde's] gift,\\" while Jon Hadusek of Consequence of Sound placed it as one of the album's essential tracks in his review. Since its release, the song has appeared in several critics' lists. In 2017, Billboard ranked \\"Ribs\\" at number 12 on their list of the 100 Best Deep Cuts by 21st Century Pop Stars. Tatiana Cirisano, a reporter for the publication, wrote that it remains the singer's \\"most poignant reflection on the anxieties‚Äîand small thrills‚Äîof growing up\\". Uproxx placed the track at number 95 on its list of the Best Songs of the 2010s. Commercially, \\"Ribs\\" peaked at numbers 36 and 92 on the Australian and British streaming charts, and reached number 29 on the New Zealand singles chart.

Life and career  √âlie Semoun was born in France, to a Sephardic Jewish family of Moroccan-Jewish and Algerian-Jewish descent. In 1980 at the age of 17, Semoun wrote two collections of poems and two plays. Beginning in 1988, he had regular appearances on the television series Vivement lundi! on TF1, where he played a horse mounted on rollers. His comedy career began in 1990 with his partner Dieudonn√© M'bala M'bala, with whom he wrote and performed daring, skits with scathing takes generally taboo subjects such as racism and poverty, often playing up contrasts between himself and his partner in terms of origin, color, and religion. Their first show was held at Caf√© de la Gare in 1991. The duo acquired a certain notoriety in 1992 after several appearances on their fellow comedian Arthur's show Emission Impossible, where they were noticed for their particularly corrosive sketches. They followed this up with one success after another at Le Splendid Theater, Paris's Palais des glaces, and at Casino de Paris. √âlie and Dieudonn√© formed one of the most popular comic duos of the 1990s. In 1997 the duo split due to artistic and financial differences. √âlie resented how Dieudonn√© handled their relations with the media and admitted that he was unhappy that his friend had turned towards film (and that he left to appear in the United States) and antisemitism. Dieudonn√© managed the financial aspects of their career, and Semoun felt their money was not divided equitably.T√©moignage d'√âlie Semoun dans l'√©mission La parenth√®se inattendue, France 2, 14 novembre 2012 Breaking out on his own, Semoun continued his success with Petites Annonces d'√âlie (which had been at first intended to be a show with Dieudonn√©) alongside his friend the actor Franck Dubosc.

In 2003, he released an album of French songs called simply \\"Chansons\\". In early 2005, he performed in a show (co-authored with Franck Dubosc and Muriel Robin entitled √âlie Semoun se prend pour qui? √âlie Semoun maintained in the years following his separation with Dieudonn√© a complex and strained relationship with his former partner.

In 1877 Leeder became the owner of the property. The site was developed further in the late 1890s with the construction of a pair of parpeted fronted shops abutting the hotel at 84 Stirling Terrace. The mill ceased operations in 1908, but was later converted to a skating rink for the townspeople and was also used as a picture theatre, with the operator - Palace Picture Shows - bringing its own electric lighting plant. A cottage (brick with hipped iron roof) was constructed in 1910 on 86 Stirling Terrace adjoining the shop pair. In 1921 architect G. Pickering of Perth undertook some restoration of the hotel. The proprietor at that time was W.J. Murphy. Additions were also undertaken in 1947.

Bowls Victoria has a responsibility to govern the game as directed by World Bowls and Bowls Australia, to run events at state level and also to run Pennant competition in the Metro region. We have representative teams at Senior, Under-25, Under-18, Over-60 and Bowlers Arm levels. They also have a responsibility to promote the sport in the community at large and in minorities. Clubs can lean on Bowls Victoria for support in a range of areas. There are over 520 bowls clubs across Victoria, with 50,000 plus members affiliated with Bowls Victoria. History Whilst the game of bowls was well established in Victoria from the 1860s, there was no governing association for the sport until 1880. As early as July 4, 1867, the six clubs in existence at the time, including the oldest Melbourne Bowling Club, met and agreed to a set of rules for the game to be used in inter club matches.International Bowling Council, p. 18-22, Bowls Encyclopedia by J.P. Monro, Wilke & Co, 1951 Whilst the clubs had regular competition, it was not until 1880, when a Victorian side visited New South Wales, that the Victorian Bowling Association was founded on 23 July 1880. The sport in Victoria continued to be governed by its own set of laws, which differed to those applied in other parts of the country, particularly New South Wales, and Western Australia. It was not until after the formation of the Australian Bowling Council on September 22, 1911, that uniform rules across the states began to be consolidated into a single set of rules. In 1947, the association was granted \\"Royal\\" status, and became known as the Royal Victorian Bowling Association (RVBA).Bowls Australia History Following the unification of the RVBA with the Victorian Ladies Bowling Association (VLBA) (see Women's bowls in Australia) in December 2009, the organisation was renamed to become Bowls Victoria.Bowls Victoria Strategic Plan 2013‚Äì2017 Structure Bowls Victoria is governed by a Board of Directors, including a president, deputy president, finance director and 5 ordinary directors.

It was built in 1905 and added to the National Register of Historic Places on October 2, 1973. Originally built to be a hardware store by George Baldwin, the building was converted into a hotel in 1911 as George saw the potential profit from the railroad coming to town. He anticipated the railroad to come by the Link River, across the street from the building's location. Unfortunately for George, the railroad was instead built at the other end of Main Street, by the current Klamath County Museum. Nonetheless, the hotel was built and operated with unique characteristics. As the site of construction was a rocky hillside, the building was constructed by carving away the basalt and creating an incredibly sturdy foundation. This hotel has almost all rooms connected in order to create the ability to rent out either one room, or an entire suite of rooms. George's thinking behind this was that people would want to be able to have an office and apartment all connected. It also was the first building to have indoor plumbing in every room, even though running water wasn't available until 1908. History The Baldwin family consisted of George and Josephine Baldwin, and their children. They started a family and had their firstborn George, who died at the age of three. Their next child was Maud Baldwin, born in 1878, who became a prominent businesswoman and photographer. Three boys followed Charles, William, and Floyd (Zim), who became businessmen, owning and operating a mining operation, a hardware store, and an automobile dealership, respectively. George's later life found him in a senatorial seat from 1917 until his death in 1920. Leaving behind his unmarried daughter to care for her ailing mother and the hotel proved to be too much of a strain for Maud, who committed suicide in 1926 by drowning her self in the nearby lake. Before her death, Maud sold the hotel to a couple in 1923. The hotel in 1922 This couple, Andrew and Cordelia Moore operated the hotel until 1951 when they retired and gave the hotel to their daughter Vera Moore Jones and her husband, Mart Jones. The hotel in its later years operated as a residence hotel serving many elderly gentlemen, including Herbert Ballard, who lived in the same room of the hotel for 51 years. Ballard was an Englishman who worked as an accountant for the many (at the time) lumber companies in the area. His duration at the Baldwin made him the only resident to have lived there under all three sets of owners and he was informally adopted, spending his holidays with the Jones'. The Jones' era came to a close in 1971 due to the hotel falling into disrepair and the financial trouble of getting up to date on the fire code; ultimately, the hotel was forced to close. The destruction of the hotel was imminent until a group of concerned citizens came together and forced a reconsideration for the property. This led to Klamath County buying the property and all of its contents, including the original brass beds, dressers, claw foot tubs and other items from the long history of the building and its inhabitants. The conversion was considerably helped by former County Commissioner, Nell Kuonen to whom the Museum owes its gratitude. The hotel is now operated as a museum by Klamath County Museums, and is open from Memorial Day weekend through Labor Day weekend, and during the Halloween season for special reservation-only tours. One- and two-hour tours are offered, showcasing all four floors, an interesting look into the history of the building and Klamath Falls. Using its vast collection of items donated over the years, the museum is able to show a unique historical insight into many different topics, such as sporting in the great outdoors, child care, fashion, laundry, Victorian ideals, cooking, music, shopping, health care and a collection of movie theater memorabilia as owned by the Moore's and the Jones' who also operated theaters in Bly, Oregon and Dorris, California.

The town is in the Bland Shire local government area west of the state capital, Sydney. The Kikoira area produces wheat and wool and between 1939 and 1970 was home to one of Australia's largest tin deposits. Settlement The Kikoira area was set apart for soldier settlement after World War I. The railway came to Kikoira in 1929 with the completion of the Naradhan railway line. Homestead farms along the railway line were available for sale to \\"farmer's sons, wheatgrowers and landseekers generally\\" later that year.. By 1931, the district had a rugby league team and a subsidised school had been established. The New South Wales government built a 60,000 bushel silo for bulk handing of wheat at Kikoira in 1933. By around 1933, the first houses were established in the township and a public telephone was installed. The Bank of New South Wales established a branch in the town in 1935 and a bush nursing hospital was built the following year. The Sydney Morning Herald reported in 1937 that Kikoira-with neighbouring Ungarie, Tullibigeal and Weethalle-was experiencing a \\"building boom\\". An Australian rules football team was formed in 1938. The New South Wales Department of Education established a public school in the town in 1939. Tin mining In 1938, John Gibson, a gold miner and prospector at nearby Weethalle, arrived at Kikoira in search of more gold. Instead of gold, Gibson found a rich tin deposit. Gibson quickly developed a mine and by October that year, the mine was employing 21 workers. A \\"mild rush\\" ensued with a large area around Kikoira pegged for mining claims by March 1939. The mine continued to grow and in 1940 it was employing 140 workers, producing more tin than any field in Australia outside of Tasmania. The Sydney Morning Herald described the shanty town that grew up alongside what was called the Gibsonvale mine as a \\"scene unknown since the gold rush days\\". Miners who staked early claims became wealthy while other miners and their families were living in crude humpies made of bark and wheat bags. The mining activity saw a \\"boom\\" in trade in Kikoira. Victoria Cross winner Reg Rattey was working at the Gibsonvale mine when World War II broke out. Mining continued into the 1960s and 1970s. An alluvial tin treatment plant was built at Gibsonvale in 1968. The plant was designed to produce of tin concentrate per month and had an estimated life of five years based on tin reserves on site.

It was first formed in 1934 and was converted into the 15th Tank Corps in 1938. It was reformed in the Far East in 1940 and moved west before the German invasion of the Soviet Union. It fought in the First Battle of Smolensk, losing large numbers of tanks in the Lepel counterattack. The corps was encircled in the Smolensk pocket and after breaking out was disbanded in late August 1941. Its third formation, from elements of the 22nd Tank Corps, occurred in September 1942. The corps fought in: Operation Little Saturn, Operation Gallop, the Second Battle of Smolensk, the Dnieper‚ÄìCarpathian Offensive, and the Jassy‚ÄìKishinev Offensive. In September 1944, it became the 9th Guards Mechanised Corps.  First formation  The 5th Mechanised Corps was formed in 1934 at Naro-Fominsk from the 1st Mechanised Brigade and the 50th Rifle Division in the Moscow Military District, commanded by Komdiv Nikolai Rakitin. On 11 June the corps was given the honorific \\"named for Kalinovsky\\" in honor of Konstantin Kalinovsky, a Soviet military theorist. The corps included the 13th Mechanised Brigade at Kaluga, the 14th Mechanised Brigade at Naro-Fominsk, and the 50th Rifle and Machine Gun Brigade at Stalinogorsk. On 15 December 1934 the corps had 525 tanks, including: 159 BT tanks, 181 T-26s, 57 T-37/41, and 6 Vickers Medium Mark II tanks. The remainder were command or flamethrower tanks. On 1 January 1936 the corps had 436 tanks. Around this time, Kombrig Alexander Grechanik became the corps commander. In June 1937, Komdiv Mikhail Petrovich Petrov became corps commander. In September 1937 the 13th Mechanised Brigade was transferred to the 11th Mechanised Corps in the Transbaikal Military District and renamed the 32nd Mechanised Brigade. In October, a new 13th Mechanised Brigade was formed in Kaluga. On 7 May 1938, the corps' Separate Tank Battalion became the Moscow Military District's 4th Light Tank Regiment. In August 1938, the corps was converted into the 15th Tank Corps when the Red Army reorganized its mechanized forces to make them more tank-heavy. Second formation The 5th Mechanised Corps (Military Unit Number 4664) began forming on 1 July 1940 as part of the 16th Army in the Transbaikal Military District. The corps' headquarters and the 17th Tank Division were formed at Crossing 77 and the 13th Tank Division at Crossing 76 of the Molotov Railway. It was commanded by Lieutenant General Makar Teryokhin. The corps' headquarters was formed from the headquarters of the 51st Rifle Corps. The 13th Tank Division was formed from the 15th Light Tank Brigade. The 17th Tank Division was formed from the 37th Light Tank Brigade and included the 199th Flamethrower and 526th Transport Battalions. The 109th Motorised Division, formerly of the 12th Rifle Corps, joined the corps at Kharanor. On 11 March 1941 Major General Ilya Alekseyenko, the 17th Tank Division commander, became the corps' commander. The corps was ordered to redeploy west with the 16th Army on 25 May. It was loaded onto trains with the 57th Tank Division and moved west. On 12 June the corps arrived in the Kiev Military District and was unloaded from the trains. Corps headquarters, the 13th Tank Division, and the 109th Motorised Division were located at Berdichev. The 17th Tank Division was located at Isyaslav. When the German invasion of the Soviet Union began on 22 June, the corps was equipped with 1,070 tanks, including 59 flamethrower tanks and 10 BT-2 tanks, and at least 493 BT-7s. On 26 June, it was ordered to move with the 16th Army to the Orsha and Smolensk area.

Alekseyenko deployed the corps in two echelons: the 13th and 17th Tank Divisions attacked first, with the 109th Motorised Division in the second echelon. The 17th Tank Division ran into the 17th Panzer Division at Senno on 6 July at the beginning of the counterattack. The 13th Tank Division was attacked on its left flank by the 18th Panzer Division after advancing farther west than the 17th Tank Division. By 10 July the corps had been mostly destroyed. In the Orsha area the retreating corps was given replacement tanks and ordered to resume the attack the next day. The corps counterattacked toward Vitebsk from the south in conjunction with the 7th Mechanised Corps. Running into the 7th and 12th Panzer Divisions, the combined losses of both corps totalled 100 tanks. By the end of 15 July the corps was in the Smolensk pocket. From 17 July the remnants of the corps fought against the 12th Panzer Division and the 35th Infantry Division northeast of Orsha until forced to retreat by lack of ammunition to the Liubovichi area. Also, a detachment of remnants of the corps led by Colonel Alexander Lizyukov enabled elements of the 16th and 20th Armies to escape the Smolensk Pocket by defending the Solovevo gap in the German encirclement. On 18 July the corps was ordered to attack German troops in the Krasny region. On the same day, the corps was reported to be fighting in the Liady and Syrokorenye region, west of Smolensk, while retreating to the Gusino crossing, west of the city. On 19 July the 109th Motorised Division became the 109th Rifle Division. The 13th and 17th Tank Divisions fought against the 17th and 18th Panzer Divisions in the southern part of the pocket. The corps was moved to the northeastern sector of the pocket to attack towards Dukhovshchina with orders to keep the Solovevo corridor open. On 26 July it was reported to have 58 tanks left. The 1st Motor Rifle Division was attached to the corps in the Smolensk Pocket by 1 August. On the night of 31 July to 1 August, the corps escaped the Smolensk Pocket through a gap in the German encirclement. Corps deputy commander Major General Yevgeny Zhuravlev took command after Alekseyenko died of wounds on 2 August. On 5 August, after escaping the Smolensk pocket, the corps was ordered to concentrate southeast of Yartsevo. On 7 August the corps was ordered to concentrate southeast of Gzhatsk with the 57th Tank Division. On the night of 7 to 8 August, the corps was ordered to move southeast of Gzhatsk in front reserve. On 10 August the 13th Tank Division was disbanded as a result of heavy losses it had suffered in the pas month of fighting. The corps was disbanded on or around 24 August 1941 due to the Soviet reorganization of their mechanised forces into smaller units. The 17th Tank Division was converted into a tank brigade days later. Third formation The 5th Mechanised Corps was reformed on 8 September 1942 on the basis of the 22nd Tank Corps. It was formed in the Moscow Military District under the command of Major General Mikhail Volkov. The corps was mostly equipped with British Lend- Lease tanks, and on 31 October consisted of 2 T-34 tanks, 78 Matilda II infantry tanks, and 117 Valentine tanks, for a total of 197 tanks. On 1 November it included the 45th, 49th, and 50th Mechanised Brigades, and the 188th Separate Tank Brigade. At the time it was part of the Bryansk Front.Combat composition of the Soviet Army, 1 November 1942 By December it was part of the Southwestern Front. From 6 December the corps was part of the 5th Tank Army. At the time it had a strength of 193 tanks. The corps was to exploit the breakthrough in Operation Little Saturn. From 12 to 18 December, the corps and the 321st Rifle Division crossed the Chir River against strong resistance from the 11th Panzer Division and the 336th Infantry Division of XXXXVIII Panzer Corps. The corps captured a bridgehead wide and deep near Dalnepodgorovsky, but could not advance further. On 28 December the corps attacked towards Chernyshkovsky with the army, pushing Group Stahel back to the city outskirts, but the corps was thrown back by German reinforcements. By 30 December the Soviet attack had stalled, marking the end of Operation Little Saturn. Almost immediately afterwards, the corps was committed to fight in Operation Gallop from 1 January to 10 February 1943. After the operation, it was withdrawn to the Volga Military District with only the 45th Mechanised Brigade assigned on 1 March. On 31 March the corps' 168th and 188th Tank Regiments were combined into the 233rd Tank Brigade. By 1 April the 49th Mechanised Brigade was re-subordinated to the corps after being directly subordinated to the Volga Military District in March. The 49th was transferred to the Reserve of the Supreme High Command in April. On 1 May the corps was part of the Steppe Military District with the 2nd, 9th, and 45th Mechanised Brigades assigned and the 233rd Tank Brigade also joined the corps. On 1 June the corps was in the Reserve of the Supreme High Command. By 1 August it was part of the Western Front. The corps fought in the Second Battle of Smolensk and in the SpasDemensk Offensive of the battle to exploit the Soviet breakthrough on 13 August. It was relocated from Kirov to the 10th Army's sector of the breakthrough towards Vorontsovo and was attached to the army for the operation. By the time it attacked, the German troops' resistance had stiffened, and the corps became bogged down in heavy fighting in the Tyagaevo area, under air attacks which destroyed many of its Lend-Lease tanks. The corps had advanced by 16 August, when a heavy air raid resulted in significant losses, and it was withdrawn to the front reserve. It was returned to the front for the YelnyaDorogobuzh Offensive and became part of the 33rd Army on 20 August. The offensive began on 28 August, and the corps was committed to exploit the breakthrough, advancing on that day. The offensive resulted in the capture of Yelnya. The corps fought in the last stage of the battle, the SmolenskRoslavl Offensive. A destroyed Sherman of the type used by the corps. On 1 October the corps was part of the Western Front, and by 1 November it was back in the Reserve of the Supreme High Command. On 1 January 1944 it was part of the Moscow Military District. They were moved back to Ukraine after being resupplied and reinforced at Naro-Fominsk in December 1943. Between 1 and 12 January 1944 the corps was sent forward by rail to the Fastiv and Kazantin area. Marching , the corps concentrated south of Bila Tserkva. The 233rd Tank Brigade and 45th Mechanised Brigade were sent into combat after the march and lost a number of tanks. At this point most of their tanks were American M4 Sherman medium tanks. On 21 January it became part of the new 6th Tank Army. The corps fought in the KorsunShevchenkovsky Offensive from 26 January. At the beginning of the offensive, the corps had 106 tanks and 46 self-propelled guns and was almost at full strength. It was to break through south of Tinovka in conjunction with the 104th Rifle Corps, then advance towards Shubennyi Stav, which was to be taken on 26 January with Zvenigorodka. The Shpola region was to be reached on 27 January. For the attack, a tank brigade and a self- propelled gun regiment were held in the 6th Tank Army reserve. The advance of the corps and the 104th Rifle Corps bogged down and made little progress capturing the first German line. On 28 January the corps, without the 233rd Tank Brigade, was attached to the 40th Army and moved west because of a German counterattack. It marched from Malyi Vinograd to Staryi Zhibotin to repulse predicted German counterattacks. The German counterattacks did not materialise and the corps achieved \\"limited success\\" (according to a later Soviet General Staff study) with its own attacks. Three days later, the corps was ordered to march back to Malyi Vinograd. By the end of 31 January, it held positions in the Vinograd region. In early February, the corps attacked from the east towards Lysianka, Bosovka, and Malyi Vinograd against counterattacking German troops, pushing them back. On the evening of 3 February the corps was in positions between Zhabinka and Yablonovka. 10 days later, German troops captured Malyi Vinograd, pushing back the corps and other units. The front stabilized and the corps with the 6th Tank Army was moved back to the second echelon of the front. In March and April 1944, the corps fought in the Uman‚ÄìBoto»ôani Offensive. A tank regiment from the corps reached Mohyliv- Podilskyi on the morning of 19 March and by the end of the day the city had been captured. On the next night the Dniester had been crossed and by 21 March the corps was on the west bank of the river. On 4 August the corps was awarded the honorific \\"Dniester\\" for its actions in crossing the river and capturing BƒÉl»õi during the Uman‚ÄìBoto»ôani Offensive. In August and September, the corps fought in the Jassy‚ÄìKishinev Offensive. In accordance with Stavka order number 0306 the 5th Mechanised Corps was transformed into the 9th Guards Mechanised Corps on 12 September for its actions. On the same day the corps was awarded the honorific \\"Rymnik\\" for its actions in the capture of Rymnik.

Among Jews of this period, the name was one of the most popular, borne by about five percent of men. Thus, it has long been debated which Johns are to be identified with which. Mentioned in narrative=John, father of Simon Peter= Simon Peter is at times called ‚ÄúSimon, son of John‚Äù, though in Matthew the text has Simon Bariona.. The latter appears to be untranslated Aramaic, with bar meaning ‚Äúson of‚Äù and Iona being Jonah, or according to Bauckham, J√¥hana‚Äò, an Aramaized form of John. =John the Baptist= John the Baptist, son of Zechariah, figures prominently in the beginning of each of the four Gospels. The Synoptic Gospels distinguish him as ‚Äúthe Baptist‚Äù, but the Gospel of John omits this epithet, as no other John is therein mentioned by name. John the Baptist was beheaded during the ministry of Jesus, so in most cases he is easily distinguished from other Johns. Ford proposes that Revelation originated as prophecy of John the Baptist, expanded by his followers to produce the book in its current form, but most scholars reject this theory. =John the Apostle= John, son of Zebedee was one of the Twelve Apostles, along with his brother James.. This John is mentioned frequently in the Synoptic Gospels, but always (with a lone exception.) in company with his brother James; ; ; ; . or with Peter. or often with both.; ; ; . In the first eight chapters of Acts, Peter is always accompanied by a certain John,. who is almost certainly his fellow apostle, and is presumably also the John that Paul elsewhere lists with Peter and James as ‚Äúpillars‚Äù.. But after the execution of his brother James. in 44, this John is never again mentioned. There are many early indications that James and John were killed together. The response of Jesus to these two, ‚ÄúThe cup that I drink you shall drink; and you shall be baptized with the baptism with which I am baptized,‚Äù. has been understood since antiquity as foretelling their martyrdom. Indeed, Papias (c. 100) records that James and John ‚Äúwere killed by the Jews‚Äù,This point, however, is preserved only in Philip of Side (c. 435) and in an interpolation in the Chronicology of George Hamartolus (c. 860). and early martyrologies record the martyrdom of ‚ÄúJohn and James the apostles in Jerusalem‚Äù. Nevertheless, many ancient sources and many modern scholars identify John the Apostle as the author of some or all of the Johannine books, thereby claiming apostolic authority for them. Thus, John the Apostle is identified with John the Evangelist, probably also John the Elder, and, with still less certainty, John the Revelator, and also with the John who survived to old age in Ephesus. =John of the high-priestly family= This John is mentioned once in passing as present during the trial of Peter and John in Jerusalem, as recorded in Acts: ‚ÄúOn the next day, their rulers, elders, and experts in the law came together in Jerusalem. Annas the high priest was there, and Caiaphas, John, Alexander, and others who were members of the high priest‚Äôs family.‚Äù. Thus, he is probably distinct from John the Apostle, although some scholars (including the 5th Century writer Nonnus, as well as the Gospel of the Nazarenes) have suggested that the Zebedees' fishing business made them known to the high priest, while others conclude that being fishermen (owning multiple boats) is not synonymous with being poor nor precludes priestly connections, and some argue that the other disciple who was known to the high priest and who spoke to the servant-girl on duty there and brought Peter in mentioned in John 18:15 is likely to be the same disciple who is never mentioned by name in John's Gospel. However, the Sons of Zebedee are both present in chapter 21 in the count of five plus two (where seven is the 'complete' number) unnamed disciples. The Beloved Disciple is named as such separately; the other is likely Andrew, which would be the reverse of the first followers identified in John 1:35. Polycrates of Ephesus (c. 190) writes that John the Evangelist ‚Äúwas a priest, wearing the petalon‚ÄùPolycrates, Ep. ad Vict., apud Eusebius, Hist. Eccl. 5.24.1‚Äì8.‚Äîi.e., specifically that he had served as High Priest. In this, he seems to identify the Evangelist with this high-priestly John mentioned in Acts. Some modern scholars make the same identification, further citing from the Gospel ‚Äúthe other disciple, who was known to the High Priest.‚Äù. Although there is no conclusive proof, and early writings such as by Polycrates may be interpretations based on their reading of the gospels, there are many theories - as one example: given that Elizabeth, Mary's kinswoman, was a \\"Daughter of Aaron\\" (and so had priestly connections), so too would Mary's sister mentioned in John 19:25... and she is mentioned in a way, some suggest, that might indicate she is John's mother. =John Mark= ‚ÄúJohn, called Mark‚Äù is mentioned several times in Acts.. Such use of one Semitic name and another Greek name was a common practice among Jews of the time. He is usually identified with the Mark mentioned in various epistles,. and with Mark the Evangelist. This John is occasionally proposed as author of some of the Johannine works as well.Dionysius of Alexandria, On the Promises 2, apud Eusebius, Hist. Eccl. 7.25. Tarazi even goes so far as to attribute to him the Gospels of both Mark and John and all the other Johannine books. Johannine literature Guido Reni, St. John the Evangelist, 17th century. Five canonical books of the New Testament are ascribed to John and thus called collectively the Johannine literature: * The Gospel of John * The First Epistle of John * The Second Epistle of John * The Third Epistle of John * The Book of Revelation Only in Revelation does the text itself name its author as John;. the other Johannine works are ascribed to John only through their attached titles and other external references. Whether or not these attributions have a basis in historical truth‚Äîmodern scholars vary widely in their opinions about authorship‚Äîthe question remains of which John each of these attributions refers to. Since antiquity, many have considered the entire Johannine corpus to be the work of a single author, a certain John of Ephesus, whom many identified with the Apostle John, son of Zebedee. On the other hand, this identification and the authorship of individual works have also been disputed since antiquity. Thus, the reputed authors of the Johannine works are conventionally called more explicitly‚Äîwithout prejudice to the issues of actual authorship and of their mutual identification‚Äîas follows. =John the Evangelist= The author of the Gospel is termed John the Evangelist. In the Gospel, the name John occurs exclusively in reference to John the Baptist, and without that epithet, though ‚Äúthe sons of Zebedee‚Äù. (named James and John in the Synoptics) are also mentioned once. The Gospel even lacks a list of the Twelve Apostles. The anonymous ‚Äúdisciple whom Jesus loved‚Äù is identified in the closing verses as the one whose testimony the Gospel bears: ‚ÄúThis is the disciple who testifies about these things and has written these things.‚Äù. Ancient sources invariably identify this disciple with the Evangelist, and many modern scholars agree, though others consider that John the Evangelist fashioned the testimony of the Beloved Disciple into a Gospel, as Mark did for Peter, or hold on other grounds that the two are not identical. Further identification of the Beloved Disciple and/or the Evangelist with John the Apostle has been variously defended and impugned. Some scholars see the Gospel's ‚Äúand we know that his testimony is true,‚Äù. as indicating a second hand, of a hypothetical ‚ÄúJohn the Redactor‚Äù or some group of elders certifying the work. Bauckham, however, argues that this is simply the ‚Äúwe of authoritative testimony‚Äù of the author himself, used also in the Epistles.; . As was an ordinary practice of the time, the Evangelist may have employed an amanuensis. Apocryphal sources of about the 5th century variously name Prochorus, Timothy, or even Papias, and modern scholars have suggested others. =John the Elder= The short second and third epistles are addressed ‚ÄúFrom the Elder‚Äù.. On this basis, the author is termed John the Elder or John the Presbyter (presbyter being Greek for elder). Papias (c. 100) refers to a certain ‚ÄúJohn the Elder, a disciple of the Lord‚Äù, one of the ‚Äúelders‚Äù he had listened to, and from whose sayings he drew in his five-book Exegesis, now lost. Papias goes on to refer to him simply as ‚Äúthe Elder‚Äù. Most see Papias as referring to the same John, at least, who penned the epistles. In later centuries, some saw the address from ‚Äúthe Elder‚Äù in the second and third epistles as possibly indicating a different author than the other Johannine works, which cast doubt on their apostolic authority and therefore on their canonicity.Origen, apud Eusebius, Hist. Eccl. 6.25.10.Eusebius, Hist. Eccl. 3.25.3.Jerome, De Vir. Illustr. 18. =John the Revelator= Patmos and the seven churches of Asia. The author of Revelation is variously termed John the Revelator, John the Divine, John the Theologian, or John of Patmos. The text of Revelation identifies its author thus: ‚ÄúI, John, your brother and the one who shares with you in the persecution, kingdom, and endurance that are in Jesus, was on the island called Patmos because of the word of God and the testimony about Jesus.‚Äù. Patmos was an island near Ephesus, and Revelation begins with letters addressed to the seven churches of Asia, which were Ephesus and other nearby cities. Dionysius of Alexandria (c. 250) closely criticized Revelation and concluded that it was starkly different from the Gospel and First Epistle (which Dionysius regarded as both the work of John the Apostle) in grammar, style, content, and anonymity, and thus could hardly be the work of the same author, but must have been written by another John, for ‚Äúthere are two monuments in Ephesus, each bearing the name of John.‚Äù Many modern scholars have concurred with this analysis, but others find striking similarities on closer inspection and attribute the stylistic differences to the Evangelist's use of an amanuensis. The ancient scholars who accepted Revelation as authentic, however, invariably identified its author as John the Evangelist. Our earliest and most reliable informant is Irenaeus (c. 180), who knew John's personal disciples while in Smyrna. Irenaeus firmly identifies the Revelator with the EvangelistIrenaeus, Adv. Haer. 3.16.5, 8; 4.20.11. and tells us that he remained with the Church in Ephesus until the time of Trajan (98‚Äì117).Irenaeus, Adv. Haer. 2.22.5, 3.3.4. The Revelator was still publicly active until the close of Domitian‚Äôs reign (81‚Äì96), as Irenaeus says:Irenaeus, Adv. Haer. 5.30.3. From Irenaeus‚Äô ambiguous syntax, some later writers inferred that the exile to Patmos occurred under Domitian, though others explicitly ascribed it to Nero (54‚Äì68); modern scholars still debate which is more likely. Clement of Alexandria, a contemporary of Irenaeus, tells an anecdote of John and the young robber captain, which opens with:Clement of Alexandria, Quis dives salvetur 42. So again the Revelator is identified with the Bishop of Ephesus, about whom ancient sources have much to say. John of Ephesus Patristic sources from as early as the 2nd century widely attest to a certain John, a disciple of Jesus, who lived to old age in Ephesus, and to whom all the Johannine works are ascribed. Whether such a man existed, which works he wrote, whether this figure has been confused or conflated with a second John, and whether he is identical with John son of Zebedee or any other John in the New Testament are all matters of intense controversy. Ary Scheffer, Christ and St. John, 19th century Irenaeus (c. 180), who cites from Papias and ‚Äúthe elders‚Äù and also personally knew Polycarp of Smyrna, another disciple of John of Ephesus, is widely considered the most reliable authority we have on this John. In our first extant description of all four Gospels, Irenaeus concludes:Irenaeus, Adv. Haer. 3.1.1. Here, John the Evangelist is clearly identified with the Beloved Disciple and located in Ephesus. Elsewhere Irenaeus unmistakably cites this same John as author of the Epistles and Revelation as well. Irenaeus also speaks of the aged John surviving in Ephesus until the time of Trajan (98‚Äì117), which would be about 70 years after the Crucifixion. Polycrates of Ephesus (c. 190) is another especially respected source on John, writing of his own relative and predecessor (following the Philip the Apostle): Polycrates is in accord with Irenaeus, but seems to additionally identify John with the high-priestly John in Acts. The earliest evidence on the identity of this John is from Papias of Hierapolis, a ‚Äúhearer of John‚ÄùIrenaeus, Adv. Haer. 5.33.4. writing c. 100, whose work survives only in fragments quoted by others. Papias writes:Eusebius, Hist. Eccl. 3.39.4. Translation from , p. 417. So, Papias refers first to John the Apostle, listed with his brother and others of the Twelve, whose words the elders had handed down to him, and then to John the Elder, another disciple of Jesus, who was himself still being heard. Though some have interpreted these as two references to the same John, Bauckham argues that Papias is clearly distinguishing them. Papias then goes on to cite ‚Äúthe Elder‚Äù (just as the Second and Third Epistles are addressed from) on the origins of the Gospels of Mark and Matthew at least,Eusebius, Hist. Eccl. 3.39.15. and also to cite from the First Epistle and Revelation. Papias‚Äô account of the origin of the Gospel of John is apparently paraphrased and expanded by EusebiusEusebius, Hist. Eccl. 3.24.5‚Äì13. and is most likely the source for the Muratorian Canon (c. 170) when it says:Papias: Hypothetical Fragments . The Acts of John, an apocryphal Gnostic work thought to have been composed around the late 2nd century, paints a rich, full narrative about John that was profoundly influential on later sources. Here we find the first explicit identification with the son of Zebedee, the story of the attempted execution by boiling oil also reported by Tertullian,Tertullian, De Praes. Haer. 36. the manner of John's natural death, and a great deal more. From the 3rd century onward, legends about John abound, with little hope of untangling any truth from the fiction. It is clear that John of Ephesus was regarded from the earliest times as a personal disciple of Jesus and a crucial witness to his life, an author of scripture, an apostle, and a great leader among the churches of Asia; whether he was also the son of Zebedee, one of the Twelve Apostles, is much more doubtful. No such identification is explicit in the early sources, apart from the clearly apocryphal, until the middle of the 3rd century. At most, John of Ephesus is occasionally called apostle, but in those cases the term is certainly not confined to the Twelve, and when mentioned with one of the Twelve Apostles, the Evangelist is in fact usually called a disciple by contrast. Bauckham argues that Papias distinguishes them and that the words of Polycrates even preclude such identification, and echos of this distinction linger in a few later sources. Among the orthodox, Origen is the first to explicitly accept the identification, which requires him to reconcile the tradition of John's natural deathJerome, Comm. in Matt. 20.23, apud , p. 206. with the prophecy of John's martyrdom by seeing the latter fulfilled in his temporary exile to Patmos.Origen, In Matt. 16.6, apud , p. 36. On the other hand, after this point the identification was almost universally accepted in antiquity. On whether or not John of Ephesus is to be identified with any of the Johns in the New Testament narrative‚Äîthe son of Zebedee, the high-priestly John, or even John Mark‚Äîmodern scholars remain divided.

It received its world premiere at the Miami International Film Festival on March 1, 2013 and was released to DVD on December 31, 2013. The film stars John Glover, David Mazouz, and Lou Diamond Phillips as three people whose stories ultimately lead them - and friends - to become patients of a sanitarium. Plot The film is divided into three short stories framed by Dr. Henry Stenson, a psychiatrist who is treating three patients with unique disorders. Each one is preceded and succeeded by Stenson giving a monologue about his interpretation, except for the last patient, whom he interviews directly. The second patient's story is additionally framed by a psychiatrist student about to write a thesis by reading the patient's file. = Figuratively Speaking = Gustav, an aged, disheveled doll artist, works for his old friend, Sam, who helps showcase his creations. He is assisted by the young Mateo, whom he is unaware has been drugging his alcohol with a psychoactive drug which soon drives Gustav into believing that his creations can talk. He is especially obsessed with a female doll whom he named Madeline, who talks him into killing Sam, his assistant, and also Mateo's lover, Isabelle. After Mateo discloses what he had done, Gustav commits suicide, but not before saying that Mateo can now own his creations. The segment is closed with the deranged Mateo opening a box containing Gustav's creations, as Stenson wonders which one is controlling which. = Monsters are Real = A young boy, Steven, who has catatonic schizophrenia, lives with his abusive father, who forces him to do household chores while he goes to a stripper club everyday. Steven feels stalked by a man clad in black with a black fedora. One day, while having his attention at a friend's pornographic magazine, the man stops him from leaving, revealing his monstrous face, but he suddenly disappears when Steven's teacher, the kind Ms. Lorne, arrives and holds Steven responsible for the magazine. Suspecting that his father is abusive after seeing him rudely fetching Steven home while refusing to explain his neck bruise (actually caused by the monstrous man), she trails them. Before Steven is abused, the man manifests and stuffs him into a burlap sack before killing Steven's father. He also kills Ms. Lorne when she comes in, leaving Steven unresponsive by the time the police arrive. Dr. Stenson narrates the events afterward: Steven is transferred to the sanitarium where he remains a catatonic, hallucinating the monstrous man well into his adulthood, yet Stenson sometimes can see him smiling while looking at the sky. = Up to the Last Man = Presented in an anachronistic order, the segment tells the story of a college professor called James Silo, who is also an avid conspiracy theorist of the 2012 doomsday event. He believes that on 21 December 2012, the planet Nibiru will collide with the Earth and to protect himself and his family, he builds a bunker underground, containing a small bedroom and working room, hydroponic culture to sustain food, and a heater. Throughout the segment, it became apparent that James' obsession had distanced himself from reality; his students began to leave his class until no one was left, dismissing him from his university. He ignored his wife, Allison, and sons Caleb and Kyle and spent his savings to build the bunker. Eventually, Allison decided to call the staff from the sanitarium to confine James, yet he managed to escape and began to live in the bunker for over 640 days, believing that he is the last man left and that his family are dead. What James does not learn until the end, however, is that he was the one who killed them after escaping from the sanitarium. In grief, James swallows a pill and opens the bunker to find Allison framed by a white light. She catches him when he falls, caresses him, and says that everything is alright. The segment is closed with the scene before James escaped from the sanitarium. While being interviewed by Dr. Stenson, he states his belief that everything is an illusion and that \\"they\\" are laughing at him. A mid-credits scene shows Stenson discovering James having escaped the sanitarium and left his doomsday timer under the pillow, followed by the first scene of the segment: James waking up to his 640th day in the bunker.

M. Bratton. He approached Ramirez and Ortiz with the intention of each of the three directors directing one of the film's stories. Ortiz liked the film's concept, as it reminded him of the 1973 film, Tales That Witness Madness, and the 1980s horror series, Tales from the Crypt. Filming for all three segments was done in Texas, and each segment was completed in five days. St. Anthony Catholic High School and the area of Monte Vista in San Antonio was used for the second sequence. Valderrama experienced some difficulty while shooting his segment, Up to the Last Man, as the filming location was on \\"the second story of a warehouse in between a highway and a train station, in July, with no air conditioning.\\" Valderrama also researched doomsday preppers for the segment, as he wanted the actions of James Silo to seem realistic. Ramirez also performed research for Figuratively Speaking, in addition to drawing from his personal experience as an artist. Reception Critical reception for Sanitarium has been mixed. The movie received praise from Ain't It Cool News, who wrote that the anthology was \\"a pretty good one\\" but expressed some frustration that the dialogue from the mental health physicians was not entirely accurate to how they spoke to patients in real life but also noted that this was a common problem in cinema. Starburst gave the film 7 out of 10 stars, remarking that the film wasn't perfect but that it \\"does make the most of what it has\\". In contrast, the San Antonio Current criticized the film as \\"not very interesting\\" and remarked that \\"Wrapping up each segment with a thought-provoking morale would have served the film better. Instead, Sanitarium goes for the clich√© and easy way out\\". Shock Till You Drop panned Sanitarium, praising its production values while opining that it was \\"too bad such a production went into such bad stories.\\" ReferencesExternal links * * Category:2013 horror films Category:Films shot in Texas Category:2013 films Category:American horror anthology films Category:American films ","title":"Sanitarium (film)"},{"id":"41618376","text":"Lake Cataouatche is a 9,280-acre lake located southwest of New Orleans, Louisiana in St. Charles and Jefferson Parishes.

The division suffered heavy losses during fighting against German forces during the Battle of Smolensk and was converted into a tank brigade in late August 1941.  History  The 17th Tank Division was formed in July 1940 at Crossing 77 with the 5th Mechanised Corps from the 37th Light Tank Brigade. It also included the 199th Flamethrower and 526th Transport Battalions. The 17th Tank Division's structure in 1941 included the 33rd and 34th Tank Regiments, the 17th Motor Rifle Regiment, the 17th Howitzer Artillery Regiment, the 17th Reconnaissance Battalion, the 17th Transport Battalion and the 17th Maintenance Battalion. The division was commanded by Major General Ilya Alekseyenko. On 1 March 1941 Colonel Ivan Korchagin took command. Beginning on 12 June 1941 the division was relocated to Izyaslav. A destroyed T-26 of the type used by the division After the German invasion of the Soviet Union, the division moved with the corps to Smolensk. The division was 60% Ukrainian in early July, and German troops attributed its reportedly poor performance to its ethnic composition. On 6 July, the division had 413 tanks, including 237 BT tanks and 130 T-26 tanks. The remainder were flamethrower or amphibious tanks. The division fought in the 5th Mechanized Corps' counterattack towards Senno and Lepel. The division was placed in the corps' first echelon during the counterattack. When it reached the region south of Senno, the division, reinforced by 6 KV-1 and 10 T-34 tanks, ran into the 17th Panzer Division. The counterattack failed with heavy losses. The division was encircled in the Smolensk Pocket, in which it defended the Dnieper line to the west of the city. The division fought against the 17th and 18th Panzer Divisions, which were attempting to establish positions on the southern bank of the river. On 25 July, the division had three KV tanks, four T-34s, 73 BT tanks, 28 T-26s, and 16 KhT-26 flamethrower tanks, for a total of 124 tanks. On the night of 31 July to 1 August, the division and the rest of the corps escaped the Smolensk Pocket through the gap in the German encirclement line. On 28 August, it was converted into the 126th Tank Brigade. On 31 August, the 17th Motor Rifle Regiment was awarded the Order of Lenin. The brigade was destroyed in the Vyazma Pocket in October. It was not officially disbanded until 22 August 1942.

Each lagna has a fixed maraka or marakas. The two luminaries, the Sun and the Moon, and the lord of the 9th house generally do not become marakas. The lords of the 2nd and the 7th house, or the malefic planets occupying anyone of these named houses and associated with their lords are the Primary determinants of death. The Secondary determinants of death are the benefic planets in association with lords of 2nd and 7th house or the lords of the 3rd and 8th house, or the lord of the 3rd or the 8th associating with the lord of the 2nd or the 7th house. The Tertiary determinants of death are Saturn associating with any of the afore stated marakas, the lord of the 6th or the 8th associated with a maraka, and the least powerful planet in the horoscope. The transit influences of the Sun, Mars and Jupiter are taken into account for determining the time of death. Longevity The results of the good and the bad karmas collected by man between intervals of births become known in this birth, and the pattern of life the aggregate of man‚Äôs karma shape are comprehended with the aid of Jyotisha. For the purpose of ascertaining the possible span of life the Amsayu method should be adopted if at the time of birth the Lagna is vested with strength; the Pindayu method, if the Sun is strong, and the Nisargayu method, if the Moon is strong. If at the time of birth the lord of the 8th house counted from the lagna happens to occupy a kendrasthana the person will be long-lived; if the lord of the 8th house or the lord of the lagna is in the 8th house afflicted by inauspicious planets the person will be short-lived. The use of Nisargayu, the Pindayu, the Lagnayu, the Amsayu, the Rashmiayu, the Chakrayu, the Nakshatrayu and the Ashtakavargayu methods are employed for determining longevity, but longevity is determined on the basis of the strength of the horoscope in its entirety, and the dasa of planets. The planets most afflicted by maraka-propensities by aspect, association or occupation are cause of death, death indicated on the basis of transits can occur only when the directional influences in the birth- chart warrant. The ordinary span of man‚Äôs life rarely exceeds one hundred years. Parasara has on a very broad basis classified three categories of life- spans ‚Äì Alpayu up to thirty-two years, Madhyayu beyond thirty-two years but less than seventy-one years, and Poornayu beyond seventy years up to the maximum of one hundred twenty years. Diseases alone are not the cause of all deaths, but diseases resulting from bad karmas cannot be cured. The grant of term of life depends on Bhagya (luck), and a person not blessed with good health does not enjoy to any extent his granted term of life. Planets causing death The moment of death is indicated by the Chhidra grahas; the Chhidra grahas are a) the lord of the 8th house, b) the planet in the 8th house, c) the planet aspecting the 8th house, d) the lord of the 22nd drekkana from the lagna, e) the planet in conjunction with the lord of the 8th house, f) the lord of the 64th navamsa from the Moon and g) the Atisatru (the bitter enemy) to the lord of the 8th house. Vaidyanatha Dikshita, in his Jataka Parijata, takes note of six Arishta- dashas ‚Äì even one papagraha devoid of strength and benefic influence indicates death during the course of its dasha in the period corresponding with the mandala occupied by it, the dasha of the planet in rasi-sandhi brings illness and disease, a person suffers set-backs and reverses in the antra-dasha of the planet situated in the 6th or the 8th house from the lagna in a sign owned by a papagraha, death occurs during the course of the 5th dasha of Mars or Rahu, or the 6th dasha of Jupiter or the 4th dasha of Saturn or the dasha of the debilitated planet occupying an inimical sign or occupying Vipata, Nidhana or Pratyari nakshatra, the person suffers loss of things indicated by the planet situated or aspecting the 2nd or the 7th during the antra-dashas of the lords of the 2nd and the 7th ; death is likely to occur when the lord of the sign occupied by the lord of the drekkena falling in the 8th house or its dispositor, transit the navamsa occupied by them. He also takes note of the dasha or antra-dasha of the weakest Chhidra-graha (‡§õ‡§ø‡§¶‡•ç‡§∞ ‡§ó‡•ç‡§∞‡§π) during which period death is likely; the lord of the 8th, the planet situated in the 8th, the planet aspecting the 8th house, the lord of the 22nd drekkena, the planet combining with the lord of the 8th, the lord of the 64th navamsa counted from that occupied by the Moon and its bitter foe are the seven Chhidra-grahas. The lords of 2nd and the 12th house cause death; the malefic planet situated in the 2nd house is stronger than the lord of that house, and the malefic planet in conjunction with the lord of the 2nd house, who also has the powers of the 12th house lord, is stronger than the malefic planet which happens to be in the 2nd. The 7th house lord becomes a stronger maraka if it also owns a trika-bhava (the 6th, the 8th or the 12th house counted from the lagna), malefic planets acquire the power to kill when associated with the 8th, 2nd or 7th house or their lords, the dashas of the marakas (lords of 2nd, 7th, 6th and 12th) can bring about death, lord of 12th and planet in the 12th bring about death when all else has failed. When Saturn is malefic and is associated with planets causing death or with the lord of the 3rd or the 11th house then Saturn becomes the prime effective maraka to cause death. Saturn situated in the 6th house prolongs life. Death can occur in the dasha of a weak benefic planet occupying the 8th house or the lord of the lagna can give yoga and kill the native. Venkateswara, the author of Jataka Chandrika, also states that in the antra- dasha of a maraka in the dasha of a Raja yoga-karaka, Raja yoga effects will be experienced but the same will break in the antra-dasha of a malefic planet; that the benefic associated with a maraka does not kill but a malefic can. If the lagna is strong Amsayurdaya method is to be applied for calculating longevity, but if the Moon is strong then it is the Naisargika Ayurdaya method that is required to be applied. Marakas & Marakasthanas The 8th house from the lagna is the house of longevity; the 8th house counted from the 8th i.e. the 3rd house, is also the house of longevity. The 12th house counted from the 3rd and the 8th i.e. the 2nd and the 7th houses from the lagna, are the marakasthanas (the death-inflicting houses), and the lords of the 2nd and the 7th are designated as the principal Marakas (the inflictors of death or the killers). Effect Maraka means the one that causes death at the end of a life-span or causes ill-health. The maraka for Aries lagna is Venus for it owns both marakasthanas; Mars, Moon, Venus and Jupiter are the marakas for Taurus lagna; the Moon for Gemini lagna; Saturn for Cancer and Leo lagnas; Venus for Virgo lagna; Mars for Libra lagna; Venus for Scorpio lagna; Venus and Saturn for Sagittarius lagna; Mars, Moon and Jupiter for Capricorn lagna; the Sun, Mars and Jupiter for Aquarius lagna, and for Pisces lagna, Mercury and Saturn are the designated marakas. The marakas and the planets associated with the marakas, and all malefic planets can cause illness and death during the operation of their dashas but if longevity is over but the dasa of maraka is not operating then the lord of the 12th house acts as the maraka and its dasha or the dasha of a malefic can cause death. Saturn and Rahu are the Mrityu-karakas or significators of death. A Maraka does not kill in its own antra-dasha in the dasa of a benefic planet but it does so in its antra-dasha the dasha of a malefic. Saturn associated with a maraka kills, and death generally occurs during the course of the antra-dasha of the lords of the trikabhavas in the dasha of a maraka. The lords of the 2nd and the 12th bhavas counted from the sign and bhava occupied by the Moon behave as marakas if they are natural malefic. Moreover, death can occur in the antra-dasha or dasha of the lord of the 3rd nakshatra from Janam nakshatra (asterism occupied by the Moon at birth) for a person of Alpayu (short-life), in that of the 5th nakshatra for a person of Madhyayu (Middle-life) and in that of the 7th nakshatra for a person blessed with Poornayu (long-life). The manner of death can be known from the yoga-formations occurring at the time of birth, e.g. if the Sun combines with Saturn and Rahu in the 7th house the person will be bitten by a cobra or if the Sun and Mars are in the 4th house aspected by or in conjunction with the lord of the 4th and the 10th, the person will be stoned to death or die by falling on a stone or by a falling stone. Death from punishment by ruler can occur if the Sun is in the 3rd or is influencing the lord of the 3rd house or by fire if it in the 8th or influencing the 8th house; similarly the Moon can cause death either by Tuberculosis or from excess fluids (or drowning); Mars from either a surgical operation, burns, injuries or from weapon or surgery; Mercury from either Febrile, illness, or from fever; Jupiter from either Tumours, swelling or from prolonged illness; Venus from either Diabetes or renal disease or from starvation; and Saturn and Rahu from poison, drowning, fall from height, injury, incarceration or from thirst or dehydration. Natural malefics cause illness or death in their dasha or antradasha; disease is possible in the body that is susceptible to diseases; a strong lagna and the strong lord of the lagna, and the natural benefics in the kendras prevent early or pre-mature death caused by illness or disease. Following are the marakas in their descending order of strength ‚Äì a) The malefic planet (as per Parasari qualification) in sambandha (association) with the lord of a marakasthana, b) The malefic planet in sambandha with lord of the 7th situated in the 2nd or the 7th house c) Lord of the 2nd house d) Lord of the 7th house e) Malefic planet in the 2nd house f) Malefic planet in the 7th house g) Natural benefic planet owning two kendras associated and with a maraka h) Rahu or Ketu in the 2nd or the 7th house combining with a maraka or situated in the 7th from a maraka i) Lord of the 12th house j) Malefic planet in sambandha with the lord of the 12th or situated in the 12th house k) Lord of the 3rd or the 8th weak and afflicted l) Lord of the 6th or the 11th house m) Any malefic planet as per Parasari qualification. The lord of the 8th house associated with a malefic planet, combining with Saturn or with the lord of the 10th house becomes a maraka if it is not situated in the 8th house; but if it also happens to be the lagna-lord then it will not act as a maraka if it occupies the 8th or the lagna. If Saturn is a functional malefic and also associates with a maraka then it becomes a very strong maraka, it will then supersede all other marakas and cause death during its own period or adverse transit. Planets associated with the lord of the 6th, the 8th, the 12th or a marakasthana cause suffering, misery and financial strain. Planets associated with the lord of a trikabhava and also simultaneously with marakas bereft of influence of the lords of the 5th and 9th bhavas, or the lagna-lord occupying the 12th house and the lord of the 12th situated in the lagna influenced by marakas, or the lord of the lagna in the 6th house and the lord of the 6th in the lagna influenced by marakas, or the lagna or the Moon afflicted by marakas, or the lagna occupied by Ketu and the lord of the lagna situated in the 8th, or the lord of the 5th is in the 6th and the lord of the 9th is situated in the 12th house influenced by marakas, or malefic planets, other than the lords of the 9th and the 10th house, are in the lagna influenced by marakas, or the lord of the navamsa occupied by Moon or the lagna-lord is located in a trikabhava associated with a maraka, they produce poverty and intense misery, and indicate loss or destruction of wealth, and troublesome period during the course of their antra-dasha or dasha. The dashas of marakas are important in determining the time of death but they should not always be taken to mean actual death. The dasha of a maraka not meant to cause death or the dasha of a malefic for a particular lagna not death-inflicting affects the health of a person. During the course of those dashas one may experience certain obstacles, death of someone close, change of place or of way of life and the like. The 7th house also indicates residence and long travels. The 22nd Drekkena is generally examined to ascertain the nature of death even though Varahamihira relates this drekkena with the disposal of the dead which falls on the 8th house, and is treated as an evil one. Any planet can acquire death-inflicting powers but the aspect of a strong Jupiter on the Moon, the Sun, Mars or Saturn neutralises their power to cause an early death. Jatakalankara states that if at birth the lagna-lord associated with a malefic is in a trikabhava or if the trika-lords occupy their own respective bhavas or if a malefic planet is in the lagna and the lagna-lord is weak, one suffers from acute mental and physical pressures and ailments. Sarvartha Chintamani states that the Moon in Cancer lagna aspected by Mars from the 10th and by Jupiter from the 7th while giving yoga gives a life span of sixty years only, whereas Jupiter exalted in the lagna and aspecting the two trikonas occupied by benefics makes one live for eighty years. Three or more planets situated in the 8th house not in their own or friendly or exaltation sign curtail term of life. Timing death The present day Hindu astrology favours the use of the Vimshottari dasha system along with the Gochara system for the purpose of prognostication and for the timing of events. The correct determination of longevity, and the timing of death is a difficult. Parasara states that the 8th house counted from the house occupied by Saturn at the time of birth is the Mrityu-bhava or the House of Death. Add up the number of Rekhas (malefic points) contributed by Saturn in the houses from the lagna to that occupied by Saturn, this figure will indicate the age at which adversity will strike the native; add up the rekhas contributed by Saturn from the house occupied by Saturn to lagna, this figure will indicate the age at which the native will suffer most severe physical adversity, and even death if so indicated by the maraka-dasha operating. Alternatively, add the number of rekhas contributed by Saturn in the houses from the house occupied by it to the Mrityu-bhava, multiply this figure by the Yoga-pinda and divide by 27 the remainder will indicate the nakshatra transiting which or the trine nakshatra therefrom Saturn will cause death, or add the number of rekhas contributed by Saturn in the houses from the house occupied by it to the Mrityu-bhava, multiply this figure by the Yoga-pinda and divide by 12 the remainder will indicate the sign or its trine that will be transited by Saturn at the time of death. Varahamihira in his Brihat Jataka states ‚Äì ‚ÄúDeath will take place in places similar to the rasi occupied by the lord of the navamsa, in which birth falls. Further details or specialities must be described by conjunctions and planetary aspects. The time of death has to be identified by the unrisen number of navamsas in the birth. If the birth lord aspects it, the time must be doubled; aspected by benefics the time will be trebled.‚Äù Narayanan Nambutiri, the author of Prasna Marga, who follows Varahamihira, in Chapter XXXII St.116-118 states that firstly total the bindus (before reduction) in Saturn‚Äôs Ashtakavarga from the lagna to the sign occupied by Saturn; and from the sign occupied by Saturn to the lagna, these two numbers will indicate the age when the native will be attacked by disease or misfortune; the total of these two figures also indicates the age of troubles. If the end or a beginning of a malefic dasha coincides with the age represented by these three figures, then death may take place. Multiply the Sodya Pinda of Saturn by the bindus in the 8th house from Saturn in his own Ashtakavarga, divide the product by 27; when Saturn transits the nakshatra represented by the remainder or trinal nakshatra, then death may take place. Multiply the bindus in the sign occupied by Jupiter or the Sun in Saturn‚Äôs Ashtakavarga by Saturn‚Äôs Sodya Pinda and divide the product by 12, the remainder will be the sign transited by Jupiter or the Sun respectively at the time of death.

The company was based in Palo Alto, California. It was founded in Israel in 2006 and has been regarded as part of the country's \\"Download Valley\\" cluster of adware companies. Superfish's software has been described as malware or adware by many sources. The software was bundled with various applications as early as 2010, and Lenovo began to bundle the software with some of its computers in September 2014. On February 20, 2015, the United States Department of Homeland Security advised uninstalling it and its associated root certificate, because they make computers vulnerable to serious cyberattacks, including interception of passwords and sensitive data being transmitted through browsers.  History  Superfish was founded in 2006 by Adi Pinhas and Michael Chertok.Superfish gets $10M for image search ‚Äì San Francisco Business Times, July 30, 2013 Pinhas is a graduate of Tel Aviv University.Q&A;: Adi Pinhas, founder and CEO of tech startup Superfish ‚Äì San Jose Mercury News, January 2, 2015 In 1999, he co-founded Vigilant Technology, which \\"invented digital video recording for the surveillance market\\", according to his LinkedIn profile. Before that, he worked at Verint, an intelligence company that analyzed telephone signals and had allegedly tapped Verizon communication lines. Chertok is a graduate of Technion and Bar-Ilan University with 10 years of experience in \\"large scale real-time data mining systems.\\"Executive Profile ‚Äì Michael Chertok ‚Äì Co- Founder and Chief Technology Officer, Superfish, Inc ‚Äì Bllomberg.com, retrieved February 20, 2015 Since its founding, Superfish has used a team of \\"a dozen or so PhDs\\" primarily to develop algorithms for the comparison and matching of images. It released its first product, WindowShopper, in 2011. WindowShopper immediately prompted a large number of complaints on Internet message boards, from users who didn't know how the software had been installed on their machines. Superfish initially received funding from Draper Fisher Jurvetson, and to date has raised over $20 million, mostly from DFJ and Vintage Investment Partners. Forbes listed the company as number 64 on their list of America's most promising companies. Pinhas in 2014 stated that \\"Visual search is not here to replace the keyboard ... visual search is for the cases in which I have no words to describe what I see.\\" As of 2014, Superfish products had over 80 million users. In May 2015, following the Lenovo security incident (see below) and to distance itself from the fallout, the team behind Superfish changed its name and moved its activities to JustVisual.com. =Lenovo security incident= Users had expressed concerns about scans of SSL-encrypted web traffic by Superfish Visual Search software pre-installed on Lenovo machines since at least early December 2014. This became a major public issue, however, only in February 2015. The installation included a universal self-signed certificate authority; the certificate authority allows a man-in- the-middle attack to introduce ads even on encrypted pages. The certificate authority had the same private key across laptops; this allows third-party eavesdroppers to intercept or modify HTTPS secure communications without triggering browser warnings by either extracting the private key or using a self-signed certificate. On February 20, 2015, Microsoft released an update for Windows Defender which removes Superfish. In an article in Slate tech writer David Auerbach compares the incident to the Sony DRM rootkit scandal and said of Lenovo's actions, \\"installing Superfish is one of the most irresponsible mistakes an established tech company has ever made.\\" On February 24, 2015, Heise Security published an article revealing that the certificate in question would also be spread by a number of applications from other companies including SAY Media and Lavasoft's Ad-Aware Web Companion. Criticisms of Superfish software predated the \\"Lenovo incident\\" and were not limited to the Lenovo user community: as early as 2010, users of computers from other manufacturers had expressed concerns in online support and discussion forums that Superfish software had been installed on their computers without their knowledge, by being bundled with other software. CEO Pinhas, in a statement prompted by the Lenovo disclosures, maintained that the security flaw introduced by Superfish software was not, directly, attributable to its own code; rather, \\"it appears [a] third-party add-on introduced a potential vulnerability that we did not know about\\" into the product. He identified the source of the problem as code authored by the tech company Komodia, which deals with, among other things, website security certificates. Komodia code is also present in other applications, among them, parental- control software; and experts have said \\"the Komodia tool could imperil any company or program using the same code [as that found within Superfish].\\" In fact, Komodia itself refers to its HTTPS-decrypting and interception software as an \\"SSL hijacker,\\" and has been doing so since at least January 2011. Its use by more than 100 corporate clients may jeopardize \\"the sensitive data of not just Lenovo customers but also a much larger base of PC users.\\" Komodia was closed in 2018.https://www.komodia.com/about  Products  Superfish's first product, WindowShopper, was developed as a browser add-on for desktop and mobile devices, directing users who hover over browser images to shopping Web sites to purchase similar products. As of 2014, WindowShopper had approximately 100 million monthly users, and according to Xconomy, \\"a high conversion to sale rate for soft goods.\\" Superfish's business model is based on receiving affiliate fees on each sale. The core technology, Superfish VisualDiscovery, is installed as a man-in-the-middle proxy on some Lenovo laptops. It injects advertising into results from Internet search engines; it also intercepts encrypted (SSL/TLS) connections. In 2014, Superfish released new apps based on its image search technology.

Biography Mochtar was born in Cianjur, West Java, Dutch East Indies, on 1 July 1918. He dropped out of school in the first year of Meer Uitgebreid Lager Onderwijs (junior high school). Sometime afterwards he was signed by the theatre company Miss Riboet's Orion for their football team; he had been a fan of the game since his youth. Mochtar was later asked to perform on stage. By the late 1930s he was skilled at the traditional martial art of silat. In 1939 Mochtar met The Teng Chun, owner and director of Java Industrial Film (JIF), while at a barbershop. Mochtar was signed to play opposite Hadidjah in JIF's upcoming film, Alang-Alang, as two lovers who confront bandits in a jungle. The Teng Chun intended Mohamad Mochtar and Hadidjah to become competitors to Roekiah and Rd Mochtar, who had become a popular on-screen couple owing to their success in Terang Boelan (1937) and Fatima (1938). Alang-Alang was successful, and Mohamad Mochtar was dubbed the \\"Tarzan of Java\\". This success led Hadidjah and Mochtar to be cast in romantic roles together for another five films for JIF. In 1940, Mochtar appeared in Matjan Berbisik (Whispering Tiger) as a man who fights his brother for the love of a young woman, then in Rentjong Atjeh (Rencong of Aceh) as a young man who fights pirates. In 1941 the pair appeared in another three films: Srigala Item (Black Wolf), Si Gomar, and Singa Laoet. Aside from his roles with Hadidjah, Mochtar also acted in several films for Action Films, a subsidiary of JIF, including Srigala Item and Tengkorak Hidoep (both 1941). Through these films Mochtar became one of the most famous actors in the Indies, recognised for his speed and courage. He did his own stunts ‚Äî including scenes such as jumping from a moving motorcycle to a truck. In March 1942, the Japanese occupied the Indies and closed all but one film studio, including JIF. Mochtar became a Heiho, a native soldier for the Japanese forces, and took up roles in propaganda films such as Berdjoang (1943). Indonesia proclaimed its independence on 17 August 1945, and for two years no fiction films were produced in the area. Mochtar made his first film after the proclamation, Bengawan Solo, in 1949. Through the 1950s Mochtar acted in various films, and worked as cinematographer on two. He left the industry in 1957. He attempted to work at a shoe factory, then tried to open his own hotel and restaurant. In 1967 he returned to film, acting in Menjusurui Djedjak Berdarah; this role garnered him a Citra Award for Best Supporting Actor at the 1967 Indonesian Film Festival. After his return to film Mochtar focused primarily on supporting roles, only taking two further lead roles: in Lampu Merah (1971) and Gara Gara (1973). At the 1979 Indonesian Film Festival he received a special award, the Pikiran Rakyat Trophy, for his lengthy career. Mochtar died in Jakarta on 1 December 1981. Filmography During his 42-year career, Mochtar appeared in some 63 films. He also handled cinematography on 2 films. =Cast= *Alang-Alang (1939) *Rentjong Atjeh (1940) *Dasima (1940) *Matjan Berbisik (1940) *Matula (1941) *Si Gomar (1941) *Singa Laoet (1941) *Srigala Item (1941) *Tengkorak Hidoep (1941) *Boenga Sembodja (1942) *Poelo Inten (1942) *Berdjoang (1943) *Di Desa (1943) *Keseberang (1944) *Bengawan Solo (1949) *Bantam (1950) *Pantai Bahagia (1950) *Terang Bulan (1950) *Tirtonadi (1950) *Air Mata Pengantin (1952) *Neng Yatimah (1953) *Timuriana (1953) *Djaja Merana (1954) *Sungai Darah (1954) *Bandar Djakarta (1955) *Korupsi (1956) *Teladan (1957) *Menjusuri Djedjak Berdarah (1967) *Djampang Mentjari Naga Hitam (1968) *Apa jang Kau Tjari, Palupi?

She was the convener of Maharashtra state unit of Aam Admi Party (AAP). During 2011‚Äì12, she exposed corruption in the Kondhane dam project through RTI queries. She came into the limelight in 2012, after she accused the Bharatiya Janata Party President Nitin Gadkari of having a business partnership with the Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar. She unsuccessfully contested 2014 Lok Sabha elections from Nagpur, as an AAP candidate against Gadkari. However, in March 2015, she quit the AAP amid allegations of horse trading against national convener and Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal. She has filed several PIL's against powerful politicians like Chhagan Bhujbal and Eknath Khadse. On 2 June 2016 she went on an indefinite hunger strike demanding the resignation of Eknath Khadse, which resulted in Khadse's resignation from the position of Maharashtra state Revenue Minister.  Anti-Corruption Activism = Kondhane dam issue = A pathologist by profession, Anjali Damania owned a 30-acre farm in the Kondivade village of Raigad district. In 2011, the government sent her a notice, stating that her land would be acquired for the construction of the Kondhane dam. In June 2011, she sent a letter to the Irrigation Department, asking for location of the dam as she wanted to check if her land would be submerged. She then went out of the country. When she returned in August, she found that the work on the dam had already started. She filed the RTI queries to know more about the project. Initially, she did not get any replies. After complaining to the Chief Information Commissioner (CIC), she received responses and found several irregularities. She found that the cost of the project had escalated from to in just one month after the contract was awarded. This increase was a result of a local elected representative's demand that the height of the dam be increased from 39 meters to 71 meters. In April 2012, along with another landowner Ajay Mathankar, she filed a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) in the Bombay High Court. The litigation ultimately forced the government to cancel the tender for the project. She also noticed similar cost escalations in other projects: the Kalu dam in Thane district, the Balganga dam in Raigad district and the Shai dam in the Thane district. The irregularities were found to be part of the bigger Maharashtra Irrigation Scam exposed by Vijay Pandhare. = Allegations against Nitin Gadkari = In September 2012, Vijay Pandhare's letter detailing the Maharashtra Irrigation Scam was leaked to the media, leading to the resignation of irrigation minister Ajit Pawar (nephew of the Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar). Subsequently, Anjali Damania claimed that she had met the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) President Nitin Gadkari thrice ‚Äì twice in 2011 and once on 14 August 2012 ‚Äì requesting him to pursue such cases in public interest. She alleged that Gadkari told her that he had a business relationship with Sharad Pawar, and therefore, he would not pursue the case. Gadkari rejected the allegations, saying that he had never met Damania, and sued her for defamation. The BJP denied any link between Gadkari and Pawar. She also alleged that Gadkari tried to prevent the BJP leader Kirit Somaiya from filing a PIL against the scam. In October 2012, she told media that Gadkari had misused his political contacts to usurp agricultural land in Khursapur for his firm Purti Power and Sugar Ltd (PPSL). The Times of India followed up on her allegations, and revealed that the company's shareholders included several shell corporations. Subsequently, the income tax department raided Gadkari's companies and associated firms. Gadkari had to step down as the BJP President in January 2013, after several party leaders including Yashwant Sinha protested against him. In December 2013, Gadkari stated that no evidence of corruption had been found against him despite all the investigations and the media hype. Damania refused to back out from her charges against Gadkari. = Kharvandi land controversy = After Damania filed the PIL against the Kondhane dam in April 2012, the tehsildar Jagatsingh Girase initiated an inquiry of all the land owned by her in the Karjat tehsil. Girase announced that Damania had provided inadequate proof of being a farmer for purchasing the land. The land was taken back by the government in 2012. Damania stated that she had followed all the legal processes required for changing the land use, and was being targeted for exposing the government corruption.  Political career  She joined the India Against Corruption (IAC) movement of Anna Hazare in 2011. After IAC split, she joined the Aam Aadmi Party, and became the convener of its Maharashtra unit. =2014 Lok Sabha election= Damania contested 2014 general election unsuccessfully from Nagpur constituency. She secured 69,081 votes, finishing fourth and losing her deposit. She lost to former BJP president Nitin Gadkari who secured 587,767 votes. On 5 June 2014, she announced her resignation from AAP, without stating any reason of her exit. However, she withdrew her resignation on the same day.  Personal life  Anjali Damania's husband Anish Damania is the CEO at IDFC securities. The couple have two children. According to Damania, her father was in the RSS, so she was brought up in an anti-corruption atmosphere. She obtained a diploma in Medical lab Technology from Premlila Vithaldas Polytechnic, Mumbai and later a Fellowship in Medical Laboratory Technology.  References.

In 1912 a preliminary expedition started aboard of the schooner \\"Herzog Ernst\\", a ship under the command of Alfred Ritscher and named after Ernst II, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg, the main sponsor of the project. The crew, among them the illustrator Christopher Rave, assembled on 1 August 1912 in Troms√∏. As the public fund-raising had been less successful than expected, Schr√∂der-Stranz searched for a way to improve the publicity. He changed the initial plans and proposed to cross Spitsbergen's Nordaustlandet from the South to the North, the first expedition to do so. The expedition left Troms√∏ on 5 August 1912.

It was later featured on her Tennis Court EP and the extended version of her debut album Pure Heroine (2013). The song was written by Lorde and Joel Little and was produced by the latter. The track was released as a single on 6 September 2013, via iTunes Stores, in a number of European countries and India. Characterised as a chamber pop and electropop song, \\"Bravado\\" addresses Lorde's introverted nature and the need to feign confidence in the music industry. The single was well received by music critics and peaked at number five on the New Zealand Artist Singles chart. Background and composition \\"Bravado\\" was written by Lorde (credited under her birth-name Ella Yelich-O'Connor) and Joel Little, while production for the song was handled by the latter. The track was written and recorded in 2012 at Little's Golden Age Studios in Auckland. Within a week, Lorde had finished recording \\"Bravado\\" alongside \\"Royals\\" and \\"Biting Down\\" during a school break. Chris Schulz, from The New Zealand Herald, described \\"Bravado\\" as a chamber pop piece, while The Village Voices Brittany Spanos called it an electropop song. Running for a duration of (three minutes and 41 seconds), the track is composed on electronic beats in the key of B minor and plays in common time at a moderate tempo of 88 beats per minute. Lorde's vocal range on the song spans from F3 to D5. The lyrics of \\"Bravado\\" address the idea \\"of false confidence delivering real confidence\\" and of Lorde stepping into a line of work where, she said, \\"everyone would be watching me, and everyone would want to talk to me and confront me\\". Lorde cited the line \\"Me found bravery in my bravado\\" from Kanye West's 2010 song \\"Dark Fantasy\\" as an influence. Simon Collins, of The West Australian, called \\"Bravado\\" a particularly prescient song, preempting Lorde's rise to prominence. At a point of the song, Lorde confesses \\"to a battle between shyness and show-business aspirations\\": :I learned not to want :The quiet of the room with no one around to find me out :I want the applause, the approval, the things that make me go oh. Promotion and reception On 6 September 2013, \\"Bravado\\" was released as a digital download single on iTunes Stores in India and various European countries. Lorde held a concert at Le Poisson Rouge in New York, which was her first U.S. live show, and performed the song among other tracks from The Love Club EP. On 3 October 2013, the singer held a concert at the Warsaw Venue in Brooklyn and performed the song among other tracks from the album. In November 2013, Lorde performed the song on the Late Show with David Letterman to promote The Love Club EP and Pure Heroine. Throughout the show, she was only backed by a drummer and a keyboard player. \\"Bravado\\" was additionally performed during Lorde's debut concert tour throughout 2013 and 2014. In 2014, she performed the track at Silo Park, Auckland on 29 January 2014 as part of her make-up show for the 2014 Laneway Festival, and at the Brazil edition of the Lollapalooza. \\"Bravado\\" was well received by music critics. Chris Schulz from The New Zealand Herald picked the song and \\"Million Dollar Bills\\" as the two best tracks from The Love Club EP. Jason Lipshutz, writing for Billboard, described the track as \\"delightfully spooky\\". In a review published in The Dominion Post, Tom Cardy compared the track's style to that of works by Florence Welch and Marina Diamandis, labelling it a \\"sharp, refreshing and smart\\" song. The song peaked at number five on the New Zealand National Singles and number twenty-nine on the US Hot Rock Songs chart.

He studied monumental sculpture under Robert Eberhard Launitz, at the same time as Casper Buberl with whom he would later collaborate. Power continued in this occupation before in 1868 establishing the National Fine Art Foundry, 218 East Twenty Fifth Street, New York. Many notable works of public art were produced by the foundry including several Civil War battle memorials. Power entered politics and became involved with Tammany Hall during the William M. Tweed era, later joining the other Democratic Party factions: Irving Hall and the County Democracy, becoming chairman of the latter. He was a prot√©g√© of Samuel J. Tilden, worked for Hubert O Thomson and held public offices including: Police Court Justice for 10 years from 1880, Shipping Commissioner for the Port of New York from 1893 and Aqueduct Commissioner from 1897. His political influence helped artists such as sculpture William Rudolf O'Donovan gain sponsorship for public works of art, many of which were soldier monuments commemorating the American Civil War. These were often cast at Power‚Äôs foundry. Power was the artist himself for similar works. Power died at his home 317 East Nineteenth Street in September 1902.

In general, an intersection curve consists of the common points of two transversally intersecting surfaces, meaning that at any common point the surface normals are not parallel. This restriction excludes cases where the surfaces are touching or have surface parts in common. The intersection of two planes The analytic determination of the intersection curve of two surfaces is easy only in simple cases; for example: a) the intersection of two planes, b) plane section of a quadric (sphere, cylinder, cone, etc.), c) intersection of two quadrics in special cases. For the general case, literature provides algorithms, in order to calculate points of the intersection curve of two surfaces.Geometry and Algorithms for COMPUTER AIDED DESIGN, p. 94  Intersection line of two planes  Given: two planes \\\\varepsilon_i: \\\\quad \\\\vec n_i\\\\cdot\\\\vec x=d_i, \\\\quad i=1,2, \\\\quad \\\\vec n_1,\\\\vec n_2 linearly independent, i.e. the planes are not parallel. Wanted: A parametric representation \\\\vec x= \\\\vec p + t\\\\vec r of the intersection line. The direction of the line one gets from the crossproduct of the normal vectors: \\\\vec r=\\\\vec n_1\\\\times\\\\vec n_2.

Intersection curve of a plane and a quadric  In any case, the intersection curve of a plane and a quadric (sphere, cylinder, cone,...) is a conic section. For details, see.CDKG: Computerunterst√ºtzte Darstellende und Konstruktive Geometrie (TU Darmstadt) (PDF; 3,4 MB), p. 87‚Äì124 An important application of plane sections of quadrics is contour lines of quadrics. In any case (parallel or central projection), the contour lines of quadrics are conic sections. See below and Umrisskonstruktion.  Intersection curve of a cylinder or cone and a quadric  It is an easy task to determine the intersection points of a line with a quadric (i.e. line-sphere); one only has to solve a quadratic equation. So, any intersection curve of a cone or a cylinder (they are generated by lines) with a quadric consists of intersection points of lines and the quadric (see pictures). The pictures show the possibilities which occur when intersecting a cylinder and a sphere: # In the first case, there exists just one intersection curve. # The second case shows an example where the intersection curve consists of two parts. # In the third case, the sphere and cylinder touch each other at one singular point. The intersection curve is self-intersecting. # If the cylinder and sphere have the same radius and the midpoint of the sphere is located on the axis of the cylinder, then the intersection curve consists of singular points (a circle) only. File:Is-spherecyl5-s.svgIntersection of a sphere and a cylinder: one part File:Is-spherecyl4-s.svgIntersection of a sphere and a cylinder: two parts File:Is-spherecyl-sing-s.svgIntersection of a sphere and a cylinder: curve with one singular point File:Is- spherecyl3-s.svgIntersection of a sphere and a cylinder: touching in a singular curve  General case: marching method  Intersection curve: principle of the marching algorithm In general, there are no special features to exploit. One possibility to determine a polygon of points of the intersection curve of two surfaces is the marching method (see section References). It consists of two essential parts: # The first part is the curve point algorithm, which determines to a starting point in the vicinity of the two surfaces a point on the intersection curve. The algorithm depends essentially on the representation of the given surfaces. The simplest situation is where both surfaces are implicitly given by equations f_1(x,y,z)=0,\\\\ f_2(x,y,z)=0, because the functions provide information about the distances to the surfaces and show via the gradients the way to the surfaces. If one or both the surfaces are parametrically given, the advantages of the implicit case do not exist. In this case, the curve point algorithm uses time-consuming procedures like the determination of the footpoint of a perpendicular on a surface. # The second part of the marching method starts with a first point on the intersection curve, determines the direction of the intersection curve using the surface normals, then makes a step with a given step length into the direction of the tangent line, in order to get a starting point for a second curve point, ... (see picture). For details of the marching algorithm, see.Geometry and Algorithms for COMPUTER AIDED DESIGN, p. 94 The marching method produces for any starting point a polygon on the intersection curve. If the intersection curve consists of two parts, the algorithm has to be performed using a second convenient starting point. The algorithm is rather robust. Usually, singular points are no problem, because the chance to meet exactly a singular point is very small (see picture: intersection of a cylinder and the surface x^4+y^4+z^4=1). File:Is- sphere4cyl1-s.svgIntersection of x^4+y^4+z^4=1 with cylinder: two parts File:Is-sphere4cyl2-s.svgIntersection of x^4+y^4+z^4=1 with cylinder: one part File:Is-sphere4cyl3-s.svgIntersection of x^4+y^4+z^4=1 with cylinder: one singular point  Application: contour line  A point (x,y,z) of the contour line of an implicit surface with equation f(x,y,z)=0 and parallel projection with direction \\\\vec v has to fulfill the condition g(x,y,z)= abla f(x,y,z)\\\\cdot \\\\vec v=0, because \\\\vec v has to be a tangent vector, which means any contour point is a point of the intersection curve of the two implicit surfaces : f(x,y,z)=0 ,\\\\ g(x,y,z)=0. For quadrics, g is always a linear function. Hence the contour line of a quadric is always a plane section (i.e. a conic section). The contour line of the surface f(x,y,z)=x^4+y^4+z^4-1=0 (see picture) was traced by the marching method. Remark: The determination of a contour polygon of a parametric surface \\\\vec x = \\\\vec x(s,t) needs tracing an implicit curve in parameter plane.Geometry and Algorithms for COMPUTER AIDED DESIGN, p. 99 : Condition for contour points: g(s,t)=(\\\\vec x_s(s,t)\\\\times \\\\vec x_t(s,t))\\\\cdot \\\\vec v=0.  Intersection curve of two polyhedrons  Intersection curve between polyhedrons: three houses Intersection of polyhedrons: two tori The intersection curve of two polyhedrons is a polygon (see intersection of three houses). The display of a parametrically defined surface is usually done by mapping a rectangular net into 3-space. The spatial quadrangles are nearly flat. So, for the intersection of two parametrically defined surfaces, the algorithm for the intersection of two polyhedrons can be used.Geometry and Algorithms for COMPUTER AIDED DESIGN p. 76 See picture of intersecting tori.

In addition to the judicial services of the regional court, the building houses sections of the Public Prosecutor's department (Staatsanwaltschaft) and of the district court (Amtsgericht). History and architecture The Bremen Courthouse in 1900 The courthouse and remand prison were built from 1891 to 1895 and from 1902 to 1906 by the Oldenburg architects Ludwig Klingenberg (1840‚Äì1924) and his partner Hugo Weber. Together with the two wings of the remand prison, the sprawling complex extends over an entire block.

History Alhambra was a resort town situated south of Helena and relied on the heavy traffic during the golden days of mining in the area. Alhambra and Sunnyside Hot Springs were the two hotels in the town, together composing a medical and recreational resort that flourished the 1860s until the 1950s. The hot water is now used to heat a retirement home on the site of one of the hotels. Alhambra Hot Springs consists of four main springs and a number of hot water seeps located along Warm Springs Creek. The water temperature averages 138 degrees F. The slightly radioactive hot water flows 0.25 mile downhill to the rehabilitation center, where the water is piped through the concrete floor for heating. In 1959, disaster struck when a fire destroyed the Sunnyside Hotel, which was never rebuilt. Although the water in the area was bottled and sold commercially and considered therapeutic in earlier years it was eventually found to be naturally radioactive and unfit for use. The days of Alhambra as a resort came to an end, though the area had already been in decline as mining production decreased. A post office operated at Alhambra from 1885 to 1947.

The Chartres was built in Nantes by Dubigeon-Normandie S.A. (later Chantiers Dubigeon S.A.) in 1974 for SNCF (French Railways) operations between Dover-Dunkerque and passenger service between Dover-Calais. Although the three ships were similar, there were small structural differences that included size of windows and design of funnels. The Chartres was delivered to SNCF on 9 January 1974 and visited Boulogne, Calais and Dunkerque on 15 February. Chartres entered service on the Dunkerque-Dover route on 25 February. She was christened at Calais on 6 March 1973. Launched on 12 September 1973, the Chartres briefly operated train ferry operations and was quickly transferred to Dieppe. From 1973, Chartres operated as a car and passenger ferry on the Boulogne-Dover and Calais-Dover routes during the summer; and as a train ferry on the Dunkerque-Dover route during the winter. In 1975-76, she was operated on the Dieppe-Newhaven routes between 1983 and 1990. It continued to service the English Channel until the summer of 1990, along the Dover-Calais route, on behalf of ALA from her berth at Dover's Western Docks. Sold to the Isle of Man Steam Packet line, it replaced the Saint Eloi (which had been rechristened the Channel Entente). In this role it operated cross-channel passenger service until the end of the 1993 season. Following the opening of the Channel Tunnel train ferry service ceased from the Dover Western Docks and Nord pas-de-Calais ceased, and it began to operate passenger traffic. Chartres collided with the Calais pilot boat Louis Magniez in 1978. Chartres operated on the Dieppe - Newhaven route from 29 May 1982. She was placed into service on the Dunkerque - Dover route in 1986 and again in 1988. On 25 January 1990, Chartres collided with the breakwater at Dieppe and was severely damaged. She was repaired at Rouen and re-entered service on 3 June on the Calais - Dover route. Due to a blockade of Calais later that month, Chartres operated on the Boulogne - Dover route before spending the last week of June on the Zeebrugge - Dover route. In October, she was switched to the Boulogne - Folkestone route. Chartres was chartered by the French Government in December for use as a troopship during the First Gulf War. She operated between Toulon and Yanbu, Saudi Arabia until June 1991. On return from trooping duties, she was chartered by Angleterre-Lorraine-Alsace, the French subsidiary of Sealink. During the winter of 1991-92, she operated on the D√∫n Laoghaire - Holyhead route. In May 1993, she was placed in service on the Calais - Dover route, making her final voyages on 24 September. =Express Santorini= The bow of Express Santorini in the Portas do Mar The vessel was acquired by Agapitos Express Ferries on 5 November 1993, and renamed the Express Santorini. It departed from Calais for Piraeus on 21 December, where there was a minor change in the ships livery following the takeover. From 1994, she operated the Piraeus-Paros-Naxos-Ios-Santorini route. On 8 November 1999, Express Santorini was sold to Minoan Flying Dolphins and was operated under the brand of Hellas Ferries, which remained unchanged following a 2000 rename of the mother company to Hellas Flying Dolphins. She operated on the Piraeus-Paros-Naxos-Ios-Santorini route. But, in 2005 while still operating on the same route, Hellas Flying Dolphins adopted the Hellenic Seaways name, and the ferry appeared in a revised blue hull colours. For technical reasons, in July 2006 it was laid-up in Drapetsona, following a major engine failure in June. Beginning in the summer of 2007, the Express Santorini was chartered by Atlantico Line to operate in the Azores between the islands of Faial, Pico and Sao Jorge, until 30 September. Alternately, during the winter season, it continued to Piraeus where it operated local services. Following a further period laid up at Drapetsona, Express Santorini was again chartered by Atlantico Line between June and September 2008; she was also chartered between May and October from 2009 to 2014. That year she was sold to Portucalence Shipping and remained in service in the Azores until the fall of 2016, when she was sold to Emirati company SAMC, taking the name Al Salmy 4.

In 1892, R. P. Farrar, the owner of Farrar General Store, made a request for a post office. However, he would discover that the name Salem had already been taken. Due to an already existing Salem in Missouri, the soon-to-be postmaster Farrar used his name as a temporary solution, which became permanent. Despite the community's name change, the church continued to be known as Salem.Family Tree Maker: Eggers http://familytreemaker.genealogy.com/users/e/g/g/Calvin-W- Eggers/BOOK-0001/0008-0001.html History The Salem congregation was founded on May 16, 1859 by eleven men who had settled in the area that is now Farrar. They purchased land from the English and Scotch-Irish settlers centered on the Abernathy Settlement, present-day Longtown, Missouri. The original congregation had some ties to the Paitzdorf congregation in Paitzdorf (present-day Uniontown), Missouri. Their first pastor was Rev. Theodore Karl Gruber, a son of the pastor that had led the immigration to Paitzdorf. The first church building, a log cabin, was dedicated in 1860 and was described at that time as \\"ein freundliches Blockhaus\\" or a friendly log cabin. The congregation grew with the influx of Lutheran settlers from Saxony, as well as more arrivals in 1866 from the Lamstaedt and Scheessel areas of Hanover. The present church building was erected in 1886 and dedicated on November 7, 1886. The cost of the building was $4,000. Each side of the building has three arched two-story windows, with an wrap-around balcony and an arched print stamped metal ceiling on the interior. The pulpit was originally located above altar on the back wall of the building, but was moved to the left side of the altar in 1927. The current pipe organ was dedicated on July 2, 1939.Farrar Congregation Observes 150th Anniversary, May 24, 2009 http://www.semissourian.com/story/1542048.html School Salem Lutheran School In 1867, a Lutheran school was established with the church building also serving as the school. The first school building, a brick schoolhouse, was dedicated on September 25, 1892. A second wooden framed school was constructed in 1926. Both buildings were razed and replaced with a new brick schoolhouse which was constructed and dedicated in 1958. In 1996, an addition was added to the school which contains school and church offices, meeting rooms and a gymnasium.

It has been located in Lun√©ville, Lorraine, France since 1730. History Auguste Majorelle, charger mid-19th century, Lun√©ville Jacques Chambrette Senior initially started the first fine pottery works in Lorraine in 1711. His son began in 1722 by trading faience in Lun√©ville. He built his own factory there in 1730, just before he obtained the royal permission. He formulated a new type of earthenware called \\"terre de Lorraine\\" in 1748 based on the study of English potteries. As soon as 1749, he was granted the label of official Royal manufactory by Stanislaus I, former king of Poland. At the time, Lorraine being indeed an independent state, France levied heavy taxes on goods imported from there, reason why Jacques Chambrette established as early as 1758 an additional factory in Saint-Cl√©ment, Meurthe-et-Moselle, only seven miles away, but located on French territory to escape those duties. However, at the death of the founder, the two factories were split between the family and Richard Mique bought in 1763 the Saint-Cl√©ment part. In 1786 S√©bastien Keller bought Luneville from the Chambrette family following the bankruptcy of the pottery manufacturer in 1785. For the next 137 years, the Keller family controlled the company. About 1832, S√©bastien Keller's son aligned with his brother-in-law Gu√©rin to give birth to the mark K&G; (or KG) from the names Keller and Gu√©rin. In 1900, there were around 1,100 employees. The factory's products had a worldwide reputation and participated successfully in various fields of art and industrial exhibitions.

During the French Revolutionary War she was stationed at Cherbourg and was successfully employed harassing British merchant shipping in the English Channel until the British captured her off the Cotentin Peninsula during the action of 20 October 1793. Renamed HMS Reunion, she served for three years in the Royal Navy helping to counter the threat from the new Batavian Navy, before she was wrecked in the Thames Estuary in December 1796. Construction La R√©union was built at Toulon between February 1785 and January 1787. She was one of a further five ships built to Joseph-Marie-Blaise Coulomb's 1777 design for the Magicienne-class frigates. La R√©union was launched on 23 February 1786.Winfield (p.206) French career On 20 April 1792 the Legislative Assembly voted for war with Austria thus starting a conflict which would become known as the French Revolutionary War. France declared war on Britain on 1 February 1793 and began to focus heavily on the disruption of British commerce through the deployment of frigates on raiding operations against British commercial shipping. In the English Channel, two of the most successful raiders were the frigates R√©union and S√©millante, both then based in Cherbourg on the Cotentin Peninsula. These frigates would make short cruises, leaving Cherbourg in the early evening and returning in the morning with any prizes they had encountered during the night.James (p.104) =Action of 20 October 1793= H.M.S. Crescent, under the command of Captain James Saumarez, capturing the French frigate R√©union off Cherbourg, 20 October 1793, att. John Christian Schetky The British response to the French raids was to attempt a blockade of the French coast, and to that end, despatched a number of vessels including the 36-gun frigate HMS Crescent, under Captain James Saumarez.Clowes (p.479) On the morning of 20 October, R√©union, under the command of Captain Fran√ßois D√©nian, and a 14-gun cutter, the Esp√©rance, were returning from a cruise when they were spotted by Crescent. A second British frigate, the 28-gun HMS Circe, was becalmed some away and Esp√©rance fled towards Cherbourg, leaving R√©union to engage Crescent alone. Although R√©union was bigger, compared to , and carried a larger crew; Crescent had a slight advantage in weight of shot, to and was marginally faster. After the opening exchanges, R√©union had lost her fore yard and mizzen topmast while Crescent had lost the top off her foremast. Both ships had rigging cut and a number of sails damaged but Crescent was still able to manoeuvre across R√©union's stern and rake her. This raking caused huge damage to the French ship and her crew, and although R√©union continued to resist for some time, she was no longer able to move effectively. With Saumarez about to cross his bow and Circe now rapidly approaching due to a strengthening wind, D√©nian realised he had no choice but to surrender his vessel.James (p.105) The engagement had lasted two hours and ten minutes during which time the cutter Esp√©rance managed to escape to Cherbourg. The French frigate S√©millante, which had been anchored in the harbour, was unable to come to R√©union's rescue because of contrary wind and tides. British career The captured ship was taken to Portsmouth where she was fitted out and finally registered as a British warship in May 1794. In the winter of 1794/5, France gained control of what was then the Dutch Republic and captured the Dutch fleet which had been frozen in harbour. Reunion was sent to become part of a newly formed British fleet to be stationed at Great Yarmouth and intended to oppose the threat from the new Batavian Navy.Woodman (p.53) Captain James Almes took command of Reunion in July 1795 and on 22 August led a small squadron that captured the Dutch ship Alliance in the North Sea. =Action of 22 August 1795= The Action of 22 August 1795 by Nicholas Pocock Reunion put to sea on 8 August in the company of HMS Isis, 50 guns, and Vestal, 28 guns, and on 12 August they were joined by another frigate, the 32-gun HMS Stag. On the 22nd, the squadron, under Almes orders, was cruising off the coast of Norway when at around 1300hrs, it spotted two ships and a cutter to windward and heading towards shore on a larboard tack. These ships proved to be the 36-gun frigates, Alliance and Argo, and the 16-gun cutter, Vlugheld.James (p.292) A favourable wind change allowed Stag to overhaul the rear most ship, Alliance, and bring her to action at about 1615hrs while the remaining British ships engaged in a running battle with Argo and Vlugheld. After an hour's fighting, Stag managed to force the surrender of her larger opponent but Argo, despite suffering much damage, and Vlugheld escaped into port at 1730hrs. =Later career= HMS Reunion remained on blockade duty in the North Sea for the rest of her career. In July 1796, command of HMS Reunion passed to Acting Captain William Hotham and then to Captain Henry William Bayntun who accidentally wrecked the ship on the Sunk Sand in the Thames Estuary on 7 December 1796. Bayntun and his entire crew survived and were later exonerated of blame for the loss of the ship.Heathcote (pp.1-2) CitationsReferences  *Winfield, Rif (2005) British Warships in the Age of Sail 1793‚Äì1817: Design, Construction, Careers and Fates.

Watson (born 1984) is a British writer and football coach. Once a semi-professional footballer himself, he is best known for serving as coach of the Pohnpei State football team and Federated States of Micronesia national football team in 2009 and 2010, an experience about which he wrote the 2012 book Up Pohnpei. Since then he has moved to Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia to assist in the founding of a new team, Bayangol FC. Early life and career Watson was born in Lethbridge, Alberta, Canada. He grew up in Shirehampton and Henleaze, and is a Bristol City F.C. fan. His brother Mark Watson is a comedian. He studied Italian language at the University of Leeds. He played football semi- professionally for East Fulham F.C. He would go on to become a sports journalist on the Channel 4 programme Football Italia. Coaching on Pohnpei In 2007, Watson and his friend Matt Conrad began looking into the possibility of becoming international footballers by joining a poorly-performing foreign team. At the time, Watson was working on a documentary about the world's weakest football teams. They started their internet research by looking at the results of the team at the bottom of the FIFA rankings at the time, the Guam national football team, and then trying to find which non-FIFA teams Guam had beaten ‚Äì most notably, the Yap football team with a score of 7‚Äì1 ‚Äì before setting their sights on the sole team which Yap had ever beaten: Pohnpei State Football Team. Unfortunately for Watson and Conrad, playing for a team in the Federated States of Micronesia would require them to first qualify for naturalisation under the country's strict nationality laws by marrying local women, learning a local language, and living in the country for five years, so they had to give up on that idea. However, the pair soon after decided that they could pursue a similar dream of becoming international football coaches instead, and got in touch with former Pohnpei coach Charles Musana, who had coincidentally just moved to London and initially thought the pair's query was part of a prank. Following two years of negotiations with Micronesian sports officials, Watson was eventually offered the coaching job, and took up his new post in August 2009; he stated that because he \\"had played to a reasonable standard in England\\", they were convinced he could perform adequately in his new role. This made him the world's youngest international football coach, beating out previous record-holder Paul Crosbie by two years. However, the position was unpaid. Watson and Conrad faced many challenges in their new role, including their players' level of physical fitness and addiction to betel leaf, and a toad infestation on their football pitch. Their efforts to set up games against Guam Men's Soccer League teams ran into difficulties with funding for travel; to overcome these difficulties, Watson visited the United Kingdom in an effort to raise sponsorship money for his team. He enlisted his brother Mark to hold a comedy fundraiser for the team. He even wrote to all 92 Premier League and Football League teams in an effort to secure kit donations; among them, only Spurs, Yeovil, and Norwich responded positively. Jim Tobin, secretary-general of the Micronesian Olympic Committee, also provided assistance in efforts to secure funding, but Watson stated that he had even had to pay for some equipment himself. Coyne Airways also provided transportation and sponsorship funds. Watson and Conrad led Pohnpei State on a four-game tour of Guam, which included a victory over Crushers F.C. with a score of 7‚Äì1. Later career After the end of his coaching career on Pohnpei, Watson went on to write a book about his experiences, Up Pohnpei, while Conrad began raising funds for a documentary on their time on the island, The Soccermen, scheduled for release in March 2014. Mark Lomas of ESPN praised Up Pohnpei as a \\"heartwarming, uplifting antithesis to all that is wrong with the modern game\\" and contrasted it positively with what he described as \\"prematurely-released autobiographies from prima donnas keen to detail their difficult Cristal-drinking existences\\" which dominated football literature at the time. The Big Issue similarly described it as \\"[f]unny without being condescending or smug\\" and \\"a refreshing counterpoint to the commercial excesses of the English Premiership\\". Nick Dorrington of When Saturday Comes also reviewed it favourably. Up Pohnpei also led to Watson's next international coaching opportunity: Enkhjin Batsumber read an article about the book and e-mailed Watson to ask if he would be interested in moving to Mongolia's capital Ulaanbaatar to aid in setting up a new team, New Mongol Bayangol FC. He moved to the country in late 2013. Unlike his previous coaching position, this one came with a salary. In contrast to Pohnpei's tropical climate and its frequent precipitation, Watson faced different challenges in Mongolia. The cold weather at the time of his arrival meant that try-outs had to be held indoors, as if for a futsal team. Watson began by holding public try-outs in an effort to find younger players, first in Ulaanbaatar, with further try-outs scheduled in Darkhan and Sainshand. A reality television show is being filmed around the try-outs.

He was a right-handed lower-order batsman and a right-arm off-break bowler. He was born at Selly Oak, Birmingham. On paper, Bridge's first-class cricket career appears to have been a fairly long one; in practice, after his return from National Service he had three full seasons with mixed success from 1959 to 1961 and then a struggle with injury, illness and form that lasted for several further seasons until his last game in 1968. Bridge made his debut at the age of 17 in a single match in 1955 and played in a few more first-team matches in 1956 before disappearing from first-class cricket for two years on National Service. He returned to Warwickshire in 1959 and after being omitted from the first team in the opening games was brought into the side before the end of May and then played regularly across the rest of the season. In June, bowling in tandem with his rival for the spinning role in the team, Geoffrey Hill, he took eight-second-innings Cambridge University wickets for 56 runs (11 for 109 in the match), and these remained the best bowling figures of his career. In the season as a whole, he took 85 wickets at an average of 22.60. Wisden Cricketers' Almanack noted \\"the increased usefulness of Bridge... whose ability to keep a length when under heavy fire rendered him a great asset on easy pitches\\". A year later, it was a much less happy tale for Bridge in 1960 that the 1961 edition of Wisden reported: \\"The poor form of Bridge came as a great blow,\\" it said. \\"The county have not enjoyed the services of a reliable off-spinner since the War and it had been hoped that Bridge would fill the gap in the spinning strength left vacant since the of Hollies, but he fell so far below expectations that he could not keep his place in the side.\\" In the 1960 season, Bridge's tally of wickets fell to 34 and their cost rose to 40.47 runs per wicket. Bridge returned to form in the 1961 season and had his best year in first-class cricket. He took 123 wickets at an average of 22.99. He was, Wisden recorded, \\"the first spinner in the country to take a hundred wickets\\". Against Glamorgan at the St Helen's cricket ground in Swansea, he took five for 48 and seven for 49 to finish with the best match figures of his career, 12 for 97, and was awarded his county cap after the game. That, however, was almost as far as Bridge's first-class cricket career went. He was ill in 1962 and could play in no more than six matches, and though there were occasional appearances in games over the next three seasons and a final one in 1968, he bowled fewer than 400 overs after the end of the 1961 season and took only 33 further wickets. Bridge's lower-order batting was occasionally useful in a team that was usually burdened with some genuine tail-enders: Roly Thompson, Jack Bannister and Albert Wright, for example. He passed 50 on three occasions in his career, with a highest score of 56 not out in the match against the 1959 Indian team, when he shared a seventh wicket partnership of 78 with Jackie Fox, whose 52 was the only half-century of his career.

Since 1893 it has been part of the British Museum's collection.British Museum Collection Discovery In the district of La Part-Dieu near Chatuzange-le-Goubet, among the ruins of a large Roman villa, a significant silver hoard was unearthed in 1888. The treasure, which consists of six pieces of antique dishes, seems to have been buried for safe-keeping, perhaps during the period of local insurrections that occurred at this time in Roman Gaul. It was discovered by the land-owner of the site who subsequently sold the treasure to a Paris art dealer, who in turn sold it to the British Museum in London. Description The whole treasure is composed of six pieces of high quality Roman silver that dates from the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD and has a total weight of 5.6 kg. There are two skillets, one of which is decorated with the figure of Felicitas between two rosettes and below her a woman offering a sacrifice at an altar, while the other is adorned with the necks of swans and a basket of fruit. Other items in the treasure include a large fluted washing- bowl with the figures of the Three Graces in the central panel, another fluted dish, a large plate and a small cup, both with a niello inlaid swastika, which was a relatively common symbol in the Roman Empire.

He was drafted into military service in 1671, and appointed stolnik after eight years of service as a Strelets sub-colonel. In 1682, he became a companion to the statesmen Fyodor Shaklovity and Ivan Miloslavsky. He was a campaigner for Sophia of Russia, who trusted him as her most faithful follower.

In 1687‚Äì1688, Tsykler took part in the first Crimean campaign of Vasily Galitzine. In 1689, after Peter I's revolt against Sophia, Tsykler informed him of Sophia's conspiracy; for this he was elevated to the rank of Duma nobleman and was sent as a voivode to Verkhoturie. In 1696, he was recalled to Moscow to build fortresses on the shore of the Azov sea. Many considered this appointment an honorable exile, but Peter I's increasing cruelty towards opponents of his reforms motivated Tsykler to plot against him. Other participants involved were okolnichiy Alexei Sokovnin and stolnik Matvei Pushkin. In February 1697, two Strelets, Yelizariev and Silin, notified Peter about Tsykler's plan to burn down the house in which the tsar was residing. Upon hearing this, Peter immediately personally arrested them and put them on trial. During the trial, Tsykler explained under torture that he was motivated by Peter's reproaches against his friendship with Miloslavsky. He also partially incriminated Sophia, leading to her imprisonment in the Novodevichy Convent. The exhumed corpse of Miloslavsky, who had died in 1685, was put under the scaffold during the execution of the conspirators. Following the execution on , the heads of Tsykler and his accomplices were put on pikes and exhibited in Red Square. Trykler's two sons were exiled to Kursk and forbidden to return to Moscow under the tsar's decree.

At age 29, McGill set a record for the fastest and only swim around Hong Kong Island which stood for over 40 years, and still holds the record for the fastest swim in a counterclockwise direction. Career At the 1962 British Empire and Commonwealth Games, McGill won the bronze medal in the women's 110-yard butterfly, the silver medal in the women's 440-yard individual medley, and the gold medal in the 4√ó110-yard medley relay. In 1964, she was banned by amateur swimming authorities for four years for alleged misbehavior at the Tokyo Olympic Games. In 1965, McGill moved to London on a working holiday visa. During the northern hemisphere summer of 1965, she accepted a dare to swim the English Channel. Although she had represented her country as an Olympic swimmer the year before, she specialized in fairly short distances and had never swum more than one kilometer at a time before--the Channel, by contrast, is 35 km. Officials of the English Channel Association were appalled to learn that she was about to attempt the Channel swim with only a few weeks lunchtime training and no long distance or cold water experience. McGill, however, decided to go ahead with the swim, feeling in part that success might help vindicate her earlier ban from Olympic swimming. She completed the long distance swim, becoming the first Australian to swim the English Channel on 7 August 1965, swimming topless and posing topless for press photographs after the swim. On this swim, she finished in 11 hours, 12 minutes and missed setting a then-world women's record by just 11 minutes. In an effort to beat the record, she formally petitioned for and was granted permission from the Channel Swimming Association to swim topless, in order to prevent the straps of her swimming costume from cutting into her shoulders, as they had done on previous long swims. In 1967, she beat the record with a time of just under 10 hours. On 23 May 1976, swimming topless most of the way, she became the first person ever to swim around Hong Kong Island, accomplishing this in 17 hours, 6 minutes. The swim, in a counterclockwise direction, was sponsored by Cathay Pacific and began and ended in Repulse Bay. McGill faced difficulties including jellyfish stings, pollution, objects in the water, ships, and inclement weather. Starting five miles into her swim, she took off her bikini top and went topless to avoid chafing. Although official records aren't kept for Hong Kong swims, this swim established an unofficial record for either gender that stood for over 40 years. McGill's record was beaten on 11 November 2017 by Simon Holliday, who swam the distance in 12 hours, 32 minutes.

Switzerland is a 2013 judgment of the European Court of Human Rights concerning public statements by Doƒüu Perin√ßek, a political activist, lawyer and former Chairman of the Workers' Party, who was convicted by a Swiss court for publicly denying the Armenian genocide. A preliminary hearing on the appeal by Switzerland was held on 28 January 2015. The Grand Chamber ruled in favour of Perin√ßek on 15 October 2015, who has argued his right to freedom of expression. Background During his visits to Switzerland, Doƒüu Perin√ßek, a Turkish political activist, repeatedly called the Armenian Genocide of 1915 a \\"great international lie\\".Akkoc, Raziye (15 October 2015). \\"Right to deny Armenian genocide upheld by European court in blow to Amal Clooney\\".

At the trial, Perin√ßek denied the charge thus: \\"I have not denied genocide because there was no genocide.\\" After the court's decision, he said, \\"I defend my right to freedom of expression.\\" Perin√ßek appealed the verdict. In December 2007, the Swiss Federal Court confirmed the sentence given to Perin√ßek.Court confirms verdict against Perin√ßek, SwissInfo, December 19, 2007 Perin√ßek then appealed to the European Court of Human Rights. Lower court judgment In December 2013 the Lower Court of the European Court of Human Rights ruled by 5-2 that Switzerland had violated Doƒüu Perin√ßek's freedom of expression guaranteed by Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights. It ruled that Perin√ßek had not abused his rights within the meaning of Article 17 of the Convention, which prohibits individuals using the rights of the Convention to seek the abolition or restriction of other individuals' rights guaranteed by the Convention. \\"The Court considers that the rejection of the legal characterisation of the events of 1915 was not in itself sufficient to amount to incitement of hatred towards the Armenian people\\", stated the court ruling. \\"The applicant has not abused his right to engage in open discussion of matters including those which are sensitive and likely to cause offence. The free exercise of this right is one of the fundamental aspects of freedom of expression and distinguishes a democratic, tolerant and pluralist society from a totalitarian or dictatorial regime.\\" ECHR Chamber Judgment, 2013 The Court pointed out that \\"it was not called upon to rule on the legal characterisation of the Armenian Genocide. The existence of a \\"genocide\\", which was a precisely defined legal concept, was not easy to prove. The Court doubted that there could be a general consensus as to events such as those at issue, given that historical research was by definition open to discussion and a matter of debate, without necessarily giving rise to final conclusions or to the assertion of objective and absolute truths.\\" Appeal and final judgement by the Grand Chamber  After the ruling the government of Switzerland announced its decision to appeal the lower court's ruling. On 3 June 2014 the court accepted the appeal to move on to the Grand Chamber to clarify the scope available to Swiss authorities in applying the Swiss Criminal Code to combat racism.European Rights Court Agrees to Hear Swiss Appeal on Perin√ßek Ruling.

Retrieved 3 June 2014 The first hearing took take place on 28 January 2015 with Perin√ßek represented by Professor Laurent Pech, head of Department of Law at Middlesex University in London, and Turkey represented as a third party by Prof Stefan Talmon, who is a professor of law at Oxford University.\\"ECHR adjourns ruling on Turkey's Worker's Party chair over 1915 statements\\", Hurriyet Daily News, published January 28, 2015 Switzerland was represented by lawyer Frank Sch√ºrmann while Armenia was represented as a third party by Doughty Street Chambers led by Geoffrey Robertson QC and Amal Clooney. The Court's subsequent deliberations were held in private. A video of the first hearing of the appeal can be found on the website of the European Court for Human Rights. While being fully aware of the acute sensitivities attached by the Armenian community to the issue in relation to which the applicant spoke, the Court, taking into account the overall thrust of his statements, did not perceive them as a form of incitement to hatred or intolerance. It is stated multiple times in the Grand Chamber Judgment that the applicant did not express contempt or hatred for the victims of the events of 1915 and the following years. The Grand Chamber held, by ten votes to seven, that there had been a violation of Article 10 of the ConventionECHR Grand Chamber Judgment, 2015 and ruled in favour of Perin√ßek on 15 October 2015. In a statement issued by Armenia's counsel, Geoffrey Robertson and Amal Clooney said they were pleased the Court had endorsed their argument on behalf of Armenia. The judgment did not dispute the fact of the Armenian genocide and recognised Armenians' right under European law to have their dignity respected and protected, including the recognition of a communal identity forged through suffering following the annihilation of more than half their race by the Ottoman Turks. The Grand Chamber also made clear that the court was not required to determine whether the massacres and mass deportations suffered by the Armenian people at the hands of the Ottoman Empire from 1915 onwards can be characterised as genocide within the meaning of that term under international law. It also added that it has no authority to make legally binding pronouncements, one way or the other, on this point. Furthermore, 7 judges, including then-President of the European Court of Human Rights Dean Spielmann notably stated in a joint dissenting opinion that it was self-evident that the massacres and deportations suffered by the Armenian people constituted genocide and that the Armenian genocide was a clearly established historical fact. \\"But that is not the question here. The case is not about the historical truth, or the legal characterisation of the events of 1915\\", they wrote. In the rest of their joint dissenting opinion, they detailed why they were unable to follow the majority's approach as regards the assessment of the applicant's statements. Reception Professor Dirk Voorhoof of Ghent University praised the judgment, arguing that it \\"would certainly be a sad day for freedom of expression in Europe\\" if the judgment was successfully appealed to the Grand Chamber. The Armenian writer Harut Sassounian described the Court's 2013 judgment an endorsement of the denialist stance of both Turkey and Perin√ßek.

The SAP founder, Fran√ßois Pilain, had a nephew called √âmile Pilain whom he trained in the automotive business and whose own company, Rolland-Pilain, presented its first car in 1907. Fran√ßois Pilain was based in the auto-making hub that grew up around Lyon, however, while his nephew‚Äôs business was based in Tours, more than to the west. Sources sometimes confuse the two companies, but in fact there was no link or collaboration between them, once the nephew had grown up and established his own company. History Fran√ßois Pilain (1859‚Äì1924) had a long career as an engineer-entrepreneur in and around the auto-business, working at different times with Gardner-Serpollet and La Buire. Between 1893 and 1897 he ran his own company, Soci√©t√© Fran√ßois Pilain, after which he worked for √âtablissements V. Vermorel. In 1901 Fran√ßois Pilain established his own business, as an automobile manufacturer, in Lyon. The cars were sold under the Pilain name, During 1906/1907 motor car chassis were being produced at the rate of approximately one per day. However, in 1908 SAP was placed in liquidation. It was permitted to continue in the auto-making business, but Pilain himself was obliged to resign, to be replaced by a new managing director called de Villeneuve. During the First World War the manufacturer assembled trucks for Hotchkiss. Afterwards, in 1920, it was taken over by a locally based recently created company called the Soci√©t√© Lyonnaise de l‚ÄôIndustrie M√©canique et Autos Pilain (‚ÄúSLIM‚Äù). Between 1920 and 1929 the factory produced cars using the ‚ÄúSLIM‚Äù badge. The cars SAP started out producing both twin cylinder engine cars and four cylinder cars, but production of the twin cylinder cars ended in 1904. In 1906 the manufacturer was offering cars with engines of 4000cc and 8600cc. These were joined in 1909 by a 1900cc model, and in 1912 a six-cylinder 2400cc model was added. By 1913 the Soci√©t√© des Automobiles Pilain was offering a broad range of cars with engine sizes from 1000 cm¬≥ to 6300 cm¬≥. The cars were meticulously constructed and therefore very expensive. A car of this type can today (2010) be seen at the Mus√©e Henri Malartre in south-eastern France at Rochetaill√©e-sur-Sa√¥ne.

He was acknowledged as one of the leading authorities on bioluminescence. He won the Rumford Prize in 1947 and was a member of the National Academy of Sciences. Early life Harvey was born on November 25, 1887 in Germantown, Pennsylvania. He was the only son and fourth child of a minister in Philadelphia who died when Harvey was six years old. His interest in natural history was exhibited at an early age and he liked collecting things and spending as much time as possible in the countryside. He was educated at Germantown Academy followed by the University of Pennsylvania where his interest in science excluded most of the social activities enjoyed by his contemporaries. He then moved to New York where he started his doctoral research under the evolutionary biologist Thomas Hunt Morgan at Columbia University. Link via ProQuest. Career In 1913 Harvey went on an expedition to the South Pacific with Alfred G. Mayer, a retired professor from the University of Pennsylvania. It was probably on this trip that he became interested in bioluminescence, and later that year he wrote a paper \\"On the chemical nature of the luminous material of the firefly\\". In 1916 he married a marine biologist, Ethel Nicholson Browne, and during their honeymoon in Japan he became fascinated by the bioluminescent ostracod Vargula hilgendorfii. This could be dried and would emit blue light when remoistened. He had large quantities of it shipped back to the United States where he devoted the next thirty years to studying the phenomenon of bioluminescence, and the chemical reactions involved in the process, in the ostracod and various other bioluminescent organisms. He discovered that the light-emitting substances known as luciferins were acted on by enzymes called luciferases and that both were species specific and not interchangeable. After completion of his thesis, Harvey moved to work under Edwin Conklin at Princeton University. By 1919 he was professor there and became the Henry Fairfield Osborn Professor on Conklin's retirement in 1933. He introduced courses in biochemistry and physiology, subjects little studied then, and inspired his students with his enthusiasm for everything scientific. During his career he wrote four books and had about 250 papers published, mostly on the subject of bioluminescence. Other fields of research included cell permeability and the effects of supersonic waves on living organisms. During World War II he studied decompression sickness and wound ballistics. He collaborated with Alfred Lee Loomis in the invention of the centrifuge microscope and he was a pioneer in the field of electroencephalography. Personal life Harvey's wife, Ethel Browne Harvey, worked on sea urchins in the same laboratories as Harvey in Princeton and Woods Hole. They had two sons, Edmund (born 1916) and Richard (born 1922), who received doctorates in chemistry and medicine respectively. Harvey died of heart failure at Woods Hole on July 21, 1959 at age 71. He is commemorated in the names of a species of bioluminescent bacterium (Vibrio harveyi), a luminous crustacean (Enewton harveyi), a species of firefly (Photinus harveyi) and a species of centipede (Pselloides harveyi).

Early life and education White was born in Parkersburg, West Virginia, but grew up in Pasadena, California. He received an A.B. from Occidental College in 1925 and a Ph.D. from Cornell University in 1929. In 1929‚Äì30 he was a National Research Council Fellow at the Physikalische Technische Reichsanstalt in Germany, working on atomic spectroscopy under Friedrich Paschen. Career While at Cornell, White was an Instructor in Physics from 1927 to 1929. After receiving his PhD and returning from Germany, he spent his career at the University of California, Berkeley: he was an Assistant Professor of Physics from 1930 to 1938, Associate Professor from 1938 to 1942, and then Professor. In 1958 he became Vice Chairman of the physics department. He designed two new buildings for the department at Berkeley, the second the 525-seat Physical Sciences Lecture Hall, which has a revolving stage divided into 120¬∞ sections each with its own chalkboard and demonstration facilities, and was also founder Director of the Lawrence Hall of Science. He retired in 1969. He was a major proponent of the vector model of the atom, which he used to illustrate quantum mechanics. During World War II, he briefly worked with a group under Ernest Lawrence measuring the vapor pressure of molten uranium, then worked on problems in optics for the war effort. White was active in instructional television. He participated in Science in Action, an early series produced in the San Francisco Bay Area. In 1956 the Ford Foundation gave him a grant to produce a nine-month high-school physics course with the educational TV station WQED. He presented five half-hour programs each week, 163 in all. In 1958 the Ford Foundation invited him to go to New York to present the inaugural year of NBC's national series called Continental Classroom. It was viewed by millions and aired by over 150 television stations; NBC estimated that the physics series alone had 400,000 viewers on its first airing. Honors In 1928 Occidental College awarded White a Sc.D. degree. In 1941 he was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship for a spectroscopic study of the gases of the Mauna Loa volcano in Hawaii; this was postponed until 1948. For his work on Continental Classroom, he won a Peabody Award, a Sylvania Television Award, and the Oersted Medal for physics teaching. Private life White had a lifelong interest in ham radio; his call sign was 6KS. He married Adeline Dally in 1928; they had three children. White dedicated his textbook Modern College Physics to his son Don. He died in Modesto, California. Selected bibliography *White, Harvey Elliott.

It was published by Farrar, Straus and Giroux on August 30, 2011. It was originally published, in slightly different form, in the Summer 2002 issue of The Paris Review. The novella details the life of Robert Grainier, an American railroad laborer, who lives a life of hermitage until he marries and has a daughter, only to lose both wife and child in a forest fire, and sink into isolation again. The novella won an O. Henry Award in 2003. It also won the 2002 Aga Khan Prize for Fiction. It was a finalist for the 2012 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction, but no award was given that year. Plot Robert Grainier is a railroad laborer. In the summer of 1917, a Chinese laborer has been accused of stealing from the company stores of the Spokane International Railway in the Idaho Panhandle. Grainier and the other white laborers attempt to throw him over the bridge they are constructing, but he escapes. While hiking back home, Grainier stops in Meadow Creek and buys a bottle of sarsaparilla for his wife, Gladys, and their four- month-old daughter, Kate. All through his walk home he believes he sees the Chinaman and when he gets home to his cabin he believes the Chinaman has cursed him and that something bad will happen. In 1920, after the bridge is completed, Grainier leaves for northwestern Washington to help repair the Robinson Gorge Bridge. He then works on cutting down and transporting timber for the Simpson Company. Grainier, then thirty-five years old, begins missing his wife and daughter. He meets a fellow worker Arn Peeples, an older man who was originally a miner from Arizona. Arn is a fearless man, dangerously excavating tunnels with dynamite, but he is also a superstitious man. He dies later by being hit across the back of his head by a falling dead branch. The men hold a funeral for Arn, who they respected as an honest man. In 1962 or 1963, an older Grainier watches young ironworkers build a new highway and considers how much he has seen the world around him change. In the mid-1950s, he sees the World's Fattest Man. Grainier confuses the chronology of his memories, but remembers seeing Elvis Presley's private train in Troy, Montana. He also remembers flying in a biplane in 1927. Grainier was born in 1886 in either Utah or Canada. In 1893, he arrived by himself as an orphan in Fry, Idaho on a train on the Great Northern Railway. He is taken in by a family. His first memory is witnessing the mass deportation of Chinese families from the town. In 1899, the towns of Fry and Eatonville were combined to form Bonners Ferry, Idaho, on the Kootenai River. Grainier quit school in his early teens and began fishing for himself. One day he comes across a dying man named William Coswell Haley. He brings him a drink of water from his boot and leaves him to die alone. Affected by the man's death, Grainier begins working frequently for the railroad and entrepreneurial families from the area. He worked in town through his twenties. At thirty-one years of age, he met Gladys Olding at the Methodist church and later married her. In the summer of 1920, Grainier returns to Idaho from working on the Robinson Gorge to find a massive wildfire has consumed the valley. His house has been lost and his wife and daughter are nowhere to be found. Ten days later he takes the train to Creston, British Columbia, but he learns no survivors from the fire had escaped there. He continues to search for them to no avail. In September, he attempts to return to his land but returns to live in town. In the following spring, he returns to their cabin and believes he feels Gladys' spirit. One night when he is sleeping by the river he believes he sees her white bonnet above, \\"just sailing past.\\" He lived there through the summer, eventually taking in a red dog as company and buying a goat, four hens and a rooster. In September he killed the goat and later he killed the hens and rooster, which he and the dog ate. He left for Meadow Creek, with the dog vanishing and Grainier taking a train to Bonners Ferry, where he stayed through the winter. He returned to his land in the Moyea Valley in March and eventually rebuilds his cabin. The red dog returned in June, this time with four puppies. Grainier befriends a Kootenai Indian named Bob, who later dies after drunkenly laying on train tracks and being ran over by trains. Four years into living in his cabin and beginning to feel the effects of aging, Grainier realizes he cannot continue to move out of his cabin every summer to Washington and every winter to Bonners Ferry. By April 1925, he stayed and worked in town instead of leaving for Washington. In one job, he loads sacks of cornmeal aboard the wagon of the Pinkhams, who run a machine shop. He works with their grandson Henry, who dies while they are working together. He is the first person Grainier himself ever saw die. Shortly after he buys the Pinkham's horses and wagon to run errands for others. Around this time, Grainier hears rumors of a wolf-girl. Grainier is visited by a figure of his wife Gladys, who tells him she died after she fell and broke her back on rocks down at the river. Before she drowned, she unknotted her boddice to allow Kate to crawl away and escape. He asked Gladys how Kate could have escaped unbeknownst to anybody, but he no longer sensed Gladys. Thereafter, Grainier lived in his cabin, even through the winters. To pay for lodging for his horses during the winter, he worked in the Washington woods one summer, his last time doing so. Later, he travels on the Great Northern to Spokane, Washington and takes a ride on the plane of two men from Alberta. He then meets his childhood friend Eddie Sauer and the two travel to Meadow Creek, where Eddie begins working on a \\"rail-and-ties\\" crew. A month later, Eddie pays Grainier to help him move a widow named Claire Thompson from Noxon, Montana to Sandpoint, Idaho. Grainier continues to live in his cabin, despite having arthritis and rheumatism. In mid-November, he can hear the wolves and coyotes howling at night. When a pack of wolves comes upon his cabin one night, Grainier sees a wolf-girl and is convinced it is his lost daughter Kate. She growls and barks at him, but lets him splint her broken leg. The wolf-girl slept through the night and, upon morning, quickly leaped out the window. Grainier never saw her again. Robert Grainier dies in his sleep in November 1968, over the age of 80. His body is only discovered next year, during the spring by a pair of hikers. In a memory from 1935, Grainier attends a sideshow to see a \\"wolf-boy\\". The audience initially laughs at him but are shocked when they hear his roar. The novella concludes, \\"And suddenly it all went black. And that time was gone forever.\\" Publication Train Dreams was published by Farrar, Straus and Giroux on August 30, 2011. It was originally published, in slightly different form, in the Summer 2002 issue of The Paris Review.

Reception Publishers Weekly called the novella \\"the synthesis of Johnson's epic sensibilities rendered in miniature in the clipped tone of Jesus' Son.\\" Writing for The New York Times Book Review, author Anthony Doerr praised the novella, writing, \\"What Johnson builds from the ashes of Grainier's life is a tender, lonesome and riveting story, an American epic writ small.\\" References Category:2011 American novels Category:American novellas Category:Novels by Denis Johnson Category:Farrar, Straus and Giroux books Category:Novels set in Idaho Category:Novels set in Washington (state) Category:Novels set in British Columbia Category:Novels set in Montana Category:Novels about rail transport Category:American historical novels ","title":"Train Dreams"},{"id":"41619842","text":"The Rough Guide to the Music of Ethiopia is a world music compilation album originally released in 2012.

Both Christgau and Deanne Sole of PopMatters compared the album with Buda Musique's √âthiopiques series (which had reached 27 volumes by 2012), with Sole discussing its role in creating the sense of age now attributed by Western world music listeners to Ethiopian music (which she calls \\"uncanny\\"), and how most tracks on the Rough Guide album are in fact by the Ethiopian diaspora and foreigners. Howard Male of The Independent said the album is one of the occasional Rough Guide compilations to \\"hit the bull's eye\\" and called Disc Two's Invisible System \\"arguably the most experimental Ethio-fusion project of them all.\\" This disc was the focus of BBC Music's review, where Robin Denselow called the tracks \\"boldly unusual\\" and \\"impressively original stuff\\". Track listing=Disc OneDisc Two= All tracks on Disc Two are by Invisible System, a former aid worker in Ethiopia who now creates dub- style tracks with UK-based Ethiopians.

It was classified by the National Trust of Australia in 1977 and added to the Register of National Estates in 1980. History The village of Toodyay was established in 1836 and in 1864 George Hasell constructed a single storey building here for James Thomas Woods. The bricks were made at the riverside and the lime was carried from Clackline. Woods ran a store on the site and obtained a storekeeper's gallon licence. In 1875 Woods added eight rooms to the store and from 1880 provided a venue for dances in the \\"long room\\". In 1882 Woods applied for a Billiard and Bagatelle License. In 1888 Woods converted the store into a licensed premises, which he called the Victoria Hotel. In 1892 Charles Corpaccioli leased the Victoria Hotel from J.T. Woods for a yearly rental of ¬£100. In 1894 the first annual dinner of the Toodyay Vine and Fruitgrowers‚Äô Association overtaxed the capacity of the dining room when 60-70 gentlemen sat down for a meal and \\"over a score were unable to find seats\\". Also in January 1894 ice cream was introduced at the hotel. In 1896 James Butler was the licensee followed by John F Cavanah in 1897. In March 1898 the Northam Advertiser mentions bricks being on site for extensions to the hotel. In September 1899 the same newspaper also noted a billiard room adjoining the hotel (now evolved into the present day Victoria Billiard Saloon) was nearing completion. It was positioned behind a hairdresser and a second shop being enlarged for a jeweller. In December 1900 Mr J Cavanah died and his widow M.H. Cavanah became the proprietress of the hotel. In September 1902 she married Frederick George Ashbourne Treadgold who became the licensee in 1902. In January 1903 the Victoria Hotel was the only hotel in town with ice. In late 1903 a tender was accepted for the erection of a second storey and other improvements. Mr Treadgold was given permission to erect a balcony over the footpath in front of the hotel. The second storey was completed in 1904. In 1906 Thomas John Donegan had taken over management of the Victoria Hotel and in 1908 an extension added the western section of the building. The cordials and aerated waters required for the hotel were manufactured on the premises. Before World War One the hotel was the rendezvous of the local volunteer Light Horse Regiment. In 1935 Patrick (Paddy) Andrew Connolly, James Ryan and Sydney Herbert Reidy-Crofts bought the hotel from Donegan. In March 1937 Mr EJ Parker (aged 37) became the licensee managing the hotel on behalf of the Avon Brewery Company. A few months later on 16 July, Parker fled the hotel with all his belongings, having stolen more than ¬£90. He left an apologetic note behind in the safe, posting the safe keys back from Melbourne by air mail. The safe had already been drilled open by the time the keys arrived. Parker was tracked down quickly at Burnie, Tasmania on 6 August. He was brought back to Western Australia to face charges of \\"stealing as a servant\\", to which he admitted his guilt in September. In 1937 repairs and renovations were undertaken by the architectural firm Cavanagh, Cavanagh and Allom. In May 1939 \\"excellent cuisine and garage space\\" were being advertised as being available and by June hot water had been installed. From August to October 1941 the weekly tariff was advertised as ¬£2/2/-. In 1946 Leslie Bartlett purchased the property and carried out further renovations, including adding a beer garden in the 1950s. More alterations were made in the 1970s including renovating the Billiard Saloon and incorporating it into the hotel as a lounge. Renovations in 2018 included a rear extension and new kitchen. Today the upper storey of the building has an enclosed balustrade while the ground floor has an open verandah.

However, the discovery was never announced and the existence of the territory only came to public notice following the Austro-Hungarian North Pole Expedition of 1872, which named the archipelago in honor of Franz Joseph I of Austria. Benjamin Leigh Smith led the next expedition in 1880, which continued the work of the first expeditions in investigating the southern and central parts of the archipelago. Concurrent expeditions followed in 1896, Nansen's Fram expedition and the Jackson‚ÄìHarmsworth Expedition, which met by accident. These two journeys explored the northern area and the flanks of Franz Josef Land. The next series of expeditions used the archipelago as a base for attempts to reach the North Pole. The first, carried out by Walter Wellman in 1898, was followed the next year by the voyage of the Stella Polare then from 1901 to 1905 the Ziegler Polar Expedition took place. Although often poorly organized and unsuccessful at reaching their ultimate goal, these expeditions further explored the islands. Russian expeditions, starting with the icebreaker Yrmark in 1901, began visiting the area and conducted increasing amounts of scientific research alongside their exploration activities. Russia claimed sovereignty over the archipelago in 1914, and the Soviet Union formally annexed the islands on 15April 1926, making it part of Arkhangelsk Oblast. Norway and Italy protested, and Norwegian sealers continued to operate in the surrounding waters for several years. A 1929 Norwegian attempt to establish a base failed. The 1930 Bratvaag Expedition was the last Western European presence on the islands until 1990, except for an undetected German weather station on Alexandra Land during World War II. From 1932 the Soviet Union operated weather stations at Tikhaya Bay, Hooker Island and on Rudolf Island. The 1930s also saw the development of complete topographical maps with the islands used as launching points for drifting ice stations. During the Cold War the islands became strategically important and aerodromes were constructed at Nagurskoye and Heiss Island. The Ernst Krenkel Observatory was established in 1957. From 1991 foreign scientists were again welcome to the islands, which were declared a nature reserve in 1994. Tourism commenced and the archipelago became part of the Russian Arctic National Park in 2011. Discovery There are two possible candidates for the claim to have discovered Franz Josef Land. =Voyage of the Spidsbergen= The Norwegian sealing vessel Spidsbergen with captain Nils Fredrik R√∏nnbeck and harpooner Johan Petter Aidij√§rvi aboard sailed northeast from Svalbard in 1865 in search of suitable sealing sites and found an archipelago that was most likely Franz Josef Land. They named the area Nord-√òst Spidsbergen (Northeast Spitsbergen) or R√∏nnebeck Land. However, an announcement of the discovery was never made and the archipelago remained unknown until the following expedition. It was at that time common to keep newly discovered areas secret to avoid competition for sealing and whaling from other vessels. In a May 1865 article for the Russian magazine Morskoy sbornik, N. G. Schilling argued that current flows and ice conditions in the Barents Sea predicated the existence of a landmass between Novaya Zemlya and Svalbard. The report received little attention at the time, but from 1871 it was used as an argument to justify sending a Russian expedition to explore further. However, due to lack of funding the voyage never took place. =Austro-Hungarian North Pole Expedition= thumb Discovery of the islands was first publicly announced by the Austro-Hungarian North Pole Expedition of 1872‚Äì74. Led by Julius von Payer and Karl Weyprecht of Austria‚ÄìHungary on board the schooner Tegetthoff, this expedition's primary goal was to find the north-east passage with the secondary goal of locating the North Pole. The ship left Troms√∏, Norway, in July 1872 but by August had become locked in pack ice north of Novaya Zemlya. The vessel drifted and eventually reached a hitherto unknown archipelago, which they named in honor of Franz Joseph I (1830‚Äì1916), Emperor of Austria. In May 1874 Wayprecht decided that the crew of twenty-four should abandon the ice-bound ship. On August 16 they reached land at Novaya Zemlya. They followed the coast and was eventually picked up by a Russian fishing vessel which brought them to Vard√∏, Norway where they arrived on 3 September 1874. This expedition contributed significantly to the mapping and exploration of the islands. The next expedition to spot the archipelago was the \\"Dutch Expedition for the Exploration of the Barents Sea\\", on board the schooner Willem Barents. Its plans frustrated by ice, the vessel never reached land. Other early expeditions=Leigh Smith= The next expedition to land on the islands was that of Benjamin Leigh Smith in 1880. The Briton captained the 250-tonne barque Eira, which left Lerwick on 22June 1880 with an undetermined destination. After a stop by Jan Mayen Island, heavy ice off Spitsbergen forced them to choose a southern route, which sent the ship towards Franz Josef Land. The Eira landed west of Wilczek Island on 14August, such that all land subsequently spotted was newly discovered. Within days they had caught walrus, ivory gulls and polar bears. On 18August the expedition discovered a natural harbor on Bell Island, which they named Eira Harbour and used as a base of operations. They then conducted a series of scientific experiments, explored the area and went hunting. The expedition next headed towards McClintock Island and Wilczek Island, but found their route blocked by ice. At the end of August they therefore returned to Svalbard, reaching Peterhead on 12October. Leigh Smith led another expedition in the same vessel the following year, which left Peterhead on 14June 1881. He sailed to Novaya Zemlya, arriving on 23July, before heading north to Franz Josef Land. The expedition landed at the natural harbor at Grey Bay on the south of Zemlya Georga (Prince George Land). In the second week of August a small shelter was built on Bell Island, which they named Eira Lodge and which still stands. It was used for storage of materials brought by the expedition. The Eira then headed eastwards to explore further, hoping to find the USS Jeannette, which was believed to be in the area. After a landing at Cape Flora ice hindered any further progress. Pressed by pack ice Eira was holed and subsequently sank off Cape Flora on 21August. Although men, stores and boats were saved, ice hindered the expedition from reaching Eira Lodge so instead the men built a turf and stone hut at Cape Flora. Coal and salt was brought from the lodge on 1September, which meant that they had sufficient food, including fresh meat to ward off scurvy. The cottage was subdivided into two sections for officers and crew respectively. Twenty-four walruses and thirty-four polar bears were killed by the expedition during the winter. Meteorological reports were recorded, but lack of sleds made exploration difficult. The group set off in their boats for Novaya Zemlya on 21June 1882. They reached a beach on Matochkin Strait on 2August, where they rendezvoused with the Willem Barents and the British vessels Kara and Hope, which had been dispatched on a search mission. =Nansen and Johansen= The hut on Franz Josef Land, covered in snow, in which Nansen and Johansen spent the winter of 1895‚Äì96. A drawing, based on Nansen's photograph. Fridtjof Nansen's 1893‚Äì1896 expedition aboard the Fram attempted to reach the geographical North Pole by harnessing the natural east‚Äìwest current of the Arctic Ocean. His custom-built vessel departed Christiania (today Oslo) on 24June 1893 and sailed to the New Siberian Islands in the eastern Arctic Ocean. There she became frozen into the pack ice and had to wait for the drift to carry her towards the pole. Impatient with the slow progress and erratic character of the drift, after eighteen months Nansen and a chosen companion, Hjalmar Johansen, left the ship with a team of dogs and sledges to make for the pole. On 14March, with the ship at 84¬∞4‚Ä≤N, the pair finally began their polar march. They did not reach their objective, but achieved a record \\"Farthest North\\" latitude of 86¬∞13.6‚Ä≤N before their long retreat over ice and water to reach safety in Franz Josef Land. Meanwhile, Fram continued to drift westward, finally emerging in the North Atlantic Ocean. After his arduous travels, Nansen decided on 7April that the pole was unreachable and instead headed for Cape Fligely on Rudolf Island, which had been discovered by Payer. Nansen and Johansen were thus able to establish that there was not, as Payer had predicted, any land north of 82¬∞. The duo spotted their first land on 24July, which Nansen named Eva Island after his wife and Liv Island for his daughter. These turned out to be the same island and is now named Eva-Liv Island. They reached Adelaide Island on 10August, and for the first time in two years stood on dry land. By this point both their watches had become unreliable and they were therefore unable to establish exact locations. The last dog was subsequently shot and the journey continued by kayak. Nansen believed he was on the west side of the archipelago and planned to reach Svalbard via the predicted Gilles Land, which turned out not to exist. He also aimed to reach Eira Lodge. Johansen, with his head nearly bitten off by a polar bear, and Nansen, exhausted from swimming after the drifting kayaks, were both close to death. By 28August the winter conditions had become so severe that the expedition halted. The pair built a hut and waited for the next season at a spot they named Cape Norvegia. While they believed they were on Alexandra Land, they were in fact on Jackson Island where they sustained themselves on bear and walrus meat and blubber. At Christmas they turned their clothes inside out and from New Year they agreed to address each other with the Norwegian familiar form du i stedet instead of the formal De. They continued their journey on 19 May 1896 and left a note in the hut, which was found in 1902. The hut was visited by several expeditions, then forgotten until being discovered again in 1990. They continued southwards, with the ultimate goal of reaching Svalbard, until they stumbled upon the Jackson‚ÄìHarmsworth Expedition by pure chance at Cape Flora on17 June. =Jackson‚ÄìHarmsworth= After the Austro-Hungarian and British expeditions, only the southern and central parts of the archipelago had been explored. At the time there was a presumption that a large landmass, tentatively called Petermann Land, stretched northwards, possibly all the way to the pole. To the west another landmass was expected, Gillis Land, which it was expected might reach as far as Svalbard. Frederick George Jackson hoped to exploit the previous expeditions' experience with overwintering to launch an expedition to explore the northern parts of the island group. To prepare for the trip, in 1893 he took an expedition to Yugorsky Strait and Vaygach Island, south of Novaya Zemlya. The plan was then to construct a series of depots along Franz Josef Land while moving northwards. Financing for the expedition was to be provided by the newspaper magnate Alfred Harmsworth. The expedition left London in the Windward on 12July 1894 and departed Arkhangelsk, Russia, on 6August. The ship sailed north via Novaya Zemlya to Franz Josef Land, which it approached near Cape Crowther on Bell Island on 25August. Ice prevented a landing before 8September, when the expedition reached Cape Flora. The men took possession of Eira Lodge and erected four wood-and-canvas huts, naming the encampment Elmwood, with one party staying on land and the other on the ship. They remained there for the winter, with bear hunting their primary pastime. In March the group began a sledge expedition to establish depots to the north. As the actual geography of the archipelago became evident, the mission's character quickly became one of general exploration. The expedition's Furthest North was reached at Cape Mill on Jackson Island on 2May. Cape Flora, 17 June 1896 (a posed photograph taken hours after the initial meeting) During the summer Jackson sent out boating parties. Along with information collected from Nansen, this allowed him to assemble a more accurate map of the archipelago. Most of the names given by Jackson, largely named for expedition members and friends, remain today. In June, expedition member Mouatt died and was buried at Elmwood. Departing the area on 3July, leaving eight expedition members at Elmwood, Windward sailed westwards to survey the land up to Cape Mary Harmsworth on Alexandra Land. Here they found a reindeer antler, establishing that the animals had once populated the islands. On their return trip to Elmwood, a boat with six men came close to being lost in a storm. During the second winter the boat remained stuck in the ice until September. By the time it reached Vard√∏ in Norway, two further expedition members had died. On 17June 1896, Jackson met a stranger at Cape Flora, who he soon recognized as Nansen. He and Johansen stayed as Jackson's guests for several weeks, with the two parties sharing knowledge of the archipelago. The Windward returned on 26July with Nansen and Johansen on board then returned to the mainland on 7August. Jackson stayed for the next winter and the following spring, along with Albert Armitage, circumnavigated the western part of the archipelago in a period of eight weeks. Two whaling vessels, Bal√¶na and Diana, had already arrived before the Windward landed on 22July. With insufficient supplies for another full winter, the expedition packed up and returned to the mainland on 6August. Supplies were left at Elmwood in the hope that they would assist any future stranded expeditions. =Wellman= Once the basic geography of Franz Josef Land became apparent, expeditions shifted to using the archipelago as a base for attempts to reach the North Pole. The first of these was conducted by the National Geographic Society-sponsored American journalist Walter Wellman. With experience of an expedition to Svalbard in 1894, he led an expedition of four Americans and five Norwegians on the sealer Frithjof, which departed Troms√∏ in late June 1898. They arrived off Franz Josef Land on 27July, then visited Eira Lodge and Cape Flora. At Elmwood, Wellman gathered most of the supplies and continued eastwards, circumnavigating Wilczek Island and Salm Island before establishing a base at Cape Tegetthof at the south of Hall Island. On 30July he rendezvoused with the steamship Hekla, which had caught 212 walrus and 70 bears. From 3August a party traveled northwards via Hall Island to Cape Hansa on southern Wilczek Land under poor conditions. Two Norwegians, Paul Bj√∏rvik and Bernt Bentsen stayed the winter at a northern camp established at Jackson's hut. They were given insufficient fuel for heating and lived in a constant temperature of . Construction of what they subsequently christened Fort McKinley started on 13September. The remaining members of the party headed north by boat, but returned to Cape Tegetthoff on 22October. Bentsen, by November seriously ill, could not keep warm because of wear to his sleeping bag and he died on 2January 1899. Wellman returned on 27February before venturing north with four Norwegians and forty-two dogs where the party lost most of their equipment and eight dogs on 21March when violent weather set the ice in motion. With an injured foot, Wellman decided to return to Tegetthoff. A party led by Evelyn Baldwin set out on 26April to circumnavigate Wilczek Island and Graham Bell Island by sled. The entire group returned to the mainland on the sealer Capella in August. The expedition's main contribution was filling in the missing geographical details of the eastern region. =Amedeo= The Stella Polare was trapped and threatened to sink with the crew obliged to land with the utmost haste and to secure materials for building a dwelling. The Italian nobleman Luigi Amedeo organized an expedition to sail as far north by land as possible and then traverse the ice sheet with sledges to the North Pole. He bought the Norwegian whaling vessel Jason, which he christened Stalle Polare. The expedition left Christiania on 12June 1899, taking on board 121 dogs in Arkhangelsk, which they left on 12July. After sighting Northbrook Island on 21July, they subsequently encountered the Capella and Wellman on 6August, while stuck in ice in the British Channel. The Stalle Polare eventually broke free and sailed north to Rudolf Island. Although hoping to continue along Petermann or King Oscar Lands, they established that no such lands were visible and instead established a winter base at Replitz Bay. From August onwards, the ice proved strong enough for a dog sleigh expedition to explore the island. On 8September strong winds forced the ice into the bay, holing the Stella Polare, which was unloaded and huts built on the shore. An expedition of 12 men and 104 dogs, led by Captain Umberto Cagni, departed towards the North Pole on 21February 1900, but returned two days later to make adjustments. The embarked again on 11March but the first detachment of three people failed to return to base camp and their fate remains unknown. The second party arrived at the base camp on 18April, reaching 86¬∞34‚ÄôN on 25April, a new record before returning on 23June. The Stella Polare set sail on 16August, leaving a large amount of provisions behind for the three missing party members should they turn up. On the return voyage the ship again became stuck in the British Channel and did not reach Cape Flora until 31August. The remaining members of the expedition arrived in Hammerfest, Norway, on 5September. A search party led by the Capella's captain, St√∏kken, conducted an expedition to Cape Flora and the southern islands the following summer but found nothing. =Ziegler= Evelyn Baldwin returned to the archipelago in 1901 after receiving sponsorship from the American businessman William Ziegler for an expedition to the North Pole. He departed Vads√∏ aboard the America on 27July with 42 expedition members from the United States, Scandinavia and Russia along with 420 dogs and 15 ponies. At Cape Flora the expedition received an additional three years' supplies from the Frithjof then established a camp, christened Camp Ziegler, on Alger Island, with a smaller camp established away. By spring, half the dogs and three of the ponies had died. Baldwin banned detours for scientific experiments, the keeping of diaries and the use of sleeping bags. Sled parties set out in January and by May had established supply depots on Greely Island, Coburg Island and Cape Aux on Rudolf Island. A small party was sent to Cape Norvegia to investigate Nansen and Johansen's hut. America departed on 1July, but despite the use of among other things dynamite, took sixteen days to clear the ice. The expedition was largely regarded as an utter failure by the exploration and scientific communities with its problems put down to a lack of proper management. Unhappy with the outcome, Ziegler organized a new expedition and appointed Anthony Fiala (second-in-command on the first expedition) as leader. With America in port at Troms√∏, little time was needed to organize the new expedition. After a refit in Trondheim, America departed on 23June 1903 and took on additional stores and dogs in Vard√∏ on 10July. In difficult ice conditions, the ship did not reach Cape Flora until 12August and Jackson Island on 29August. The expedition continued north to 82¬∞14‚Ä≤N before returning to Tepliz Bay to spend the winter. America anchored at Tepliz Bay The ship came adrift on 22October and the party spent three days recapturing her. She was evacuated on 12November due to crushing by ice, but it was deemed safe for the crew to return until 21December when the vessel was crushed beyond repair. On 22January 1904 the ship disappeared, either sinking or drifting away during night. The first attempt to reach the pole began on 7March with 26 men and Fiala acting as cook. Bad weather forced them to return to the base camp on 11March. A new attempt made on 25March lasted only two days before the expedition was forced to wait until the next spring before trying again. The men retreated to Cape Flora, although all but fourteen of them instead stopped at Camp Abruzzi. On 30April the most enthusiastic men continued towards Cape Flora, which they reached on 16May, the same day as one of the Norwegians died. A relief ship made two attempts to reach the party that summer, but failed. The party sledged back to Camp Abruzzi between 27September to 20November. A new attempt to reach the pole commenced on 15March 1905. After a week, the group reached open water, and Fiala decided to return. The rest of the season was spent moving supplies and exploring. Fiala returned to Camp Ziegler on 19June, with the crew variously based there and at Cape Flora and Cape Dillon on southwest McClintock Island. The relief ship Terra Nova arrived on 30July, departing on 6 August. Ziegler himself died on 24 May 1905, before the expedition ended. =Russian expeditions= The first Russian expedition took place in 1901, when the icebreaker Yermak traveled to the islands. Intended to reach the North Pole, she had only a quarter of the necessary power. M. P. Vasilev led this expedition to measure the meridian that departed Troms√∏ in May and reached Cape Flora on 24July. It continued on to Hochstetter Island before returning to Troms√∏ on 20August. Hydrologist Georgy Sedov led the next expedition, which embarked from Arkhangelsk on 15August 1912 aboard the Svyatoy Muchenik Foka. Ice conditions forced the group to spend the first winter off Novaya Zemlya then during the 1913 season it advanced to Cape Flora and arrived on 1September. After establishing a wintering base at Tikhaya Bay on Hooker Island from 7September, among its scientific studies were the first snow measurements of the archipelago and establishing that changes in the magnetic field occurred in cycles of fifteen years. The expedition also conducted topographical surveys of the surrounding area. Scurvy set in during the second winter and killed a machinist. Despite lacking prior experience or sufficient provisions, Sedov decided to press forward and march to the pole. He and two sailors started off on 15February 1914, despite Sedov being ill at the time. His condition deteriorated and he died on 6March whereafter the sailors returned to the ship on 19March. The expedition embarked for the mainland on 30July, and on 1August they encountered two survivors from the Brusilov Expedition, including Valerian Albanov, which had set out to explore the Northern Sea Route. Hertha was sent to find the expedition and its captain, I. I. Islyamov, hoisted a Russian flag at Cape Flora and proclaimed Russian sovereignty over the archipelago. The move was sparked by the ongoing World War I amid Russian fears that the Central Powers might establish themselves in the archipelago. Polish aviator Jan Nag√≥rski flew towards Franz Josef Land to reach Sedov's group while the Andromeda set out for the same reason, However, both putative rescue missions failed to find anything but supplies, although the crew of the ship were finally able to determine the non-existence of Peterman Land and King Oscar Land. Annexation Heiss Island The Soviet Union sent the Persey on expeditions to the islands in 1923 and 1924, followed by the Elding in 1925 and the Zarnica in 1927. Franz Josef Land had been considered terra nulliusland belonging to no oneuntil the Soviet Union declared its annexation on 15April 1926, as part of Arkhangelsk Oblast, when it copied Canada's declaration of the sector principle and claimed that all land between the Soviet mainland and the North Pole would become Soviet territory. This principle has never been internationally recognized. Both Italy and Norway protested. Italy based its claim on the fact that it had acquired Triest from Austria‚ÄìHungary, the port from which the Payer expedition had been equipped. Norway was first and foremost concerned about their seal hunting and whaling economic interests in the area, during a period that also saw the country's activities curtailed in the White Sea, Novaya Zemlya and Greenland. The government of Norway chose to remain passive, while the Soviet Union did nothing to hinder twelve Norwegian hunting ships access to the area in 1928. Italian explorer Umberto Nobile set out in his airship Italia to reach the North Pole in 1928. After it crashed, a series of multinational expeditions were sent to find him. Several of these were in the waters around Franz Josef Land. Among the vessels participating was the Soviet icebreaker Krasin. After having rescued some of the crew, the ship was sent onwards to Franz Josef Land, reaching George Land on 22September 1928. Beyond erecting an iron Soviet flag at Cape Neal, they failed to construct any facilities. The Government of Norway decided to protest the Soviet annexation by establishing a meteorological station on the archipelago, a task awarded to the Norwegian Polar Institute. An expedition was sent in 1929, in part financed by Lars Christensen, with the explicit task of annexing Victoria Island and establishing a base in Franz Josef Land. Norway further proposed a similar arrangement as in the Svalbard Treaty, whereby the Soviet Union could retain full sovereignty, but could not limit Norwegian economic interests. However, ice conditions hindered a Norwegian landing. To support the annexation, the Polar Commission of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR proposed establishing a station at Tikhaya Bay on Hooker Island. An expedition was sent aboard the icebreaker Sedov, which departed Arkhangelsk on 21July 1929. The expedition's head, Otto Schmidt, was subsequently proclaimed Soviet Commissar of Franz Josef Land. The expedition landed at Tikhaya Bay on 12August, whereupon some of the crew began construction of a base. Meanwhile, the vessel continued to Rudolf Island, where another location was selected. The base at Tikhay Bay was officially opened on 29August. The Soviet government proposed renaming the archipelago Fridtjof Nansen Land in 1930, but the name never came into use. Cape Tegethoff on Hall Island The 1930 Bratvaag Expedition, led by Norwegian geologist Gunnar Horn, was sent out to survey Svalbard, Victoria Island and Franz Josef Land. Norway followed up with another expedition the following year, aboard the tourist ship Isbj√∏rn. While visiting the base at Tikhaya Bay, the Soviets asked that Norway in the future respect Soviet territorial waters. Other expeditions that year were a Norwegian-Swedish expedition led by Hans Wilhelmsson Ahlmann aboard the Quest and the German Graf Zeppelin. Apart from the German weather station established during the Second World War, these were the last Western expeditions to Franz Josef Land until 1990. The Soviet Union sent the icebreaker Malygin to Rudolf Island during the Second International Polar Year in 1932 to establish a weather station. The Knipovich conducted the first circumnavigation of the archipelago and landed the first Soviets on Victoria Island. The 1933 season saw an Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute project complete a topographical map of the archipelago at a scale of 1:200,000. A geological and glaciological expedition was carried out in the 1934‚Äì35 season while over one hundred hours of cartographic flights were flown in 1935 to make corrections to the maps. Two more icebreakers, Sadko and Taymyr, explored the islands that year. From 1934 to 1936 sixty people stayed the winter at Tikhay Bay, where the first person was born on the archipelago. Mikhail Vodopyanov and V. M. Makhotin carried out flights to the islands in 1936, in preparation for their expedition the following year, during which they hoped to reach the North Pole. The same year the icebreakers Rusanov and Hercen freighted in equipment for a drifting ice station on Rudolf Island. This was followed up with the construction of an airstrip on the island's glacier. The plans were executed in 1937, with four aircraft setting out on 18April and the establishment of North Pole-1 as a drifting ice station headed by Ivan Papanin. A transpolar flight by Sigizmund Levanevsky went astray and ships were dispatched to search for him in the archipelago. With poor ice conditions, they were forced to stay the winter, bringing the archipelago's winter population to 300. Second World War and Cold War After the Second World War broke out, Soviet interest in the archipelago dwindled. The base at Rudolf Island closed in 1941 and only a small group of men remained at Tikhay Bay, unsupplied throughout the war, and unaware of the existence of the German weather station. Half of the men remained until they were picked up by the icebreaker J. Stalin in 1945, with the remainder returning home the following year. The Arctic islands were of strategic importance during the war in part because of the weather reports they produced. With the Allies strong grip on most suitable locations, Germany established an undetected weather station on Alexandra Land named Schatzgr√ºber, located inland from Cambridge Bay. Ten men landed in September 1943 after a three-day voyage from Troms√∏ in the weather observation ship Kehdingen escorted by U-387. Additional supplies were dropped by aircraft in May 1944. The entire party ate raw polar bear meat the same month, which almost caused the entire station to cease operation as a result of most of the men becoming infected with trichinosis. After the men insisted on medical treatment a makeshift airstrip was built but it proved unsuitable although a Focke-Wulf Fw 200 was able to land on 7July 1944 some away. U-354 came to the rescue and all twelve men were evacuated that day, although with considerable difficulty, as they had to walk to the aircraft carrying the sick men on stretchers. The first four men were transported in twelve hours, although with the help of a cart, while the last eight were transported in six. The aircraft departed on 10July whereafter the base remained in operational condition, as it was planned to send a new group to replace the evacuees. However, by October U-387 was dispatched to clear the stores and instead set up an automated weather station. The ice proved too difficult for a landing and the station was instead set up on Novaya Zemlya. Ernst Krenkel Observatory The Cold War resulted in renewed interest in the islands from the Soviet Union, this time because of their military strategic significance. Regarded as an \\"unsinkable aircraft carrier\\", the location of the German weather station was selected for the Nagurskoye aerodrome and military base. Meanwhile, from 1949 to 1952, the Arctic Institute carried out an expedition to Hooker Island in the hope of establishing a military base and aerodrome on and inside the ice cap. A major glaciological aerial expedition was carried out in 1955, with landings on the ice caps of many islands. With the advent of intercontinental ballistic missiles, the Soviet Union changed its military strategy in 1956, abolishing the strategic need for an airbase on the archipelago. This decision also allowed for the international publication of the Soviet research garnered during the preceding decade. The International Geophysical Year of 1957 and 1958 gave a new rise to the scientific interest in the archipelago. An airstrip was built on Heiss Island in 1956, which could serve as a base for Antonov An-2 aircraft. The following year the geophysical Ernst Krenkel Observatory was established. The research results were coordinated with measurements in the Antarctic and the Kerguelen Islands. A base at Chiurlionis Ice Cap on Hooker Island was built to study ice core samples. In 1958 the weather station at Hooker Island closed and moved to the observatory. The Arctic Geology Research Institute carried out an extensive survey of the geology of the islands. Activity at Tikhaya Bay were reduced from 1957 and the base closed two years later. Because of the islands' military significance, the Soviet Union closed off the area to foreign researchers. An exception was made in 1967, when French geophysicists were permitted to take part in an ionospheric program. The Zoological Institute of Leningrad undertook marine-biological surveys with a diving expedition in 1970. A botanical survey from Leningrad was carried out in 1979 and the following year an Arctic Institute investigation of various glaciers included aerial photographs. Ornithological surveys were carried out on Graham Bell and Hooker Islands in 1981. Internationalization The Soviet Union allowed international activities on the archipelago from 1990, with non-Russians given fairly straightforward access. A cooperative venture between the Academy of Sciences, the Norwegian Polar Institute and the Polish Academy of Sciences was the first of several archaeological expeditions organized by the Institute of Culture in Moscow. That year also saw the reopening of the base at Tikhaya Bay organized jointly by the three countries. An Ilyushin Il-14 which crashed at Graham Bell Island in 1981 The base on Graham Bell Island was abandoned during the early 1990s while military activities at Nagurskoye were reduced to that of a border post, and the number of people stationed at Krenkel Observatory reduced from seventy to a dozen. The archipelago and the surrounding waters were declared a nature reserve in April 1994, covering an area of . This was protected as the more liberal zakaznik type of reserve. During this period several other federal subjectsMurmansk Oblast, Krasnoyarsk Krai and Moscowall offered to take over the administration of the islands. The opening of the archipelago also saw the introduction of tourism, most of which now takes place aboard Russian-operated icebreakers. Popular sites include Cape Flora, Tickaya Bay, Nansen and Johansen's hut as well as the Russian stations with tourists are commonly landed by helicopter. The Russian Armed Forces upgraded the base at Nagurskoye with the construction of a new barracks. In 2012 the Russian Air Force decided to reopen Green Bell Airfield as part of a series of reopenings of air bases in the Arctic. Plans for a national park covering northern Novaya Zemlya and Franz Josef Land were launched in the 2000s. When the Russian Arctic National Park was established on 15June 2009, Franz Josef Land and Victoria Island were excluded. Prime Minister Vladimir Putin visited the archipelago in 2010, describing it as a \\"giant rubbish tip\\". By 2011 the national park had been expanded to include Franz Josef Land in a move to better accommodate tourism in the archipelago. From 2012, Russia commenced a 1.5 billion ruble, three-year clean-up project to remove more than 100,000 tonnes of waste which had accumulated during the Soviet era. These include a quarter million barrels of oil products, a million old barrels and dilapidated vehicles, radar installations and aircraft, among others.

Carelmapu was established by the Spanish in 1602 as San Antonio Ribera de Carelmapu following the Destruction of Seven Cities. In 1643 Carealmapu was sacked and its church vandalized by the Dutch corsair Hendrick Brouwer. On March 6, 1676 Carelmapu received the exhausted survivors of Pascual de Iriarte's expedition to the Strait of Magellan. Fort system During colonial times Carelmapu was the site of a small fort system made up of Fuerte de Carelmapu just west of Carelmapu, the sentinel outpost of Astillero and the battery of Coronel. The last two were not located in Carelmapu proper but further east along the northern shores of Chacao Channel. The original Fuerte de Carelmapu was built in wood in 1603. At present remnants of it can be found in a deteriorated state.
