Completed and commissioned in 1943, she served in World War II, operating on supply missions in the New Guinea campaign and the Solomon Islands campaign, and conducting war patrols in the Solomons, off the Mariana Islands, and in the Philippine Sea before she was sunk in November 1944. Construction and commissioning I-38 was laid down on 19 June 1941 by at the Sasebo Navy Yard at Sasebo, Japan, with the name Submarine No. 151. Renamed I-38, she was launched on 15 April 1942 and provisionally attached to the Kure Naval District. She was completed and commissioned on 31 January 1943. Service history Upon commissioning, I-38 was attached formally to the Kure Naval District and assigned to the Kure Submarine Squadron. The same day, she got underway to participate in tests of a new type of shallow-depth torpedo in the Seto Inland Sea. After that, she conducted tests of the new Unpoto gun sled, a sled that could carry up to 15 tons of cargo, usually in the form of three Type 96 howitzers and ammunition for them. She became the first Japanese submarine equipped with fittings to carry an Unpoto. On 1 April 1943 she was assigned to Submarine Squadron 11 for work-ups. With her work-ups completed, I-38 was reassigned to Submarine Division 15 in Submarine Squadron 1 on 30 April 1943. On 8 May 1943, she got underway from Kure with an Unpoto on her afterdeck, paused at Osako, then continued to Saeki, where she spent the night of 8–9 May 1943. She departed Saeki on 9 May with the Unpoto in tow bound for Truk, which she reached on 14 May 1943. During her stay at Truk, the commander-in-chief of the 6th Fleet, Vice Admiral Teruhisa Komatsu, inspected I-38 and her Unpoto installation on 15 May, after which I-38 unloaded her provisions and a repair ship moored alongside her to repair the Unpoto. She was assigned to the Southeast Area Fleet that day. I-38 departed for Rabaul on New Britain on 16 May 1943. =New Guinea campaign, May–June 1943= Assigned to supply runs to New Guinea in support of Japanese forces fighting in the New Guinea campaign, I-38 arrived at Rabaul on 18 May 1943. There she detached her Unpoto and transferred some of her provisions to the submarine tender , and her commanding officer boarded Chōgei to received a briefing on the supply operations from the commander of Submarine Squadron 7. On 19 May, she conducted an Unpoto test with the commanders-in-chief of the Southeast Area Fleet, Vice Admiral Jinichi Kusaka, and Eighth Area Army, General Hitoshi Imamura, looking on. She then transferred all remaining provisions in her after storeroom and all but four of her torpedoes to Chōgei. On 21 May 1943 I-38 set out from Rabaul on her first supply run, bound for Lae on the coast of New Guinea carrying 12 naval officers as passengers and a cargo of 48.6 tons of ammunition and provisions. She arrived at Lae on 23 May, quickly discharged her passengers and cargo, embarked 17 sick and wounded Imperial Japanese Army soldiers, and got back underway for Rabaul. Soon after she departed Lae, a United States Navy PT boat sighted her and fired six torpedoes at her, but they all missed, and I-38 arrived safely at Rabaul on 25 May 1943. I-38 got underway from Rabaul on 27 May 1943 for her second supply run, carrying 29 Special Naval Landing Forces personnel and a cargo of 48.6 tons of food and medicine. As she approached Lae on 28 May, her lookouts sighted a U.S. Navy PT boat, and she dived to avoid it. That night she dropped off her passengers and cargo, brought aboard six soldiers, and headed back for Rabaul, where she arrived on 31 May 1943. After taking aboard cargo from Goshu Maru, she left Rabaul on her third supply run on 2 June and met a Daihatsu-class landing craft off Lae on 4 June, transferred her cargo to it, embarked General Imamura and three members of his staff for transportation to Eight Area Army headquarters at Rabaul, and headed back to Rabaul, arriving there on 6 June 1943. At Rabaul, I-38 loaded cargo from Taisei Maru and an Unpoto sled was mounted on her afterdeck. She departed on 9 June 1943 and headed for New Guinea, discharging some of her cargo at Salamaua on 11 June 1943, then proceeding to Lae, where on 12 June she unloaded the rest of it and disembarked her Unpoto , the first successful delivery of artillery using an Unpoto. She embarked six soldiers, and soon after she left Lae on her return voyage to Rabaul, an Allied plane spotted her and dropped three bombs after she crash-dived. She avoided damage, but another Allied plane forced her to crash-dive again at around midnight. She arrived safely at Rabaul on 13 June 1943. I-38 refueled from the oiler at Rabaul on 15 June 1943 and received a new Unpoto sled from Taisei Maru on 17 June. She began her fifth supply run on 19 June, departing Rabaul with 48.5 tons of provisions aboard, calling at Lae to unload them on 21 June, and returning to Rabaul on 23 June 1943. After receiving another new Unpoto from Taisei Maru on 24 June and undergoing maintenance work and having her upper deck repainted on 25 June 1943, I-38 departed on her sixth supply run on 26 June 1943, calling at Lae after dark on 28 June to unload 48.5 tons of provisions and embark 15 soldiers, and then made for Rabaul, which she reached on 30 June 1943. =First war patrol= After taking aboard supplies from Chōgei on 1 July 1943, I-38 departed Rabaul on 2 July on her first war patrol, ordered to attack Allied shipping in the Solomon Islands, where Japanese forces were fighting in the Solomon Islands campaign, and conduct a reconnaissance of Kula Gulf. She arrived in her patrol area on 4 July, and on 5 July sighted two Allied transports, but was unable to attack them. On 6 July, she fired a torpedo at a U.S. Navy destroyer, but it missed. I-38 was on the surface in darkness in New Georgia Sound on 7 July 1943, when an Allied warship — probably the destroyer at — surprised her, suddenly opening fire with her main gains and machine guns. I-38 crash-dived, and 10 minutes later the warship dropped a pattern of depth charges. I-38 descended to a depth of and finally broke contact with the warship after 90 minutes. I-38 conducted her reconnaissance of Kula Gulf on 8 July, again after dark on 9 July, and a final time on 10 July 1943, when she received orders to return to Rabaul to resume her New Guinea supply runs. During her voyage to Rabaul, Allied aircraft attacked her repeatedly on 11 July 1943, forcing her to crash-dive each time, but she arrived safely at Rabaul on 12 July 1943. =New Guinea campaign July–August 1943= On 17 July 1943, I-38 began her seventh New Guinea supply run from Rabaul, calling at Lae on 19 July and reaching Rabaul safely on 21 July despite coming under frequent attack by Allied bombers during her return voyage. She received a new Unpoto sled and cargo on 23 July and made her next round trip between Rabaul and New Guinea from 24 to 28 July 1943, discharging cargo at Lae on 26 July. On her ninth trip, conducted between 30 July and 3 August 1943, she lost five or six supply drums overboard while outbound from Rabaul, but she dropped off the rest of her cargo at Lae on 2 August 1943. On her tenth run, she departed Rabaul on 6 August 1943, called at Lae on 8 August, and crash-dived during her return trip after her lookouts sighted an Allied plane on 9 August, but returned safely to Rabaul on 10 August 1943. =New Guinea and Solomon Islands= After taking aboard cargo from Nagoya Maru on 12 August 1943, I-38 departed Rabaul on 14 August on her eleventh supply run and first to the Solomon Islands, carrying cargo to Kolombangara. She was only about into her voyage that day when an Allied plane bombed and strafed her. On 15 August, six Allied aircraft attacked her in darkness and depth-charged her. She nonetheless unloaded her cargo at Kolombangara on 17 August. During her return voyage to Rabaul, her lookouts sighted six United States Army Air Forces B-24 Liberator bombers on 19 August and she crash-dived, but she made it back to Rabaul on 20 August 1943. I-38 received a new Unpoto from Toyo Maru on 26 August 1943. For her twelfth supply trip, she returned to the New Guinea run, departing Rabaul on 28 August, calling at Lae on 30 August, and then making for Rabaul. En route, she had to crash-dive several times on 1 September 1943 when Allied aircraft sighted her, but she reached Rabaul that day. After receiving another new Unpoto from Toyo Maru on 2 September, I-38 set out for her second trip to Kolombangara on 7 September 1943. While entering the Kolombangara Gulf, an Allied aircraft attacked her with a bomb but missed. Rather than unload her cargo at Kolombangara, she proceeded to Shortland Island, where she unloaded it on 12 September 1943 and got back underway for Rabaul. Only 30 minutes into her return voyage, her lookouts sighted an Allied plane, and she crash-dived. She was back on the surface again at 23:00 when an Allied plane surprised her — I-38′s crew reporting that the plane had switched off its engine to approach I-38 silently — and dropped three bombs, all of which missed. I-38 arrived at Rabaul on 13 September 1943. =New Guinea campaign, September–December 1943= I-38 resumed her focus on supplying the New Guinea campaign. After taking aboard a cargo of provisions from Toyo Maru on 17 September 1943, she got underway with the commander of Submarine Division 15 embarked on her fourteenth supply run to deliver supplies at Finschhafen on the Huon Peninsula. She arrived off Finschhafen on 22 September but could not make contact with the Imperial Japanese Army garrison ashore and moved back out to sea. She again approached Finschhafen after dark on 23 September and again failed to contact the soldiers on the coast, and later that night she sighted an Allied convoy but was unable to attack it because of the cargo she still had aboard. She made a third and final attempt to contact the Japanese forces ashore on 24 September, and when that failed as well she received orders to patrol in the area until 27 September and then deliver her cargo at Sarmi, New Guinea. After dropping off half her cargo at Sarmi on 27 September, she returned to Rabaul on 28 September 1943. On 3 October 1943, I-38 began her fifteenth supply run, departing Rabaul bound for Sarmi. While she was unloading at Sarmi on 5 October, an Allied plane attacked her, forcing her to submerge with two-thirds of her cargo still on her deck. She soon surfaced, completed unloading, and began her return trip to Rabaul, where she arrived on 8 October 1943. While at Rabaul, I-38 began tests of the Unkato supply container — a submersible cargo container that could carry up to 377 tons of supplies, designed for a one-way trip in which the cargo′s recipients released, recovered, and unloaded it — on 10 October 1943. On 12 October 1943, the U.S. Army Air Forces Fifth Air Force and the Royal Australian Air Force combined to stage the largest Allied air raid of the Pacific War up to that time, with 349 aircraft based in New Guinea and Australia hitting Japanese airfields around Rabaul and shipping in Simpson Harbour at Rabaul. I-38 and the submarines , , , , and were in the harbor during the air raid and most of them submerged to avoid attack. I-38 concluded her unsuccessful Unkato tests on 13 October 1943. On 15 October 1943, I-38 got underway from Rabaul on her sixteenth supply run. She arrived at Sarmi on 16 October, but had to suspend cargo-unloading operations when a severe thunderstorm struck. A U.S. Navy PT boat then attacked her, forced her to dive, and dropped four depth charges. I-38 returned to Sarmi after dark on 17 October and managed to discharge 80 percent of her cargo into two Daihatsus before departing for Rabaul. She was off Rabaul on 18 October when she sighted Allied aircraft heading for Rabaul and had to dive four times to avoid them, but she made it safely into Rabaul that day. At Rabaul, she conducted Unkato supply container tests again on 20 and 21 October 1943. I-38 left Rabaul for her seventeenth supply run on the morning of 24 October 1943, submerging at around 09:15 when her lookouts spotted an Allied plane. She delivered her cargo at Sarmi on 25 October and had to crash-dive again because of an Allied plane on her return voyage to Rabaul, which she reached on 26 October 1943. On her eighteenth supply run, she departed Rabaul on 29 October 1943, submerged en route when she sighted an approaching formation of Allied aircraft, called at Sio, New Guinea, on 31 October, and headed back for Rabaul, where she arrived at around 13:00 on 2 November 1943. That afternoon, 145 aircraft of the U.S. Army Air Forces Fifth Air Force attacked Rabaul's airfields and harbor in support of the previous day′s landings at Cape Torokina on Bougainville, which began the Bougainville campaign. I-38 submerged in the harbor to avoid attack, and after she resurfaced she used her deck gun to scuttle a crippled ship in Simpson Harbour. I-38 loaded cargo on 4 November 1943 and got underway for her nineteenth supply run on 5 November, towing an Unkato supply container. Allied aircraft attacked her that day, forcing her to submerge, and when she surfaced she abandoned the Unkato at sea. She unloaded her cargo at Sio on the evening of 7 November, embarked wounded and sick soldiers, and got back underway for Rabaul. She sighted Allied reconnaissance aircraft and submerged twice on 9 November 1943 during her return voyage, but arrived safely at Rabaul that day. She conducted more Unkato towing tests off Rabaul on 16 and 17 November 1943. She began her twentieth supply run on 18 November 1943, and saw action on 19 November, when a U.S. Navy PT boat attacked her, forcing her to crash-dive, and attacked her with four depth charges. Emerging from the encounter unscathed, she unloaded her cargo at Sarmi that evening and arrived at Rabaul on 20 November 1943. She made one more run before the end of November 1943, departing Rabaul on 23 November, delivering her cargo at Sio on 25 November, and surviving an encounter with an Allied bomber which dropped a bomb but missed her during her return trip on 26 November. She arrived at Rabaul on 27 November 1943. Between 1 and 7 December 1943, I-38 conducted more Unkato towing tests and performed a speed trial. She resumed her supply activities on 7 December 1943, when she began her 22nd supply run, departing Rabaul with an Unpoto sled in tow and unloading her cargo and transferring the Unpoto to a Daihatsu at Sarmi on 9 December, and on 11 December she returned to Rabaul, where she conducted Unkato towing tests on 18 and 19 December. She got underway from Rabaul towing an Unkato on 19 December 1943 for her 23rd — and, as it turned out, last — supply run. Detached from the Southeast Submarine Force while at sea on 20 December, she delivered her cargo and the Unkato at Sio on 21 December before returning to Rabaul on 24 December 1943. She had delivered a total of 753 tons of cargo to New Guinea, Kolombangara, and Shortland Island during her 23 trips, and in March 1944 the commander-in-chief of the Combined Fleet, Admiral Mineichi Koga, decorated I-38′s commanding officer for his submarine′s supply achievements. I-38 left Rabaul on 26 December 1943 and set course for Truk, where she arrived on 29 December. At 15:00 on 30 December 1943, she got back underway, bound for Japan. By 1 January 1944 a member of Submarine Division 15 in along with the submarines , , , and , I-38 arrived at Kure for repairs and overhaul on 7 January 1944. =Second war patrol= While I-38 was at Kure, Submarine Squadron 1 was disbanded, and Submarine Division 15 — I-32, I-35, I-36, I-38, and I-41 — was attached directly to the 6th Fleet on 15 January 1944. After her overhaul was completed, I-38 departed Kure on 14 March 1944 to return to combat. On 19 March 1944, the submarine chaser and auxiliary submarine chaser Fuyo Maru escorted her into Truk Lagoon. She remained at Truk until 30 March 1944, when she got underway for her second war patrol, assigned a patrol area in the Palau area. On 4 April 1944, she received orders to divert from her patrol to pick up the staff of the 9th Fleet at Wewak, New Guinea, and transfer it to Hollandia, New Guinea. She embarked a first group of 9th Fleet staff members at Wewak on 8 April, disembarked them at Hollandia on 10 April, brought aboard the remainder of the staff at Wewak on 12 April, and completed the transfer by discharging them at Hollandia as well on 14 April 1944. She called at Truk from 19 to 20 April 1944, then proceeded to Kure, where she arrived on 27 April 1944. =Operation Tatsumaki= In April 1944 I-38, the submarines I-36, I-41, and , and the auxiliary submarine tender began training in the Seto Inland Sea off Nasakejima for Operation Tatsumaki (\\"Tornado\\"), which called for the submarines to transport modified Type 4 Ka-Tsu amphibious tracked landing craft, each armed with two torpedoes, from Kure to Majuro in the Marshall Islands. After the submarines launched the Ka-Tsu vehicles, the operation called for the vehicles to proceed to shore, move overland across the atoll′s islands, then enter the water in the lagoon and attack Allied ships in the Majuro anchorage with torpedoes. In the later part of May 1944, Operation Tatsumaki was postponed pending the correction of defects found in the vehicles. The operation later was canceled entirely. =Third war patrol= I-38 set out from Kure on 18 May 1944 with a Yokosuka E14Y1 (Allied reporting name \\"Glen\\") floatplane embarked to begin her third war patrol, during which she was to patrol in the Pacific Ocean east of the Marshall Islands and use the floatplane to conduct a reconnaissance fight over Kwajalein. After she put to sea, she received orders changing her reconnaissance target to Majuro. On 13 June 1944, the commander-in-chief of the Combined Fleet, Admiral Soemu Toyoda, activated Operation A-Go for the defense of the Mariana Islands and ordered the commander-in-chief of the 6th Fleet, Vice Admiral Takeo Takagi, to redeploy all 6th Fleet submarines to the Marianas. When the Marianas campaign began with the U.S. landings on Saipan on 15 June 1944, I-38 and the submarines , , I-38, I-41, , and received orders to remain on patrol off the Marianas while the rest of the 6th Fleet′s submarines withdrew from the area. On 16 June 1944, I-38 was assigned to Submarine Unit A, tasked with patrolling in the Pacific east of the Marianas. She received orders on 28 June 1944 to evacuate the 6th Fleet′s staff from Saipan, but did not succeed, and Takagi canceled all rescue operations for his staff on 2 July 1944. Ordered on 7 July 1944 to return to Japan, I-38 arrived at Sasebo on 16 July 1944 to undergo a refit that included applying an anti-radar coating to her. =Fourth war patrol= Toyoda activated Operation Shō-Gō 1 for the defense of the Philippine Islands on 13 October 1944. With her refit complete, I-38 was assigned to Submarine Unit B on 18 October 1944, and on 19 October 1944 got underway from Kure for her fourth war patrol, assigned a patrol area with I-41 in the Philippine Sea east of the Philippines. The Battle of Leyte began with the U.S. landings on Leyte on 20 October 1944, and the Japanese naval reaction to the landings resulted in the Battle of Leyte Gulf of 23–26 October 1944. I-38 arrived in her patrol area east of Leyte and Samar on 25 October 1944 with the Battle of Leyte Gulf raging, but saw no action in the battle. On 5 November 1944, I-38 received orders to conduct a reconnaissance of Ngulu Atoll in the Caroline Islands to determine if Allied ships were anchoring there, information that the Japanese needed to plan future attacks by piloted kaiten suicide attack torpedoes against Allied anchorages. Her reconnaissance was planned for 11 November 1944. While en route to Ngulu Atoll, she transmitted a report that she had sighted an Allied task force in the Philippine Sea east of Luzon on 7 November 1944. The Japanese never heard from her again. =Loss= On 12 November 1944, the destroyer — which along with the destroyer was escorting the light cruiser on a voyage from Ulithi Atoll to Kossol Roads at Palau — picked up a surface contact on radar east of Palau at a range of at 20:03. Nicholas closed the range and opened radar- directed gunfire with her guns, but the contact disappeared, indicating it was a submarine that had submerged. At around 22:30, Nicholas acquired sonar contact on a submerged submarine and dropped a pattern of 18 depth charges. She subsequently lost contact with the submarine, but at 00:30 on 13 November 1944 she regained it and approached for an attack. When her sonar operator reported that the submarine had made a last-minute hard turn to starboard, Nicholas also turned hard to starboard, backing with her starboard engine as she did. The maneuver put her almost on top of the submarine, and she dropped a pattern of depth charges. A few minutes after the last depth charge detonated, a huge underwater explosion occurred. It marked the sinking of a Japanese submarine at . After sunrise on 13 November, debris and human remains were sighted floating in the area. I-38 did not send a scheduled message to the 6th Fleet on 13 November 1944, and the submarine Nicholas sank early that morning probably was her. On 6 December 1944, the Imperial Japanese Navy declared I-38 to be presumed lost off the Palau Islands along with all 110 men on board. She was stricken from the Navy list on 10 March 1945.

The classification of heterokonts is still unsettled: they may be designated a division, phylum, kingdom, or something intermediate to those. Consequently, diatoms are ranked anywhere from a class, usually called Diatomophyceae or Bacillariophyceae, to a division (=phylum), usually called Bacillariophyta, with corresponding changes in the ranks of their subgroups. Genera and species An estimated 20,000 extant diatom species are believed to exist, of which around 12,000 have been named to date according to Guiry, 2012 (other sources give a wider range of estimatesCanter-Lund, H. and Lund, J.W.G. (1995). Freshwater Algae: Their microscopic world explained, Biopress Limited. .). Around 1,000-1,300 diatom genera have been described, both extant and fossil,The World Register of Marine Species lists 1,356 diatom genus names from all habitats as at July 2020, of which 1,248 are \\"accepted\\". of which some 250-300 exist only as fossils.Queries to the World Register of Marine Species, July 2020, return 299 \\"fossil only\\" genus names, of which 285 are \\"accepted\\". Classes and orders =Overview= For many years the diatoms—treated either as a class (Bacillariophyceae) or a phylum (Bacillariophyta)—were divided into just 2 orders, corresponding to the centric and the pennate diatoms (Centrales and Pennales). This classification was extensively overhauled by Round, Crawford and Mann in 1990 who treated the diatoms at a higher rank (division, corresponding to phylum in zoological classification), and promoted the major classification units to classes, maintaining the centric diatoms as a single class Coscinodiscophyceae, but splitting the former pennate diatoms into 2 separate classes, Fragilariophyceae and Bacillariophyceae (the latter older name retained but with an emended definition), between them encompassing 45 orders, the majority of them new. Today (writing at mid 2020) it is recognised that the 1990 system of Round et al. is in need of revision with the advent of newer molecular work, however the best system to replace it is unclear, and current systems in widespread use such as AlgaeBase, the World Register of Marine Species and its contributing database DiatomBase, and the system for \\"all life\\" represented in Ruggiero et al., 2015, all retain the Round et al. treatment as their basis, albeit with diatoms as a whole treated as a class rather than division/phylum, and Round et al.'s classes reduced to subclasses, for better agreement with the treatment of phylogenetically adjacent groups and their containing taxa. (For references refer the individual sections below). One proposal, by Linda Medlin and co-workers commencing in 2004, is for some of the centric diatom orders considered more closely related to the pennates to be split off as a new class, Mediophyceae, itself more closely aligned with the pennate diatoms than the remaining centrics. This hypothesis—later designated the Coscinodiscophyceae-Mediophyceae-Bacillariophyceae, or Coscinodiscophyceae+(Mediophyceae+Bacillariophyceae) (CMB) hypothesis—has been accepted by D.G. Mann among others, who uses it as the basis for the classification of diatoms as presented in Adl. et al.'s series of syntheses (2005, 2012, 2019), and also in the Bacillariophyta chapter of the 2017 Handbook of the Protists edited by Archibald et al., with some modifications reflecting the apparent non-monophyly of Medlin et al. original \\"Coscinodiscophyceae\\". Meanwhile, a group led by E.C. Theriot favours a different hypothesis of phylogeny, which has been termed the structural gradation hypothesis (SGH) and does not recognise the Mediophyceae as a monophyletic group, while another analysis, that of Parks et al., 2018, finds that the radial centric diatoms (Medlin et al.'s Coscinodiscophyceae) are not monophyletic, but supports the monophyly of Mediophyceae minus Attheya, which is an anomalous genus. Discussion of the relative merits of these conflicting schemes continues by the various parties involved. =Round et al., 1990= Based on the fact that pennate diatoms either do or do not have a longitudinal groove in the valve, called a raphe,O.E.D. 2nd edition 2005 a 1990 classification by Round, Crawford & Mann divides the diatoms (as Bacillarophyta) into three classes, centric (22 orders); pennate without a raphe (12 orders); and pennate with a raphe (11 orders), as follows: *Phylum Bacillarophyta (diatoms) :*Class Coscinodiscophyceae Round & R.M.Crawford (centric diatoms) ::* Subclass Biddulphiophycidae Round & R.M.Crawford :::* Anaulales Round & R.M.Crawford :::* Biddulphiales Krieger :::* Hemiaulales Round & R.M.Crawford :::* Triceratiales Round & R.M.Crawford ::* Subclass Chaetocerotophycidae Round & R.M.Crawford :::* Chaetocerotales Round & R.M.Crawford :::* Leptocylindrales Round & R.M.Crawford ::* Subclass Corethrophycidae Round & R.M.Crawford :::* Corethrales Round & R.M.Crawford ::* Subclass Coscinodiscophycidae Round & R.M.Crawford :::* Arachnoidiscales Round :::* Asterolamprales Round :::* Aulacoseirales R.M.Crawford :::* Chrysanthemodiscales Round :::* Coscinodiscales Round :::* Ethmodiscales Round :::* Melosirales R.M.Crawford :::* Orthoseirales R.M.Crawford :::* Paraliales R.M.Crawford :::* Stictocyclales Round :::* Stictodiscales Round & R.M.Crawford ::* Subclass Cymatosirophycidae Round & R.M.Crawford :::* Cymatosirales Round & R.M.Crawford ::* Subclass Lithodesmiophycidae Round & R.M.Crawford :::* Lithodesmiales Round & R.M.Crawford ::* Subclass Rhizosoleniophycidae Round & R.M.Crawford :::* Rhizosoleniales Silva ::* Subclass Thalassiosirophycidae Round & R.M.Crawford :::* Thalassiosirales Glezer & Makarova :* Class Fragilariophyceae Round (pennate diatoms without a raphe (araphids)) ::* Subclass Fragilariophycidae Round :::* Ardissoneales Round :::* Climacospheniales Round :::* Cyclophorales Round & R.M.Crawford :::* Fragilariales P.C.Silva :::* Licmophorales Round :::* Protoraphidales Round :::* Rhabdonematales Round & R.M.Crawford :::* Rhaphoneidales Round :::* Striatellales Round :::* Tabellariales Round :::* Thalassionematales Round :::* Toxariales Round :* Class Bacillariophyceae Haeckel, 1878, emend.

Medlin and co-workers erected a new class, Mediophyceae (which could be re-ranked a subclass if diatoms as a whole are ranked as a class rather than a phylum) for the \\"polar centric\\" diatoms, which they consider to be more closely related to the pennate rather than to other centric diatoms, a concept which has been followed and/or further adapted by some (e.g. Adl et al., 2019, see below), but not all subsequent workers at this time. * Phylum Bacillariophyta (diatoms) :* Subphylum Coscinodiscophytina ::* Class Coscinodiscophyceae (\\"radial centrics\\") :::* Arachnoidiscales :::* Asterolamprales :::* Aulacoseirales :::* Corethrales :::* Coscinodiscales :::* Chrysanthemodiscales :::* Ethmodiscales :::* Leptocylindrales :::* Melosirales :::* Orthoseirales :::* Rhizosoleniales :::* Stictocyclales :::* Stictodiscales :* Subphylum Bacillariophytina ::* Class Mediophyceae (\\"polar centrics\\") :::* Ardissoneales :::* Biddulphiales :::* Chaetocerotales :::* Cymatosirales :::* Hemiaulales :::* Lithodesmiales :::* Thalassiosirales :::* Toxariales :::* Triceratiales ::* Class Bacillariophyceae (pennate diatoms) :::* Achnanthales :::* Bacillariales :::* Cymbellales :::* Dictyoneidales :::* Eunotiales :::* Fragilariales :::* Licmophorales :::* Lyrellales :::* Mastogloiales :::* Naviculales :::* Rhabdonematales :::* Rhaphoneidales :::* Rhopalodiales :::* Surirellales :::* Tabellariales :::* Thalassionematales :::* Thalassiophysales =Ruggiero et al., 2015= In the treatment for \\"all life\\" (down to order, extant taxa only) by Ruggiero et al., 2015, the diatoms are treated as follows.

Mann, in Adl et al. 2019, presented his most recent classification of diatoms as follows, while noting: \\"This revision reflects numerous advances in the phylogeny of the diatoms over the last decade. Due to our poor taxon sampling outside of the Mediophyceae and pennate diatoms, and the known and anticipated diversity of all diatoms, many clades appear at a high classification level (and the higher level classification is rather flat).\\" This classification treats diatoms as a phylum (Diatomeae/Bacillariophyta), accepts the class Mediophyceae of Medlin and co-workers, introduces new subphyla and classes for a number of otherwise isolated genera, and re-ranks a number of previously established taxa as subclasses, but does not list orders or families. Inferred ranks have been added for clarity (Adl. et al. do not use ranks, but the intended ones in this portion of the classification are apparent from the choice of endings used, within the system of botanical nomenclature employed). * Clade Diatomista Derelle et al. 2016, emend.

He resigned from this position in 2001 after criticising the ZANU-PF government headed by President Robert Mugabe. Moyo ran for the president of Zimbabwe in 2018 on a newly launched political platform, Alliance for the People’s Agenda scoring only 15,000 votes. His campaign focused on plans for economic expansion and fight against corruption. He is the founder and remained the Executive chairman of Nelson Mandela Development Studies.

He earned an MBA from Cranfield School of Management, Cranfield University in the UK and a PhD in Physics from Imperial College (University of London). His early career was in academic and later moved to commerce and industry sector where he spent six years before transferring his services to financial sector. He served as Managing Director of Standard Chartered Merchant Bank in Zimbabwe and rose to the position of Regional Head of Corporate Banking - Africa, based in London overseeing 14 African countries. Moyo served as Managing Director and Country Head of Standard Chartered Bank in Tanzania. He served at the International Finance Corporation of the World Bank as an Associate Director, based in Washington, with responsibility for all SMEs operations in Africa. In 2004, he joined an equity firm, Actis operating in Africa, Asia and Latin as a Managing Partner and was the Advisor on Africa. Between March 2009 and August 2011, Moyo was Vice- President and Chief Operating Officer, African Development Bank. In 2000, President Robert Mugabe appointed Moyo into his cabinet as Minister of Industry and International Trade. While in this position, he criticised the ruling ZANU-PF policies and voluntarily tendered his resignation letter to President Mugabe from South Africa via fax to avoid possible confrontation with Mugabe in 2001. After receiving the letter, President Mugabe reportedly labelled him a \\"coward\\" and \\"spineless\\" and further remarked “I do not want ministers who are in the habit of running away. I want those I can call amadoda sibili (real men), people with spine. Our revolution . . . was not fought by cowards. If some of you are getting weak-kneed, tell us and we will continue with the struggle”.  Presidential run  = 2018 = Moyo declared his presidential ambition on 29 June 2017 that he would run on the platform of Alliance for the People’s Agenda (APA) in the 2018 presidential election. His campaign manifesto titled “It is time to rehabilitate Zimbabwe”, focused on issues such as economic management, service delivery, arresting corruption, reducing Government wage bill, human and social development, nation building, tourism, mining and agriculture. In an informal survey conducted by VOA Studio 7 on a social media platform, Twitter, about 72 per cent of the respondents said Moyo should withdraw from the race while 13 per cent gave him a nod to contest in the poll. The poll was not universal to reflect the popular view of Zimbabweans. Moyo, one of the 15 candidates for president scored a paltry 15,000 of the votes cast.

Prior to his death, his home and adjoining land was created into the Auburn Valley State Park.  Early life  Marshall Jr was born to T. Clarence Marshall and Esther Shallcross Marshall, and spent the first eighty-four years living in Yorklyn at the Victorian-era mansion built by his grandparents in 1897. He attended Wilmington Friends School and graduated in 1941, then Mercersburg Academy before attending M.I.T. between 1942 and 1943. He served in the US Army from 1942 until 1946 as a weather forecaster in New Mexico before joining a B-24 flight crew as a aerial weather observer in the Western Pacific. While a part of the crew he flew over the USS Missouri in the Tokyo Harbor the day of the surrender ceremony that ended World War II.  Stanley Steamer collection  Marshall Jr. inherited his fathers car collection, which began in 1910 when his father was an authorized dealer; and the first in Delaware, for the company based in Newton, Massachusetts. While the collection peaked at forty cars, of which 24 were Steamers, Marshall Jr inherited 34 vehicles and gradually reduced that number to fifteen Steamers, two Packards and one early electric car. He drove one of the vehicles a 30-horsepower 1912 Stanley Steamer touring car on four transcontinental tours. One spanned 8,328 miles and visited Montreal, Canada and Tijuana, Mexico before returning to Yorklyn, Delaware which he completed in 1972. The family opened the collection and the surrounding property to the public in the 1970s, along with the 1/8 scale steam train line that Marshall Jr had installed on the property.  Philanthropy  He served on many non- profit and philanthropy based boards including Mercersburg Academy, Historic Red Clay Valley, the Friends of Old Drawyers and the Red Clay Valley Association. As a Quaker, Marshall Jr served with multiple Quaker organizations such as Hockessin Friends Meeting and the Friends Home in Kennett Square, Pennsylvania. He was a founder of the Wilmington & Western Railroad, a historic nonprofit tourist train line in Wilmington, Delaware and served as its first President and General Manager from 1960 until 1971 and continued as a volunteer and board member. He had presented the idea of the line in 1959 and purchased the first steam locomotive that the organization would use. In 2008, he and his wife donated the mansion and four acres around it to the state of Delaware when they moved to a senior community center. The home and acreage was named the Auburn Heights Preserve and an additional 300 acres was purchased to protect the rural setting of the land. Also a part of the preserve is the car collection housed in the T. Clarence Marshall Steam Museum, which is leased to the state by the Friends of Auburn Heights Preserve and houses the largest collection of operating Stanley Steamer automobiles in the world.  Personal life  Prior to his death, Marshall Jr was married to his wife Ruth Pierson Marshall for thirty-three and a half years.

Heady published multiple volumes of children's books and poetry and was frequently referred to by the contemporary press as the \\"Blind Bard of Kentucky\\". He was one of the first advocates for books for the blind in the United States and he invented several devices to facilitate communication and improve quality of life for deaf and blind people. Early life and education James Morrison Heady was born July 19, 1829, in Elk Creek, Kentucky. He was blinded in one eye in early childhood by a chip from a woodcutter's axe, and at age sixteen he lost sight in the other eye while playing with a schoolmate. His hearing was damaged after a fall from a horse as a child, worsening until he was completely deaf by the age of forty. After losing his sight at sixteen, Heady attended the Kentucky School for the Blind for a year, then attended the Ohio State School for the Blind for another fourteen months. He learned to read embossed print and invented a \\"talking glove\\", a cotton glove with the letters of the alphabet printed at multiple places on the hand, using this tactile spelling to communicate with friends. He was largely self-educated through reading books and compiled one of the largest private collections of raised-type books in the United States. One of Heady's inventions, the \\"talking glove\\" Writing and advocacy for the deaf and blind Heady developed a number of friendships with other deafblind people, including Helen Keller and Laura Bridgman. He also cultivated relationships with poet John Greenleaf Whittier, physician Simon Flexner, and legal scholar Lewis Naphtali Dembitz, each of whom read to Heady. He read Matilda Ziegler Magazine for the Blind and other periodicals in embossed print to keep informed about current affairs. In his 20s Heady traveled throughout the United States advocating for more books to be made available to the blind. In 1854 he began collecting monetary donations for the publication of Milton's Paradise Lost in embossed type. Heady inspired Dempsey Sherrod, a blind man from Mississippi, to raise funds for a national printing house for books for blind people, which was established as the American Printing House for the Blind. In 1860 Heady was appointed by the printing house's board to solicit donations for publishing raised-type books. His literary career began when he would gather local schoolchildren to hear his stories about pioneer days; friends encouraged him to write and publish the stories. His first book, a children's biography of George Washington titled The Farmer Boy, and How He Became Commander-in-Chief, was written by Heady in 1864 under the pen name Uncle Juvinell; it sold over 8,000 copies. One of his most significant works was a book of verse titled The Double Night and Other Poems, which touched on autobiographical themes of loss. He wrote in multiple genres, including children's books, romantic verse, and philosophical poetry. Heady devised several inventions in his lifetime, including several designed to make life easier for deaf and/or blind people. His inventions included a self-opening gate, a swivel chair, and a thermos to keep coffee warm. In the 1860s he built a hydraulic machine for raising water from wells and cisterns. Heady also created a working prototype of a steam-powered embossing press. Another of his inventions was the \\"diplograph\\", a typewriter that with the flip of a switch would type in one of three different embossed scripts used by the blind: Boston line letter, New York Point, or braille. He left Spencer County in 1901, moving to Louisville. Heady finished his last two works at age 86, shortly before his death. He died December 19, 1915. Legacy A biography of Heady's life, Beyond the Double Night, was written by Ken D. Thompson and published in 1996.

It was disbanded at Dortumund, Germany, in 1993. Until 1985, the Royal Regiment of Artillery maintained three staff bands; one major staff band and two minor staff bands. The Royal Artillery Alanbrooke Band, like its older sister band, the Royal Artillery Mounted Band, was known in the army as a 'minor staff band', in other words, because the regiment had its main band, the famous Royal Artillery Band, stationed permanently at Woolwich, any additional 'satellite' bands formed within the regiment automatically held the minor staff band status. So that the main band could remain based permanently in London, a satellite band was situated in Germany, at Dortmund, and another at Larkhill in Wiltshire. For many years the two minor staff bands would alternate locations. The Royal Regiment of Artillery was the largest regiment in the British Army, practically identical to a 'corps', and in fact comprised several regiments. For this reason, it was considered necessary for the regiment to maintain more than one band. Like its sister band, the Royal Artillery Mounted Band, and the main Royal Artillery Band, the Alanbrooke Band was able to function as an orchestra, because all Royal Artillery musicians were required to play at least two instruments each; a military band instrument, and an orchestral one. The Band's history rests on the history of the Royal Artillery Band (Woolwich).  History and Officers Commanding  The history of the Royal Artillery Alanbrooke Band is inextricably linked to that of its parent band, the Royal Artillery Band (Woolwich). War Office authority was given to form a band at Portsmouth on 1st April 1903. WO1 George Miller, Bandmaster of the 2nd Battalion The Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry was appointed as the bands first bandmaster. The band's task was to provide musical support for the Garrison, its surrounding area, and almost all of the south coast. As in the case for all bands of the Royal Artillery, the Portsmouth Band required that each of its musicians be proficient on two instruments; one military band instrument, and one orchestral. On 25th August 1953, the 41-strong Royal Artillery (Portsmouth) Band moved to Germany to become the Staff Band to all Royal Artillery regiments in BAOR. The band's strength was increased to 61 musicians. The name of the band was changed accordingly to the Royal Artillery (BAOR) Band, and it was stationed with HQ5 AGRA in Oldenburg. In 1958 the band moved to the 2nd Infantry Division at Dortmund. In March 1958 the band provided music for the state visit of Her Majesty The Queen to the Netherlands, for which it provided a full concert orchestra for the reception at The Hague, and a salon orchestra at the Commonwealth Ball in the evening. In 1967 the band returned to England, and was stationed at Larkhill, Wiltshire, where it was again renamed to become the Royal Artillery (Larkhill) Band. During this period the band made a number of recordings for the BBC for their radio 'Bandstand' series, while its salon orchestra proved particularly popular with the officers at the School of Artillery. In 1972 the band returned to Dortmund to relieve the Royal Artillery (Mounted) Band, and the decision had been made for the two bands to thereafter to take it in turn to swap between Larkhill and BAOR. The Field Marshal, the Viscount Alanbrooke was the Commandant of the School of Artillery between 1929 and 1932, and from 1939 to 1945 he was Chief of the Imperial General Staff. It was decided to honour him by changing the name of the Larkhill Band to The Royal Artillery (Alanbrooke) Band, which it held until its disbandment, brought about by the breach of the Berlin Wall, and the need to reduce the number of regiments at that time in BAOR. In 1972 the Royal Artillery (Alanbrooke) Band played for the Four Nations Carol Service in Berlin (for America, Germany, France and Britain). The band's first exchange with the Royal Artillery (Mounted) Band occurred in 1977, and the idea was that the two bands would continue to exchange locations every five years. Howevr, this would not be the case, because the Royal Artillery (Mounted) Band was disbanded in 1985. Owing to the army's Options for Change, the Alanbrooke Band was due to disband by the end of April 1995 as a result of the breach of the Berlin Wall. However, in 1993 it was decided to create a band for the rapidly expanding Army Air Corps, and the position of Director of Music was given to Captain Geoffrey Kinston, the Alanbrooke Band's final director of music. It was agreed that the core of the new band be made of Alanbrooke Band musicians, with the option of voluntary redundancy. or a posting to the Royal Artillery Band in Woolwich, for those musicians who would not become founder members of the Band of the Army Air Corps. All of the musicians who transferred to the Army Air Corps, were double-handers (proficient on both a military band, and an orchestral, instrument).

Since its publication in Portuguese in 1976, the book has been republished and translated into more than 18 different languages, including a translation into English by Margaret A. Neves, published by Readers International in 1987. This novel made its author famous all over Brazil and worldwide. The novel in Portuguese is in its 32nd edition and in different formats. Originally published by Editora Ática, its first edition sold 30,000 copies right after its release. After its 15th edition, Record Publishers acquired the rights of publication of all of the author's works.  Media Reception  The book was well-acclaimed by critics and began to be used as a literary classic in many schools and universities in Brazil. Among the innumerable reviews, essays and academic studies in masters theses and doctoral dissertations, several writers and important critics from different parts of the world have written positive comments about this book: Doris Lessing (England), Teolinda Gersão (Portugal), Ascensión Rivas (Spain) and many other writers from Brazil, such as Jorge Amado and Affonso Romano de Sant'Anna, and newspaper critics such as Leo Gilson Ribeiro (Jornal da Tarde, São Paulo), Leonor Bassères (Tribuna da Imprensa, Rio de Janeiro), Irineu Garcia (Jornal de Letras, Lisbon), Torriéri Guimarães (Folha da Tarde, São Paulo), Flávio Moreira da Costa (O Globo, Rio de Janeiro), Wladyr Nader (Folha de São Paulo), Gerson Pereira Valle (Tribuna de Petrópolis), Gerana Damulakis (A Tarde, Salvador). The land has generated a trilogy, with O cachorro e o lobo [The Dog and the Wolf] and Pelo fundo da agulha [Through the eye of the needle], both very well received by critics and the public. It also received good criticism in France. The site remue.net described the book as \\"a romanesque song of love and despair\\" [\\"ce chant romanesque d’amour et de désespoir\\"]. In English, the novel was reviewed by Kirkus and by Publishers Weekly. It is cited in The Cambridge Companion to the Postcolonial Novel and in Richard Pine's The Disappointed Bridge: Ireland and the Post-Colonial World. This is the first of Torres's two novels published in English. The other one is Blues for a Lost Childhood (1989), translated by John Parker and also published by Readers International, which was reviewed by The Los Angeles Time. The Land also has two Wikipedia entries, one in Portuguese and another one in French.  Content Summary  The novel is divided into four parts: \\"The Land Calls Me,\\" \\"The Land Casts Me Out,\\" \\"The Land Maddens Me,\\" and \\"The Land Takes me Back.\\" Each part is followed by an illustration by Brazilian artist Djanira, whose work also illustrates the book's cover. At the time of its release in English, the Book Review in Kirkus defined the book as \\"a sad, simple, lyrical novel about a poor family's dashed hopes when a favored son returns from the big city to commit suicide.\\" The novel plays with contemporary narrative styles and with the techniques of flash forward and flashback. It takes place in a village named Junco, a small, poor place in the state of Bahia in rural Brazil, which is described by the initial narrator, a young man named Totonhim, as \\"the end of the world.\\" Everyone in the village mirrors their dreams in Totonhim's brother Nelo, who had left town in search of fame and success in the distant industrial and wealthy city of São Paulo. However, everyone's dreams and hopes come to naught when Nelo returns. Instead of famous and rich, he is a penniless drunkard who ends up hanging himself, crushing everybody's hopes transferred to the mythological figure. The novel is then narrated in flashback from the points of view of Nelo's mother and father. As they try to make sense of what led to the tragic end of their son, the family also tries to come to grips with \\"what has always been the hopelessness and cruelty of their lives.\\" During Nelo's funeral, his deluded mother starts a process of denial by rejecting her son's death and confusing her son Totonhim with the deceased Nelo. Totonhim then decides to leave Junco and follow his brother's footsteps, although he is aware that the dream promised by the big city is a mere illusion. The Land is considered a despairing, political novel, which shows Torres' mastery of melodic prose and style, as well as his affectionate knowledge of rural Brazil.

It was executed in ca. 1656. The subject of the sculpture is Cornelis II Landschot, a wealthy Flemish businessman and philanthropist. The sculpture, today housed at the Maagdenhuis Museum, used to stand above the entrance to the chapel of Falconrui, founded by Landschot. Composition The bust emblematizes the deep influence of Italian sculpture on sculpted portraiture in the Netherlands. Van den Eynde himself had traveled to Italy, living in Rome at the same time as François Duquesnoy and Gian Lorenzo Bernini. According to some sources, Van den Eynde returned to Antwerp in 1656. Cornelis Landschot is depicted in a simple shirt with a square collar, over which a piece of cloth is draped. The latter is fastened to the left shoulder with a round pin, fully covering the bottom of the bust, with the overlapping, overhanging (but not dynamic, over-elaborate or billowing) folds of the drapery acting as the bust's lower limit. Both the cloak and the pin are strongly reminiscent of Italian, Roman inspired cinquecento, thus of pre Mannerist and pre Baroque sculpture. Van den Eynde might have studied the work of his Italian predecessors with his own eyes during the study trip he made immediately prior to this assignment. In terms of quality of execution, this sculpture is not inferior to its Italian counterparts. The client is accurately and naturalistically portrayed via an extremely refined surface treatment of the physiognomy. It was depicted slightly bent over, probably in order to allow the churchgoers leaving the chapel to better look at the bust from their frog's eye view.

It was written over a period of twenty years, stretching from Wilde's years as an Oxford student up to the poem's publication in an édition de luxe in 1894. The Sphinx drew on a wide range of sources, both ancient and modern, but particularly on various works of the French Decadent movement. Though at first coldly received by critics it is now generally recognized as Wilde's finest Decadent poem, and has been described as \\"unrivalled: a quintessential piece of fin-de-siècle art\\".  Synopsis  The poem begins with the narrator describing the figure of a sphinx which stands \\"in a dim corner of my room\\".Line 1 He then addresses her, \\"Come forth you exquisite grotesque! half woman and half animal!\\",Line 12 and asks to stroke her. He contrasts her immense antiquity with his own \\"twenty summers\\",Line 18 and begins to enumerate scenes of Classical history and Egyptian mythology, asking her if she witnessed them. He next turns to the question \\"Who were your lovers? who were they who wrestled for you in the dust?\\"Line 45 He suggests various Egyptian animals, mythical beasts, men, women and gods, before announcing \\"Nay, I know / Great Ammon was your bedfellow!\\"Lines 73-74 He details the beginning of their sexual liaison, and describes Ammon's personal beauty and splendour, before reflecting that that splendour has all come to ruin. He bids the sphinx return to Egypt to find and honour Ammon's remains; yet Ammon is not dead, and neither are any of her other divine lovers. In Egypt she could resume any of her former passions with god or beast. The narrator dismisses her with disgust both for her and for himself: \\"You make my creed a barren sham, you wake foul dreams of sensual life\\".Line 169 Finally, he asks to be left to his crucifix with its figure of Christ, who \\"weeps for every soul who dies, and weeps for every soul in vain\\".Line 174  Composition  The writing of The Sphinx was a long and complicated process, lasting almost twenty years and producing eleven surviving groups of manuscripts. Wilde began working on it in 1874, the year he went up to Oxford, possibly in the summer of that year when he was on holiday in Paris with his parents. In 1883, again in Paris, he returned to the poem and produced a version which included thirteen stanzas not found in the published poem. By the 1890s Wilde, needing money and wanting to present himself as something more than a fiction- writer and journalist, brought his poem into its final form, ready for publication.  Publication  The title-page of the first edition of The Sphinx, with decorations by Charles Ricketts The Sphinx was published on 11 June 1894 by Elkin Mathews and John Lane in an edition of just 200 copies along with a large-paper edition limited to 25 copies. It was printed in black, green, and red, and boasted illustrations by Charles Ricketts, who also designed the vellum and gold binding. It has been described as \\"the most exquisite of all Wilde's first editions...so beautiful that, read in any other format, it seems to lose half of its power\\". Wilde dedicated the book to his friend Marcel Schwob, and remarked that \\"My first idea was to print only three copies: one for myself, one for the British Museum, and one for Heaven. I had some doubts about the British Museum.\\"  Verse form  The Sphinx was originally written in the four-line stanza, rhyming ABBA, used by Tennyson in his In Memoriam and by Wilde himself in very many of his poems. Later, by eliminating half of the line-breaks, he reduced the four eight-syllable lines of each stanza to two sixteen-syllable lines, thereby turning end rhymes into internal rhymes. In this form, as finally published, it is 174 lines in length.  Sources  The prime influence on The Sphinx the French Decadent movement, particularly Huysmans' À rebours, the cat sonnets in Baudelaire's Les Fleurs du mal, and the poems of Maurice Rollinat. In particular, the poem's fascination with monsters, statues, and ambiguous sexuality draws on Flaubert's Tentation de Saint-Antoine and on Gautier's Mademoiselle de Maupin and Émaux et camées; Flaubert also provided Wilde with much of his exotic vocabulary. Other important influences include Swinburne's \\"Dolores\\", with its \\"imputation of ageless profligacy\\"; Rossetti's \\"The Burden of Nineveh\\", itself inspired by the British Museum's acquisition of a sculptured god from Nineveh; and Shelley's \\"Ozymandias\\", recalling Wilde's \\"giant granite hand still clenched in impotent despair\\".Line 116 The ending of Wilde's poem, in which the sphinx is seen as an evil presence and dismissed, echoes the ending of Poe's \\"The Raven\\", which may also have suggested some of The Sphinx's complex prosodic features. Wilde's \\"snake-tressed Fury\\" may be taken fron Dante's Inferno.Line 161 He did not make use of Egyptological scholarship, preferring, as a classicist, to take his view of Egypt from writers like Herodotus and Tacitus. Several books of the Bible provided Wilde with details, including Exodus, 2 Kings, Job, and Matthew. The influence on The Sphinx of various art objects has also been traced. One example is Gustave Moreau's painting Oedipus and the Sphinx, in which, as described by Giles Whiteley, \\"the Sphinx is grasping onto the half naked body of Oedipus and gazing coquettishly into his eyes, repeating physically the coupling of Hermaphroditus and Salmacis\\". Wilde's lines suggest Luc-Olivier Merson's painting \\"Repose on the Flight into Egypt\\", with its depiction of the Virgin and Child resting between the Sphinx's paws. It is also clear that Wilde had seen the British Museum's collection of Egyptian antiquities and recalled them to mind while writing his poem.  Criticism  Contemporary reviews of The Sphinx were few and, on the whole, unenthusiastic, criticizing its sensationalism and artificiality. W. E. Henley, writing in The Pall Mall Gazette, vented his dislike of the Decadent movement in a particularly contemptuous notice. The Athenaeum found the poem's \\"lewd imaginings\\" and \\"reckless riot of self-indulgence\\" distasteful, but conceded its ingenuity and technical proficiency. The Pall Mall Budget praised Ricketts' illustrations, and characterized the poem itself as \\"weird, sometimes repulsive, but all the same stately and impressive\\". The disappointing reception of The Sphinx provoked George Bernard Shaw to write to one reviewer, \\"The critic's first duty is to admit, with absolute respect, the right of every man to his own style. Wilde's wit and his fine literary workmanship are points of great value.\\" In the years after Wilde's death the poem's merits were reconsidered. In 1907 Guy Thorne wrote that \\"In the realm of the fantastic, it has no equal...It has all the fantastic unreality of Chinese dragons, and therefore can in no way be harmful...Whilst we are alternately fascinated and repelled by the subject, we are lost in admiration of the decorative treatment of the theme\\". An anonymous writer in The Academy in 1909 considered it \\"perhaps Wilde's most complete and satisfactory poetical work, for here he was hampered neither by the insincerity which sacrifices everything to style on the one hand, nor, on the other hand, by the crude brutality of real and horrible life breaking like a violent unresolved discord into the harmony of his delicate yet stately music.\\" In the same year The Globe declared it \\"among the most remarkable works ever penned by human hand...If such lines have not the haunting, magical touch of the true poet, we know not where to look for it in all English literature.\\" One dissenting opinion came from Arthur Symons, who wrote that The Sphinx \\"offers no subtlety, no heat of an Egyptian desert, no thrill in anything but the words and cadences...[It] can delude the mind through the ears to listen, when the lines are read out, to a flow of loud and bright words which are as meaningless as the monotonous Eastern music of drum and gong is to the Western ear.\\" In 1946 Wilde's biographer Hesketh Pearson took a similar view: \\"No doubt The Sphinx could pass as poetry in an age that had forgotten how to write it and mistook word-patterns for the real thing...This kind of thing has about it the interest of the cross-word puzzle, for those who find cross-word puzzles interesting, and the reader is kept wondering what quaint word the author will come across when next he dips into the dictionary.\\" This criticism of the poem is still made, with Tully Atkinson in 2003 noting that much of The Sphinx is \\"nonsense poetry of the purest verbal music of rhythm and rhyme...just humorous wordplay of phantasmagoria\\", while Isobel Murray has remarked that some phrases \\"defy explanation, because they evolved accidentally in composition\\". The title-character of The Sphinx, like the title-character of Wilde's Salome, has been seen as a femme fatale, the murderess of those she desires, even a necrophiliac, who is finally defeated by the ascetic Christianity of the man she has tried to fascinate. Both can be seen as morbid sexual fantasies, of which the object is even more androgynous and demonic in the case of the Sphinx. The poem's ending, in which the narrator becomes disgusted with the Sphinx and turns to his crucifix, has been seen as problematic. Some critics, such as Ruth Robbins and Wilde's editor Anne Varty, have suspected him of a \\"confusion of religious sentiment with secular sensuality\\" in his invocation of Christ on the Cross. Another common criticism was first made by one of the original reviewers of the poem, who asserted that \\"Mr. Wilde's crucifix is no less an artistic property than his nenuphars and monoliths\\"; likewise Anne Varty thought that the dismissal of the Sphinx comes too late to carry conviction, and the critic Norbert Kohl suggested that Wilde had \\"taken fright at his own daring and...run back at the last moment to the safety of Victorian moral convention\\". The final line, which asserts that Christ \\"weeps for every soul that dies, and weeps for every soul in vain\\", shows that the narrator, even in his rejection of Classical paganism, still has doubts about the doctrine of the Atonement. Tully Atkinson sees in this a portrayal of the compromised religious faith of the proto- Modern man, which \\"while imperfect in him, offers a sublimity greater than himself and the world\\".  Legacy  The composer Henry C. ff. Castleman's False Sphinx, published as one of his Two Songs (1913), is a setting of the last two stanzas of The Sphinx. In 1925 the Soviet composer Alexander Mosolov set a Russian translation of the poem, under the title Sfinks, as a cantata for tenor, choir and orchestra. It was his diploma work as a student at the Moscow Conservatory, and is now lost. Granville Bantock made a song-cycle of the poem in 1941, scored for baritone or contralto and orchestra. The saxophonist and jazz composer Trish Clowes included a setting of The Sphinx, with vocals by Kathleen Willison, on her 2012 album And in the Night-Time She Is There. Jacob Epstein's memorial over the grave of Oscar Wilde in the Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris takes the form of a \\"flying demon-angel\\", to use his own words, based on the description of the god Ammon in Wilde's poem, and includes a sphinx whispering into the main figure's ear.

The plant is native to tropical Central and South America, and has been introduced into the Republic of the Congo. Common names include horse-eye bean and ox-eye bean. Taxonomy The word mucuna is the vernacular name for Mucuna urens in an indigenous language of Brazil, and in 1763 this word was chosen by the French botanist Michel Adanson in his Familles naturelles des plantes to be the generic epithet for this genus of legumes, although M. urens was itself known as Dolichos urens until being transferred to Mucuna many years later. Description Mucuna urens is a large, vigorous, much-branched, twining liana that climbs into the tree canopy. The stems are thick and soft, and bear alternate, trifoliate leaves with petioles up to long. The leaflets are ovate or elliptical, and up to long; the lateral leaflets are somewhat oblique, and all leaflets have rounded bases and apiculate tips. The inflorescences grow laterally or in the axils of the leaves and are pendulous racemes with peduncles up to a metre long, with the flowering part near the tip. The calyx has a long tube and the petals are thick, waxy and yellowish. The standard is slightly longer than the wings and keel. The flowers are followed by transversely-ridged, oblong pods about bearing orange-brown bristly stinging hairs; the pods have a suture underneath and two longitudinal, undulating wings. The one to four seeds are rounded, almost surrounded by hilum and or more in diameter. Distribution and habitat This liana is native to the West Indies, Central and South America, its range extending from Panama to Peru, Ecuador, Bolivia and Brazil. It grows in forests and woodland at altitudes of up to . Uses Pods with seeds Mucuna urens is used in traditional medicine. A tincture made from the powdered bean macerated in alcohol is a soothing remedy used against hemorrhoids, especially those inclined to bleed. The stinging hairs that grow on the pods can be taken internally against intestinal worms, which are expelled alive. These hairs are irritating to the skin and cause intense itching, with reddening and the formation of tiny pustules, soon after contact; the active chemical is the proteolytic enzyme, mucunain. Potable water can be obtained from the fleshy stems. Fibres from the stem are used to make strong rope, and the seeds are used to make beads and ornaments, as well as being used as famine food. An extract of the seeds given to male guinea pigs at low dosages was found to cause the degeneration of sperm, raising the possibility that the plant could be used as a male anti-fertility agent.

In 2006, the vessel was acquired by Reinauer Transportation of Staten Island, New York and renamed Craig Eric Reinauer. Under the ownership of Reinauer, she underwent a major refit including the replacement of her engines and generators, and the addition of a secondary, upper wheelhouse. In 2017, after sister tug Meredith C. Reinauer and barge RTC 150 ran aground in the Hudson River at Catskill, New York, Craig Eric Reinauer and barge RTC 103 were dispatched to transfer 60,000 barrels of gasoline off from RTC 150 to help free the tug and barge.

Early life and education Chaplin was born and raised in Montville, New Jersey by parents Dolcey and James Chaplin and graduated from Ridgewood High School. Following high school, she attended the University of Delaware for her Bachelor of Arts degree in psychology and Penn State University for her PhD in child-clinical psychology. With her doctoral degree, Chaplin earned a post-doctoral associate position at Yale University. Career Upon completing her post doctoral research, Chaplin was promoted to Associate Research Scientist and assistant professor of psychiatry at Yale University School of Medicine. In her role as an Associate Research Scientist, she led a study examining the differences between men and women's reactions to stress-related psychological disorders. Chaplin concluded that women have greater rates of depression than men, who often experience greater rates of alcohol-use disorders. The following year, she received a five year $774,714 grant from the National Institutes of Health to fund research on Gender, Emotional Arousal, and Risk for Adolescent Substance Abuse. She collaborated with Amelia Aldao of Ohio State University to research how the emotional response of children varied based on who was observing them. They concluded that when children were around their parents, they regulated their emotions less than when they were surrounded by peers. Chaplin eventually left Yale University in 2013 to accept an assistant professor of psychology position at George Mason University (GMU). At GMU, she runs the Youth Emotion Lab and continues to focus on the role of \\"gender and emotion regulation in the development of psychopathology and substance abuse in children and adolescence.\\" In 2018, she received a five year, $2.5 million grant to study predicting factors of substance and alcohol abuse in preteens' brain patterns as they move through puberty.

He began acquiring his education during World War II, after which he taught the children of Sh'erit ha-Pletah mathematics. In 1949, Ginzburg immigrated to Israel, and began studying in the Technion Faculty of Electrical Engineering, where he received his B.Sc. summa cum laude. Three years later, he acquired a Master's degree in electrical engineering and in 1959, he received his Ph.D. in mathematics, and was appointed lecturer in the Faculty of Mathematics of the Technion. During 1965-1967, he served as a visiting lecturer in Carnegie Mellon University, in Pittsburg, Pennsylvania. Upon returning to Israel in 1967, he was appointed associate professor of Mathematics in the Technion Institute, and in 1971 to a Professor of Computer Science. Ginzburg founded the Department of Computer Science in the Technion, and served as its first head of department. Later, he served as the vice president of development of the Technion. In 1976, Ginzburg took part in the formation of the Open University of Israel, as it's vice president,https://in.bgu.ac.il/bgi/iyunim/31/Uri-Cohen.pdf Page 116 and from 1977 until 1987 served as it's president Ginzburg received an Honorary degree from the UK Open University in 1988, an Honorary Ph.D. from the Weizmann Institute in 1990, and, in 2002 was awarded a Rotary Prize for the promotion of higher education in Israel.

The thesis title was \\"Multiplicative Systems as Homomorphic Images of Square Sets\\", and was done under the supervision of Prof. Dov Tamari. During the early 60's, Ginzburg was involved in research in basic group theory, graph theory and automata, and frequently collaborated with Michael Yoeli. In 1961, Ginzburg, in collaboration with Paul Erdős and Abraham Ziv, proved the Erdős-Ginzburg-Ziv Theorem. This Theorem is an important result in abelian group theory, and is cited to this day. In 1968, Ginzburg published his book \\"Algebraic Theory of Automata\\". Ginzburg also invested a lot of time in writing several textbooks in mathematics, for high school and first degree Mathematics and Engineering students.

In spreading disinformation, information laundering resembles the laundering of illicit funds in money laundering.  Descriptions  Information laundering, as summarized by the American comedian and commentator Jon Stewart, can occur when relatively reputable news organizations report on something that a blog or platform of unknown credibility has written. These news organizations may attribute the assertion, but another publication may omit its original source. \\"That piece of information [on where the news came from] has now been laundered,\\" Stewart says, and the original assertion, whether or not its source was credible, gains credibility, especially if it is used by outlets known for high standards. According to Adam Klein of Pace University, \\"Conspiracies grow in communities like Reddit or Twitter, which can act as incubators. Then they graduate onto more respected websites and political blogs, until sometimes, they’re picked up by mainstream news outlets as 'trusted information.\\" Digital platforms can be especially vulnerable to information laundering efforts. \\"Bots, fake accounts and click farms pretend to be people they’re not and create a false sense of consensus,\\" Karen Kornbluh and Ellen Goodman wrote in Nextgov. Faked video and images can create media moments. \\"The platforms, which are designed to keep users online to be served ads, end up privileging engagement over truth or the public interest. What drives engagement is often outrage and disgust, so this is what the algorithm rewards.\\"  Examples  American intelligence officials say Russia has used information laundering to spread disinformation in the West about the COVID-19 pandemic and the 2020 elections in the United States. The Russian effort has included a network of fake accounts on social media. Russian propaganda using information laundering is also suspected in stoking fears about 5G technology. The Alliance for Securing Democracy, an American group that opposes Russian efforts to undermine Western elections, cites maskirovka, a Soviet-era military doctrine that translates as \\"mask\\" or \\"masquerade\\", as a precursor to Russian information laundering. Rallies in 2020 by supporters of QAnon, an American far-right conspiracy theory, were said by Brandy Zadrozny of NBC News to be an attempt at information laundering by attracting local news coverage. Information laundering was alleged in the spreading of false news by social media in the 2018 Mexican election. In 2013, WikiLeaks, which publishes secret information from anonymous sources, was said in a commentary by Jonathan Holmes on ABC Australia to be information laundering.

Black people are underrepresented in medicine, and this underrepresentation gives rise to a cycle of health disparities for Black people. Lester was encouraged by her father to specialise in dermatology. Whilst she was at medical school, a Black patient presented with psoriasis, but none of the physicians could diagnose the condition because they had not been trained in how to identify it on dark skin. In fact, in a survey of dermatologists in 2011, half of the participants reported that they could not diagnose conditions on Black skin.  Research and career  Lester has worked to train physicians how to identify dermatological conditions on skin of colour and is a leader in equity in dermatology. She established the first UCSF Skin of Color program and clinic, where she serves as the director. The programme focuses on research, education and clinical care. Her work and research has been nationally and internationally recognized for tackling inequities in dermatology. In 2019, the San Francisco Chronicle described Lester as the only Black dermatologist working in San Francisco. She was also featured on NPR's Science Friday with Ira Flatow where she reviewed some the differing features of skin disease across skin tones. She is a member of the American Academy of Dermatology, where she sits on the committee for Augmented Intelligence, a working group that provides expert advice regarding the use of artificial intelligence in dermatology. During the COVID-19 pandemic it emerged that occasionally coronavirus presented as skin disorders (including so-called covid toes). Whilst it was well known that coronavirus disease disproportionately impacts people of colour, in the countless scientific papers documenting the dermatological manifestations of the disease Lester noticed a distinct underrepresentation of non-white patients.. She was the first person to publish about these disparities, and subsequently profiled in the New York Times.  Select publications   * Lester, J., Jia, J., Zhang, L., Okoye, G. and Linos, E.

Personal life Mary Ellet was born on 24 January 1839 in Lynchburg, Virginia, the daughter of Charles Ellet Jr. and Elvira Augusta Daniel. She married William Daniel Cabell on 9 July 1867 and became step-mother to his two daughters. Together, the couple had six children: three boys and three girls. William opened Norwood School for boys in Nelson County, Virginia from 1865 to 1879. After the school's closure, the Cabells moved to Washington, D.C., where, in 1881, the couple created and directed the Norwood Institute for Girls and Young Ladies. In 1897 the couple left education and returned to Nelson County. DAR membership Mary Cabell was one of 18 organizing members of the Daughters of the American Revolution on 11 October 1890. She presided over the first meeting and would continue to chair additional meetings and the 1st and 2nd Continental Congresses. The newly formed Society elected the First Lady of the United States, Caroline Scott Harrison as their inaugural President General and Harrison accepted on the condition that she would be more of a figurehead. Cabell was given the title Vice President Presiding and was charged with the practical running and administration of the DAR. When Harrison died in office on 25 Oct 1892, Cabell took over all responsibilities of the President General's office but did not take on the title. During the next election, Cabell turned down the nomination of DAR President General in favor of nominees with more prominent social standing. Cabell was responsible for establishing much of the DAR's foundation, goals, and purpose. Her home served as the headquarters of the DAR in its first year, and she proposed the construction of their \\"House Beautiful,\\" Memorial Continental Hall, in Washington, D.C. Her vision was of “the finest building ever owned by women . . .” one that would serve “as an outward and visible sign of an inward and spiritual grace.” During the First Continental Congress, Cabell asked members “What is your object: what do you propose; what good will you do; what is the use of such an organization? What does thou work?” She had a vision of women working together to achieve their goals in harmony and friendship. During the 7th Continental Congress in 1898, Cabell was elected Honorary Vice President General.

The group was founded by Jane Fonda, Barbra Streisand, and other women in the Greater Los Angeles area. HWPC formed in response to Geraldine Ferraro being selected as the running mate of Walter Mondale to run against President Ronald Reagan in the 1984 United States presidential election. The HWPC helped the Democratic Party wrest majority control in the 1986 U.S. Senate elections, and they helped elect Bill Clinton in the 1992 presidential election. Quoting from Kevin Starr's book Coast of Dreams: California on the Edge, 1990-2003. 1992 also saw the HWPC assist in bringing a record number of women into the U.S. Senate, the accomplishment called the Year of the Woman. Founded by 12 women, the membership grew to several hundred. In 1996 they were described as \\"the single most-powerful entertainment group\\" in politics, based on their total donations. The group disbanded in April 1997 after the rise of Clintonism: the centrist compromises made by Bill Clinton, abandoning HWPC and the Left. During its 12 years of operation, HWPC donated a total of $6 million for political causes. Background Singer/actress Barbra Streisand had long been active in politics, taking part in 1961's Women Strike for Peace, and helping the George McGovern 1972 presidential campaign by performing at the Four for McGovern concert. Archival article introduced by Tony Ortega on February 15, 2011. Actress/activist Jane Fonda and her husband, activist/politician Tom Hayden, created the Campaign for Economic Democracy (CED) in 1976 to fund Hayden's 1982 run for the California State Senate, and to champion progressive political causes. After Hayden won, CED promoted solar power, opposed nuclear power, and promoted women's rights; all paid for by Fonda's very popular workout book and videos. Foundation Geraldine Ferraro inspired HWPC to form In 1984, President Ronald Reagan, strongly conservative, was running for reelection. In speeches, he referred to Hollywood as \\"my town\\" and \\"my people\\". A group of liberal women in Hollywood were vexed by Reagan's assumption that Hollywood was conservative, and they discussed ways of promoting the idea that Hollywood was strong in liberal politics. On July 12, 1984, Democratic Party presidential nominee Walter Mondale chose Geraldine Ferraro as his vice presidential running mate; she was the first female vice presidential candidate from a major political party. The Hollywood women were catalyzed into action to support her campaign. They filed papers in August to form the Hollywood Women's Political Committee, raising $750,000 for the Mondale–Ferraro ticket. From 12 original members, the HWPC grew to 70 women in 1987, 140 in 1988, 200 women in 1990 and 300 in 1996. Older members paid $1,500 yearly, while those under 30 paid $500. A majority of the members were younger than 45. Men were not allowed to join but they could attend public meetings. A policy committee of 14 members determined the group agenda. Activist Margery Tabankin ran HWPC; she was later appointed by Streisand as executive director of the Barbra Streisand Foundation, holding both positions. In 1994 when filmmaker Steven Spielberg appointed Tabankin to his Oskar Schindler Foundation, she stayed with the Streisand Foundation but resigned from the HWPC, handing the reins to Lara Bergthold. Campaigns 1992 Year of the Woman. Five U.S. Senate candidates stand behind Senator Barbara Mikulski. From left: Carol Moseley-Braun, Jean Hall Lloyd-Jones, Barbara Boxer, Dianne Feinstein, Patty Murray. After Mondale–Ferraro lost to Reagan–Bush, the HWPC felt that Mondale had not moved far enough to the left, and had failed to engage or excite liberal voters. They decided to declare a strong New Left stance. The HWPC drew up a list of principles in early 1985, determining which political issues were to be the focus. They included abortion rights, nuclear weapons freeze, anti-nuclear power, anti-pollution, and more. Though Fonda was not involved in day-to-day operations, her influence was felt. Bergthold noticed in 1992 when she joined the group that many of the staffers had previous experience working on political campaigns with Fonda and Hayden. And the issues pursued by CED were many of the same confronting HWPC, especially the HWPC policy statement, \\"We are committed to an economic policy based on every citizen's full participation in our country's economic wealth.\\" HWPC decided to fund six Democratic challengers in the 1986 Senate races, in an effort to take majority control of the Senate. Streisand and the HWPC held a fund-raising benefit concert at Streisand's Malibu home in September 1986, raising a surprising $1.5 million for the six close races. Five of the six were elected, and with other wins, the Democratic Party became the majority party in Congress, serving as a counterbalance to Reagan's policies. Typically, the HWPC backed the issues more than individual candidates; they were not pragmatic political players who would easily compromise. They wanted hard proof of a politician's commitment to their principles, and they did not accept promises without action. But in 1986 they began looking at potential Democratic Party presidential candidates to run in 1988, and they narrowed the field to Senator Joe Biden from Delaware, and Senator Gary Hart from Colorado. Hart was briefly the frontrunner but his campaign was sunk by revelations of his womanizing.Ross 2011, pp. 347–348 Biden dropped out after charges of plagiarism in his speeches. The Democratic Convention settled on Michael Dukakis, who lost to George H. W. Bush. In 1992 to help implement the Year of the Woman, HWPC donated almost $200,000 to the campaigns of Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer to assist them in winning the special election and the regular U.S. Senate election in California, respectively. This was the first time both U.S. senators from one state were women. In July 1992 at the Regent Beverly Wilshire Hotel, the HWPC hosted a fundraising dinner for nine women candidates running for U.S. Senate. Lily Tomlin was master of ceremonies, and Streisand delivered the keynote speech, saying, \\"It’s time we had a place at the table where the life and death decisions of the country, the world and the planet are made.\\" HWPC co-founder Marilyn Bergman composed a song for the dinner with Marvin Hamlisch; \\"Common Threads\\" was performed by a chorus of HWPC singers, and women from the First African Methodist Episcopal Church. Tomlin joked, \\"The last time we celebrated the Year of the Woman was 72 years ago when women got the vote. Boy, time sure flies when you’re being oppressed.\\" A total of $375,000 was raised for the nine candidates. In 1994, the HWPC spent $10,000 to oppose two anti-gay bills in other states, Oregon's Ballot Measure 13, and a similar one in Idaho. These efforts were victorious, unlike the funding of Rick Zbur's campaign during the 1996 U.S. House of Representatives elections in California. Zbur, running as an openly gay man, won his Democratic primary but lost to the Republican incumbent. Bergthold said that HWPC's gay-friendly position on LGBT issues was based on the group's established stance regarding civil rights in general. In January 1996, the HWPC \\"went cyber\\" by establishing a webpage, which was unusual for the time. Even so, they still kept their fax machines to pass information to politicians. Breakup Bill Clinton speaks on welfare reform. His 1996 turn away from the New Left was a blow to HWPC. The HWPC suffered a setback in 1994 when years' worth of New Left advances were swept aside in a rightward turn led by Newt Gingrich's Contract with America. The HWPC raised $4 million for the successful 1996 campaign to reelect President Bill Clinton, but a number of HWPC members were unhappy with his policies. Clinton had just signed the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act, a gesture of mollification to Gingrich and others on the right who were urging welfare reform. The new laws hurt low income women disproportionately, a fact which angered many in the HWPC. In various other ways, Clinton was signaling a further shift to the right which would later be described as Clintonism. The HWPC convened discussion groups about this problem, and no consensus emerged for a solution. They voted to disband in April 1997, fulfilling contractual obligations through the end of June when they finally closed their doors. During its heyday, HWPC was seen as \\"the most dominant political force in Hollywood,\\" according to political strategist Andy Spahn. Spahn said the women of the PAC \\"were certainly a counterforce to the right. They held the candidate's feet to the fire. They provided pressure to keep them on the left.\\" Principles * \\"We are committed to the absolute right and prerogative of women to economic equality, personal choice, and full participation in and benefits of citizenship of the United States.

Savage booked eight rooms for 15 days at the Oriental Hotel in Lagos, where producers and musicians could come and go, bouncing ideas off one another as Savage supervised, selected tracks and came up with top lines. \\"Just put your heart into it, and let's have fun,\\" she reportedly told them. With news of the album came a \\"conscious branding\\" that positioned Savage as an activist and socio-political commentator. Pulse Nigeria said the album \\"represents a veritable rebrand from an artist who is entering her veteran days.\\" Concept Celia was dedicated to Savage's mother, whom the album was named after in tribute. Savage elaborated that her mother \\"embodies everything that this album is. It speaks to a strong, modern African woman. This album is Afrobeats from a very female perspective. It's an extension of the African woman: she still values her culture and her upbringing, but she's also well-traveled, so it's blending those two worlds.\\" In an interview with The New York Times, Savage commented on the album's other inspirations: :\\"I've experienced a divorce, being a single mom and seeing backlash for being sometimes too sexy in a male-dominated industry. [...] I wanted my message to be clear. I have a platform now to encourage young African girls—and just young girls in general—how important it is to be true to yourself and be unapologetically strong as a woman. Initially when you hear it, it's just like, 'Oh, I want to be in the club, shaking my butt.' So I'll get you that way first. And then you go back and listen to the lyrics and then you get inspired by it.\\" YNaija wrote: \\"Celia puts Tiwa in a new political world, one that honours [her] predecessors – and its pool of bubblegum tracks but pushes for a closer examination of womanhood. She [said] the album was inspired and named after Celia Savage, her strong, supportive mother who's given a cameo in a promo clip alongside Kelly Rowland and Genevieve Nnaji saying 'I am Celia.'\\" Composition In July 2020, Savage commented, \\"I decided to really just go back to what I loved and what I fell in love with as a musician, which is afrobeat combined with soul and R&B.; [...] So it's very, very heavily influenced by that. And while I was creating the album, I actually didn't listen to any other songs during the process of creating it because I didn’t want to be influenced by the trend of what was happening. You can expect real, hardcore R&B; fused with afrobeats with this album.\\" NativeMag said, \\"[Savage] is defiant of her conservative Nigerian audience and seeks to rework imaginations of what a female artist should look like, leading the industry whilst owning her sex appeal in a way that is rare to these parts. On Celia, Tiwa Savage comes out with an onslaught of carnal numbers, reminding us why she labels herself a bad gyal.\\" The360Mag remarked that Celia \\"further solidifies Tiwa's position as one of the leading artists in the forefront pushing Afrobeats to a global audience,\\" and later added, \\"Celia demonstrates the incredible musical growth she’s experienced over the years.\\" In September 2020, Essence wrote, \\"Celia shows us how Savage stays in the pocket of what makes listening to R&B; so warm, with the complex melodies and messages that align with afrobeat music. The album is a sonic journey—taking us through falling in love, heartbreak, navigating double standards and gender dynamics in relationships, boosting one's confidence, and even showing gratitude for the road taken thus far in her career.\\" That same month, The New York Times wrote, \\"Celia is an album of sleekly insinuating Afrobeats grooves that carry love songs and understated but purposeful messages of empowerment. The lyrics switch between English and Yoruba as Savage glides through her melodies, rarely raising her airy, unflappable voice.\\" =Songs= Celia opens with \\"Save My Life\\", an Afrobeats/house track that feels \\"light and feathery\\". The \\"luminous\\" \\"Temptation\\" (featuring Sam Smith) has lyrics about being unable to resist a love interest, over streaks of saxophones. \\"Ole\\" (featuring Naira Marley) was compared to Rihanna's \\"Bitch Better Have My Money\\". The song boasts a captivating preamble, with a near forty seconds of vibrant horns, feel-good drums and an ensorcelling bass guitar. On \\"Koroba\\", Savage addresses the slut-shaming young women face when surrounded with rich men or politicians by poking fun about \\"living lavish\\" on the national budget. \\"Bombay\\" (featuring Stefflon Don and Dice Ailes) is a \\"good body\\" anthem \\"calibrated\\" to a dancehall beat, with \\"a bubbly, feminine confidence that makes for makes for a good dance record\\". \\"Dangerous Love\\" speaks about a toxic relationship. \\"Park Well\\" (featuring Davido) is \\"feel-good love song\\". The \\"vulnerable\\" \\"Us\\" has a piano accompaniment, and Savage \\"confronts her rocky separation from her ex-husband Tee Billz in 2018\\" with \\"lovely vocal runs\\". \\"It's definitely the first time I'm being vulnerable... When we first started, it was just like, 'Me and you, we're going to conquer the world.' And then it got to a point where the brand was getting big, and when I had to make a decision, it wasn't just me and you,\\" she commented. \\"FWMM (F*CK With My Mind)\\" has an audacious tone. \\"Pakalamisi\\" (featuring a \\"soulful\\" Hamzaa) sounds like \\"a regular Afrobeats cut on commercial radio, filled out with Hamzaa's crispy vocals\\". On \\"Attention\\", Savage details her worth in a relationship. \\"Glory\\" is \\"a testament that Tiwa soars when she does undiluted pop. This trance/EDM pop song is further uplifted by its immaculate songwriting, loaded with a deep message about Tiwa reaping the fruits of her efforts.\\" \\"Celia's Song\\" is about Savage's mother supporting her through her music and with prayers. NativeMag added the song has an \\"choir-like harmonies\\" and a \\"mixing of fellowship into the song’s end\\" which brings a \\"gospel feel\\" to it. =Art= According to Savage, the inspiration behind the album cover is also her mother. She shared that growing up and playing Ludo, she remembered that one has to move to win, and such is applicable in real life because being successful in life requires boldness. The cover art is an aminated version of herself and her mother on a Ludo game board. Promotion In May 2020, Savage appeared on the cover of Billboards first issue devoted entirely to Africa alongside Afrobeats artists Davido and Mr Eazi. Later, Savage became the first African music artist to have two billboards in Times Square, New York on the album's release day. Celia received 120 US programmed playlists across all the DSPs and secured cover placements from Apple Music, YouTube Music, Pandora, Spotify, Amazon Music, Tidal, Deezer, Boomplay, Audiomack and UduX. Boomplay made Tiwa the face of 'Top New Music' – the biggest playlist on its platform. =Singles= On 20 November 2019, Savage released \\"Attention\\", her first single off the project. The single was released under Universal Music Group, and produced by Blaq Jerzee. That same week, she performed the song at ColorxStudios in London on A Colors Show. On 9 July 2020, She released \\"Dangerous Love\\" produced by Cracker Mallo. On 15 July 2020, Savage released the music video for \\"Dangerous Love\\", directed by Ibra. On 6 August 2020, she released \\"Koroba\\", produced by London and received praise for the song from Pulse Nigeria editor Motolani Alake, shortly after the release of the music video directed by Clarence Peters. On 24 August 2020, She released \\"Temptation\\", a song she praises Fireboy DML for co-writing with her, and Sam Smith. The song was produced by London in Lagos, Nigeria. =Live performances= On 24 August 2020, during her U.S. television debut, Savage performed \\"Dangerous Love\\" on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon on NBC. On August 31, 2020, Savage performed live alternative versions of the singles \\"Dangerous Love\\", \\"Attention\\", and \\"Koroba\\". She also performed Reekado Banks's 2017 single \\"Like\\", a song she was featured on alongside Fiokee. Critical reception In a review for Pulse Nigeria Motolani Alake said Celia \\"isn't a poor album, but it's not exceptional. While it has some really good songs, the album is mostly filled with lukewarm to good songs. That said, props must go to Tiwa Savage for seeking songwriting help in a terrain that stigmatizes artists for seeking help. However, the delivery of some of those songs revealed that Tiwa Savage didn't write them.\\" In a review for NaijaLoaded, Jelili Adekunle rated Celia 4/10, and Tope Delano from Mhojo Hub wrote that Celia is \\"an album that makes it easy for listeners to truly sense just how little effort was packed into it and just how lazy Tiwa Savage has gotten over the years. In a bid to try and please everyone, it became glaring just how bland and boring the project is. From an artist who strives to be perceived as young and experienced, ”Celia” granted listeners permission to get lost in the sprawling unwieldy tactlessness employed on it. I mean come on, cooing ”baby” in different variations can only appeal so much to a core fan before they skip to the next track.\\" Writing for Music in Africa, the music editor Gabriel Myers Hansen praised Savage for proving to be an effectual songwriter, summoning the appropriate emotions for every song. NativeMag felt that \\"Celia is a formidable pop album, already being lauded as a 'classic'. Naming the album after [her] mother, who she takes every opportunity to thank and celebrate, Celia reads as a memoir of an African woman. Free in her sexual impulses, driven in her pursuit of The Life, and resilient to the many misogynistic barriers standing in her way, Tiwa Savage's 'Celia', is unapologetic about her womanhood, asserting her female perspective into this hugely male-dominated space in unquestionable sonic style.\\" Commercial performance In its first week, Celia generated song streams across multiple platforms: 3,164,000 on Audiomack; 512,000 on Boomplay; and 230,000 on YouTube.

Completed and commissioned in 1943, she served in World War II and was sunk during her first war patrol in March 1944. Construction and commissioning I-42 was laid down on 18 March 1942 at the Kure Navy Yard at Kure, Japan, with the name Submarine No. 372. Renamed I-42 on 20 August 1942 and provisionally attached to the Yokosuka Naval District that day, she was launched on 10 November 1942. She was completed and commissioned on 3 November 1943. Service history Upon commissioning, I-42 was attached formally to the Yokosuka Naval District. In late November 1943 she took part with the submarines , , and and the submarine tender in antisubmarine warfare exercises in the Iyo-nada in the Seto Inland Sea. By 1 January 1944, she was part of Submarine Division 11 in Submarine Squadron 7 along with I-43, Ro-40, Ro-113, and the submarines , , , , , , and . On 31 January 1944, she was reassigned to Submarine Division 15 in the 6th Fleet. On 12 February 1944, I-42 departed Yokosuka on her first war patrol, assigned a patrol area northeast of Truk. She reached her patrol area on 20 February 1944. She called at Saipan in the Mariana Islands from 3 to 4 March 1944, then proceeded to Truk, where she arrived on 7 March 1944. She got back underway on 15 March 1944 to make a supply run to Palau, which she reached on 19 March 1944. After embarking cargo and passengers, she departed Palau on 23 March 1944 on a supply run to Rabaul on New Britain, with an estimated date of arrival of 30 March 1944. I-42 was zigzagging on the surface at on the first evening of her voyage when the United States Navy submarine , which had been alerted to I-42′s schedule by Ultra intelligence information, detected I-42 on radar at a range of at 21:19 on 23 March 1944. Also on the surface, Tunny closed to within visual range and identified I-42 as a Japanese I-boat. I-42 also sighted Tunny, and for almost 90 minutes each submarine maneuvered on the surface to obtain a firing position against the other while trying to deny one to her opponent. Finally, at 23:24, when the two submarines were southwest of Angaur, Tunny fired four torpedoes at I-42 at a range of , then immediately turned hard to starboard to avoid a collision and crash-dived to prevent I-42 from making a torpedo attack of her own. Just before Tunny′s hatch closed, her crew saw a bright flash and felt and heard two explosions. Diving to , Tunny circled the area, and her sound operator heard I-42′s propeller noises stop. Tunny′s crew heard the noises of I-42 breaking up for the next hour. I-42 sank with the loss of all 102 men aboard at . On 27 April 1944, the Imperial Japanese Navy declared I-42 to be presumed lost with all hands north of the Admiralty Islands. She was stricken from the Navy list on 30 April 1944.

It was at the upper end of a navigable reach of the Congo River from Isangila, further downstream to the west. Above Manyanga goods had to be carried by land round the falls and rapids to Stanley Pool. Location The lower part of the Congo River below Stanley Pool first descends through the Livingstone Falls and rapids, then has a navigable section from Manyanga to Isangila, and then has further rapids and cataracts down to Matadi, from where it is navigable to the Atlantic Ocean. History In February 1881 Henry Morton Stanley heard rumours that English missionaries were planning to build a post in the region, and asked Louis Valcke to establish an International African Association (AIA) post at Isanghila before they did so. While Valcke continued to develop the Isanghila post, Stanley took the steamers En Avant and Royal up the navigable stretch of the river to Manyanga, where Stanley started to build a post, which he entrusted to Victor Harou. He charged Charles-Marie de Braconnier with building a road from Manyanga to the mouth of the Lufu River, bypassing the Ntombo-Mataka falls. In May 1881 Stanley fell ill with a serious fever at Manyanga. He was not able to consider moving on to Stanley Pool until mid-June. The Baptist missionary George Grenfell established a chain of missions at Musuko, Isangila and Manyanga. An American visitor in May 1885 referred to the station as North Manyanga, opposite South Manyanga Station, or N’Gombe, on the south shore. The decision to build a road along the south shore, avoiding territory claimed by the French, followed by construction of the Matadi-Léopoldville Railway made the laborious route via Manyanga to Léopoldville obsolete. Today named Pioka, the former station is a minor village.

Houghton Mifflin Company, 1994. Production The design was built by Luger Industries in Burnsville, Minnesota, United States starting in 1962. The company produced it as a kit boat for amateur construction, which the building time estimated at 10-15 hours. The company went out of business in 1987 and the boat is now out of production. Design The Leeward 16 is a recreational sailboat, built predominantly of fiberglass, with wood trim. It has a fractional sloop rig with anodized aluminum spars. The hull features a spooned raked stem, a conventional transom, a rounded, transom-hung rudder controlled by a tiller and a retractable centerboard. It displaces and has an angular cuddy cabin for stowage. The boat has a draft of with the centerboard extended and with it retracted. With the non-folding rudder removed it has a draft of , allowing beaching. Ground transportation on a trailer is facilitated by a hinged tabernacle that permits easy lowering of the mast by easing the forestay. A motor mount was a factory option, allowing fitting a small outboard motor of for docking and maneuvering. Other factory options included sails, trim molding and running lights for night operation. Foam for hull buoyancy was recommended to make the boat unsinkable. For sailing the design is equipped with mainsail roller reefing around the boom. The jib sheets, mainsheet and the centerboard raising and lowering lines are all controlled from the cockpit. The supplied assembly kit included stainless steel and anodized aluminum fittings. The design has a Portsmouth Yardstick racing average handicap of 112.3 and is normally raced with a crew of two sailors.

Description and history The Moseley School is located north of downtown Westfield, in a small residential area east of North Elm Street (United States Route 202 and north of Union Street. It is set on just over one acre of land bounded on three sides by Dartmouth, Westminster, and Woodmont Streets. It is a two-story masonry structure built of brick, stone, and concrete, and set on a raised basement. Its main facade is 19 bays wide, representing two phases of construction. Windows are set group in fours in bays decorated with corner quoining. Entrances are set at a recess from the facade at the center and the outermost bays. The interior retains its original floor plan, and features are relatively little altered since its construction. The oldest portion of the school, its northern half, was built in 1915 to meet burgeoning demand for educational services from the city's growing immigrant population. Growth continued, and the school's size was doubled in 1922. The original section was designed by George Haynes of Pittsfield, and the addition by Malcolm B. Harding. It served as an elementary school throughout, closing for two years in 1991 due to low enrollment, and permanently in 2009.

However, the heading titled 'experience' conflates her with Hsu Tien-tsai. Political career Chang Tsai was a member of the Kuomintang and was active in the party's women's association. Chang Tsai served on the Hsinchu County Council and the Hsinchu City Council before her 1994 election to the Taiwan Provincial Assembly. She then represented the Hsinchu City Constituency for two terms in the Legislative Yuan on behalf of the Kuomintang, winning consecutive legislative elections in 1998 and 2001. In 2003, during her second term on the Legislative Yuan, Chang Tsai discussed electronic waste originating from compact discs. Later that year, the Association Monitoring the Nomination of Grand Justices placed her on a list of worst-performing legislators. After losing a July 2004 party primary to Ko Chun-hsiung, Chang Tsai left the Kuomintang, joined the Alliance of Independent Lawmakers, and lost the subsequent general election to Ko. Controversy Chang Tsai and seven others were indicted on charges of bribery in 2008. The charges stemmed from her 2003 endorsement of the Oral Healthcare Act. The Taiwan High Court's first ruling in October 2010 declared that the eight were not guilty. The verdict was overruled in another decision by the same court, issued in September 2011. An appeal heard by the Supreme Court resulted in a 2016 decision in which Chang Tsai was one of six defendants found not guilty.

She was an associate professor of psychiatry and neurology and Chief of the Clinical Neuropsychopharmacology Laboratory at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. Deaf from the age of fourteen, Sharpless encouraged deaf people to consider careers in scientific research. She also served as the president of the Foundation for Science and the Handicapped. Early life and education Nansie Sue Sharpless was born October 11, 1932 in West Chester, Pennsylvania. Her father was a biochemist and as a child she gravitated towards studying science and mathematics. At age fourteen, she lost her hearing due to meningitis. She attended her local public high school as well as a Quaker boarding school, relying on notes from classmates and teachers to succeed. Sharpless attended Oberlin College, graduating with a degree in zoology in 1954. Wayne State University admitted her for master's level studies in medical technology and she graduated in 1956. When she considered entering a doctoral program, friends and family discouraged her, saying she would have difficulty finding work as an \\"overeducated\\" deaf woman. The director of admissions at Wayne State told her she would held to higher standards in the program, as colleagues would question her ability to carry out professional duties. She was awarded a 1967–1968 fellowship from the women's advocacy organization Zonta International. Sharpless graduated with her Ph.D. in biochemistry in 1970 with a perfect 4.0 grade point average. Her dissertation advisor encouraged her to study l-DOPA metabolism, and her dissertation was titled \\"Catecholamine metabolism of the central nervous system as reflected in cerebrospinal fluid\\". Career After graduating with her master's degree in medical technology in 1956, Sharpless worked for eleven years as a research medical technologist, publishing papers on immunochemistry and protein chemistry and working her way up to supervise several technicians. After earning her Ph.D., she spent four years of post-doctoral training at the Mayo Clinic. In 1975 she joined the faculty at Albert Einstein College of Medicine and was tasked with organizing a monoamine assay laboratory for the departments of psychiatry and neurology. Sharpless was later promoted to the position of chief of the clinical neuropsychopharmacological laboratory. She was in that role and a member of the faculty until her death in 1987. Research and service Sharpless was involved in research studying the role of neurotransmitter amines in brain function, as well as investigating changes in neurotransmitter amine metabolism in fluctuations of mood and behavior as well as various neurological and mental disorders. Her most notable work showcased the patterns of dystonia in Parkinson's disease patients in response to l-DOPA therapy. Sharpless authored over fifty research articles and eleven book chapters on the measurement of neurotransmitters, metabolism and mental disorders, and using animal models of neurological disorders. She was professionally active, serving on committees and panels in multiple organizations, including the National Science Foundation, the American Chemical Society, and the National Science Advisory Board. About being a female deaf scientist, Sharpless said, \\"Deaf people are often treated like children, incapable of responsibility for their own affairs. Women are supposed to be passive, not too competent or independent. I don't fit... . It has taken time for people to get used to me. As a professional woman who is deaf, I represent a study in contrasts.\\" She served as president of the Foundation for Science and the Handicapped. She was also a board member for the Alexander Graham Bell Association for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing. Sharpless encouraged deaf people to consider scientific research as a career in a paper presented at the American Association for the Advancement of Science meeting in 1975.

Westminster ruling, which required schools in California to end segregation. Both the Cypress Street School, a segregated school for Mexican American children, and the Killefer School opened in the same neighborhood in 1931. In the first half of the Twentieth Century, the majority of public schools in California practiced segregation. Mexican American children commonly were provided lesser school buildings, less experienced teachers and outdated materials.

Completed and commissioned in 1943, she served in World War II and was sunk during her first deployment in February 1944. Construction and commissioning I-42 was laid down on 27 April 1942 at the Sasebo Navy Yard at Sasebo, Japan, with the name Submarine No. 373. Renamed I-43 on 25 September 1942 and provisionally attached to the Yokosuka Naval District that day, she was launched on 25 October 1942. Formally attached to the Yokosuka Naval District a year later on 25 October 1943, she was completed and commissioned on 5 November 1943. Service history Upon commissioning, I-43 was assigned to Submarine Squadron 11. After she completed her work-ups, her deck gun was removed from her afterdeck and replaced by fittings that allowed her to carry a waterproofed Daihatsu-class landing craft abaft her conning tower. On 15 November 1943, she was reassigned to Submarine Division 11 in the 6th Fleet along with the submarines , , , , , , , , , , and . She moved from Sasebo to Yokosuka during December 1943 and from Yokosuka to Kure in January 1944. On 9 February 1944, I-43 got underway from Kure to perform a special mission in which she was to transport Special Naval Landing Forces (SNLF) personnel from Saipan in the Mariana Islands to Truk as part of a build-up of forces for a planned Japanese counterlanding on the Green Islands. While at sea, she was reassigned to Submarine Division 15 in the 6th Fleet on 11 February 1944. She arrived at Saipan on 13 February 1944 and embarked 59 SNLF personnel there. On 14 February 1944, she received orders from the 6th Fleet to proceed to Truk, and she put to sea that day with an estimated date of arrival at Truk of 16 February 1944. On 15 February 1944, I-43 was east-southeast of Guam when the United States Navy submarine — operating submerged in the area in support of the upcoming Operation Hailstone, a major U.S. Navy raid on Truk — detected her propeller noises at 11:06. At 11:21, Aspro′s commanding officer sighted I-43 heading south-southeast on the surface, zigzagging and making on a heading of 155 degrees true. He identified her as an \\"I-9-class\\" submarine, and noted the number \\"443\\" — probably the Japanese character for \\"I\\" followed by \\"43\\" — and a hinomaru flag painted on her conning tower, as well as a large structure abaft her conning tower — apparently her waterproof Daihatsu — which he thought might be a midget submarine. Out of position for a submerged attack, Aspro allowed I-43 to pass, surfaced at 12:07, and began a lengthy, radar-assisted maneuver known to American submariners as an \\"end-around\\" to get herself into a favorable firing position ahead of I-43. Finally ahead of I-43 that evening, Aspro fired four Mark XIV-3A torpedoes at her at a range of at 22:23. At 22:24, two of them hit I-43, which exploded and sank by the stern at . Aspro′s crew heard several more explosions after I-43 sank, the last of them at 22:27. On 8 April 1944, the Imperial Japanese Navy declared I-43 to be presumed lost in the vicinity of Truk with the loss of all 166 men on board. She was stricken from the Navy list on 30 April 1944.

Connective tissue, including dermis, tendons and ligaments, is one of four main animal tissues. Usual connective tissue does not change its stiffness except in the slow process of aging. Catch connective tissue, however, shows rapid, large and reversible stiffness changes in response to stimulation under nervous control. This connective tissue is specific to echinoderms in which it works in posture maintenance and mechanical defense with low energy expenditure, and in body fission and autotomy. The stiffness changes of this tissue are due to the changes in the stiffness of extracellular materials. The small amount of muscle cells that are sometimes found scattered in this tissue has little influence on the stiffness-change mechanisms.  Tissue distribution  Catch connective tissue is found in all the extant classes of echinoderms. *Sea lilies and feather stars: ligaments connecting ossicles of arms, stalks and cirri. *Starfish: body-wall dermis; walls of tube feet. *Brittle stars: intervertebral ligaments; autotomy tendons of arm muscles. *Sea urchins: ligaments or catch apparatus, connecting spines to tests of sea urchins; tooth ligaments; compass depressor \\"muscles\\", which are in fact mostly made of connective tissues. *Sea cucumbers: body-wall dermis. Early echinoderms were sessile organisms that fed on suspended particles carried by water currents. Their body was covered with imbricate small skeletal plates. The arrangement of plates suggests that plates worked as sliding joints so as animals to be able to change their body shape: they could possibly take an extended feeding posture and a flat \\"hiding\\" posture. The body plates might be connected with catch connective tissue that allowed early echinoderms such postural changes.  Mechanism of stiffness changes  Detailed mechanical properties and their changes have been studied only in sea-cucumber dermis. Its mechanical properties are determined by the extracellular materials that are made of collagen fibrils embedded in a hydrogel of proteoglycans. The dermis takes 3 mechanical states soft (S1), standard (S2) and stiff (S3).Animals without stimulation takes the standard state S2. Different molecular mechanisms of stiffening have been found in the transition S1→S2 and in the transition S2→S3. Three proteins that cause stiffness changes have been isolated from sea cucumbers. Tensilin causes the change S1→S2 increasing cohesive forces between collagens, whereas softenin causes the change in the reverse direction; NSF induces S2→S3. There are cross bridges between collagen fibrils. The number of bridges increases in the order S1  Nervous control  The mechanical states of catch connective tissue are under nervous control and thus we can regard this tissue as one of neutrally controlled mechano-effectors such as muscles. It is found in the sea-urchin spine joints that the stiffness of catch connective tissue changes in the coordinated manner with the muscle contractions. One of the characteristic cells found in catch connective tissue is juxtaligamental cells containing secretory granules. These cells are supposed to contain proteins controlling stiffness of extracellular materials. When stained with the antibody specific to echinoderm nerves sea-cucumber body wall is supplied with immunoreactive fine fibers running among the collagen fibrils. Pharmacological experiments suggested the presence of two types of cholinergic systems, one is the nicotinic one involved in the dermal stiffening and the other is the muscarinic one involved in softening. Cholinergic nerves seem to control the secretory activities of juxtaligamental cells. The presence of the cholinergic system was supported by the neuropeptide stichopin that inhibits the action of stiffening cholinergic systems. Stichopin is one of four new peptides in the dermis of sea cucumbers. Other ones are the neuropeptide NGIWYamide that stiffens the dermis and two holokinins that soften the dermis. The nerves containing these neuropeptides possibly control the secretory activities of juxtaligamental cells.

Hannah Allen (), born Hannah Howse and later Hannah Chapman, was an English bookseller and printer whose trade focussed on religious treatises and colonial affairs in America. Our knowledge of Allen's activities comes mainly from documents dated between 1646 and 1651. Hannah married Benjamin Allen on 2 April 1632. He died in 1646, and Hannah took over Benjamin's bookselling business after his death; she would later marry her apprentice Livewell Chapman. In total, there are 54 literary works bearing Hannah's imprint, but Bell estimates that the true number of her publications was somewhat higher. Bross describes Allen as a \\"radical sectarian\\"; Bell notes that the works on her booklist also tended towards millenarianism and the views of the Fifth Monarchists. She sold a number of works by religious writers, including editions of the works of Thomas Brightman, Menasseh ben Israel, and several works by Henry Jessey. In 1647, Allen published a book by Jessey titled The Exceeding Riches of Grace Advanced by the Spirit of Grace, in an Empty Nothing Creature, Viz. Mris [sic] Sarah Wight, which became a bestseller at the time. Exceeding Riches concerned the prophetic vision of Sarah Wight, reported to have undergone such powerful religious experiences that she became paralysed. In the text, Allen is credited as a witness of Wight in her ecstatic state. Her trade also included works on the American colonies, including several treatises on the law of Massachusetts and Connecticut.

Horne studies at the University of Mississippi and earned his doctorate in physics at the Boston University with Abner Shimony. He taught at the Stonehill College, a catholic school in Easton in the south of Boston. Together with John Clauser, Abner Shimony and Richard A. Holt he developed the CHSH inequality for experimentally testing Bell's theorem (the test has been conducted in 1972 by John Clauser and Stuart Freedman). In 1975 he started to investigate neutron interferometry in collaboration with Clifford Shull at the MIT (at these days, neutron interference experiments have been developed by Sam Werner at the University of Missouri and by Helmut Rauch and Anton Zeilinger at the University of Vienna). This led to an encounter with Daniel Greenberger, who had already theoretically proposed neutron interferometry for gravitation in the 1960s and was also interested in Shull's experiment, and later with Zeilinger (in Grenoble 1978). With Daniel Greenberger and Anton Zeilinger in 1989 he introduced quantum entangled states of three subsystems (Greenberger–Horne–Zeilinger states).

According to Williams, tension is created or enhanced when one of the three corners of the triangle is deprived knowledge (or \\"kept in the dark\\") in the scene. left  Option A: Audience in the Dark  To create tension, a writer may deprive the audience of information that the two characters in the scene posses. Keeping the audience in the dark is the most common use of the Triangle of Knowledge. It is often used at the beginning of the film. At the beginning of Leaving Las Vegas, screenwriter/director Mike Figgis keeps the audience in the dark revealing just enough details to make the Protagonist (Ben - Character A) stand out. Ben dons an expensive but worn suit in an elite bar, which leaves the audience curious. then, Ben has an awkward conversation with a second character about borrowing money (Character B). The awkward interaction between Character A and Character B reveals a fractured relationship, which creates curiosity and (therefore) tension in the audience.Figgis, Mike. Leaving Las Vegas. Film. United States: United Artists Pictures, 1995.  Option B: Protagonist in the Dark  Often, the audience and a specific character are aware of all the information in a scene, but the protagonist is left in the dark.Williams, Eric.

When the protagonist is kept in the dark, the audience is immediately invested. This explains why people talk to the screen to warn the Protagonist of impending danger even though the character cannot hear them. In Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, director William Goldman kept the protagonists in the dark in the final scene. Butch and Sundance engage on trivial banter, unaware that an army is gearing up to attack them. However, the audience knows because Goldman shows the army preparing.Goldman, William. Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. Film. United States: Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp., 1969.  Option C: Secondary Character in the Dark  When the audience feels as smart as the protagonist, there is tension and enjoyment in laughing at the ignorance of secondary characters. When a secondary character is kept in the dark, the audience enjoys watching how characters act upon incomplete information. Tension is created when the audience watches secondary characters make decisions that they know the character will regret because the audience does not have the same emotional connection to secondary characters as they have to the protagonist. Screenwriter Paul Attanasio used this approach in his screenplay for Donnie Brasco.

Following years of brutal suppression, civil war, and excessive taxation, the rural population of central China was restive, and susceptible to militant salvationist movements. One spiritual group, the so-called Spirit Soldiers, promised the peasants that they could gain protection from modern weaponry through protective magic. Tens of thousands consequently rallied to join the Spirit Soldiers, and successfully revolted in the mountainous and isolated areas of Hubei and Sichuan. At its height, the Spirit Soldier movement numbered over 100,000 fighters, and controlled about forty counties. The Spirit Soldiers had early military victories, but, relative to their opponents, lacked organization, a cohesive ideology and modern weaponry. As result, they could not prevail in the face of concentrated counter-offensives by the Chinese warlord armies. The Spirit Soldiers’ main armies were defeated and dispersed in 1926. Despite this, the movement remained active and continued to spread into neighboring provinces. Several Spirit Soldier factions consequently allied themselves with the Communist Party of China, providing crucial support to the latter's nascent insurgency in central China.  Background  = Warlordism and peasant rebellions in China = Having suffered from internal instability for decades, China fully disintegrated upon the death of Yuan Shikai in 1916. In the following Warlord Era, military strongmen used private armies to carve out their own territories while fighting each other in order to archieve supremacy. In the process, the warlords caused great suffering for China's civilian population. They brutally suppressed opposition, raised high taxes, and in many cases allowed their armies to plunder, rape, and enslave civilians. This, combined with the constant wars between the warlords, led to destitution, hunger, and the rise of banditry in many areas. Some regions suffered more than others from the warlords' rule. Less developed, and more remote parts of China, such as the country's south, centre and west were most adversely affected. They were often rather poor and isolated to begin with, and crises were less likely to be alievated by outside help. Furthermore, warlord armies of these regions were less well equipped, fed and disciplined than their equivalents in the more wealthy north and coastal regions of China. The warlord soldiers of southern China consequently treated civilians especially badly, reguarily exploiting and abusing them. As result, peasants in rural China generally perceived outsiders like soldiers, tax collectors, and other state agents as \\"foreign\\" or \\"parasite\\" in nature, and were deeply hostile toward them. In an attempt to evict these groups from their lands, or at least in order to resist the collection of rents and taxes, peasants launched a great number of uprisings, riots, and protests during the Warlord Era. Varying greatly in their intensity and importance, such disturbances often erupted spontaneously and were frequent during years of poor harvests. In several cases, the peasants joined or organized militant secret societies that acted as self defense and vigilante groups. In most cases, however, the peasants were unable to form cohesive movements and their resistance was easily crushed by the warlords. = Situation in western Hubei and eastern Sichuan = A Chinese peasant on the fields in the 1910s or 1920s. After the National Protection War of 1915–1916, Hubei and Sichuan had fallen into chaos, as various warlords carved out their own fiefdoms. Sichuan became home to a very large number of warlords, some of them little more than villages leaders or bandit chiefs while others led armies several thousand strong. These military strongmen constantly fought each other. As a result, hundreds of thousands of soldiers, militiamen and bandits roamed the two provinces during the Warlord Era, causing widespread instabiliy. Further tensions existed due to the fact that the local warlords often acknowledged the nominal authority of the central government and the more powerful warlords in northern China, but distrusted them and wanted to maintain their autonomy. Besides the chaotic infighting among the armies of Sichuan and Hubei, the two provinces were affected by additional divisions between the different ethnic and social groups. While the valleys and plains of Sichuan and Hubei were dominated by Han Chinese, the highlands harbored a mixed population of Han migrants and non-Han groups like the Miao, Tujia, and others. The latter felt traditionally oppressed by the plainspeople and had long resisted Han immigration as well as influence from the Chinese central governments. The highlanders were thus more versed in organizing self-defense forces and more prone to revolting than the Han population. In this context, belief systems were also of great importance. Although the Han Chinese migrants and highland people rarely inter-married, they culturally influenced each other. This gave rise of a highly heterodox cultural and religious environment in which ancestor worship, and belief in magic as well as possession played a major role. In the context of the long struggle for autonomy by the highlanders, gods, heroes, and ancestors were often associated with past resistance and rebellions. These elements helped to popularize the so-called \\"spirit soldiers\\" – the belief that one could summon divine beings that would fight alongside or possess a fighter, granting the marginalized and weak the ability to oppose stronger opponents. The belief in spirit soldiers was often integrated into messianic and apocalyptic movements in Chinese history, giving rise to the idea that saviors in human guise would arrive in times of immense crisis, leading an army of spirit soldiers, and establish a new and fair rule on earth. Amid this volatile situation, a power vacuum came to be in western Hubei in 1920. The 30,000-strong army of warlords Li Tiancai, Lan Tianwei, Bao Wenwei, and Wang Tianzong which had previously controlled the Enshi-Hefeng area had been driven away by Hubei governor Wang Zhanyuan. This allowed the local communities to organize themselves to resist the warlord soldiers and bandits.  Rebellion  = Intitial uprisings = Boxers (pictured) due to their reliance on close quarters combat and belief in magic to overcome better armed opponents. Having suffered from deprivations and high taxes at the hands of the warlords, the rural populace of Hubei and Sichuan became increasingly restive. The discontent escalated in 1920 when a group of Taoist priests started a militant and spiritual movement opposed to militarism and taxation in Lichuan, Hubei. It was initially a small association of about 100 people. The movement's slogan \\"Kill the Warlords and Out with Rotten Officials and Loafers\\" found wide appeal, while the priests taught that anyone could become a heaven-blessed \\"Spirit Soldier\\" by undergoing magical rituals. These rituals such as drinking a special fluid or eating the ashes of burned amulets, were supposed to make the \\"Spirit Soldiers\\" invulnerable to gunfire and raise their bravery. Convinced that they could finally overcome the government authorities' superior weaponry, thousands joined the movement and launched an open rebellion. Despite being mostly armed with just close quarters weaponry such as spears and dao broadswords, the peasant rebels overran Lichuan County and killed the local magistrate, whereupon the movement spread into the surrounding regions. At this point, the Spirit Soldiers numbered over 10,000 fighters, and their forces would continue to grow over the next few years. Though the movement would eventually develop a relatively sophisticated organization, it was never really unified. The rebel forces split into three main armies as well as numerous militias early on, and had formed six main branches by 1928. These different groups did not much coordinate their activities. While the Spirit Soldiers generally lacked military training, modern weaponry, and uniforms, they attempted to organize their forces into actual armies. They introduced military ranks, and the rebel fighters identified themselves by wearing a yellow band around their left hand's middle finger since yellow served as \\"official color\\" of their movement. In addition, each major Spirit Soldier group dressed in a specific color. For example, the Spirit Soldiers in western Hubei mostly wore red turbans and sashs. They also carried flags into battle, many of them red, which were inscribed with their leaders' names or slogans that urged for \\"heavenly\\" or \\"universal peace\\" and the establishment of a \\"heavenly kingdom\\" on earth. Jesuit missionary on an Asahi motorcycle in China in 1939. The Spirit Soldiers were hostile toward Western-influenced modernization and Christianity. Besides such vague slogans and the aim of overthrowing the existing authorities, the rebels had few concrete aims. Most of the Spirit Soldiers did not want to seize political power, and had no revolutionary ideology. Despite having an affinity with the poor, they would not try to change the political or social order when occupying counties. Instead the old magistrate would simply be replaced with a new one \\"who appeared to be a 'good' man\\". One observer noted that such minor changes often failed to permanently improve the situation of the peasants. Despite this, the Spirit Soldiers' rule was widely perceived as \\"benevolent\\" in comparison with the warlords' regime. The peasant rebels prevented the collection of rents and taxes by the government, and drove away both marauding warlord soldiers as well as bandits. The areas the insurgents had conquered were considered to be safe for unarmed travellers. To finance themselves, the Spirit Soldiers fought bandits and warlords for control of the salt and opium trade routes which ran from Sichuan and Guizhou through western Hubei. The Spirit Soldiers were also noted for persecuting Christians and foreigners. This was due to the rebels' belief that Western-style modernization as well as Christianity had brought chaos to China by subjecting it to foreign ideas. They consequently wanted to purge their territories from Western influences. = Battle of Wanzhou = Soon after its launch, the Spirit Soldiers movement spread westward into Sichuan, where it directly affected the regional trade center of Wanzhou. In late 1920, a number of Spirit Soldiers from Lichuan came to Wanzhou. Led by the peasants Hsiang Ting-hsi and Yang Tse-kun, they spread the message of their movement in the town's suburbs using slogans such as \\"Stand Against Rents and Taxes\\", and \\"Kill the Grey Dogs\\" (warlord soldiers). In a few months, they managed to gather 4,000 supporters from the town and the nearby villages. The insurgents then set up their headquarters at the local temple for Yama, armed themselves with simple weapons including bamboo spears and launched a grand assault against Wanzhou town on 5 March 1921. Attacking in two waves of about 2,000 fighters, the Spirit Soldiers terrified the local warlord soldiers, as they fought ferociously with bared upper body, unafraid of bullets. Despite being armed with guns, the soldiers believed their opponents to be actually protected by magic and fled from Wanzhou's outskirts behind the walls of the inner town. Though they had managed to capture most of the town, the Spirit Soldiers did not capitalize on their success, instead \\"composing chants and parading\\" through the streets. The remaining warlord forces managed to hold out, and shot a number of Spirit Soldiers from behind the inner town's walls. They consequently realized that they could actually kill the rebels, and launched a counter-attack on 8 March. Heavy fighting lasted almost the entire day, but the warlord forces prevailed and had mostly ousted the Spirit Soldiers from Wanzhou by nightfall. About 500 people died in course of this battle, the majority of them rebels. On 12 March, warlord Chou Fu-yu arrived in the area with reinforcements and attacked the Spirit Soldiers at their temple headquarters, killing about 1,000 of them, including most of their leaders. Following this defeat, the insurgents around Wanzhou scattered. Most of the survivors in Wanzhou County returned to civilian life, but a significant number continued the insurgency. Several retreated into the mountains of Hubei, where they joined the main Spirit Soldier armies, while others stayed in Sichuan. The latter were mostly small militias that behaved like bandits, so that officials lamented that \\"whole country districts [were] laid waste\\" as the rebels plundered them. Instead of attempting to seize and hold territory, they would capture towns, expel foreigners and missionaries, and then move on. For several years after the Wanzhou incursion, permanent Spirit Soldier bases in Sichuan were restricted to areas which were close to the border with Hubei. = Height and decline of the movement = Despite the setback in Sichuan, the Spirit Soldiers continued to flourish and expand in Hubei, driving warlord forces from large parts of the province. Many counties fell to the insurgents, including Xuan'en, Badong, Yichang, and Enshi. One insurgent leader, a former farm worker named Yuan, even felt confident enough to declare himself the \\"Jade Emperor\\" at his base in western Hubei. Active around 1920–1922, he began to issue numerous edicts, in which he railed against \\"students, farmers, labourers, employers, merchants, and military, and, lastly, the missionaries\\". He openly called for the violent extermination of all Christian priests, blaming them for the country's problems and promising his followers that with Christianity gone peace would return to China. Other Spirit Soldiers wanted to restore the Ming dynasty which they saw a highpoint in China's history. Under the Ming, the Chinese had ruled their own country and not been subject to the Manchu Qing dynasty or western foreigners. The Spirit Soldiers were aided in their expansion by the continuing infighting among the warlords of Hubei and Sichuan. The conflicts in western Hubei remained very chaotic, with not just the Spirit Soldiers but also warlord forces from other provinces and bandits invading the region. Zhili clique armies loyal to northern warlord Wu Peifu moved from Hunan and Sichuan into Hubei in 1921. The northern forces were repelled, but the Sichuan troops occupied Badong, Xingshan, and Zigui for a short time. More importantly, Yang Sen took control of Lichuan and Jianshi in October 1921, holding them until February 1923. Yang was strongly involved in the wars of Sichuan, as the forces of Governor Xiong Kewu battled several rivals in an attempt to unify the province. This became important to the peasant rebels because Xiong was gradually defeated in 1923, and his armies moved towards western Hubei. Yang and other strongemen exploited the situation by moving their forces in the opposite direction, trying to crush Xiong's dwindling armies and taking Sichuan for themselves. Although Kong Geng took control of some counties previously occupied by Yang, the removal of many Sichuan troops allowed Lao Yangren's bandit army to invade Yunxian, while the Xingshan County garrison mutinied. With his fortunes declining, Xiong actually allied with the Spirit Soldier factions based at Enshi and Hefeng, and his remaining army moved through the Wu valley in an attempt to link up with them around July 1924. This valley was the most important Spirit Soldier stronghold in Sichuan. However, northern warlord forces under Wang Duqing and Yu Xuezhong as well as Henan troops led by Hu Xiannian were sent to block the way of Xiong's army. Wu valley, the center of Spirit Soldier activity in Sichuan The chaotic wars continued in Hubei and Sichuan, as Yang Sen's ascendency to Sichuan's governorship proved short-lived. He provoked several of his previous allies, and was ousted from power in early 1925. He retreated back to Hubei, eventually finding himself in Badong. These clashes once again spilled over into western Hubei, where Guizhou expatriate warlord Yuan Zuming – one of Yang's opponents – moved to Lichuan and Shinan in an attempt to conquer Hefeng. Meanwhile, the Spirit Soldiers spread in eastern Sichuan offering the locals protection from the marauding warlords and bandits. In fact, the peasant rebels managed to win a major victory over warlord troops at Wangying in that year; according to one account, \\"the river ran red with enemy blood\\". Early 1926 marked the Spirit Soldier movement's height, as the rebels counted about 100,000 fighters, and controlled forty counties in Hubei. Despite this, however, the Spirit Soldiers were too disorganized and poorly armed to defend their territories against the three well-trained, well-equipped divisions which the warlords eventually sent against them in 1926. The rebels suffered several crushing defeats in rapid succession, and their leaders were either killed in combat or died of other causes, including suicide or sickness. In consequence, the rebel movement rapidly declined from late 1926 to early 1927, and large numbers of Spirit Soldiers deserted. By this point, however, the situation in the region began to experience a significant change due to the launch of the Northern Expedition in July 1926. This was a major campaign by the Kuomintang (KMT; also known as \\"Chinese Nationalist Party\\") to reunite China and defeat the warlord cliques.  Aftermath  The Northern Expedition lasted until December 1928, reunified China, and ousted numerous warlords from power. However, several warlords such as Xiong Kewu and Yang Sen allied themselves with the KMT to maintain or regain power. The operation also caused further chaos and great disruption in Hubei and Sichuan which was exploited by various groups such as Lao Yangren whose bandit army had grown to about 20,000 fighters by late 1926. In addition, autonomous village militias, other secret societies such as the Gelaohui and Baijihui, as well as river pirates (huba) were active in the province. However, one major change to the warfare in the region was the introduction of new ideological elements. Many KMT troops which moved through central China were part of the party's left wing or outright Communists. When the KMT's right wing launched a purge against the leftists in the Shanghai massacre of April 1927, a civil war broke out within the KMT. The Chinese Communist Party left the United Front with the KMT, and rebelled. Hubei became one of the major centers of the early Communist insurgency. By this point, the Spirit Soldier movement still had a significant presence in the region, and Spirit Soldier bands soon allied themselves with the Red Armies of He Long and Xu Xiangqian. Although the Communists regarded secret societies with suspicion as conservative and predatory elements, they presented convenient allies whose aims were at least somewhat compatible with the Left-wing uprising. He Long in particular forged close links with the Spirit Soldiers. He came to view them as \\"social bandits\\" who wanted to protect their people. In fact, many Spirit Soldiers actually became part of the Red Armies. As unrest remained high throughout the country, the Spirit Soldier movement also continued to spread on its own, expanding to northern and central Sichuan, western Henan, and eastern Guizhou. Spirit Soldier groups persisted in these regions during the 1930s. One of the last known Spirit Soldier rebellions took place in February 1959, when the 1,200-strong \\"Regiment of Spirit Soldiers\\" launched an anti-Communist uprising at Sizhuang, Henan.

He was also a founding governor of both Seneca College and North York General Hospital. Prior to becoming mayor, he was a member of North York's town council since the mid-1950s. During his successful campaign for mayor in the December 1969 municipal election, he campaigned for a domed stadium to be built in Metropolitan Toronto. Hall was born in Toronto in 1912, and studied architecture at the University of Toronto before joining his father's construction business in 1934. In 1946, he switched careers to become a chinchilla rancher. In 1952, he switched careers again entering the photography business and forming a photographic supply and microfilming company. This business was so successful that he was able to turn it over to his sons in 1954 in order to enter politics. Hall lost his first attempt to win election to North York Town Council in the 1954 municipal election, but won a seat the following year. As an alderman and then a member of the Board of Control, he was the chairman of council's development committee for much of his term on council, prior to becoming mayor, and helped guide the municipality from being an \\"open fields\\" township to a semi-urban area and is credited with leading the development of Flemingdon Park, and along with then- mayor James Service, the introduction of high rise development in Willowdale around Yonge Street, which would eventually become North York's downtown. In 1966, while a town councillor, he joined the founding board of governors of Seneca College, as the newly created community college was seeking to construct its first campus. He played a critical role in acquiring land on which Seneca would build its campus as well as property for the construction of North York General Hospital. He was elected mayor in the December 1969 election defeating Liberal candidate Ronald Barbaro. Though a supporter of the Conservative Party, Hall ran as an independent and saw his election as a repudiation of party politics at the municipal level. Hall promised to only serve a single term as mayor and that he would bring in \\"business-like procedures\\" to North York's government. Despite his support for the provincial Progressive Conservatives, Hall, who had championed the construction of the Spadina Expressway throughout his mayoralty, clashed with Ontario Premier Bill Davis after the provincial government bowed to pressure from downtown Toronto residents and cancelled the completion of the expressway in 1971. Hall successfully fought to have Metropolitan Toronto Council approve the paving of the Spadina Expressway right of way between Lawrence Avenue and Eglinton Avenue thus extending what became Allen Road further south. After one term as mayor, Hall did not run for re-election in 1972 and instead endorsed Mel Lastman who went on to serve as mayor of North York, and then the amalgamated city of Toronto, into the twenty-first century. Hall was appointed to the board of the Urban Transportation Development Corporation, a provincial crown corporation, in the 1970s. He died of cancer at the age of 78 at Toronto's Grace Hospital.

Despite a strong start and the addition of mid laner CooN midway through the summer split, Damwon Gaming finished fifth in the regular season. The roster was subsequently revamped, with Nuguri, Alive, and newcomer ShowMaker replacing Parang, BeryL, and TRY respectively. The new roster did not see much success at the 2017 LoL KeSPA Cup, and so jungler Punch and bot laner Veritas were brought in for the 2018 spring split. = 2018 = During the spring regular season, BeryL briefly subbed for Damwon as a bot laner before swapping to support. Damwon finished second in the regular season but lost to Ever8 Winners in the first round of playoffs. Crush, Alive, and Veritas left the team shortly afterwards, and bot laner Nuclear joined the team to fill in the bot laner position. Damwon dominated the summer regular season, finishing first and losing only a single series to Team BattleComics.

Early life and education  Grace Vale was born in the then British colony of Victoria, in the Melbourne suburb of Richmond, on 14 May 1860.NSW Public Service Lists, 1920, page 178Victorian Register of Births No 7102/1860 She was the first of six daughters of bookseller and later prominent Victorian politician, William Mountford Kinsey Vale (1833–1895) and his wife Rachel Lennox. http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/vale-william-mountford-kinsey-4770 Her sister, May Vale, was an Australian painter. Grace Vale received part of her education in England, where her parents had married the year before her birth, but was mostly educated in Victoria. She passed her matriculation examination in 1882, and had been studying biology at Melbourne University in 1887 when she became one of seven members of a group who, despite some strong opposition, were admitted as its first female medical school students. Before her graduation in 1894, some of her clinical experience was gained at the Alfred and Women's and Children's Hospitals. Career and other activities  After graduating, Vale went into private practise, taking over the Collins Street consulting rooms in Collins Street formerly used by Margaret Whyte, a fellow Melbourne University graduate who had suspended practising after getting married. Outside her daily medical practice, Vale took a leading role in a range of groups. In March 1895, she was a foundation member of the Victorian Medical Women's Society.http://www.womenaustralia.info/biogs/AWE0524b.htm The following month, she was elected one of the vice-presidents of the Victorian Woman's Suffrage League. The election came at the annual meeting of the League, held in the rooms of the Women's Christian Temperance Union, another organisation in which Vale would play a prominent part. Early in 1896, it was through the WCTU, that she would become involved in a scheme to provide free medical advice and \\"at cost\\" medicines to female factory workers in Melbourne. She would also be vice-president of a Working Girls' Recreation and Improvement Club in the inner suburb of Collingwood, which her father had once represented in the Victorian Legislative Assembly, and where he had died from Bright's disease a few months earlier.http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/vale-william-mountford- kinsey-4770 However, despite her early activities in Melbourne, Vale was destined to become the only pioneer female medical graduate not to spend the majority of her career in an Australian capital city. In April 1896, Vale left Melbourne to set up a new private practice in the Victorian gold mining city of Ballarat, which her father had also represented in the Legislative Assembly. At the time of her move, the Assembly seat of Ballarat West previously held by her father was held by her uncle, Richard Taylor Vale.http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/vale-william-mountford-kinsey-4770 He shared her commitment to women’s suffrage, and for example when he chaired a \\"well-attended\\" public meeting in Ballarat to advocate the cause, she would be on the platform with him. After establishing her new practice in Ballarat, Vale took on many other activities, mainly related to women's or children's health or welfare. By September 1898, she was President of Ballarat's Women’s Health and Home Protection Society, which provided cookery and other classes for women, and through the WCTU she would promote healthy diets for women. The following year, Vale became one of the first two female members of the influential Ballarat City Board of Advice, set up to monitor conditions in government schools. Advocates of female suffrage were reportedly \\"jubilant\\" at the appointments. Vale would remain on the Board of Advice for about a decade, serving periods as its president and vice-president. As a Board member, issues she would promote would include cooking classes for girls, and swimming classes for all children, including girls, at a time when they had been mainly for boys. From 1906 to 1909, Vale was one of two vice-presidents of the Victorian School Boards Association. At its annual conference in Bendigo in 1908, she moved a successful motion calling for the regular fumigation of all Victorian state schools \\"and not by the burning of a cake of sulphur in the building, as is now generally done\\". She successfully raised the issue again at the Association's conference the following year in Ballarat, but was defeated in a move to have first aid lessons substituted for the preliminary artistic skill of \\"brush work\\" in government schools. First aid had long been one of Vale's passions, often giving lectures through the St John Ambulance Association in Ballarat. Vale was president of the Ballarat Board of Advice in 1908, when Victoria became the last Australian state to give women the right to vote. She then lobbied the newly-elected Victorian government to spend more on Ballarat's state schools and an accommodation facility for kindergarten teachers. Vale made no secret of her affinity with the Liberal Party. Early in 1910, she was elected president of the Ballarat women's branch of the Commonwealth Liberal League, a national group set up to support Liberal Party candidates. In May 1910, soon after he had lost a federal election, former Liberal Prime Minister and now Opposition Leader Alfred Deakin accepted an invitation to address a meeting of the Ballarat women's branch, chaired by Vale. Thirty years earlier, before Vale's father briefly served as Victoria's Attorney-General, he and Deakin had shared a room in Melbourne as young barristers.http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/vale-william-mountford-kinsey-4770 In October 1910, Vale became the first woman to be appointed a Public Vaccinator in Victoria. Her appointment covered the whole south-western district of the state.Victoria Government Gazette No 130, 5 October 1910, page 4582 Under state legislation, those holding such positions provided free compulsory vaccinations to children of parents who could not afford obtain them from their normal family doctor. Another area of Vale’s involvement in Ballarat was in the training of nurses. Just before the outbreak of World War I, for example, she was giving a lecture in \\"home nursing\\". Once war broke out, she was reported to have women in training for formation of a possible Australian nurses' brigade. Nevertheless, in April 1915 she accepted an appointment as one of the first female Medical Officers employed by the NSW Department of Public Instruction.

Amandus was raised in a Christian home and educated in the Christian Bible. Recognizing his qualities, Bishop Delphinus had him ordained a priest. He was the priest who prepared Paulinus for baptism by Delphinus in 389. He wrote a consolatio to Paulinus, then living in Italy, on the death of the latter's brother. Paulinus' response survives. In another letter, Paulinus reproves Amandus for having exaggerated Paulinus' literary skills to the point where Delphinus was requesting Paulinus write him a letter. The earliest collection of Paulinus' letters contains six to Amandus. Amandus may also have corresponded with Jerome. Amandus succeeded Delphinus as bishop of Bordeaux around 404. When his health began to fail, he urged the people to elect a replacement. He was succeeded by Severinus, who had already served as bishop of Trier. When Severinus died not long after in 420, Amandus resumed the bishopric. These events are known through the letters of Paulinus. Amandus is revered as a saint and his feast day is 18 June in the Catholic Church. He is listed in the revised Roman Martyrology (2004), but not the revised General Roman Calendar (1969).

Produced by Alsthom for use under multiple electrification networks and un-electrified lines, they have been in widespread use from 1976 into the 21st century. Classes produced in the main series were BB 7200/7600 and CC 6500 under 1.5 kV DC, BB15000 under 25 kV 50 Hz AC, BB 22200 (7200+15000) and CC 21000 under dual 1.5 kV DC and 25 kV 50 Hz AC, and the diesel CC 72000/72100. The locomotive series was developed from the 1964 quadruple-voltage CC 40100, designed by Paul Arzens, which was mainly used for Trans Europ Express international service. The CC 40100 featured a forward-leaning nose and windshield that drew comparisons with a broken-nose facial profile (\\"Nez Cassé\\"). A greater emphasis on crash protection for engine drivers in the following series added depth to the nose and emphasized the broken-nosed profile.

The ONCF E 900 is similar to the CC 6500 and the ONCF E 1300/1350 is similar to the BB 7200, both under 3 kV DC .

He currently works for Westside Xtreme Wrestling (wXw), where he is the director of sports.  Professional wrestling career  = Early career (2003–2006) = = Westside Xtreme Wrestling (2006–present) = Uhlmann began wrestling for Westside Xtreme Wrestling under the ring name Absolute Andy in 2006, having also made an appearance under a different ring name the previous year. He was brought in for True Colors, a co-production between wXw and German Stampede Wrestling (GSW), with the latter promotion being the one he debuted in. In 2007, Andy was predominantly used in the tag division; he twice won the wXw World Tag Team Championship alongside partners Josh Abercrombie and Steve Douglas, with both victories over Murat Bosporus and Wesley Croton. He and Douglas were defeated by Chris Hero and Marc Roudin at the 7th Anniversary show, and won the title back the following June, enjoying a short second reign, before dropping it to Doug Williams and Martin Stone. At True Colors, Andy won his first title opportunity for the wXw World Heavyweight Championship, but was defeated by John Klinger, who he had been feuding with for much of the year. In May 2009, he won the World Heavyweight Championship for the first time, defeating Bryan Danielson at Dead End Beta, and remained the champion until December, when Douglas defeated him at the 9th Anniversary show. In the years after this, Andy went on to suffer a six-year drought, and despite teaming again with Douglas and more prominently, with Klinger, he was unable to regain the World Tag Team Championship. In April 2016, he began teaming with Marius Al-Ani under the name A4, and at Broken Rules, they defeated the pairing of David Starr and Lio Rush to win the vacant tag team championship. This reign lasted until May 2017, where they were defeated by The Young Lions (Lucky Kid and Tarkan Aslan), and A4 would continue to feud with members of Rise for the next couple of months. A4 would break up on night three of World Tag Team League, when Andy turned on Al-Ani after their loss to The Spirit Squad (Kenny and Mikey). At 16 Carat Gold, Andy defeated Starr in the tournament final, having largely cheated his way to get there in victories over Al-Ani, Matt Riddle and Timothy Thatcher. Andy then feuded with Ilja Dragunov for the Unified World Wrestling Championship, and defeated him for the title at Shortcut to the Top. However, he would later suffer a shoulder injury, causing a proposed three-way match between, him, Dragunov and Bobby Gunns at World Tag Team League to be cancelled. Despite Andy's injury, the title was not vacated, and Dragunov was named interim champion, after defeating Gunns on night two of World Tag Team League. The following month at Broken Rules, Andy defeated Gunns in an #1 contender match for the interim title, and during the Shotgun tour, he defeated Dragunov to become the champion outright. His feuds with Dragunov and Gunns both ended in early 2019; he defeated Dragunov in a Käfigschlacht match at Back to the Roots, and Gunns defeated him for the title on night two of 16 Carat Gold, ending his reign at 217 days. Afterwards, Andy started allying himself with Jay FK (Jay Skillet and Francis Kaspin), who he had occasionally teamed with in the past. He regularly began teaming with Jay FK from May onwards, and after Kaspin was ruled out of World Tag Team League with a spinal injury, Andy replaced him, forming Jay-AA. At the event, Jay-AA went out in the first round to Pretty Bastards (Maggot and Prince Ahura). Over time, his character gained some comedic elements to it, and he became obsessed with winning the wXw Shotgun Championship. A backstage quarrel led to director of sports Karsten Beck booking a four-way match for the title at the 19th Anniversary show, which was won by Skillet. At Back to the Roots, Andy unsuccessfully challenged him for the title, in what would be Skillet's only singles title defence in the promotion. While Andy did not qualify for 16 Carat Gold, he found another way to get there through the tag division, as Jay-AA defeated Jordan Devlin and Scotty Davis at Dead End to win a title shot, and in the process, cementing their face turn. On night one of 16 Carat Gold, Jay-AA defeated Pretty Bastards on night one to become the tag team champions. On night two, they held a parejas increibles gauntlet match, which was won by The Young Guns (Ethan Allen and Luke Jacobs). On night three, Jay- AA defeated The Young Guns, in what became their only defence of the title as a tag team. Jay-AA's reign as tag team champions was affected by Germany's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic and Skillet's departure from the promotion, following allegations of harassment. Andy's role in the promotion also changed during this period, becoming director of sports, since Beck's pre-existing heart issues could have made him vulnerable to the virus. On June 19, Jay-AA dropped the title back to Pretty Bastards (later aired on the July 3 episode of Shotgun, in a heavily edited match which only saw Andy rolled up for the pin).

The station was owned by Jerry Bassett, Inc., and broadcast for seven months in 1966. History Jerry Bassett, Inc., filed in 1965 to move channel 16, an educational reserved assignment at Cotati, to Concord for immediate commercial use; Bassett had previously managed a Contra Costa County radio station, KKIS. The Federal Communications Commission declined but instead suggested moving channel 42, another reserved assignment, from Stockton to nearby Pittsburg, where it could still be used in Concord under a rule permitting the use of an allocation in a nearby community within . Bassett then received a construction permit for channel 42 on May 25, 1965. The station was initially planned for a November 1 debut, broadcasting from a transmitter and interim studios on Willow Pass Road between Pittsburg and Concord and utilizing offices on A Street in Concord; however, the station struggled to obtain local and tower permits in a timely manner. KCFT-TV signed on the air on February 5, 1966. At that year's National Association of Broadcasters convention, Bassett stated that the total investment made in starting the station was $470,000; despite eliminating what he called \\"frills and extras\\", the station's programming still included daily hours of news and sports. However, much of the rest of it was older fare; San Francisco Examiner television columnist Dwight Newton described KCFT-TV's lineup as \\"mostly a collection of network and syndicated films revisited\\". Severe undercapitalization did the station in quickly. As time passed. the number of hours of programming per day dropped from 16 to 3, while just two personnel remained. The September 12 edition of Broadcasting magazine carried an ad declaring KCFT-TV for sale, boasting of its color film capabilities and six cameras. The station met its end on September 19, when representatives of equipment manufacturer General Electric arrived at the station with a moving van, a deputy sheriff, a locksmith, and a court order to repossess some $128,000 in equipment that was not fully paid for. A bankruptcy court allowed the station to try and raise additional funds, but in November, the bankruptcy court appointed a trustee and ordered its sale with a January 1967 deadline for bids. The permit was sold in 1969 to a consortium known as T.V. Hill, a joint venture of Television Communications Inc. and Watson Communications Systems Inc., for $13,500. The new permittees filed to have the channel assignment moved to Concord proper, citing its larger population and definition of Concord as partly in the San Francisco media market, whereas Pittsburg was entirely in the Sacramento market. Meanwhile, Bassett filed a $3.4 million lawsuit against General Electric and a Walnut Creek bank, alleging that he had stopped paying the manufacturer after the equipment delivered was found to be defective. On May 7, 1971, the KCFT-TV permit and call letters were deleted at the request of the permittee, but the FCC still decided to approve the allocation shift.

He served as deputy governor of the state of Burgenland from 2015 to 2020, and leader of the FPÖ in Burgenland from 2005 to 2020. Personal life Tschürtz first attended elementary and secondary school and completed an apprenticeship as a locksmith at the police school in Vienna. From 1981, Tschürtz worked there as an executive officer. During his time in the military, Tschürtz was also stationed in the Golan Heights as part of a United Nations mission. Political career Tschürtz has been an active member of the FPÖ since the 1990s; he founded a local party branch in his home town of Loipersbach in 1992. The same year, he was elected district party chairman for the Mattersburg District. He became regional manager of FPÖ Burgeland in July 1996, and became a member of the state Landtag in November 1997. He was not elected in the 2000 state election, but nonetheless returned after Wolfgang Rauter did not take his seat. Tschürtz was elected deputy chairman of the FPÖ Burgenland in May 2002, and took on the role of executive chairman after Stefan Salzl withdrew from the party leadership. On 16 January 2005, he was elected FPÖ regional chairman with 91.9% of votes at a state party conference in Eisenstadt, and went into the 2005 state election as the lead candidate. The FPÖ suffered a substantial defeat, losing half its voteshare and winning only two seats. Tschürtz became chairman of the parliamentary group. In August 2006, Tschürtz was re-elected party chairman with 84% of votes. After a series of internal disputes, former leader Wolfgang Rauter left the party and joined expelled member Manfred Kölly to form the List Burgenland, which drew support from the FPÖ. In the 2015 state election, Tschürtz once again ran as lead candidate. The party won 15.0% and six seats, its best ever result in Burgenland. After negotiations, the FPÖ entered into a coalition with the FPÖ, and Tschürtz was elected Deputy Governor on 9 July 2015. He resigned from the Landtag to join cabinet, and was succeeded by Gerhard Kovasits as group chairman. The coalition was terminated by the SPÖ after the Ibiza affair, and the FPÖ suffered losses in the subsequent 2020 election. The SPÖ won an absolute majority, and the FPÖ was excluded from government. Tschürtz resigned as party leader shortly afterwards, and was succeeded by Alexander Petschnig, but remained a member of the Landtag.

The feature increases accessibility to and from the expressway in less-populated areas while cutting construction and maintenance costs. Smart interchanges can be built by adding connector roads between local roads and pre-existing service areas, parking areas, or bus stops located along expressways or by building simpler interchanges than were previously implemented in Japan. Design The objective of a smart interchange is to increase accessibility to areas that were not served by full-scale interchanges in order to spread out the economic, logistical, and disaster recovery benefits that a high-speed road provides beyond more densely populated areas. This often is achieved by adding connector roads between local roads and service areas, parking areas, or bus stops that are located along expressways. The connector roads are then equipped with gates that allow the free-flow of traffic that utilizes ETC payment. In the past, Japan's tolled expressways involved complex interchanges, such as the continuous green-T hybrid interchange to streamline the number of points where cash tolls were collected. The rise of ETC and the introduction of smart interchanges has allowed new smart interchanges be built in the more simple, diamond interchange layout, resulting in lower construction and maintenance costs. The average cost of installing a new interchange along an expressway is 35 billion yen while a new smart interchange costs about 20 billion yen to build. History In October 2004, an experiment was conducted on the Tōhoku Expressway's Fukushima-Matsukawa Smart Interchange, which was installed onto the pre-existing Fukushima- Matsukawa Parking Area in the city of Fukushima. After the experimental smart interchange was deemed successful, the Fukushima-Matsukawa Smart Interchange as well as sixteen others around the country were officially opened to traffic across the country in October 2006. As of March 2020, 136 smart interchanges are operational across Japan's expressways.

The mosque is built of wood with clay mortar. The adobe walls were raised later during an extension project in the 1960s. Ali Tërziqi of Požaranje is responsible for the roof, Mulla Mehmet of Smirë for the railings of the müezzin mahfili, and carpenter Nazim Buzhala for the ceiling moldings. Different dates have been suggested for construction, including the 14th century and 1447, but serious scholarship doubts origins prior to the mid-18th century. The discrepancy may come from local memory of an older mosque on whose foundations the current one was built, complicating preservation efforts. Description The mosque has 9 square windows are at different heights: the two lower ones on the northern façade were closed by the congregation due to vandalism by individuals throwing bottles of brandy or beer, requiring a guard of two to three during services especially on holidays. The rectangular mosque is by , its stone foundations contrasting with the adobe walls. The four-layer roof conforms to the local fashion, lacking a minaret. While the prayer hall has a mihrab, minbar, and mahfili, it lacks a dikka or lectern. The mihrab faces the qibla (direction of Mecca) and features floral decoration on both sides, otherwise only distinguishing itself from the remainder of the wall through engraving since both are white, though the mihrab may have once have been colored something else. The minbar is separated from the wall as in most mosques of its day and features wooden decorations with a few glass beads inside. Both the minbar and mahfili are made of oak wood. The minbar features geometric motifs that once included a hexagram facing toward the middle of the prayer hall. Meanwhile, the mahfili was built from 1969 to 1970 and is studded with wooden boards and handrails shaped like fish scales or crescent moons. Two stone inscriptions found in the old portico’s foundations are now featured in the mosque's courtyard. National registry expert Qazim Nasami believes them to be old since they accompanied a standalone altar. Though heavily damaged, the inscriptions include seamless calligraphy that would be lost if they are threatened by construction in the courtyard corner where they now stand. Renovations were required by roof leaks.

Her works are held in the collections of the Christchurch Art Gallery. Reverend Doris Tutill was born in 1916, in Christchurch. Tutill enrolled in the Canterbury College School of Art straight out of primary school, and studied there from 1929 to 1934. Tutill studied under many leading figures of the Canterbury Arts and Crafts movement. Tutill's teachers included Dorothy Brewster, Ivy Fife, Hilda McIntyre, Florence Atkins, Julia Scarvell, Francis Shurrock, Louise Henderson, and James Johnstone. Tutill studied alongside Bill Sutton, Isobel Boone, and Hannah Taylor. After finishing art school, Tutill worked for Whitcombe & Tombs, Christchurch, as a designer. Towards the end of the 1930's she joined a Christchurch studio making parchment. Working from home, she also produced cards, bookmarks and book covers for sale in department stores. In around 1954 Tutill was appointed head of art at St Margaret's College, and remained in that position for about 25 years. Tutill branched out into stained glass window design, and in 1984 designed a window for St George's Hospital Chapel, Merivale, Christchuch, which was executed by Paul Hutchins. One of Tutill's watercolour works, Maori whare and tiki design, was featured in an exhibition at the National Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne, in 2008 titled Art Deco: 1910-1939. This work features Māori motifs of wharenui and tiki, against a bright starburst background. Tutill produced works during her teenage years which explored Māori iconography. In an interview with Ken Hall in 2007, Tutill admitted that at the time she had known very little about Māori art, and was bemused at the attention these works of hers received. Maori whare and tiki design was donated by Tutill to the Christchurch Art Gallery in 2008. Tutill was ordained into the Anglican church in 1986. She died on 31 January 2010.

Later in life, known as U. E. K. Cull, she collected art and ancient Chinese artifacts with her banker husband in London.  Early life  Ursula Edith Kate Mackarness was born on Staten Island. Her English-born father Charles Mackarness was a grandson of dramatist James Planché and son of novelist Matilda Anne Mackarness; he was a magazine editor, sculptor, and dog breeder. Her mother was an actress, and toured with young Ursula as a chaperone. John Mackarness and George Mackarness, both bishops, were her father's uncles; politician Frederick Coleridge Mackarness and sportsman Charles Coleridge Mackarness were his cousins.  Career  St. George appeared in The Blue Bird (1911), and was best known in the title role in Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm, which she performed across the United States and Canada in a Klaw and Erlanger production, 1911 and 1912. She was sixteen years old for much of the run of the show. \\"Miss St. George holds her audience in the delicious spell of her girlishness and ingenuous beauty,\\" raved a Texas critic. She and her husband were art collectors, and had a particularly valuable collection of ancient Chinese artifacts. In 1927, Australian artist James Peter Quinn painted her portrait. In 1972, she donated a pair of ancient Chinese bronze vessels to the British Museum, with enough money to build a case for them. Other Cull collection items were auctioned by Sotheby's in the 1960s, and she sold seven paintings by James Peter Quinn in 1975. Further objects from their collection were bequeathed to the British Museum in 1979.  Personal life  Ursula Mackarness married London banker Anders Eric Knos Cull in 1913, in London. They had six children and lived at Warfield House in Bracknell, Berkshire. Their daughter Ursula Kennard Cull married Sir George Bellew. The Culls' grandson Eric Brodnax was a member of the equestrian team representing the U.S. Virgin Islands at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul. Ursula Mackarness Cull was widowed in 1968, and still alive in 1972.

During the last ice age these were all one island. The lack of a land bridge to Asia during the ice age kept most Asian megafauna (elephants, tigers, etc.) from reaching the Philippines, and the Visayan Islands host many unique and endemic species, sometimes limited to single islands.  Location and description  Panay, Negros and the islands around them in the Visayas occupy the central position in the Phillipines. Most of the islands are rugged, with the highest point being at Mt. Kanlaon.  Climate  The climate of the ecoregion is Tropical rainforest climate (Köppen climate classification (Af)). This climate is characterized as hot, humid, and having at least 60 mm of precipitation every month. The islands receive precipitation averaging 2,417 mm/year, with July and August being the wettest months.  Flora and fauna  Vegetation in the ecoregion depends on distance from the coast, and elevation. Beach vegetation merges into beach forest away from the coast, featuring trees of genus Casuarina (a tall evergreen with feather-like leaves) and Barringtonia. There are also mangroves along the coast that give way to tropical lowland rain forest farther inland. These lowland forests are dominated by trees of genus (Dipterocarpus), but the dipterocarps are joined by Pterocarpus indicus, Pandans Pandanus, and others. Upper hill dipterocarp forests are found from 650 meters to 1,000 meters, where the dominant trees are Shorea polysperma, oaks, chestnuts, and elaeocarps. Montane forests begin at about 1,000 meters featuring oaks and laurels. There are 58 species of mammals in the ecoregion, 13 of which are endemic. Large mammals of conservation interest include the Philippine spotted deer (Cervus alfredi), and the critically endangered Visayan warty pig (Sus cebifrons). One island in particular, the isolated, mountainous Sibuyan Island contains six endemic mammal species. It also has 700 species of vascular plants, 54 of which are endemic, and 131 bird species, a high level of diversity for a small island.

Carved on the stand are ruyi, a traditional auspicious ornament, and Formosan lilies, which symbolise resilient vitality, good governance, social peace, and national prosperity.  History  = Peiyang Government = In December 1914, the Peiyang Government passed the National Seals Act based on the 1914 Constitution, adopting three national seals. The first, known as the Seal of the Republic of China, was used in the national ceremonies and exchanges of letters of credence, etc. The second, the Seal of Investiture (), was used in the investiture of nobilities and appointment of offices. The third, the Seal of Honour, was used in the conferring of medals and other documents of honour. = Adoption by the Nationalist Government = The Seal of the Republic of China is affixed to the instrument of ratification of 1952 Sino-Japanese Peace Treaty. The Seal of Honour is affixed to the certificate of medal. On 2 November 1928, the fifth meeting of the Nationalist Government resolved that a seal of the Republic of China should be engraved. In May 1929, Chief Commander of the Eighth Army Chen Chi-tang ordered the procurement of two jades from Burma and offered them to the Nationalist Government. One of the jades was carved by the Printing and Casting Bureau under the National Government's Department of Civic Affairs and adopted as the Seal of the Republic of China on 10 October 1929; the other was carved into the seal of the Kuomintang. Chin Shu-jen, chairman of Sinkiang Provincial Government, ordered Chen Chi- shan, magistrate of Hotan, to search for jade materials from the locals. In July 1930, Sinkiang delegates in Nanking offered the suet white jade to the Nationalist Government. Designed and carved by the Printing and Casting Bureau, the Seal of Honour was received by Chiang Kai-shek, chairman of the Nationalist Government, in person on 1 January 1931 and was adopted on 1 July in the same year. On 20 May 1948, with the promulgation of the Constitution of the Republic of China, the inaugural president Chiang Kai-shek took office in Nanking. Head of the First Bureau of the Office of the President was concurrently appointed to the post of , who was, under the command of the secretary general to president, responsible for safekeeping the two national seals and security during imprinting. On 7 December 1949, when the Republic of China Government decided to relocate its seat to Taipei, Pang Hsiang, who had been appointed the head of First Bureau, stayed in Hong Kong and refused to take office. Chiang, who had resigned from presidency, assigned Wang Wei-shih and Chu Ta-chang to be in charge of the relocation and to secretly carry with them the Seal of the Republic of China and the to Taiwan in advance. For fear that the seals might fall into the communist hands, Wang and Chu boarded a military aircraft to Hainan Island on the same day, and kept the seals under their pillows during their 2-day stay at a hotel, as bandits ran rampant. On 11 December, they were escorted by an ROC Air Force aircraft, upon arrival at the Chiayi Airport, took an overnight train to Taipei and carried the seals to the Grand Hotel, which was a temporary office of the government, and then to the Taipei Guest House. Separately, was entrusted by Cheng Yan-fen, secretary- general of the Kuomintang, with the transferral of the Seal of Honour and the seal of the Kuomintang to Taipei. When Chiang resumed presidency on 1 March 1950, Wang and Chu passed the seals onto the deputy head of the First Bureau Tsao Sheng-fen. Thus the use of the national seals resumed in Taiwan. In January 1975, the First Bureau circulated to government agencies the Illustrations and Descriptions of the Seal of the Republic of China and the Seal of Honour, with the depiction of the seals in colour and Chinese and English descriptions of their materials, measurements and use. Prior to the amendment to the Office of the President Organisation Act on 24 January 1996, the national seals had been kept in an iron made safe in an air raid shelter fortress of the Taiwan Garrison Command; the staff had to visit the fortress whenever they needed to stamp on documents. Following the amendment, the post of Keeper of the Seals was abolished and the responsibility of safekeeping the national seals was transferred to the Imprinting Officer under the Second Bureau of the Presidential Office, and the seals were moved to be kept in a safe inside the Presidential Office Building. The Imprinting Officer is also responsible for keeping the presidential seal, as well as those of the vice president, the premier and the ministers. Prior to 2000, article 5 of the Credential Act () stipulated the president of the republic shall receive the national seals and the presidential seal from a representative of the National Assembly. This symbolises the transition of the authority and administration of the state. In 2000, an amendment to the act added that the president of the Legislative Yuan should be responsible when the National Assembly was not in session. Following the abolishment of the National Assembly, president of the Legislative Yuan grants the seals to the president at the presidential inauguration. Wooden stands and trays for the seals were first used at the 2020 presidential inauguration. It was designed and crafted by Professor Huang Chun-chieh of the Department of Wood Science and Design, National Pingtung University of Science and Technology.  Use  The Seal of the Republic of China is the official seal of state. It is used for marking credentials, instruments of ratification, instruments of acceptance, full powers, exequaturs, consular commissions, etc. The Seal of Honour is the official seal with which the president, as the head of state, confers honours and decorations. It is used for stamping medal certificates, citations, commendatory plaques, and other such items. Special care is to be taken when using the national seal, which is done in the form of rubbing rather than stamping. To mark documents, they are placed face-up, then the faces are covered with cinnabar oil ink. The document is then placed face-down on the face of the seal, and then pressure is applied evenly on the back of the sheet.

He was later a first- class umpire. Cricket career Born in Yorkshire, Dickinson played in the first recorded cricket match in Christchurch in December 1851, when he was 23. The match took place in Hagley Park, between a Working Men’s Eleven (Dickinson’s team) and a Christchurch Cricket Club Eleven, as part of the celebrations marking a year since the foundation of Christchurch. Dickinson was one of the most successful batsmen and bowlers in the match. He appeared in a similar celebratory match 20 years later, this time for Old Chums against New Chums, and once again succeeded with both bat and ball. An accurate slow round-arm bowler, able to break the ball either way off the pitch, Dickinson played in the first seven first-class matches in New Zealand, representing Canterbury in their annual match against Otago beginning with the inaugural match in January 1864. His best figures against Otago included 3 for 7 in 1864 and 3 for 17 in 1867, but his most successful match was in 1869, when he scored 30 in the first innings, took 4 for 43, then made 8 not out in the second innings to help Canterbury avert defeat.T. W. Reese, New Zealand Cricket: 1841–1914, Simpson & Williams, Christchurch, 1927, p. 160. He umpired four first-class matches in New Zealand between 1873 and 1885. Dickinson was one of the first settlers in St Albans, which is now a northern suburb of Christchurch, where he had a farm to the south of the St Albans Creek. He called his farm St Albans in memory of his cousin Harriet Mellon, an actress, who had become the Duchess of St Albans in England. When residents were looking for a name for the district, he suggested St Albans, and it was adopted. He served on the St Albans borough council for 14 years. Personal life Dickinson’s first wife, Marianne, died in April 1884. His second wife, Janet, died in March 1895. He died suddenly at his home in Westminster Street, St Albans, on 14 June 1913, aged 85. He was survived by his third wife, Jessie.

Deemed mentally unfit to stand trial, he was sent off to a psychiatric facility in the village of Troitskoye, where he remains to this day. Biography A native Muscovite, Sedov grew up in a dysfunctional family, both of his parents being alcoholics. Ever since he was a child, Sergey suffered from hearing loss, and at school, he was put in a group for children with special needs. He was described as unsocial, and if he was offended by other children, he would run away, refusing to return to class for several days. His peculiar behavior led to examinations by several doctors in 1989, who concluded that the young Sergey was intellectually disabled. However, they deemed that treatment was unnecessary, as it was believed that he would pose no threat to others around him. On the night of October 7, 1998, while wandering around Sokolniki Park at night, Sedov got into an argument with a drunk man. He then grabbed a metal pipe, with which he proceeded to beat the man to death, after which he sexually abused his corpse. Until his arrest on October 18, 1999, he would go on to commit five similar murders in the area, killing three victims with the metal pipe, one with a hammer and the final, his only female victim, with a pair of scissors. On the day of his arrest, Sergey told one of his neighbors that he had just killed a person, but as he was known to be of unsound mind, the neighbor didn't believe his claims. Sedov then went to the park with him, where he showed the still-fresh crime scene. Alarmed, the neighbor phoned the authorities, who quickly arrested the killer and started to interrogate him. During the investigations, Sedov admitted to the six murders and that he had had sex with the victims' corpses. When queried about why he had done it, he claimed that an \\"inner voice\\" had told him to commit exactly six killings. One of the investigators asked what would happen if he were told to kill for example 12 people, to which Sergey replied \\"Orders are not being discussed. I would continue to kill.\\" In June 2000, Sedov was put on trial before the Eastern Moscow District Court, accused of murder, but the sexual assault charges were dropped, as they couldn't be proven. He was ordered to undertake an exam at the Serbsky Center, from which the doctors determined that he was criminally insane, suffering from sexual sadism with necrophilic tendencies. As a result, the Moscow Court determined that he was mentally unfit to stand trial and sent him to a psychiatric hospital in the village of Troitskoye, where he would receive intensive treatment for the rest of his life.

He was involved in the debate over the ordaining of French rabbis in his time, and some have attribute to him the founding of modern Ashkenazi semicha. Biography Little is known about his life. He was born in Fulda,Meir ben Baruch Ha-Levi and therefore is sometimes called \\"Maharam Fulda\\". His father was apparently killed during the Persecution of Jews during the Black Death. He served as rabbi of Erfurt and then of Frankfurt. In 1383 he moved to Nuremberg, but two years later returned to Frankfurt. In the following years he was imprisoned for some time due to a false allegation. In 1392 he was freed and moved to Vienna, where he served as rosh yeshiva. שלמה שפיצר, \\"מהר\\"ם הלוי מוינה ופסקיו\\", עמ' לז–לח. It was said that he brought to Vienna \\"all the sources of the religion and customs\\" of the Rhineland,Israel Isserlein, Terumat Hadeshen, Pesakim Uchtavim, 63 and this move symbolized the transfer of the center of Ashkenazi Torah culture from Ashkenaz to Austria for generations to come. שלמה שפיצר, \\"לימוד התורה בישיבות אוסטריה במאות 14–15\\", דברי הקונגרס העולמי למדעי היהדות י (תשמ\\"ט), חטיבה ב', כרך ראשון, עמ' 137 The last known official record mentioning him dates to 1406, and as later his wife is mentioned as a widow, he apparently died then.שלמה שפיצר, \\"מהר\\"ם הלוי מווינה ופסקיו\\", עמ' מ. Isaac ben Sheshet (Rivash), despite his dispute with Meir over ordination, respected Meir and described him as \\"the great eagle, great of wings, full of Torah, who has wisdom\\".Shut haRivash, 271 Few of Meir's halachic positions survive in writing. However, his stature among Ashkenazi rabbis is shown by his appearance in many Memorbuch lists alongside figures such as Rabbeinu Gershom, Rashi, Rabbeinu Tam, and Meir of Rothenburg.e.g. של קהילת וורמייזא, הודפס ע\\"י אדולף ילינק, ‏קונטרס ווירמייזא וקהל ווינא, וינה תר\\"ם, עמ' 8, The French ordination dispute  He played an important role in the ordination dispute in France in his lifetime. Rabbi Mattitiah Treves had been known as \\"head of the French rabbis\\", and upon his death bequeathed this title to his son Yohanan Treves. However, a different student of Mattitiah's, Yeshayah ben Abba Mari who served as rabbi in Savoy contested this. Yeshayah turned to Meir ben Baruch Halevi, who gave him a semicha document, establishing that Yeshayah had the sole right to appoint rabbis in the entire kingdom of France. Yohanan, though, turned to Isaac ben Sheshet, who argued that Meir's authority to make such decrees was limited to Ashkenaz. The resulting debate drew in rabbis across Europe. יוסף הקר, \\"יוחנן טריוויש ומשפחתו באיטליה וישיבה בפדובה בראשית המאה החמש עשרה\\", ציון עח [ד] (תשע\\"ג), עמ' 471–472. מרדכי ברויאר, \\"הסמיכה האשכנזית\\", ציון לג [א–ב] (תשכ\\"ח), עמ' 16–18. Based on this episode, many modern scholars have concluded that Meir founded the institution of Ashkenazi semicha (\\"moreinu\\" semicha), i.e. explicit granting of the title \\"Moreinu\\" by a rabbi to his student, as a precondition to the student's serving in a rabbinic role. This title is first recorded in the French ordination dispute, suggesting that it was founded by Meir, and this was the accepted scholarly opinion in the past. צבי בנימין אוירבך, ברית אברהם (פרנקפורט דמיין, תר\\"ך), מבוא עמ' 6; א\\"ה ווייס, דור דור ודורשיו, חלק ה', ספר עשרים ושנים, פרק ששה עשר, עמ' 165. More recently, other scholars have rejected this argument, noting that Yeshayah's opponents (Yohanan and Isaac ben Sheshet) seem to treat semicha as a preexisting institution, arguing that Meir's controversial innovation was that the requirement of ordination by Meir should apply internationally and not only within the circles of Meir's students. מרדכי ברויאר, \\"הסמיכה האשכנזית\\", ציון לג [א–ב] (תשכ\\"ח), עמ' 16–18.

In 1805, as flag captain aboard , he returned to England for Robert Calder's court martial, following perceived inaction at the Battle of Cape Finisterre. Cuming, therefore, missed the Battle of Trafalgar. Early life and career William Cuming was born in 1760 to John and Elizabeth Cuming of Totnes. He remained in the county of Devon until 1773 when he joined the Royal Navy as a midshipman.Hore p.63Norrie p.91 Passing his lieutenant's examination in 1779, Cuming was made a Commander in 1795, and in this capacity he was appointed to HMS Alliance in 1796.

Hostilities renewed When the short-lived Peace of Amiens came to an end, Cuming was appointed to as flag captain to Robert Calder. On 9 July, the Admiralty received word from Nelson that the Franco-Spanish fleet had left the West Indies. Presuming this force was destined for the Channel, the Admiralty responded by ordering Prince of Wales to take up a position west of Cape Finisterre and intercept.Clowes (Vol.V) p.110 Calder was reinforced on 15 July, giving him a total of fifteen ships of the line. The partial clearing of fog at 11:00 on 22 July revealed the allied fleet of 20 ships of the line, heading east-southeast towards Ferrol and Calder gave the order to pursue.Clowes (Vol.V) pp. 111–112 The winds were light and the visibility so poor that Calder had to send his frigates ahead to keep track of the enemy, and it was after 17:00 before the British fleet was close enough to engage.Clowes (Vol.V) pp. 113–114 The action was a confused melee with neither side able to see signals nor each other. At 20:25, with the fading light and gunsmoke compounding the problem, Calder called a halt to the action, his force having captured two of the enemy ships.Clowes (Vol.V) pp. 113–115 The following morning, the two fleets were 17 miles apart and Calder, still outnumbered and wishing to protect his prizes, chose not to renew the action.Clowes (Vol.V) p. 116 He was much criticised for his perceived lack of action and demanded a court martial to clear his name. Prince of Wales later returned to England for the hearing, depriving Nelson of one of his most powerful ships and Cuming of the opportunity to fight at the Battle of Trafalgar. After a period as captain of , flagship of Erasmus Gower on the Newfoundland station, Cuming took command of , flagship of Rear-Admiral Charles Stirling, in the latter half of 1806 and sailed with a convoy for Cape of Good Hope on 30 August 1806 and from there to the River Plate. Sampson returned to England in July 1807 and paid off in December.Winfield p. 99 In June 1808, Cuming commissioned the newly built and sailed her to the Mediterranean, where she formed part of Edward Pellew's fleet on blockade duty at Toulon.Winfield p. 76 Cuming commanded HMS Royal George from February 1813 until she was laid up at Plymouth at the end of the War of the Sixth Coalition.Winfield p. 5 Court martial Lieutenant Nesbit Willoughby was one of those sent aboard Prøvesteenen at the Battle of Copenhagen, and, after suppressing a mutiny and returning to Russell with prisoners, Cuming ordered him cheered. Later, during the Baltic Campaign, when Russell was on blockade duty at Karlskrona, Willoughby was judged to be insolent by Cuming and was consequently ordered to never leave the poop deck without authorisation. In retaliation, Willoughby charged Cuming with 'unofficerlike' and 'oppressive behaviour', claiming that he struck and shoved his fellow officers while in the execution of their duties. Cuming was acquitted but Willoughby was dismissed from the service on counter-charges of insolence and contempt. Later life Cuming was made a Companion of The Most Honourable Order of the Bath in 1815. Promoted to Rear-admiral in 1821, he died in 1824. Cuming left his estate to his nephew. He had been married to Catherine Lyde from Devon, and the couple were childless.

It is a manuscript, in the Latin language; its title means [the little book] on the five regular solids. It is one of three books known to have been written by della Francesca. The other two, De prospectiva pingendi and Trattato d'abaco concern perspective drawing and arithmetic in the tradition of Fibonacci's Liber Abaci, respectively. Along with the Platonic solids, De quinque corporibus regularibus includes descriptions of five of the thirteen Archimedean solids, and of several other irregular polyhedra coming from architectural applications. It was the first of what would become many books connecting mathematics to art through the construction and perspective drawing of polyhedra, including Luca Pacioli's 1509 Divina proportione (which incorporated without credit an Italian translation of della Francesca's work), Albrecht Dürer's Underweysung der Messung, and Wenzel Jamnitzer's Perspectiva corporum regularium. Lost for many years, it was rediscovered in the 19th century in the Vatican Library and the Vatican copy has since been republished in facsimile. Background Truncated icosahedron, one of the Archimedean solids illustrated in De quinque corporibus regularibus The five Platonic solids (the regular tetrahedron, cube, octahedron, dodecahedron, and icosahedron) were known to della Francesca through two classical sources: Timaeus, in which Plato theorizes that four of them correspond to the classical elements making up the world (with the fifth, the dodecahedron, corresponding to the heavens), and the Elements of Euclid, in which the Platonic solids are constructed as mathematical objects. Two apocryphal books of the Elements concerning the metric properties of the Platonic solids, sometimes called pseudo-Euclid, were also commonly considered to be part of the Elements in the time of della Francesca. It is the material from the Elements and pseudo-Euclid, rather than from Timaeus, that forms della Francesca's main inspiration. The thirteen Archimedean solids, convex polyhedra in which the vertices but not the faces are symmetric to each other, were classified by Archimedes in a book that has long been lost. Archimedes' classification was later briefly described by Pappus of Alexandria in terms of how many faces of each kind these polyhedra have. Della Francesca had previously studied and copied the works of Archimedes, and includes citations to Archimedes in De quinque corporibus regularibus. But although he describes six of the Archimedean solids in his books (five in De quinque corporibus regularibus), this appears to be an independent rediscovery; he does not credit Archimedes for these shapes and there is no evidence that he knew of Archimedes' work on them. Similarly, although both Archimedes and Della Francesca found formulas for the volume of a cloister vault, their work on this appears to be independent, as Archimedes' volume formula remained unknown until the early 20th century. Della Francesca's other mathematical book, Trattato d'abaco, was part of a long line of abbacist works, teaching arithmetic, accounting, and basic geometrical calculations through many practical exercises, beginning with the work of Fibonacci in his book Liber Abaci (1202). Although the early parts of De quinque corporibus regularibus also borrow from this line of work, and overlap extensively with Trattato d'abaco, Fibonacci and his followers had previously applied their calculation methods only in two-dimensional geometry. The later parts of De quinque corporibus regularibus are more original in their application of arithmetic to the geometry of three-dimensional shapes. Contents After its dedication, the title page of De quinque corporibus regularibus begins Petri pictoris Burgensis De quinque corporibus regularibus. The first three words mean \\"Of Peter the painter, from Borgo\\", and refer to the book's author, Piero della Francesca (from Borgo Santo Sepolcro); the title proper begins after that. A decorative initial begins the text of the book. The first of the book's four parts concerns problems in plane geometry, primarily concerning the measurement of polygons, such as calculating their area, perimeter, or side length, given a different one of these quantities. The second part concerns the circumscribed spheres of the Platonic solids, and asks similar questions on lengths, areas, or volumes of these solids relative to the measurements of the sphere that surrounds them. It also includes the (very likely novel) derivation for the height of an irregular tetrahedron, given its side lengths, equivalent (using the standard formula relating height and volume of tetrahedra) to a form of Heron's formula for tetrahedra. The third part includes additional exercises on circumscribed spheres, and then considers pairs of Platonic solids inscribed one within another, again focusing on their relative measurements. This part is inspired most directly by the 15th (apocryphal) book of the Elements, which constructs certain inscribed pairs of polyhedral figures (for instance, a regular tetrahedron inscribed within a cube and sharing its four vertices with the four of the cube). De quinque corporibus regularibus aims to arithmetize these constructions, making it possible to calculate the measurements for one polyhedron given measurements of the other. The dome of Santa Maria presso San Satiro Intersecting two cylinders to form a Steinmetz solid The fourth and final part of the book concerns other shapes than the Platonic solids. These include six Archimedean solids: the truncated tetrahedron (which appears also in an exercise in his Trattato d'abaco), and the truncations of the other four Platonic solids. The cuboctahedron, another Archimedean solid, is described in the Trattato but not in De quinque corporibus regularibus; since De quinque corporibus regularibus appears to be a later work than the Trattato, this omission appears to be deliberate, and a sign that della Francesca was not aiming for a complete listing of these polyhedra. The fourth part of De quinque corporibus regularibus also includes domed shapes like the domes of the Pantheon, Rome or the (at the time newly constructed) Santa Maria presso San Satiro in Milan formed from a ring of triangles surrounded by concentric rings of irregular quadrilaterals, and other shapes arising in architectural applications. The result that calls della Francesca's \\"most sophisticated\\" is the derivation of the volume of a Steinmetz solid (the intersection of two cylinders, the shape of a cloister vault), which della Francesca had illustrated in his book on perspective. Despite its curves, this shape has a simple but non-obvious formula for its volume, 2/3 of the volume of its enclosing cube. This result was known to both Archimedes and, in ancient China, Zu Chongzhi, but della Francesca was most likely unaware of either prior discovery. De quinque corporibus regularibus is illustrated in a variety of styles by della Francesca, not all of which are in correct mathematical perspective. It includes many exercises, roughly half of which overlap with the geometric parts of della Francesca's Trattato d'abaco, translated from the Italian of the Trattato to the Latin of the De quinque corporibus regularibus. Dissemination Della Francesca dedicated De quinque corporibus regularibus to Guidobaldo da Montefeltro, the Duke of Urbino. Although the book is not dated, this dedication narrows the date of its completion to the range from 1482 when Guidobaldo, ten years old, became duke, until 1492 when Della Francesca died. However, della Francesca likely wrote his book first in Italian, before translating it into Latin either himself or with the assistance of a friend, Matteo dal Borgo, suggests that della Francesca did not know Latin and would have needed dal Borgo's assistance, but this is contradicted by the later discovery by of a Latin manuscript of the works of Archimedes, copied by della Francesca. so its original draft may have been from before Guidobaldo's accession. In any case, the book was added to the library of the duke. It was kept there together with della Francesca's book on perspective, which he had dedicated to the previous duke. In what has been called \\"probably the first full-blown case of plagiarism in the history of mathematics\\", Luca Pacioli copied exercises from Trattato d'abaco into his 1494 book Summa de arithmetica, and then, in his 1509 book Divina proportione, incorporated a translation of the entire book De quinque corporibus regularibus into Italian, without crediting della Francesca for any of this material. It is through Pacioli that much of della Francesca's work became widely known. Although Giorgio Vasari denounced Pacioli for plagiarism in his 1568 book, Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects, he did not provide sufficient detail to verify these claims. Della Francesca's original work became lost until, in 1851 and again in 1880, it was rediscovered in the Urbino collection of the Vatican Library by Scottish antiquary James Dennistoun and German art historian , respectively, allowing the accuracy of Vasari's accusations to be verified. Subsequent works to study the regular solids and their perspectives in similar ways, based on the work of della Francesca and its transmission by Pacioli, include Albrecht Dürer's Underweysung der Messung (1525), which focuses on techniques for both the perspective drawing of regular and irregular polyhedra as well as for their construction as physical models, and Wenzel Jamnitzer's Perspectiva corporum regularium (1568), which presents images of many polyhedra derived from the regular polyhedra, but without mathematical analysis. Although a book with the same title was recorded to exist in the 16th century in the private library of John Dee, the Vatican copy of De quinque corporibus regularibus (Vatican Codex Urbinas 632) is the only extant copy known. An 1895 catalog of the Vatican collection lists it between volumes of Euclid and Archimedes. Reproductions of it have been published by the Accademia dei Lincei in 1916, and by Giunti in 1995.

For general discussion of Rabbinic ordination, see Semikhah #Concept and Rabbi #Ordination; for an overview of the differing emphases between denominations re ordination-training, see Yeshiva #Curriculum. Orthodox :See: Yeshiva #Contemporary Orthodox yeshivas; Rabbi #Orthodox and Modern Orthodox Judaism. Orthodox yeshivas are institutions of Torah study generally, \\"Torah lishma\\", and are not focused on the training of rabbis per se. (Their curricula emphasize Talmud along with the study of halacha (Jewish law); if less emphasized, Tanakh (bible) and Jewish thought /Musar /Hasidic philosophy are also studied.) Rabbinical training proper, generally takes one of three forms. Many Yeshivot host a specific Rabbinic kollel, or other program, focusing on Semikhah (ordination); these are then an integral part of the yeshiva. These programs build students' ability to \\"pasken\\", i.e. decide cases in Halacha, extending and relying on the textual and analytical skills built over several years of Talmud study; this, in parallel, includes preparation of the specific sections of Shulchan Aruch required for certification-testing (always kashrut; often shabbat, niddah; sometimes avelut, marriage laws).

These programs span 2 years on average, depending on the topics covered. Alongside their Rabbinic studies, students here typically participate in the Yeshiva's senior Talmud shiur. Institutions: * Most Religious Zionist Rabbis are trained at Mercaz HaRav and / or the various Hesder Yeshivot (well known are Yeshivat Kerem B'Yavneh, Yeshivat Hakotel, Yeshivat Sha'alvim, and Yeshivat Har Etzion) typically preparing for the \\"Semikhah of the Rabbanut\\" * Haredi yeshivot in Israel generally do not offer a \\"semikha program\\", although if required students may be tested by the Rosh Yeshiva. Well known Ashkenazi (Lithuanian) yeshivot are Mir and Ponevezh; the leading Sephardi yeshiva is Porat Yosef. Students here also, often sit the Rabbanut exams. * In the US, well known Haredi semachot are through Hebrew Theological College, \\"Rabbinical Seminary of America\\", Telz, and Ner Yisroel (others, such as Chaim Berlin and \\"Lakewood\\", as at Israeli Yeshivot, do not commonly ordain) *In Europe Gateshead Talmudical College is probably the best known, others include the Yeshiva of Aix-les- Bains; elsewhere, Yeshiva Gedolah in Sydney, Yeshiva Gedolah of Johannesburg. *Many Hasidic dynasties have their own yeshivot - see for example Satmar (Hasidic dynasty) #Institutions, Bobov (Hasidic dynasty) #Institutions and Breslov (Hasidic group) #Today - focusing on general learning as opposed to semicha, which is granted on a limited basis; Chabad-Lubavitch, by contrast, operates its global Tomchei Tmimim network, many of which include a semicha program. (Since the 1950's, unlike at other streams, semikha is obtained by the bulk of Chabad yeshiva students; the Lubavitcher Rebbe instructed students to obtain ordination before getting married.A New Crop of Students To Receive Rabbinic Ordination,lubavitch.com ) Some institutions specifically focus on rabbinic training. These typically prepare all of the above topics, and extend their curriculum to other relevant areas of Jewish law (e.g. laws of the synagogue and Jewish prayer), and discussion of contemporary issues, or \\"hashkafa\\"; as well as offering some elements of \\"practical Rabbinics\\" (e.g. public speaking, life-cycle events, pastoral care), always secondary however. These programs average 3 years, but may be up to 5 years. Institutions well known for their Rabbinic training: *In Israel: Ohr Torah Stone's Straus Rabbinical Seminary, Kollel for Israeli Rabbis and Machon Ariel which trains Rabbis and Dayanim (Rabbinic Judges); Kollel Eretz Hemda trains Dayanim; there are several specialized kollels preparing candidates for the Chief Rabbinate Dayanut test. *Israel-based programs preparing Rabbis for Diaspora communities: The Shehebar Sephardic Center, sscusa.org The Jerusalem Kollel, Ohr Somayach's Ohr La'Golah, Aish HaTorah's semicha program, The Center for Kehilla Development, The Center for Kehilla Development Ner Le'Elef, nerleelef.com Mizrachi's Manhigut-Toranit program,manhigut-toranit.org Institute for Community Rabbis in the Diaspora (Ariel Institute)Institute for Community Rabbis in the Diaspora, mosdot-ariel.org * Various Chabad institutions are located globally, and include the Rabbinical College of America, Rabbinical College of Australia and New Zealand, Rabbinical College of Canada, Rabbinical College of Pretoria; the testing here, certifying community Rabbis, is typically more extensive than at Tomchei Tmimim above *Most American Modern Orthodox Rabbis are trained at RIETS, the Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary, many at the Israeli Yeshivat HaMivtar (Straus) *In Europe: Rabbinerseminar zu Berlin and Judith Lady Montefiore College Outside of these, it is common also for a student to prepare material independently, so as to be tested by a well known Rosh Yeshiva or posek (many from the late R. Zalman Nechemia Goldberg), so called \\"private semicha\\". This Semikhah solely certifies the holder's ability, and thus right, to pasken; see, again, Semikhah #Concept. Recently, several institutions are established around semicha-testing (i.e. as opposed to Rabbinical training); these publish syllabi, with a corresponding learning program, and often provide online training, Dvora Lakein, 2010. Chabad Rabbi Launches Online Training Program for Rabbis and are then a hybrid of Yeshiva and private; they are sometimes referred to as \\"on-line semicha programs.\\" In some cases, the program is completed in one year. (Although sometimes criticized, their syllabi are standard, and their role, in fact, is intended as providing structured learning in Halacha to those outside of a formal yeshiva, and their offerings then include non-semicha courses; as for the above, these programs assume a level of scholarship typically acquired over several years in Yeshiva. Membership in the Rabbinical Council of America requires six years yeshiva study, excluding the time spent in an on-line program.) *Semicha-testing programs: Pirchei Shoshanim, Yeshiva Pirchei Shoshanim Yeshivas Iyun Halacha, Yeshivas Iyun Halacha Yeshiva Chonen Daas chonendaas.org / rbssemicha.com *Chabad programs: The Institute For Rabbinical Studies, Online Smicha Institute For Rabbinical, Studies, onlinesmicha.com Machon Smicha, Machon Smicha, onlinemachon.com HSSP Home Study Semicha Program, shulchanaruchharav.com *WebYeshiva, a fully online Yeshiva, offers semikha culminating a four year program. Conservative :See: Yeshiva #Conservative movement yeshivas; Rabbi #Conservative Judaism. In addition to knowledge and mastery of the study of Talmud and halakhah, Conservative semikhah also requires that its rabbinical students receive intensive training in Tanakh, classical biblical commentaries, biblical criticism, Midrash, Kabbalah and Hasidut, the historical development of Judaism from antiquity to modernity, Jewish ethics, the halakhic methodology of Conservative responsa, classical and modern works of Jewish theology and philosophy, synagogue administration, pastoral care, chaplaincy, non-profit management, and navigating the modern world in a Jewish context. Most Conservative seminaries ordain women and openly LGBT people as rabbis and cantors. Ordination is granted at: *the Rabbinical School of the Jewish Theological Seminary of America in New York, *the Ziegler School of Rabbinic Studies in Los Angeles, *the Schechter Institute of Jewish Studies in Jerusalem (Jerusalem's Conservative Yeshiva does not grant ordination), *the Budapest University of Jewish Studies, *the Zacharias Frankel College in Potsdam, *and the Seminario Rabinico Latinoamericano in Buenos Aires. Reform :See Rabbi #Reform Judaism In Reform Judaism, rabbinic studies are mandated in pastoral care, the historical development of Judaism, academic biblical criticism, in addition to the study of traditional rabbinic texts. Rabbinical students also are required to gain practical rabbinic experience by working at a congregation as a rabbinic intern during each year of study from year one onwards. All Reform seminaries ordain women and openly LGBT people as rabbis and cantors. *The seminary of Reform Judaism in the United States is Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion. It has campuses in Cincinnati, New York City, Los Angeles, and in Jerusalem. *In the United Kingdom the Reform and Liberal movements maintain Leo Baeck College for the training and ordination of rabbis. *In Germany the progressive Abraham Geiger College trains and ordains candidates for the rabbinate. *In Latin America, the Reform Movement maintains the Instituto Iberoamericano de Formación Rabinica Reformista http://www.institutorabinico.org (Iberoamerican Institute of Reform Rabbinical Formation), based in Buenos Aires, Argentina. The IIFRR serves the Latin American Reform communities and has had online teaching as part of its curriculum, counting as teachers and supporting lecturers rabbis from the Reform communities throughout Latin America, North America, Israel and Europe. Reconstructionist The Reconstructionist Rabbinical College is located in Pennsylvania ; it ordains women as well as men (and openly LGBT people) as rabbis and cantors. In 2015 the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College voted to accept rabbinical students in interfaith relationships, making Reconstructionist Judaism the first type of Judaism to officially allow rabbis in relationships with non-Jewish partners. Other non-Orthodox In general, Non-Orthodox institutions offer a synthesis of traditional and critical methods, allowing Jewish texts and tradition to encounter social change and modern scholarship. The curricula thus focus on classical Jewish subjects, including Talmud, Tanakh, Midrash, halacha, and Philosophy, with an openness to modern scholarship, but also on \\"the other functions of a modern rabbi such as preaching, counselling, and pastoral work\\". Ordination (Semicha), myjewishlearning.com Note that, often, in these institutions less emphasis is placed on Talmud and Jewish law, \\"but rather on sociology, cultural studies, and modern Jewish philosophy\\".Rabbi Steven Blane (N.D.). \\"Ordination and Semicha\\", jsli.net Institutions: * Pluralistic Rabbinical Seminary offers a two-year online rabbinical ordination program. It trains men and women. Rabbinic educators are Conservative, Reform and Orthodox rabbis, but the semicha is postdenominational. * Humanistic Judaism has the International Institute for Secular Humanistic Judaism, which currently has two centers of activity: one in Jerusalem and the other in Farmington Hills, Michigan. Both places ordain women as well as men as rabbis, and do not ordain cantors. Both, ordain openly LGBT people. * Jewish Renewal has an ordination program, ALEPH, but no central campus. ALEPH ordains women as well as men as rabbis and cantors. It also ordains openly LGBT people. * The Academy for Jewish Religion, in New York City, since 1956, and the unrelated Academy for Jewish Religion-California, in Los Angeles, since 2000, have been rabbinic (and cantorial) seminaries unaffiliated with any denomination or movement. Hebrew College, near Boston, includes a similarly unaffiliated rabbinic school, opened in the Fall of 2003. These seminaries are accepted by all non-Orthodox rabbis as valid rabbinical seminaries, and they all ordain women as well as men (and openly LGBT people) as rabbis and cantors. Orthodox Jews do not consider these ordinations valid, because these seminaries do not consider Orthodox halacha to be binding. * The Jewish Spiritual Leaders Institute offers a training program, meets in weekly online classes via the Internet and ordains women as well as men as unaffiliated rabbis to meet the needs of unaffiliated Jews as well as interfaith couples and their families. It subscribes to Jewish Universalism, promoting religious tolerance and asserting that there are many paths to 'the One.' JSLI ordained its first class of rabbis in August 2011.

He also did still-lifes and some female nudes.  Biography  He was born to a family of prominent bankers, and received a commercial education. His first art lessons came in 1889, from José de Larrocha (1850-1933) at the Granada School of Arts and Crafts. Between 1890 and 1895, he finished his technical education at the University of Granada, but also painted as a hobby. During his time with Larrocha, he had become friends with the painter, , who encouraged him to make a career of art. In 1899, he took that advice and moved to Madrid, where he studied with Emilio Sala. This involved several trips to Paris, to view the Old Masters in person. After paying a visit to the Exposition Universelle (1900), he produced a long series of Granadian landscapes and genre scenes, some of which earned him honorable mention at the National Exhibition of Fine Arts in 1904. He continued to participate in the National Exhibition, receiving a Second Class prize in 1906 and achieving a First Class prize in 1908 for \\"The Gypsies of Sacromonte\\". In 1910, his \\"Temptation on the Mount\\" led him to be honored as a full Commander in the Order of Alfonso XII. He also exhibited in Paris, Munich and Amsterdam. In 1913, he toured central Europe and paid a visit to Egypt. In 1914, at the beginning of World War I, he returned to Granada, where he began construction of his own home; an extensive and lush , a type of walled house with gardens and an orchard. Over the next decade, he painted little although, in 1923, he became involved in helping José Ortega y Gasset start up his cultural magazine, the '. By 1928, the carmen and its accompanying studios was complete, so he began painting regularly again and took part in a retrospective of Spanish painting that toured Belgium and the Netherlands. Throughout the early 1930s, he became a world traveler, ranging from Canada to India and Africa. He also established a legacy fund for creating the , a cultural organization which, to this day, has its headquarters in his carmen. Upon the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, he isolated himself in his studio and would remain in isolation until his death. During those years, he painted simple still-lifes and nudes, but failed to complete most of them. He died suddenly after a brief illness. The painting he was working on at the time, a female nude, has come to be called La Noche (Night), due to its resemblance to a sculpture by Michelangelo. It still stands in his studio, where it was when he died.

It ranks among the most severe floods recorded in the region. A state of emergency was declared, and teams have worked to prevent damage to threatened archaeological sites. The flood affected more than 3,000,000 people, destroyed more than 100,000 homes, and left 102 people dead to date. Event The water level of the Nile River in Sudan rose and reached record levels, as floods entered homes and destroyed about 60,000 homes, and caused dozens of deaths. The level of the Blue Nile reached more than 17 metres, breaking all records. Floods caused by torrential monsoon rains mostly outside the country in neighbouring Ethiopia raised the Nile River by in late August, the highest level it has reached in nearly a century, according to the Sudanese Ministry of Irrigation. For the first time in history, the Pyramids of Meroë were threatened by flooding. The rates of floods and rain exceeded the records set in 1946 and 1988. Some experts, such as International Rivers, expect climate change to cause periodic bouts of drought and flooding in the future. Response The government led and coordinated the emergency response to the flood. The National Flood Mission Forces of the Humanitarian Aid Committee began, and Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok confirmed that \\"the levels of the Nile and its tributaries this year, according to the Ministry of Irrigation and Water Resources, have been unprecedented since 1912.\\" He also pointed out that this year's floods resulted in tragic and painful losses of life and property. =State of emergency= The Sudanese Security and Defense Council declared a state of emergency throughout the country for a period of three months and has decided to consider Sudan a natural disaster area. The council has formed a supreme committee to prevent and address the effects of torrents and floods, which killed about 100 people and flooded more than 100 thousand homes since late July. The floodwaters may overrun and flood an ancient archaeological site in the country. Teams have organized sandbag walls and are pumping water out of the area in order to avoid damage to the ruins of Al-Bajrawiya, formerly an ancient city of the two-thousand-year-old Meroitic empire and a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Previous floods have never affected the site before. The floods have thus far affected more than 500,000 people in at least 16 states across the country. This has left thousands of people homeless. Tents have been put up to accommodate the displaced in Sudan's capital, Khartoum. Water-borne diseases have rapidly increased since the floods. Fever, diarrhea, and stomach infections are rampant as a result of dirty drinking water. Sudan was facing a health crisis even before the flood emergency. Pharmacies have been reporting shortages of medicine, and many hospitals lack adequate equipment. The United Nations has increased food aid to the country while hundreds of thousands of Sudanese have been forced to live in desperate makeshift camps.The situation has been aggravated by the country's economic crisis and political deadlock. The government announced a public emergency after its currency abduptly declined in recent weeks. Prices of basic foods such as bread and sugar have risen in price by over 50 percent over the past few weeks. Last week, Sudanese Economic Minister Hiba Mohamed Ali said that the government had dedicated 6.15 million dollars to help alleviate victims of the floods. Furthermore, less than half of the $1.6bn needed for the country's humanitarian relief plan has been funded thus far. The United Nations said humanitarian actors might run out of funds necessary to continue operations. The country is fighting multiple catastrophes, including warfare and an upsurge of COVID-19 and polio cases. The worst-hit states were North Darfur, Khartoum, Blue Nile, West Darfur and Sennar. In addition, vast areas of arable land in the affected states are flooded. The damage to farms could endanger food security, particularly in Khartoum, where over 1.4 million people are in desperate need of food. On 30 September 2020, the Food and Agriculture Organization said that the floods in Sudan have affected nearly one third of cultivated land and about 3 million people from agricultural households. About 2.2 million hectares of cropland has been flooded and 108,000 head of livestock lost, according to an FAO assessment. Some 1.1 million tonnes of grain was destroyed in planted areas, most of it sorghum, a staple in Sudan, it added. Women from some of the nearly 600,000 affected agricultural households told the FAO they were cutting down to one small meal per day after their sorghum was washed away just before harvest. Commercial crops including bananas and mangos have also been badly hit. The floods have also destroyed or damaged tens of thousands of homes. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees said they have affected about 150,000 refugees and displaced people. The United Nations estimates that 9.6 million people face acute food insecurity in Sudan, the highest number on record. In addition, the UN said that severe flooding in South Sudan has forced more than 600,000 people to flee their homes since July.

It takes place in the context of an attempt to conquer Tlemcen by the Alaouites.  Background  Hajj Chabane had just been elected dey by the Taifa of the Raïs. He decided to declare war on the Sultan of Morocco as a result of continued efforts to ravage his territory. As a result of the troubles that have occurred in the country over a period of ten years Chabane had sought to extend his territory towards Tlemcen. Mouley Ismaïl learned of his arrival to Oujda and attempted to retrace his steps, however the Turkish army reached him at a ford of the Moulouïa which lead to clashed with the Turks of Algiers. These tensions at the Algerian border occurred because Mouley Ismaïl wanted to have his \\"religious equality\\" with the Sultan of Istanbul recognized in the eyes of the Europeans. The alliance of France and Turkey intrigued him as he believed it could be an opportunity to counter Spain; or in case of war against the Algerians, an opportunity to bring an agreement between the Sultan of Istanbul and Fez. Mouley Ismaïl even proposed making an alliance with the bey of Tunis.  Battle  The dey marched against Mouley Ismail with 10,000 Janissaries and 3,000 spahis, as well as a contingent of Igawawen Kabyles. The Algerians encountered the enemy, composed of 14,000 infantrymen and 8,000 cavalrymen. Despite the numerical inferiority, they vigorously attacked the Moroccans and killed 5,000 of their men while the Algerians suffered casualties of only a hundred. Léon Galibert gives the following account:  Aftermath  The dey pursued the fugitives to the wall of Fez, which was protected by an army of 24,000 foot soldiers and 20,000 horses. The Sultan of Morocco, Ismail commanded it in person, but was reluctant to engage in combat knowing the earlier victory that the Algerians had spread terror among his soldiers. Despite their numerical superiority they forced him to make peace proposals. The two commanders went to a tent erected between the two camps and a peace agreement was signed. Ismail came to the conference with his hands bound in a sign of submission. Kissing the ground three times, he appealed to the protection of the padichah of Constantinople and then said to the dey: \\"You are the knife and I am the flesh that you can cut\\".

With the blizzard raging outside the train no one had thought to bring refreshments as ordinarily the journey was a short one. Coincidentally, it was Tunks' birthday, and he having little faith in the eatables provided by theatrical landladies had obtained a large steak and kidney pie with various other confections plus a few bottles of spirits and beer to share with his friends in the digs.

Taxonomy The taxonomy of this very variable species is not sufficiently understood. The initial species description by Nathaniel Wallich was published in 1824 by William Roxburgh in Flora indica 2 on page 176. Occasionally Lonicera henryi and giraldii are listed as separate species. Description Lonicera acuminata grows as a several meters high, semi- evergreen and fast-growing lignifying vine. The branches, petioles and peduncles are mostly hairy. The branches usually become hollow. The opposite or sometimes 3-whorled, simple leaves are short-stalked and with entire margins. The more or less hirsute (especially on the midvein) to bare, leathery leaves with often somewhat ciliate edges measure 2.5 to 13 centimeters in length and 1.3 to 4.5 centimeters in width. They are ovoid to -lanceolate or obovate to inverted lanceolate, pointed to rounded and often slightly cordate toward the short 2 to 15 millimeter long stem and acuminate to caudate at the apex. To reduce the evaporation rate, the leaves can also get rolled in slightly. The hermaphroditic, narrowly funnelform, five-petalled and reddish to purple or yellow flowers with a dichlamydeous perianth usually grow in stalked pairs, more rarely in small panicles, axillary at the branch apices. They have both bracts and bracteoles. The small calyx is pitcher- shaped with small teeth and the corolla is double-lipped, with a recurved, tongue-shaped lower lip. The long corolla tube is more or less hairy inside. The ovary is inferior with a long, firm, more or less hairy style with a large, head-like stigma. The five filaments are about as long as the corolla and are partly hairy in the lower part. Nectaries are present. The plants bloom fragrantly between May and July and in October and November they bear 4-6 millimeters large, roundish to ovoid, pruinose and blue-black, smooth berries with several seeds and calyx remains at the top. The seeds are ellipsoid to elongated and somewhat compressed. Distribution It grows on neutral to alkaline soils up to 3200 meters above sea level. Its origin is in Western China, Tibet, Nepal, Buthan, India and in the Asian tropics. Worldwide cultivation has led to spontaneous occurrences in other places. Ecology The nectar attracts insects and hummingbirds, the berry-fruits birds. The plants can be affected by powdery mildew, aphids and thrips. The species is used for insect- and bird-friendly green walls. Its stems are used in the Philippines as a binding material in fence construction. The high content of pharmacologically active substances is similar to that of other honeysuckle (vitamin C, polyphenols, flavonoids, peroxidases, catalase, superoxide dismutase) and has useful antioxidant and radical scavenging effects. It can also be propagated via cuttings, whereby the plant hormone 1-aminobenzotriazole (ABT1) considerably improves rooting.

Painted between 1875 and 1877, it depicts a dreamy young woman (or aristocratic demi-monde) gently supporting her head with her hand. The painting is part of the permanent collection of the Royal Museum of Fine Arts in Antwerp. The Parisian Sphinx shows the influence of Vermeer and the other Netherlandish old masters on Stevens, and testifies to the Symbolist influence in the latter's day. It incorporates a harmonious juxtaposition of superficial Dutch realism with the spreading Symbolist manner, as opposed to the bottom- up, pluralistic symbolism of the declining Romanticism. While well executed and apparently quite realistic, the painting has also a non-plain meaning. Beside being renowned for its realism and luminism, The Parisian Sphinx has been described as enigmatic, just as its title. Critics agree in that the apparently realistic painting conceals a hidden meaning. Many point to the \\"hidden dangers behind feminine tenderness,\\" and to the figure of the femme fatale. Background Alfred Stevens was born in Brussels on May 11, 1823 . He received his training in the Brussels studio of François-Joseph Navez, a successful Belgian portraitist. Stevens belonged to the generation of Joseph Lies, Jean Pierre François Lamorinière and Liévin De Winne. He received his training together with Charles de Groux and Jan Frans Portaels. Alfred Stevens and his brothers grew up with their grandfather, who ran the popular Brussels cafe de l'amitié. The latter was an intellectual gathering place of progressionists and dissenters. Stevens' aversion to history painting was manifested in his reaction to the current heroic romance of his time. He later wrote: \\"the historical subject was invented when people stopped being interested in painting itself.\\" Two constants permeated both his upbringing and his later oeuvre: realism in his art and bourgeois materialism in his lifestyle.Leen de Jong, in Openbaar Kunstbezit Vlaanderen 1971, p. 4-4b. It was Camille Roqueplan who persuaded Stevens to move to Paris. He emigrated to Paris in 1851. His brothers also moved to Paris. Joseph Stevens became a celebrated Belgian animal painter and Arthur Stevens, who was a critic, was the best advertisement for the brother painters. Alfred grew into a Parisian society that had mastered fashion genre painting for almost twenty years. After initially focusing on realistic, socially motivated works (1844), around 1855 he increasingly turned to the depiction of chic middle-class ladies. He depicted them all with their intricate hairstyles, colorful clothes and finery in charming genre pieces, in which he invariably captured a fleeting mood. The sadness of a farewell, the emotion of a letter, the rustle of a silk dress. Each oeuvre is an atmospheric painting packed with wealth and luxury.Jan Lea Broeckx in Musea van België. Koninklijk Museum voor Schone Kunsten te Antwerpen. Moderne meesters, 1958, nr. 5; Leen de Jong, in Moderne Meesters in het Koninklijk Museum, 1992, nr. 6. The Second Empire was a very bourgeois and prosperous period in which Stevens became the chronicler par excellence of the demi-mondaines, making his name in Paris as a painter of beautifully dressed ladies. Unlike Franz Xaver Winterhalter, the official portraitist of the French imperial family and Steven's main rival in the genre, Stevens chose his models from among the wealthy upper classes. The demi-mondaines were maintained by their well-to-do lovers and often had nothing to do at all. They read books, waited for their lovers to return, made themselves up and passed their time in salons, exhibitions and seaside towns. His fascination for the female figure in art is evidenced by one of the 360 aphorisms in Steven's Impressions sur la peinture. In it he states: “The glance of a woman has more charm than the most beautiful landscape or seascape, and is more beautiful than a ray of sunlight.\\" His choice of bourgeois ladies was unprecedented. Female figures were more likely to play a mythological or historical role in painting. However, Stevens showed them as precious objects in richly decorated environments.https://www.kmska.be/nl/collectie/highlights/Parijse_sfinks.html His paintings, in which he usually depicted lone women, are often a confluence of individual portraitures and types. Individual women disappeared behind their fashionable clothes and stereotypical attitudes. It gave his paintings a hint of theatricality and false sensibility. The female models of Stevens' paintings were described by Joris-Karl Huysmans as des petites femmes, qui ne sont plus des flamandes et qui ne seront jamais des Parisiennes. The graceful postures and elegant bodies are French , yet the women are more reminiscent of (stereotypical) Flanders. Stevens' characters often have strong facial features with a wide chin and short, sturdy arms and hands. In 1863 Stevens was made a Knight of the Legion of Honor . A year later, Gustave Moreau achieved great success at the Paris Salon with his mythological Oedipus and the Sphinx. He painted the sphinx as a monster with a lion's body and a woman's head and breasts. The sphinx was a very popular topos, one of the most common symbols of lust in the nineteenth century. In 1884 a friend of Steven's, the transgressive Baudelaire (who dedicated a poem to Stevens' brother Joseph and initially praised Alfred, although later, in an unpublished work, he condescendingly described him as a 'Flemish painter' because of the Flemings' excellence in the imitation of nature) opposed the neoclassicism paradigm and defended his transgressive decadentism, stating: \\"Littérature de décadence! Paroles vides de sens que nous entendons souvent tomber, avec la sonorité d’un bâillement emphatique, de la bouche de ces sphinx sans énigme qui veillent devant les portes saintes de l’Esthétique classique\\" 1867 was a successful year for Stevens: at the World Exhibition of that year he was given a separate room in which he could hang eighteen paintings; he was appointed to the Legion of Honor by Emperor Napoleon III , and imperial and royal orders poured in. The year before, he had been appointed an officer in the Order of Leopold . His group of friends included Eugène Delacroix (who attended his wedding in 1858), Alexandre Dumas Jr. , Edouard Manet , James Abbott McNeill Whistler and Émile Zola.Leen de Jong, in Het Museumboek. Hoogtepunten uit de verzameling, 2003, p. 142; Leen de Jong, in Openbaar Kunstbezit Vlaanderen 1971, p. 4-4b. His contemporaries praised him, with the poet Robert de Montesquiou calling him le sonnettiste de la peinture. After 1870, Stevens' popularity diminished, with Baudelaire, whose conferences in Belgium and travel to the Netherlands had turned into a fiasco, writing of him in the discriminatory and anti-BelgianPauvre Belgique: \\"Le grand malheur de ce peintre minutieux, c ’est que la lettre, le bouquet, la chaise, la bague, la guipure, etc ..... deviennent, tour à tour, l’objet important, l’objet qui crève les yeux. — En somme, c ’est un peintre parfaitement flamand, en tant qu ’il y ait de la perfection dans le néant, ou dans l’imitation de la nature, ce qui est la même chose.\\"Leen de Jong, in Het Museumboek. Hoogtepunten uit de verzameling, 2003, p. 142. Beside being renowned for its realism, the Parisian Sphinx has been described as enigmatic, with most critics pointing to the femme-fatale figure, and the hidden dangers beyond feminine tenderness.Topstukken, 2007.De Parijse sfinks op kmska.be; Leen de Jong, in Het Museumboek. Hoogtepunten uit de verzameling, 2003, p. 142. Description The Sphinx, a young woman depicted frontally, appears as a tender girl lost in thought. She has her hair arranged nicely and is neatly dressed. She wears an airy, elegant, white muslin robe with faint blue, red and yellow flowers. She wears a fur scarf around her neck and a black tulle scarf partly covers her left arm. She tilts her head slightly and gracefully brings her fingers to her lips. She radiates grace and youthful freshness at the same time, with the nonchalance of bourgeois romanticism.Jan Lea Broeckx in Musea van België. Koninklijk Museum voor Schone Kunsten te Antwerpen. Moderne meesters, 1958, nr. 5. Stevens painted a neutral brown background with neither objects nor attributes. Contrary to what the name suggests, no dead men, weapons or even mythological symbols are on display. The young lady that Alfred Stevens painted in his Parisian Sphinx is enigmatic, and quite different from the kind of ladies he usually depicted, in their richly appointed interiors, full of frills and ornaments. The viewer is left wondering: Who is she? What riddles does she have to tell? With the title merely adding to the mystery.Christien Oele, in Fatale vrouwen. 1860-1910, 2003, p. 158; Leen de Jong, in Openbaar Kunstbezit Vlaanderen 1971, p. 4-4b. Supporting her head slightly, the young woman stares dreamily in front of her in the direction of the viewer.Christien Oele, in Fatale vrouwen. 1860-1910, 2003, p. 158; Jan Lea Broeckx in Musea van België. Koninklijk Museum voor Schone Kunsten te Antwerpen. Moderne meesters, 1958, nr. 5. There is something inscrutable about it, something the viewer can keep speculating about. By calling her a 'sphinx,' Stevens reinforced the hint of mystery that surrounds the apparent realism of an ordinary Parisian bourgeois lady's depiction.Christien Oele, in Fatale vrouwen. 1860-1910, 2003, p. 158; Topstukken, 2007. In The Parisian Sphinx, Stevens renounces the narrative aspect that characterizes his other paintings so strongly. It is also a work in which his interest in luminism comes to the fore. By aiming an invisible, oblique light source on the woman's head, he builds a poetic wreath around her face.Leen de Jong, in Moderne Meesters in het Koninklijk Museum, 1992, nr. 6. In his painting style and color, enlivened by luminism, the influence of young impressionism is clear. His usual smooth way of painting gives way to a refined tendency towards suggestion. Art historians place the color distribution in this work among Stevens' most painterly achievements. The fresh hues of the dress and the soft glow of the Sphinx's young skin are enhanced by the brown background. They also break the static character of the figure.Leen de Jong, in Openbaar Kunstbezit Vlaanderen 1971, p. 4-4b; Jan Lea Broeckx in Musea van België. Koninklijk Museum voor Schone Kunsten te Antwerpen. Moderne meesters, 1958, nr. 5; Topstukken, 2007. Meaning Detail of the Sphinx's mouth In The Parisian Sphinx, Stevens turns a young bourgeoise into a mysterious and sensual apparition. A femme fatale. The contrast between tenderness and beauty and hidden danger in the girl, is paralleled by the dualistic nature of the painting, with its immediate, eye-pleasing realism against its hidden Symbolism. Stevens usually portrayed contemporary women purely as seductive subjects, although they had been traditionally given historical or mythological roles in painting. By contrast, according to Kathrin Hoffmann-Curtis, in this painting Stevens encoded his supposedly realistic portrait with the danger of the mythological figure. Stevens used hidden signs in a discerning way similar to Dante Gabriel Rossetti's in Bocca Baciata. Since the mid-19th century, Pre-Raphaelite and Symbolist artists had been employing literary metaphors wherein femininity covertly represented love and death. Stevens on his part portrayed his Parisian Sphinx as cuddly, dreamy and mind-wandering. The gaze of the viewer is drawn to the woman's mouth, whose redness corresponds to the red fingernails of the young lady's long white hand. Stevens draws attention to the mouth, which was considered the central female sexual organ. Some features of the painting are reminiscent of Rossetti's Bocca Baciata, where the mouth functions as \\"the classic fetish object that by recalling breast-feeding and sexuality, suggests the possibilities of pleasure, fear and loss.\\" The fur scarf barely discernible from her hair and contrasting with the softness of her muslin dress, reminds of the animality of the Sphinx. The whole picture is balanced between melancholy, childlike reflection, and dangerous beauty.

The violence reportedly started as scuffles and agitations between the supporters of Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi (VCK) and the members of Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK) along with the members of Hindu Munnani, which reportedly led to violence by the members of the PMK on a Dalit colony. Many Dalit houses were damaged and Dalits were assaulted during the violence. Tensions started during the polling for the 2019 Indian general election where some members of the Hindu Munnani reportedly broke a pot which is the election symbol of the VCK and when some members of the PMK reportedly prevented an elderly Dalit person to vote in the elections. These tensions led to scuffles and stone pelting between the two parties. Later a mob of 100 people reportedly belonging to the PMK went on to attack the Dalit colony, damaging Dalit owned houses, house hold items and vehicles and assaults against the Dalits including attacks against the women and children. There were also reports of sexual assaults on Dalit women. According to various reports 60 - 115 houses belonging to the Dalits were damaged or destroyed. The Study carried out by the Madras Institute of Development Studies (MIDS) blamed the Hindu Munnani and the PMK for the Violence. MIDS also reported that the attack was \\"pre-planned and murderous\\".  Background  The village of Ponparappi is situated in the Ariyalur district of the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. The village had over 300 families belonging to the Dalit community and 1000 families belonging to the Vanniyar caste. The Dalits also had to cross into the area of the upper caste Vanniyars for Swachh Bharat and Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) schemes. The Hindu Munnani, a Hindutva outfit, had grew in popularity among the upper caste Vanniyars owing to the presence of Christians among the Scheduled Caste population. = Election violations = Frequent violent incidents, repeated casting of votes, mass deletion of names of voters and such were recorded on polling day from several parts of the State. In the Dharmapuri lok sabha constituency's Nathamedu village in Pappireddipatti, men reportedly belong to the PMK were seen casting fraudulent votes. A security officer of the CISF at Keezhvisharam in Vellore fired shots in the air to break two different groups of party members engaging in fist fights.  Tensions  Tensions reportedly began when some people belonging to the upper caste community tried to prevent an elderly person to vote, the person voted with the help of the police and when members of the Hindu Munnani shattered an earthen pot under alcoholic influence at the front of the panchyat office where the polling took place for the 2019 Indian general election. The earthen pot was the election symbol of the Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi. The MIDS reported that the PMK spread a fake news claiming that some youth from the Secluded Caste Colony attacked an individual belonging to the upper caste community, who used to sell alcohol in the region. The animosity between the two parties intensified, leading to scuffles, stone pelting and damaging of the VCK party flag on the road side.  Attacks  The attacks started on April 2018 when a mob of about 100 upper caste members, reportedly belonging the PMK party, an ally of the AIADMK and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), entered the Dalit colony on the polling day of the 2019 Indian general election and went on a rampage attacking the Dalits including the children and women and damaging motor bikes. The violence lasted for an hour and left 2 Vanniyars and 16 Dalits injured. Nearly 65 houses and 12 two-wheelers were reportedly damaged as per initial reports. Over 100 people had abstained from voting as a result of the attack, though some Dalit students who graduated classes 10th and 12th did not go to get their certificates since their schools were located in the Vanniyar region. = Investigations = The Madras Institute of Developmental Studies (MIDS) carried out a study on April 25 which reported that the PMK and the Hindu Munnani were responsible for the attacks. The team also reported that the Dalit women were pulled out of their homes, and were verbally and sexually abused by the assilants. While women pleaded them to leave, the assailants proceeded to abuse the women. The team also termed the violence as \\"preconceived and murderous\\". Evidence, a rights organization based in Madurai, which conducted an evaluation on the spot and reported that 115 houses had been damaged and 25 among them were completely damaged, 13 people were hospitalized and many sustained injuries to the head. The organization reported that the attackers have used derogatory language against women and victims. The founder of the organization, Kathir reported that the residents of the Dalit colony voted overwhelmingly for the VCK, which angered the PMK and led to the violence. The organization also requested to call the National Human Rights Commission of India (NHRC) instead of allowing the police to investigate the violence.  Arrests  25 cases were filed against the members of the Hindu Munnani and the PMK by the police which included a member of the Hindu Munnani who was also accused in the 2016 Ariyalur gang rape case.The police also filed 24 cases against the Dalits as counter FIR's to force them to come into terms. After the violence 9 men belonging to the VCK were also arrested for circulating offensive audio related to the violence.  Political reactions  The fact-finding team of the Tamil Nadu state unit of the Congress SC and ST cell reported that the police officers stayed as a silent spectator as of the upper caste group targeted Dalits and their properties. They also claimed that the PMK and the Hindu Munnani were responsible for the violence. The Party's general secretary K. Jeyakumar, said that violence happens only in the areas where the PMK is in the majority. The Amma Makkal Munnetra kazhagam (AMMK) general secretary TTV Dinakaran also blamed the police for failing to prevent the attack. The PMK asserted that the conflict on the day of polling was staged by the VCK to frame the PMK. M K Stalin, the president of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhgam condemned the violence and also urged the Chief Electoral Officer and DGP for Election to take measures to develop the people into fraternity. Thol Thirumavalavan, the general secretary of the VCK blamed the PMK and the Hindu Munnani for the violence and also said that the AIADMK and BJP have unleashed violence in various places for fear of losing the elections in Tamil Nadu. In particular, the PMK is inciting caste-based violence to win the polls. He also stated that he would seek for a re-poll and said that 150 homes were damaged during the violence. He also said that the police remained as a mute spectators. Vaiko of the Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam condemned the violence and also blamed the police for failing to stop the violence. Kamal Haasan compared the violence with his delayed drama Marudhanayagam which talks about caste violence 300 years ago. He also said that the violence is a shame to the entire Tamil race.

The museum opened in the former Grey County Council Chambers in 1996, but the building was deemed unsafe in the event of an earthquake and forced to close in 2017. A new home for the collection is being sought.  Origins  History House Museum was housed in the former Grey County Council Chambers at 27 Gresson Street, Greymouth. The Grey County Council was formed in 1877, and built the Grey County Council Chambers in 1924. In 1989 the building was vacated when the County Council amalgamated with the boroughs of Greymouth and Runanga and the Greymouth Harbour Board to form the Grey District Council. The project to turn the empty building into a history museum was instigated by former deputy mayor Kevin Brown, Mayor of Grey Ron Hibbs, and Kevin Beams of Grey District Council. Kevin Brown recruited volunteers from the Lions, family, and local community to fit out the building and assemble a collection. The museum opened in 1996, with Brown as manager. When Brown was elected Mayor in 1998, volunteer Bob Naisbitt took over the running of the museum, along with assistant historian Margaret Mort. Volunteers Jack Flood (left) and George Gardner apply a paint job to the Standard Austin-Western Grader outside History House Museum. The Grey County Council purchased the grader in 1920 for £225. In February 2017 a seismic assessment of the Grey County Council Chambers found it was at only 10 per cent of the new building standard (NBS), well below the 34 per cent required for a public building; the standards had been revised following the 2010–2011 Christchurch earthquakes. The cost to strengthen the building would be $142,000, and it is in a flood zone. The museum was closed and the archives moved to the Grey District Library. Several options were pursued: eventually incorporating the museum into a \\"Discovery Centre\\", disbanding the collection, or moving to another space – the former Dick Smith premises at 130 Mackay Street at a cost of $50,000/year – in conjunction with an iSite visitor centre. The location of the museum (at the other end of town from the railway station where most tourists arrived) and the lack of signage were blamed for the low visitor numbers: about 6–8 people a day. The Greymouth iSite manager Phil Barnett claimed tourists were simply not interested in its collections. In any event the Protected Objects Act and Public Records Act required the collection to be catalogued before moving, at a cost of over $100,000. One consultant suggested the bulk of the collection was not \\"of sufficient merit\\" to be archived. The archives at the museum also needed to be properly stored; the Council Chambers are unsuitable and in a flood zone. There is no regional archive on the West Coast, although Shantytown near Greymouth had offered to host one. James Tunnicliffe cleaning the gold-mining Kershaw Pump outside History House Museum After a stocktake of the collection, items relevant to other West Coast districts were sent to the Hokitika Museum and Coaltown Museum. The museum operated from a pop-up space in the former Dick Smith premises, operating Wednesday to Sunday afternoons from 20 December 2017. The space had to close in July 2018 but had 1200 visitors in the first month and 9000 visitors in total, compared to the 1200 visitors a year at its former home. In September 2018, the Council budgeted $140,000 to strengthen the Gresson Street building, but resolved to move the museum to a new discovery centre combining a library and museum some time in the future. The cost to reopen History House was estimated at $455,000, and just to make the building safe would be $170,000: even strengthened the former Council building would still have problems with climate control, fire safety, and storage. The former manager Kevin Brown took back his extensive photograph collection in protest at the lack of progress in strengthening the building. In 2020 the building was emptied and the collection moved into two climate- controlled shipping containers at a cost of $90,000.

He was the first person to be put on retrial following the result of a DNA test, which again resulted in a conviction by the Supreme Court of Israel.  Biography  Born in Romania in 1948, Schwartz was first convicted of sexual offences in 1969, receiving a 14-year prison term, but served only nine years before he was released in 1978. Not long after, he became an active member of several chess clubs and participated in backgammon competitions, quickly achieving the rank of champion in the former, and was a senior candidate for a chessmaster. In the early 1990s, Schwartz was rearrested after he was accused of several rapes, of which he would be convicted of only one and sentenced to 20 years imprisonment. Through his trial, he professed his innocence and claimed that this was only because of his previous convictions. Since his conviction, Schwartz has worked from prison to prove his innocence in a long series of motions and appeals, as well as initiating legal proceedings, one of which resulted in a retrial. Although he is a convicted sex offender with problematic behavior, it was deduced that law enforcement agencies had conducted suspiciously in his case, raising doubts from judges and public figures. Among his supporters are Prof. Kenneth Mann, the founder and first Chief Public Defender of Israel's Public Defense, and Prof. Mordechai Kremnitzer, a criminal expert who teaches law at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.  Court proceedings  In February 1991, Schwartz was charged in the Tel Aviv District Court with seven counts of rape and indecent assaults on children, although authorities suspected the true number was double that amount. The main evidence was based on identifications from a police lineup. The panel of judges, headed by Justice Amnon Straschnov, acquitted him in five of these cases, after it was determined that there were errors in the identification, and they couldn't be used as evidence. In the remaining two cases, he was convicted and sentenced to 25 years imprisonment. In 1995, after an appeal to the Supreme Court, he was acquitted of another rape case, after it was determined it was wrongful too. The sole remaining case had occurred in Jerusalem, while the others were in the Central District. According to the verdict, Schwartz preyed upon an 11-year-old girl returning home from a public library, and on various pretexts, lured her to a dark shelter, where he raped her while threatening her with a knife. The girl later recognized Schwartz from photos presented to her, and also identified his wallet. This identification and additional circumstantial evidence provided by the prosecution led to his conviction. Among other things, he refused to give blood and semen samples, rationalizing that the investigating authorities would skew the findings to worsen his condition. In this case, the conviction remained unchanged, but his sentence was reduced to 20 years imprisonment. Schwartz's request for another hearing on his appeal was denied. In 1997, the Supreme Court reviewed his request for an appeal which, according to him, had the power to point out his innocence, but was withheld by the Criminal Department. In the end, the request was denied. In 2002, Schwartz petitioned the Tel Aviv District Court to be released on parole, to seek medical attention to reduce his risky behavior, but it was denied.  DNA testing  In 1996, Prof. Mann was informed that the possibility of comparing blood samples would exonerate the convict. He persuaded Adrian to agree to provide blood samples, and appealed to the Supreme Court to order an examination whose results could lead to Schwartz's acquittal. The court denied the request, but instead allowed a DNA exam to link some semen found at the crime and compare it. Schwartz initially refused the test, arguing that police would compromise the results, but three years later, when he agreed, the prosecution refused on the grounds that the matter had been exhausted on all instances, and the Supreme Court was required to rule. In June 2001, Justice Mishael Cheshin ruled that Schwartz's request should be denied, but due to the state's consent, an examination would be conducted by the Abu Kabir Forensic Institute. The findings of the initial tests were inconclusive, and the Supreme Court ruled for supplementary tests. In 2004, after they were completed, Dr. Maya Freund concluded that the girl's genetic profile and that of an unidentified male couldn't be positively linked to Adrian Schwartz. During the hearings, she retracted her previous statements, saying that there had been a technical error, correcting that, based on the results, \\"it cannot be ruled out that this is Schwartz's DNA\\". At the hearings, another new piece of evidence was presented which, ostensibly, casted doubt on the conviction. In September 2005, and after two more crucial witnesses were brought on Schwartz's behalf, Justice Edmond Levy ruled that \\"the existence of a retrial in the applicant's case is warranted by the new evidence before the court, which, if accepted as credible, may change the outcome in his favor.\\" In 2005, the new trial began in the Tel Aviv District Court, and after four years, in June 2009, he was convicted a second time. Schwartz appealed to the Supreme Court over his conviction, but it was denied, as well as his request for another hearing. In early September 2010, he was released from prison. The Tel Aviv District Court ruled that he should remain under house arrest and is prohibited from approaching any areas frequented by minors. In January 2019, Schwartz again filed a motion for a retrial, which was denied. Supreme Court outcomes * TF (Tel Aviv District) 170/91 State of Israel v. Adrian Schwartz, given January 27, 1992.

He is the founder and CEO of Shaviv Strategy and Campaigns, an international political consulting firm that is based in Israel. Shaviv served as the campaign manager of Benjamin Netanyahu’s 2015 election campaign and advised David Cameron in the 2015 UK general election as well as President Aleksandar Vucic in the 2017 Serbian Presidential elections. According to his company's website, his clients have included the presidents and prime ministers of Thailand, Cambodia, Poland, Romania, Kenya, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Serbia, and the European Commission.  Early life and career  Shaviv was born in 1979 in Oxford, UK and spent most of his childhood in Canada and Australia. He immigrated to Israel in 1996 where he enlisted in the Israel Defense Forces and rose to the rank of captain. After serving in the military for nine years, he worked for political consultant Arthur Finkelstein. From October 2005 through May 2006, Shaviv served as a political advisor to the Yisrael Beiteinu party ahead of the general election in Israel that was held on May 28, 2006. He then founded the Shaviv Strategy and Campaigns consulting firm. Political projects  Shaviv is reported to have worked on presidential, parliamentary, and municipal campaigns in the US and UK as well as across Europe, Asia, and Africa. In 2012, Shaviv served as campaign strategist for iVoteIsrael, an organization that encouraged American citizens living in Israel to register for and vote in the 2012 US presidential elections. In 2015, as campaign manager to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Shaviv formulated the winning strategy for the Likud party in the 2015 Israeli legislative elections. He also advised UK Prime Minister David Cameron in the UK general election that year. In December 2015, Shaviv played a key role in lobbying the government of Slovakia to grant asylum to 149 Iraqi Christian refugees. In 2017, he advised the successful campaign of President Aleksandar Vucic in the Serbian presidential elections. Cambodian poll documents also showed that Shaviv advised Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen ahead of the 2018 Cambodian general elections. In 2019, Shaviv Strategy and Campaigns advised the successful election campaign of President Zuzana Caputova in the 2019 Slovak presidential elections.  Controversies  In 2012, Shaviv served as campaign strategist for iVoteIsrael, an organization that encouraged American citizens living in Israel to register for and vote in the 2012 US presidential elections. The campaign was funded by a nonprofit called Americans for Jerusalem, a 501(c)(4) organization. Although the organization’s tax status required it to be nonpartisan, Shaviv admitted that its funders included the “Sheldon Adelsons of the world,” and reports linked it to Ronald Lauder as well. A subsequent audit by the Internal Revenue Service determined that iVoteIsrael did meet the non-partisan standards of a 501(c)(4) organization. In 2016, Shaviv was hired by the Montenegrin Democratic Front party to serve as a consultant for the 2016 Montenegrin parliamentary elections. The election was shrouded by accusations by Montenegro’s chief special prosecutor of a coup attempt to assassinate the prime minister over his government’s attempt to join NATO. As part of the investigation into the plot, a group of 20 Serbian and Montenegrin citizens, including a former Serbian special police forces commander and pro-Russian rebel fighters in eastern Ukraine, were arrested on election day. While two Democratic Front leaders, Andrija Mandic and Milan Knezevic, were given sentences of up to five years, they denounced the verdicts and claimed along with all the opposition parties that the coup attempt was staged by the Montenegrin government as a publicity stunt to improve its electoral results. In 2017, Shaviv was linked to a political survey conducted on behalf of the ruling party of Cambodia, CPP, ahead of the 2018 Cambodian general elections. The leaked findings from the survey were listed in emails that apparently showed correspondence between Cambodian Finance Minister Aun Porn Moniroth and Shaviv.  Awards  In 2011, Shaviv received Campaigns and Elections Magazine's Rising Star award for his work for a Slovak candidate whom he helped achieve victory after polling 40 points behind the incumbent less than two months prior to the election. In 2012, he won Campaigns and Elections Magazine's Best International Campaign Award. In 2016, he won the International Consultant of the Year Award from the American Association of Political Consultants (AAPC). AAPC President Mark Mellman also awarded him a Pollie Award for the \\"Bibi-sitter\\" ad in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's 2015 campaign.

It is one of only two recreation areas in British Columbia, the other being Coquihalla Summit Recreation Area. Description The recreation area features a public beach, a section of the Great Trail of Canada, and a historic railway bridge that has since been converted for pedestrian use. Recreational facilities include a vehicle-accessible campsite complex, pit toilets, running water, picnic tables, and fire pits. Hiking and inner tubing are popular summertime activities at this park. The recreation area also protects a collection of old growth cottonwood and dry ponderosa pine-bunchgrass plant communities. History In 1887, gold and silver were discovered in the region, causing thousands of American miners to flood the region in search of it. In response, the governments of British Columbia and Canada sponsored the construction of the Kettle Valley Railway to better link the region to the rest of the province. Due to the challenging topography of the region, construction of the railway took nearly 20 years, by which time the gold and silver rush had largely subsided. The railway operated through the river valley from 1915 to 1973. Between 1979 and 1980, the railway tracks between Midway and Penticton was removed. The abandoned right-of-way would later be reused as part of the Great Trail of Canada.

She was the first woman to be awarded a Doctorate by the University of Porto in Portugal. Education Leopoldina Ferreira Paulo' was born in the parish of Vitória in the city of Porto in Portugal on 12 January 1908. She completed high school with distinction in 1928. She then attended the Faculty of Sciences of the University of Porto between 1928 and 1933, graduating in Historical-Natural Sciences. While taking this degree she completed a qualification as a teacher of drawing and, more or less simultaneously, studied a range of transdisciplinary subjects including Aesthetics and Art History at the Faculty of Letters of the University (19301931), as well as Figure Drawing, Statue Drawing, Living Model Drawing, Ornate Drawing, Modelling and Styling at the School of Fine Arts of the University (19311933). She also took exams in the subjects of General Mathematics and Descriptive Geometry. During the first Portuguese colonial exhibition and World’s Fair, held in Porto in 1934, Paulo worked under the direction of Prof. António Mendes Correia to present scientific investigations of Indians in Portuguese colonies. She also took part in the first National Congress of Colonial Anthropology (Porto, 1934) where she presented, in collaboration with Drª Emília Duarte de Oliveira, a paper on “Anthropometric Canons of Indigenous Women of the Colonies”. Paulo then taught in the city of Guimarães during the academic year 193334 before enrolling in and completing a Pedagogical Sciences Course at the Faculty of Arts of the University of Coimbra, Portugal’s oldest university. She also taught in private secondary education, in Porto, between 1935 and 1942, while studying for a Doctorate and carrying out other functions within the university. She became assistant professor of anthropology at the Faculty of Sciences of Porto, in 1935. In 1944, she became the first woman to obtain a Doctorate from the University of Porto, after defending a thesis entitled “Some morphological characters of the hand in the Portuguese”. She received widespread publicity in the press for her achievement. However, in an academic atmosphere that remained prejudiced against women, her attempts to secure a permanent staff position at the university were not successful until 1970. She retired in 1976, one year after obtaining tenure. Career Paulo became a member of the Sociedade Portuguesa de Antropologia e Etnologia (SPAE – Portuguese Society of Anthropology and Ethnology), which was based at the University of Porto and regularly organized scientific meetings and published a journal. Unlike many similar societies, the SPAE was noted for welcoming women as members. The SPAE was for a time oriented towards physical or biological anthropology, under the influence of its founder, António Mendes Correia (1888 - 1960), as opposed to social or cultural anthropology. This tendency is reflected in the fieldwork of Paulo, as indeed it was in the subject of her Doctoral thesis. Research and publications Throughout her academic career, Paulo carried out anthropological research on the peoples of what were at the time Portuguese colonies, under the direction of Mendes Correia. She participated in an Anthropological and Ethnological Mission to Guinea (1946-1947) and was also involved in the work of the Junta de Investigações do Ultramar (Overseas Investigation Board) of the Ministry of the Colonies (Junta do Ultramar) of the authoritarian Estado Novo government. In the 1950s and 1960s she received several scholarships from German institutions. She published numerous scientific works, including: * Contribuição para o estudo da pigmentação dos portugueses. 1940. (Contribution to the study of pigmentation in the Portuguese) * Restos humanos pré- históricos do Monte de Pedrogal. 1940.

The first accident occurred when a Cessna F172M Skyhawk aircraft, with four on board, crashed into the heath. The second accident occurred when a Sikorsky HH-3E Jolly Green Giant rescue helicopter of the 67th Aerospace Rescue and Recovery Squadron United States Air Force (USAF), from the Iceland Defense Force at Naval Air Station Keflavik, crashed with three of the injured from the previous accident, two Icelandic doctors and a five man U.S. crew shortly after takeoff from the first crash site. The accidents On 18 December 1979, a Cessna 172 aircraft, with registration number TF-EKK, took off from Reykjavík Airport with a French pilot, a New Zealander and two Finnish girls who worked as physiotherapists in Reykjalundur, on a sight-seeing tour around Gullfoss and Þingvellir. On its way back it crashed in heavy fog on the Mosfellsheiði heath. At around 15:20, the plane was reported missing and a signal from its emergency transmitter was detected. Shortly afterwards, a search plane discovered the wreckage on the heath, a short distance south of Þingvallarvegur, where it had broken up and turned upside down. A helicopter from the Defense Force at Keflavík Airport that happened to be on a training mission nearby went to the scene and transported the New Zealander to Reykjavík, while leaving two crew members to attend to the other occupants, whose injuries were more severe, and wait for the Icelandic SAR teams who arrived shortly later. After taking two doctors from Borgarspítalinn, fuel and offloading two of its crewmembers, the helicopter returned to the scene of the accident to pick up the Finns and the French pilot. Shortly after the helicopter took off again from the scene of the accident, it lost power and crashed to the ground several hundred meters from the wreckage of the Cessna. Rescuers, including photographer Ragnar Axelsson, rushed to the second crash site and where confronted with the mangled remains of the helicopter and Kerosene fumes filling the air. A 19-year old SAR member, Hallgrímur Skúli Karlsson, who was one of the first at the scene managed to prevent a fire in the wreckage by cutting main power of the helicopter. After the second accident, the injured were transported about 1-1.5 km to ambulances that took them to Borgarspítali. Aftermath In the aftermath of the accidents, the lack of equipment of the SAR-units was criticised, especially its lack of two-way radios which was largely a result of the Icelandic goverments tariffs that doubled its prices.

It is produced by LZ Design d.o.o. in Logatec, Slovenia. The system uses a 22 kW compact outrunner brushless DC electric motor located in the nose of sailplane. Power is provided by two lithium-ion battery packs. Lighter gliders are able to self-launch with FES. Heavier gliders can use it as a sustainer system, i.e. climb and cruise sufficiently high and far to avoid an out-landing. Although gliders with FES have a shorter range (70-100 km) under power than gliders with two-stroke gasoline sustainer engines (10 litres at 8.5 L/h at 100 km/h = 120 km) or jet sustaining engines (150-200 km), the electric motor can be expected to start reliably provided there is sufficient energy in the batteries. The one metre diameter propeller is made of carbon fibre and folds across the nose. It opens using centrifugal force when rotation starts. Each propeller blade weighs 260 grams. They are slightly bent to take the shape of the front surface of the fuselage of each type of glider to which they are fitted. Unlike some electric gliders such as the Lange Antares and Schleicher AS 34Me, the batteries can be removed from the glider for charging off-site. No power supply is needed near the glider itself. The two battery packs each contain 28 Kokam lithium polymer cells. The cells are wired in serial and operates at a voltage range of 90-116V. The two packs contain a total of 4.2kWh of energy. Each pack weighs 15.7kg and are mounted a reinforced area in the fuselage behind the wings. This configuration balances the weight of the motor and propeller. Reinforced carrying cases are used to transport the battery packs to a location where they can be charged. More than 240 gliders of eleven different types, from seven manufacturers are already equipped with this system. * Schempp-Hirth Ventus 3 and its predecessor Schempp-Hirth Ventus 2 * Schempp-Hirth Discus 2 * DG Flugzeugbau DG-1000 * Rolladen-Schneider LS8 * LAK-17 and Mini-LAK * HPH 304 * Diana Sailplanes Diana * Alisport Silent 2 * Albastar AS References External links *LZ Design web-site Category:Electric motors Category:Slovenian brands Category:Electric aircraft ","title":"Front electric sustainer"},{"id":"65241816","text":"Jinhua station can refer to: *Jinhua station (Chengdu Metro), a metro station in Chengdu, China *Jinhua railway station, a railway station in Jinhua, China ","title":"Jinhua station"},{"id":"65241821","text":"Brian John Bluck (29 August 1935 – 29 June 2015) was a Welsh geologist, academic author and professor of sedimentation and tectonics at the University of Glasgow.

This lies in the much disputed Danzig corridor where ownership has frequently passed between Germany and Poland. He would have spoken both German and Polish. He was a member of the Krakow Astronomical Society. In 1830/31 he and his whole family took arms in a local fight for independence from Germany and recognition of their Polish identity. His father was a Captain in this resistance movement.Homeopathy in 1851: J R Russell Initially studying Science at Krakow University and Bonn University under a false (German) name, he obtained a PhD at the University of Berlin in 1837. Originally intending to stay in Krakow his role in the 1830 rebellion was exposed and he was imprisoned in Krakow. He escaped and managed to evade capture in a 900km cross country trip to Hamburg. In 1839 he left Germany with his older brother Severin Wielobycki, sailing from Hamburg to Leith. He initially made a living teaching French (which was more in demand than Polish or German. In 1841 he enrolled at Edinburgh University with his brother, both studying Medicine. They received their doctorate (MD) in 1843 and his brother left to Canada soon thereafter (but returned to Britain and worked in London). His dissertation was on \\"plica polonica\\". From 1843 to 1845 he was assistant surgeon at the Royal Maternity Hospital. He was created a Licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh (LRCPE). He was then living at 35 York Place, Edinburgh.Edinburgh Post Office Directory 1845 He decided to focus in the field of homeopathy and joined Drs Francis Black and John Rutherford Russell in the Stockbridge Homeopathic Dispensary. Up to this time he was living at a flat at 25 Montagu Street in the south of the city. Immediately successful as a homeopath, in 1850 he took premises at 59 Queen Street, Edinburgh, one of the best addresses in the city, standing on a prominent corner.Edinburgh Post Office Directory 1850 Sadly in 1852 Edinburgh medical society rallied against him and he and his brother Severin were stripped of their Licentiate.Medical Times vol 25 (1852) He moved to a slightly smaller ground floor and basement house at 55 Queen Street in 1855. He appears to have had many affluent clients in Edinburgh's New Town and his stealing of wealthy clients from the Edinburgh medical establishment continued as a friction. In 1856 he was charged with forging the will of a patient and making himself the beneficiary. This concerned the Darling family of Portobello. Thomas Darling had left his estate to his sisters: Margaret and Isabella. Wiebolycki in conspiracy with Isabella forged a will of Margaret (who died a few months after Thomas). He had already got Isabella to leave her estate to him. The crime, whilst proven, was somewhat futile as Isabella would have inherited from Margaret with or without a will. The sum concerned was £1200. He was found guilty and sentenced to be transported to Australia for 14 years. Going into hiding in England he was apprehended on 28 November 1856. He spent time in various prisons: Wakefield Prison, Lewes Prison and the infamous Dartmoor Prison where he spent from July 1859 until February 1862.Annual Register of the Scottish High Court Jan 1857 He was then released after appeal to the Old Bailey, his defence being led by the Dean of Faculty of Scotland himself.Dramatic Days at the Old Bailey S Paul 1929 In 1862 he was living in Leicester and running a homeopathic clinic there on Granby Street. From 1871 until death he was living at 3 George Square, Edinburgh.Edinburgh Post Office Directory 1880 In 1881 he got back in the news: suing Isaac Atkinson,BMY vol 2, 1882 an affluent tailor living at 12 St Andrew Square in the city centre.Edinburgh Post Office Directory 1881 Atkinson was obliged to return £107 to the doctor. He died in Edinburgh on 16 November 1882 and is buried in Grange Cemetery in the south of the city. The grave lies in an obscured location backing onto the south side of the central vaults on their east side. Family In 1871, shortly before return to Edinburgh, he married Henrietta Felicia Kierblewska Kennedy (\\"Lady Felice\\") of 5 Eldon Place in Bradford. She was the daughter of Stephen Kennedy Esq. After his death his wife styled herself \\"Baroness Wielobycka\\" and married a Dr Robert MacHardy LLD, the organist at Edinburgh Cathedral. They travelled around Europe. However their lavish lifestyle exhausted their funds. She was forced to sell 3 George Square to pay debts and they lived then in humble house at Lesmahagow before final years in a cottage (\\"hut\\") on Whitehill Close near Chapel farm in the parish of Strathaven.

The biocuration of biomedical knowledge is made possible by the cooperative work of biocurators, software developers and bioinformaticians.  Biocuration as a profession  A biocurator is a professional scientist who curates, collects, annotates, and validates information that is disseminated by biological and model organism databases. It is a new profession, with the first mention in the scientific literature dating of 2006. The role of a biocurator encompasses quality control of primary biological research data intended for publication, extracting and organizing data from original scientific literature, and describing the data with standard annotation protocols and vocabularies that enable powerful queries and biological database interoperability. Biocurators communicate with researchers to ensure the accuracy of curated information and to foster data exchanges with research laboratories. The University of Cambrigdge and the EMBL-EBI jointly offer a Postgraduate Certificate in Biocuration, considered as a step towards recognising biocuration as a discipline on its own.  Curation and annotation  Biocuration is the integration of biological information into on-line databases in a semantically standardized way, using appropriate unique traceable identifiers, and providing necessary metadata including source and provenance. = Ontologies, controlled vocabularies and standard names = Biocurators commonly employ and take part in the creation and development of shared biomedical ontologies: structured, controlled vocabularies that encompass many biological and medical knowledge domains, such as the Open Biomedical Ontologies. These domains include genomics and proteomics, anatomy, animal and plant development, biochemistry, metabolic pathways, taxonomic classification, and mutant phenotypes. Given the variety of existing ontologies, there are guidelines that orient researchers on how to choose a suitable one. The Unified Medical Language System is one such systems that integrates and distributes millions of terms used in the life sciences domain. Biocurators enforce the consistent use of gene nomenclature guidelines and participate in the genetic nomenclature committees of various model organisms, often in collaboration with the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC). They also enforce other nomenclature guidelines like those provided by the Nomenclature Committee of the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (IUBMB), one example of which is the Enzyme Commission EC number. More generally, the use of persistent identifiers is praised by the community, so to improve clarity and facilitate knowledge = Entity annotation = In genome annotation for example, the identifiers defined by the ontologists and consortia are used to describe parts of the genome. For example, the gene ontology (GO) curates terms for biological processes, which are used to describe what we know about specific genes.Annotations of a biomedical text in the Europe PMC SciLite platform = Text annotation = Besides annotating biological sequences, biocurators also annotate texts, linking words to unique identifiers. This aids in disambiguation, clarifying the meaning intended, and making the texts processable by computers. One application of text annotation is to specify the exact gene a scientist is referring to. Publicly available text annotations make it possible to biologists to take further advantage of biomedical text. The Europe PMC has an Application Programming Interface which centralizes text annotations from a variety of sources and make them available in a Graphic User Interface called SciLite. The PubTator Central also provides annotations, but is fully based on computerized text-mining and does not provide an user interface. There are also programs that allow users to manually annotate the biomedical texts they are interested, such as the ezTag system. International Society for Biocuration (ISB) The International Society for Biocuration (ISB) is a non- profit organisation \\"promotes the field of biocuration and provides a forum for information exchange through meetings and workshops.\\" It has grown from the International Biocuration Conferences and founded in early 2009. The ISB offers the Biocuration Career Award to biocurators in the community: the Biocurator Career Award (given annually) and the ISB Award for Exceptional Contributions to Biocuration (given biannually).  Wikimedia  = Wikipedia = There is some overlap between the work of biocurators and Wikipedia, with boundaries between scientific databases and Wikipedia becoming increasingly blurred. Databases like Rfam and the Protein Data Bank for example make heavy use of Wikipedia and its editors to curate information. However, most databases offer highly structured data that is searchable in complex combinations, which is usually not possible on Wikipedia, although Wikidata aims at solving this problem to some extent. The Gene Wiki project used Wikipedia for collaborative curation of thousands of genes and gene products, such as titin and insulin. = Wikidata = The Wikimedia knowledge base Wikidata is increasingly being used by the biocuration community as an integrative repository across life sciences. For example, it has been used by the Gene Wiki project to curate information about genes. Community curation Traditionally, biocuration has been done by dedicated experts, which integrate data into databases. Community curation has emerged as a promising approach to improve the dissemination of knowledge from published data and provide a cost-effective way to improve the scalability of biocuration. =Biological databases= Community curation portal of WormBase Several biological databases include author contributions in their functional curation strategy to some extent, which may range from associating gene identifiers with publications or free-text, to more structured and detailed annotation of sequences and functional data, outputting curation to the same standards as professional biocurators. Most community curation at Model Organism Databases involves annotation by original authors of published research (first-pass annotation) to effectively obtain accurate identifiers for objects to be curated, or identify data-types for detailed curation. For example: * WormBase successfully solicits first-pass annotation from users and has integrated author curation with the micropublication process. WormBase also integrates text-mining to its platform, providing suggestions to community curators. * FlyBase sends email requests to authors of new publications, inviting them to list the genes and data types described via an online tool and has also mobilized the community to write gene summary paragraphs. Other databases, such as PomBase, rely on publication authors to submit highly detailed, ontology-based annotations for their publications, and meta-data associated with genome-wide data-sets using controlled vocabularies. A web-based tool Canto; was developed to facilitate community submissions. Since Canto is freely available, generic and highly configurable, it has been adopted by other projects. Curation is subjected to review by professional curators resulting in high quality in-depth curation of all molecular data- types. =Wiki-style resources= Bio-wikis rely on their communities to provide content. AuthorReward, for example, is an extension to MediaWiki that quantifies researchers' contributions to biowikis. RiceWiki was an example of a wiki-based database for community curation of rice genes equipped with AuthorReward. One notable example is WikiProteins/WikiProfessional, a project to semantically organize biological data led by Barend Mons. The 2007 project had direct contributions of Jimmy Wales, Wikipedia co-founder, and took Wikidata as an inspiration. Another one is WikiPathways, which crowdsources information about biological pathways. = Gamified resources= An approach to involve the crowd in biocuration is via gamified platforms that use game design principles to boost engagement. A few examples are: * Mark2Cure, a gamified platform for community curation of biomedical abstracts * Cochrane Crowd, a platform by Cochrane for curation of clinical trials and to categorize and summarize biomedical literature. Computational text mining for curation Natural-language processing and text mining technologies can help biocurators to extract of information for manual curation. Text mining can scale curation efforts, supporting the identification of gene names, for example, as well as for partially inferring ontologies. The popular NLP python package SpaCy has a modification for biomedical texts, SciSpaCy, which is maintained by the Allen Institute for AI. Among the challenges for text-mining applied to biocuration is the difficulty of acessing full texts of biomedical articles due to pay wall, linking the challenges of biocuration to those of the open-access movement. = Biocreative challenges = The interface between text-mining and biocuration has been propelled up by the BioCreAtIvE (Critical Assessment of Information Extraction systems in Biology)challenges, a series of text-mining competitions that ocurred for the first time in 2004.

He was rector of St. Philip's Episcopal Church in Harlem from 1933 to 1957. His father, Hutchens Chew Bishop, served as rector of the same church from 1886 to 1933. At age seven, Bishop entered the service of St. Philip's as an acolyte. After receiving his Bachelor of Arts degree from Columbia University in 1911 and graduating from General Theological Seminary, he was ordained deacon in 1914. He then became curate at St. Thomas' Church, Chicago, where he was ordained to the priesthood a year later. From 1916 to 1923, he was rector of Church of the Holy Cross in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He then returned to New York City to serve as assistant to his father at St. Philip's, where he supervised religious education and youth work, eventually succeeding his father as rector in 1933. In 1944, Father Bishop persuaded the parishioners of St. Philip's to convert a four-story parish house into a community center with recreational facilities. Crowds of children jammed into the facility's gym, which also provided recreation supervisors who cared about them. Bishop realized that only the city could provide Harlem children with facilities at the scale needed to give them any alternatives aside from roaming the streets while their parents were out working. Such alternatives already existed in more high-rent neighborhoods; during the 1930's, Robert Moses built 255 playgrounds in New York City, and only one was in Harlem. Bishop tried to persuade Moses for ten years to build a playground in his neighborhood and advocated for the cause, at one point telling an audience, \\"The children have no place to go. Day and night they must use the block on which they live for recreation. No wonder they are like caged tigers and, once loose, want to wreak havoc.\\" In 1957, Bishop retired and relocated to Hawaii where he became involved in local church activities.

Storyboarded by series creator C.H. Greenblatt and directed by Juli Hashiguchi, it originally aired on Cartoon Network in the United States on November 2, 2007. The series follows the adventures of the young title character as an apprentice in Chef Mung Daal's catering company. In this episode, Chowder, Mung Daal, and Shnitzel try to accomplish a customer's order for a \\"froggy apple crumple thumpkin\\", a dish with a highly complex and difficult recipe. \\"The Froggy Apple Crumple Thumpkin\\", along with other early Chowder episodes, received mixed reviews from critics. Its writing was unfavorably compared to SpongeBob SquarePants, Greenblatt's previous show as writer, and criticisms were aimed at its unrefined comedy or \\"noisiness\\", though some gave praise to the characters and the episode's fourth wall-breaking humor. Plot Chowder, a nine-year-old cat-bear-rabbit hybrid, retrieves two bags of food from the Marzipan city market and journeys back to Mung Daal Catering. Getting tired from lifting the bags, he uses a piston to launch himself towards his destination. Meanwhile, Truffles receives an call from a ordering customer, only for her to become frustrated that she and the customer could not spell the dish's name. As Truffles calls for her husband Mung to get the order, Chowder then crashes through the roof and lands next to her, who hands Chowder the misspelled order instead. Mung and Shnitzel, the latter a rock monster assistant, are waiting in the main kitchen as Chowder enters with the two bags and the order for a \\"froggy apple crumple thumpkin\\". As Mung notices that the two bags seem smaller than they should be, Chowder admits to snacking a bit on his way back, and proceeds to regurgitate the various ingredients he ate, along with a marching band. With the mess Chowder has made, Schnitzel steps out of frame and shakes away the clutter from the screen. Mung begins to prepare the order by consulting the gigantic \\"Big Book of Recipes\\", as its recipe is at an \\"advanced level\\" and Mung has not made the dish in centuries. For step one, Mung introduces the \\"no-fruit\\" (based on tofu) to Chowder. Once a leaf is pulled off, the no-fruit cycles through various types of fruit, and by hitting it at just the right moment, a chef can bring forth the desired fruit. As Mung, Chowder, and Shnitzel tries to turn no-fruits into apples, Chowder excessively hits an already-altered no-fruit, which leads to its transformation into a violent critter that proceeds to attack Shnitzel. For step two, Mung gives to Chowder the meat from a twelve-legged cave frog. Chowder accidentally places the meat into a chipper machine before removing the explosive stink sac; once the sac comes out, Chowder tries to taste it, only for it to start beeping. Chowder throws it away, with the sac landing on Shnitzel and exploding into pungent gas. After 67 steps, the final step involves a thumb wrestling match with the dish. Meanwhile, the customer has arrived to retrieve his order. The dish proves difficult for Mung to beat, so Mung tags in Chowder for the match. Chowder panics and proceeds to run away, until Mung advices him that a chef tastes the dish before serving it. Chowder regains his confidence and takes a bite out of the dish, defeating it. However, Chowder becomes too gratified and tries to consume it entirely. The dish is able to carry itself over to the customer while Mung keeps Chowder at bay, and the customer leaves the building. As Mung and Truffles note their success with the dish, Chowder consumes the entire screen and leaves. Release \\"The Froggy Apple Crumple Thumpkin\\" originally aired on Cartoon Network in the United States on November 2, 2007. The episode was first released on DVD in the \\"Chowder: Vol. 1\\" set on November 4, 2008. Critical response The episode, alongside other early Chowder episodes, received mixed reviews from critics. Mike Hale of The New York Times gave Chowders first two episodes (four segments), which includes \\"The Froggy Apple Crumple Thumpkin\\", a negative review. Though he recognized that the episodes has some \\"nice flourishes\\" such as artistic images of real food reminiscent of Giuseppe Arcimboldo paintings and the fourth wall-breaking gag involving Shnitzel shaking the screen to remove a mess, he wrote that \\"it’s no 'SpongeBob.' The writing lacks bite and resonance; instead of possessing antic charm, it’s merely antic.\\" Hale also expressed concern towards the allotting large portions of time to \\"vomit, spit and gas\\", and criticized the show overall as simply bland. Paul Pritchard of DVD Verdict, in reviewing ten of the series' early segments on the \\"Chowder: Vol. 1\\" DVD set, also shared the sentiment that the show is generally inferior to SpongeBob, with Greenblatt's connection to the latter series \\"prov[ing] to be both a blessing and a curse for Greenblatt's labor of love.\\" However, he realized that upon rewatching the ten episodes, the characters were what made Chowder engaging, with the title character of Chowder being \\"instantly likeable\\". Pritchard concluded that the show in itself is fun, even if at this early stage is \\"still finding its feet\\". Jeffrey Kauffman of DVD Talk also reviewed Chowders volume one set, giving it three out of five stars and stating that \\"While there are some laugh out loud moments with some creative ideas [...], there's still a bit of rampant noisiness here [...] in the place of well developed comedy.\\" References External links * * Category:2007 American television episodes Category:Animated television episodes ","title":"The Froggy Apple Crumple Thumpkin"},{"id":"65242312","text":"This is a list of the Bulgaria national football team results from 2020 to present.

He was very popular administrator among the people of Yuzhou, from his early days of Prefect of Huainan to Inspector of the province. He participated in the famous Battle of Fei River in 383, fighting alongside Xie Xuan as they repel Former Qin forces. Apart from his involvement in the government, what Huan Yi was most known for was his contribution in music. It is believed that he was the original composer of the popular guqin composition \\"Mei Hua Sannong (3 Variations on the Plum Blossom)\\".  Administrative and military career  Huan Yi was from Zhi County (銍縣, in present-day Anhui province) as a clansman to Huan Xuan, a prominent Eastern Jin general during the early years of its establishment. He was appreciated by the likes of Wang Meng and Liu Tan and went on to handle various military affairs before serving Jin's Grand Marshal Huan Wen. Huan Yi was chosen to become Prefect of Huainan to protect Jin's borders from the growing Former Qin power. Huan Yi managed his responsibility well so the court extended his control over parts of Yuzhou and Yangzhou and made him General Who Establishes Might.(時苻堅強盛，邊鄙多虞，朝議選能距捍疆場者，乃授伊淮南太守。以綏禦有方，進督豫州之十二郡揚州之江西五郡軍事、建威將軍、曆陽太守，淮南如故。) Book of Jin, Volume 81 Huan Yi fought during Yuan Zhen's Rebellion in 370. He and Huan Shiqian were tasked in intercepting Qin forces from reaching Shouchun. The two of them routed Zhang Ci and Wang Jian (王堅) at Shiqiao (石橋, around present-day Lu'an, Anhui), allowing Huan Wen to quell the rebellion in 371.(苻堅乃使其將王鑒、張蠔等率兵以救瑾，屯洛澗，先遣精騎五千次於肥水北。溫遣桓伊及弟子石虔等逆擊，大破之，瑾眾遂潰，生擒之，並其宗族數十人及硃輔送於京都而斬之，所侍養乞活數百人悉坑之，以妻子為賞。) Book of Jin, Volume 98 In 374, Huan Yi was made Commander of military affairs in Yuzhou and also Inspector of Yuzhou. Huan Yi administered the province for ten years, being well-respected by its populace for his fair and competent treatment of them.(伊在州十年，綏撫荒雜，甚得物情。) Book of Jin, Volume 81 In 383, the Heavenly King of Qin, Fu Jian held a major invasion against Jin. Huan Yi was working together with Xie Xuan when the numerically superior Qin army met with Jin's. Through Xie Xuan and Xie An's deception, the Qin army was tricked into a disorganised retreat. Huan Yi and Xie Xuan charged at the retreating Qin forces, leaving thousands of them dead. The battle sealed the fate of Qin, as many of Fu Jian's generals would betray him and established their own state.(融等攻壽春，晉遣都督謝石、徐州刺史謝玄、豫州刺史桓伊、水陸七萬。) Annals of the Sixteen Kingdoms, Volume 4 After the battle, Huan Yi would collect a total of 600 armors of the fallen Qin soldiers throughout the rest of his life. Long before his death, he made a list of people he wanted to present themselves to the court with the armors he collected. Huan Yi believed that this would help in Jin's unification process in case he dies before he lived to see the day.( 初，伊有馬步鎧六百領，豫為表，令死乃上之。表曰：「臣過蒙殊寵，受任西籓。淮南之捷，逆兵奔北，人馬器鎧，隨處放散。于時收拾敗破，不足貫連。比年營繕，並已修整。今六合雖一，餘燼未滅，臣不以朽邁，猶欲輸效力命，仰報皇恩。此志永絕，銜恨泉壤。謹奉輸馬具裝百具、步鎧五百領，並在尋陽，請勒所屬領受。」詔曰：「伊忠誠不遂，益以傷懷，仍受其所上之鎧。」) Book of Jin, Volume 81 The following year in 384, Huan Wen's brother, Huan Chong passed away. The court decided to have Huan Yi succeed his position of Inspector of Jiangzhou. Upon inspection of the towns in Jiangzhou, Huan Yi noticed that it required reforms since Qin no longer posed a threat. He informed the court that Jiangzhou was suffering from a famine. He proposed that the small counties be merged, rice debts be exempted and that Jiangzhou's prefectural government office be moved to Yuzhang (豫章, in present-day Nanchang, Jiangxi). The people of Jiangzhou deeply loved Huan Yi for clearing their famine issues.(伊在州十年，綏撫荒雜，甚得物情。桓沖卒，遷都督江州荊州十郡豫州四郡軍事、江州刺史，將軍如故，假節。伊到鎮，以邊境無虞，宜以寬恤為務，乃上疏以江州虛秏，加連歲不登，今餘戶有五萬六千，宜併合小縣，除諸郡逋米，移州還鎮豫章。詔令移州尋陽，其餘皆聽之。伊隨宜拯撫，百姓賴焉。在任累年，徵拜護軍將軍。以右軍府千人自隨，配護軍府。卒官。贈右將軍，加散騎常侍，諡曰烈。) Book of Jin, Volume 81 Late into his life, Huan Yi became General Who Protects the Army and he received 2,000 men from the General of the Right to serve among his staff. Huan Yi passed away in 391 while in office. He posthumously appointed as General of the Right and given the posthumous title of 'Lie (烈)'.(子肅之嗣。卒，子陵嗣。宋受禪，國除。伊弟不才，亦有將略。討孫恩，至冠軍將軍。) Book of Jin, Volume 81 His tomb is located on Shima Street (石馬街), Caijiafang (蔡家坊) in Nanchang.  Music  Huan Yi was very talented in music with the flute being his forte. Huan Yi's bamboo flute was said to be the \\"Ke Ting Di (柯亭笛)\\", a famous flute made by the Han dynasty intellectual Cai Yong. He was also said to be the composer of \\"Mei Hua Sannong (梅花三弄)\\". As the story goes, the calligrapher Wang Huizhi was travelling to the capital when he met Huan Yi along the way. Wang asked him play his flute, so Huan Yi performed the song with his flute before leaving without a word.(王子猷出都，尚在渚下。舊聞桓子野善吹笛，〈續晉陽秋曰：「左將軍桓伊善音樂，孝武飲燕，謝安侍坐，帝命伊吹笛。伊神色無忤，既吹一弄，乃放笛云：『臣於箏乃不如笛，然自足以韻合歌管。臣有一奴，善吹笛，且相便串，請進之。』帝賞其放率，聽召奴。奴既至，吹笛，伊撫箏而歌怨詩，因以為諫也。」〉而不相識。遇桓於岸上過，王在船中，客有識之者云：「是桓子野。」王便令人與相聞云：「聞君善吹笛，試為我一奏。」桓時已貴顯，素聞王名，即便回下車，踞胡床，為作三調。弄畢，便上車去。客主不交一言。) Shishuo Xinyu, Volume 23 The original scores for the flute does not exist today but was supposedly later adapted for the guqin by Yan Shigu during the Tang dynasty. There is another story that highlights his musical talents that takes place in 383. Xie An hated his son-in-law Wang Guobao who was greedy and abusive in power so he had his daughter divorce him. However, Wang was a close associate to Emperor Xiaowu and Xie An's recent actions made the relationship between the two tense, much to Xie An's disappointment. At a banquet, Huan Yi was sitting next to Xie An when the emperor called him up to perform his flute. Huan Yi first asked the emperor to have his jester perform the flute for him and was permitted. However, the jester could not play, so Huan Yi asked for the court singer instead. She could not play either so Huan Yi asked the emperor one last time to call for the jester's servant, who was skilled at the flute.(時謝安女婿王國寶專利無檢行，安惡其為人，每抑制之。及孝武末年，嗜酒好內，而會稽王道子昏ＪＴ尤甚，惟狎昵諂邪，於是國寶讒諛之計稍行於主相之間。而好利險詖之徒，以安功名盛極，而構會之，嫌隙遂成。帝召伊飲宴，安侍坐。帝命伊吹笛。伊神色無迕，即吹為一弄，乃放笛云：「臣於箏分乃不及笛，然自足以韻合歌管，請以箏歌，並請一吹笛人。」帝善其調達，乃敕禦妓奏笛。伊又云：「禦府人於臣必自不合，臣有一奴，善相便串。」帝彌賞其放率，乃許召之。奴既吹笛，伊便撫箏而歌《怨詩》曰：「為君既不易，為臣良獨難。忠信事不顯，乃有見疑患。周旦佐文武，《金縢》功不刊。推心輔王政，二叔反流言。」聲節慷慨，俯仰可觀。安泣下沾衿，乃越席而就之，捋其須曰：「使君于此不凡！」帝甚有愧色。) Book of Jin, Volume 81 Once he had all three of them, Huan Yi performed the \\"Poem of Complaint (怨詩)\\" by Cao Zhi from the period of Cao Wei during the Three Kingdoms. The poem was Cao Zhi's way of showing resentment to the emperor, who was his brother Cao Pi. It focuses on the hardships of a minister, making an allusion to King Wu of Zhou and his brother, Dan, Duke of Zhou. Xie An realised that he was the subject of Huan Yi's chosen poem and began to cry. He got up and praised Huan Yi while the emperor can only look in shame.  References  * Fang, Xuanling (ed.) (648). Book of Jin (Jin Shu). * Liu, Yiqing (ed.) ( 5th century).

Career  Born in Resolven in south Wales on 7 February 1909, he was the son of an engineer and attended the Neath County School before going up to St Catharine's College, Cambridge, on a scholarship; after initially reading English, he switched to geography and graduated with firsts in parts one and two of the Tripos. He subsequently completed a PhD, the first to be awarded in geography at Cambridge; and, after a year as a university lecturer in geography, he took up a fellowship at King's College, Cambridge, where he remained until 1945.

He was the brother of Samuel J. Briskin, and Murray Briskin, both also film producers. Career Briskin's film career began in 1923 as an auditor for Banner Productions, in New York City. In 1925 he moved to the Henry Ginsburg Distributing Corp. In 1926 he joined Sterling Pictures. In July 1927, when the studio got rid of their foreign broker system and implemented their own foreign sales, Briskin was put in charge, becoming head of their foreign department. That year he negotiated a major sales agreement with Cinematografica Astrea in Barcelona, Spain for distributing all of Sterling's product in Spain and Portugal, as well as six of its films in Italy. And later that same year he negotiated the sale of all 18 Sterling pictures in Hungary. In August 1928, he was named vice president of Sterling and given control over all of the company's operations. By September 1928, Briskin had his own company, Briskin Pictures Corp., headquartered in New York City. In April 1931, Briskin became president of the newly formed Meteor Pictures, in New York. The new company had been formed from the former Briskin Distributing Company, which Briskin began in the late 1920s. In 1932 he moved over to Columbia Pictures, where the first film he produced was Fighting for Justice, starring Tim McCoy. He was put in charge of all films starring McCoy, and spearheaded the transition of McCoy from Westerns to other types of films. In 1936, Columbia renewed his contract. Briskin's contract to run his own production unit at Columbia was renewed in 1942, and again for three years in 1944. 1945 saw Briskin become the executive assistant to Harry Cohn at Columbia. In 1951, Briskin re-signed a seven-year contract with Columbia, to continue on as vice-president of the studio. In 1952, Briskin announced that he had an inked a deal with Ford Motors for Columbia to produce 39 half-hour films to be shown on television. In 1956 Briskin began his own production company, Briskin Productions, to release television material through Screen Gems, Columbia's television subsidiary. At the same time, he continued as V.P. at Columbia, and was put in charge of all production at Screen Gems. In doing so, Briskin resigned from his duties as the studio manager for Columbia's film division, to focus on television production. In April 1956, Briskin initiated a series of writing scholarships to encourage young talent. This was the first time in history this had been done. Six schools were to participate, with the first three selected being Fordham University, University of Chicago, and Iowa State University. In May 1946 he hired Mickey Rooney to produce a new series, Calamity Jane, although the show never seems to have been aired. Later in 1956, Briskin negotiated with Sam Cohn for a $1 million budget for television production for Screen Gems. His production produced several series for Screen Gems for the 1957 season, including Casey Jones. Also in 1956, Briskin set up a $2.5 million fund to entice independent producers to create product to be distributed through Screen Gems. The caveat was that the production either had to have a star attached, or be a very \\"powerful idea\\". Briskin said, \\"there are many producers seeking not only financing, but affiliation with an organization which can give their potential programs everything needed from production facilities to distribution and sales.\\" One of the productions Briskin was in charge of was Playhouse 90, which was broadcast on CBS-TV. By August 1957, Briskin had turned Screen Gems into the leading producer of content for television in Hollywood. One of the projects which Briskin created, but was never released was a television series based on The Secret Life of Walter Mitty, which he created a pilot for, but the three networks passed on due to it being \\"too adult for popular appeal\\". In 1959 Briskin was promoted at Columbia, and left the Screen Gems subsidiary, where he was replaced by William Dozier. In 1962, Briskin resigned from Columbia Pictures. However, he came back as an independent producer late in the year. In November, he joined with Debbie Reynolds and formed Harmon Enterprises. Reynolds was the president, with Briskin serving as vice-president. The company was to shoot on MGM lot. Personal life In October 1940, Briskin purchased the Pepper Lane Farm, one of the oldest residences in southern California, dating from the 1850s. The farm was the estate of Alan O. Stearns and was located in Reseda, California, and consisted of seven acres. Briskin sold the estate for $65,000 in 1946 to a non-profit group, Field Photo Homes, Inc., who intended to develop the property into a memorial for the 13 men of the O.S.S.' Field Photo Unit during World War II. The purchase price had been donated by John Ford. The memorial ranch opened in July 1946. His son, Frederick Briskin, was an assistant director at Columbia, and he also had a daughter, Joyce. He was elected the head of Temple Israel of Hollywood twice, in 1947 and 1950. In 1950, he served as one of the pallbearers at the funeral of Al Jolson. In June 1955, he suffered a heart attack and was hospitalized at Cedars of Lebanon Hospital. He was also a pall-bearer for Harry Cohn in 1958. Briskin was one of the founding members of the Friar's Club of California. In 1961, Briskin purchased a 2.5 percent share of the Riviera Hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada for $62,500. In December 1962, Brisking sold his 2.5 percent interest back to hotel corporation, for exactly what he paid for it the year before. Briskin died on May 29, 1981.

It is a right tributary of the Congo River. Course The Djoué River rises in the Pool Department to the north of Mayama, and flows through that town. It then follows a meandering southeast course through Ngoma-Tsétse in the Brazzaville Department and through the west of the city of Brazzaville, entering the Congo where it leaves the Pool Malebo. The river flows through the Kintamo Rapids at its mouth, described by the English explorer Henry Morton Stanley on 12 March 1877 as having an impressive beauty rarely equaled. Ramsar site At its mouth the river flows through the Ramsar site no.1857, Les Rapides du Congo- Djoué. It includes rapids, permanent and temporary rivers, marshes, forested islands and aquaculture ponds. There are three forested islands in the site. One of them, the Île du Diable, is a refuge for many birds. The waterways support fish and other invertibrates, and is a spawning ground. Although protected by law, there is no management plan in place, and the site is used for market gardening, fishing and harvesting of wine palm oil. Water quality An analysis of the water for the purpose of determining treatment needed to make it potable found an acceptable pH 7.5, but turbidity of 15 NTU: the water is very muddy. The water is soft, and has low levels of inorganic pollutants other than phosphate ions. It could be disinfected with calcium hypochlorite and clarified with calcium sulfate and lime. Hydroelectricity There is a gravity dam with a head and hydroelectric power plant on the river less than from the city center, built in the 1950s. In March 2013 Andritz Hydro Switzerland was awarded a contract to rehabilitate and upgrade HPP Djoué. The power plant had been out of operation since April 2007, when the control room was flooded, and the tailrace channel had been completely silted up by the biannual floods of the Congo River. The renovated plant would supply 2 x 9.06MW.

Historically, philosophers have assumed that some of their statements are absolutely general, referring to truly everything. In recent years, logicians working in the logic of quantification and paradox have challenged this view, arguing that it is impossible for the logical quantifiers to range over an absolutely unrestricted domain. Philosophers who deny the possibility of absolutely unrestricted quantification (often called generality relativists) argue that attempting to speak absolutely generally generates paradoxes such as Russell's or Grelling's, that absolute generality leads to indeterminacy due to the Löwenheim—Skolem Theorem, or that absolute generality fails because the notion of \\"object\\" is relative. Philosophers who believe that we can indeed quantify over absolutely everything (known as generality absolutists), such as Timothy Williamson, may respond by noting that it is difficult to see how a skeptic of absolute generality can frame this view without invoking the concept of absolute generality. A 2006 book, Absolute Generality, published by Oxford University Press, contains essays on the subject written by both the leading proponents and opponents of absolutely unrestricted quantification.

Early life After attending elementary school, he worked in the mining industry from 1883 to 1886. Then he moved to Hamburg and became a clerk at Blohm+Voss, a shipbuilding company. In 1899, now a travel agent for his employer, he was granted citizenship in Hamburg. In 1903 he bought a cigar business which he ran until his death. Drawn to right wing and conservative political views, he became a member of the German Socialist Party, and later the German National People’s Party. He was also a member of the Deutschvölkischer Schutz- und Trutzbund, the most active, and most influential anti-Semitic federation in the Weimar Republic. In July 1922, he joined the Nazi Party and became chairman of the local Nazi association. When the Party was banned in the wake of the Beer Hall Putsch, he remained a tireless organizer and founded several cover associations which were quickly banned as well. In 1923 and 1924 he remained active as a speaker at several mass meetings. The Hamburg association was last reorganized under the name the Blücher Group, and in February 1924 Klant was sentenced to 4 months in prison and a 500 Reichsmark fine for his continued illegal activities on its behalf. In October 1924 he was elected to the Hamburg State Parliament under the auspices of the German Völkisch Freedom Party. He would remain a member of this body until his death. Nazi Party career In March 1925 Klant re-joined the Nazi Party (membership number 1,065) after the ban on it was lifted, and he founded the Nazi Local Group (Ortsgruppe) in Hamburg, Germany’s second largest city. On 27 March he was proclaimed the first Gauleiter of Gau Hamburg and confirmed in this post by Adolf Hitler on 15 July. He maintained his headquarters in the backrooms of his cigar shop. Klant was considered to be in the moderate wing of the Party and opposed the use of force as a tactic against political opponents. He did not succeed in asserting himself against the Sturmabteilung (SA) in Hamburg. Constant quarrels between the SA and the Gau political leadership were the result. In addition, the Party membership remained largely lower middle class and failed to attract sizeable numbers of workers. The membership stagnated and the leadership was factionalized. Klant was increasingly unable to control his subordinates. In October 1926 Klant offered to resign, hoping that this would be refused thereby strengthening his position in the leadership. Instead, the Party headquarters in Munich sent Gregor Strasser, the national Propaganda Leader, to Hamburg to supervise a total restructuring. On 4 November 1926, Strasser removed Klant as Gauleiter. In addition, Hamburg lost its status as a Gau and was renamed the \\"Independent Ortsgruppe (Local Group) Hamburg\\". Strasser oversaw the election of Albert Krebs with the title of Chairman (in effect, Ortsgruppenleiter) of the new organization. Klant protested his removal by appealing to his fellow Gauleiters, but relinquished his challenge when it became clear that Strasser had the full support of Hitler. Klant took no additional active part in party affairs, and died on 7 September 1927 after suffering a stroke. At his funeral in Ohlsdorf Cemetery, Albert Krebs spoke on behalf of the Party.

He made pioneering studies on the modes of vibrations and spectral energies in small molecules. The so called Badger's rule relating force and internuclear distance in diatomic molecules is based on his work from 1933. Badger was born in Elgin, Illinois to Joseph Stillman who worked at General Electric, and Carrie Mabel Hewitt. His father was posted to Brisbane, Australia where he spent his early life. He was then sent to school at Elgin grammar school and again briefly in Australia. He joined Northwestern University in 1916 but was posted into the US Army 311st Field Station Battalion in World War I and was demobilized in 1919. He then went to California to continue his education at the Throop Institute of Technology which became the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in the next year. He studied crystals using X ray diffraction and was influenced by Richard C. Tolman, Roscoe G. Dickinson, Paul S. Epstein, and Arthur A. Noyes. He received a PhD in 1924 and continued to work as a research fellow. Badger and Tolman worked on examining predictions based on Niels Bohr's ideas. In 1928-29 he visited universities in Germany and studied fluorescence with James Franck in Göttingen. He also worked with Reinhard Mecke in Bonn. He became an assistant professor in 1929 and began to examine hydrogen bonds in organic molecules. During World War II he was also involved in problems coming from the Manhattan Project. He worked alongside Linus Pauling working on Navy sponsored research but he did not share Pauling's pacificm and anti-nuclear testing stance. Badger married Virginia Alice Sherman in 1933 and they had a son and a daughter.

History  In 1849 Joseph Treffry opened a tramway from the East Wheal Rose mine to Newquay. The loading sidings were the first East Wheal Rose station. It became a railway in 1874 when the tramway was taken over by the Cornwall Minerals Railway and steam locomotives replaced the horse-drawn wagons. The Great Western Railway took over the line in 1896 and expanded it as a branch line in 1905 from Newquay to Chacewater servicing the resorts of Perranporth and St Agnes and ran it until nationalisation in 1948. British Railways ran the line until 4th February 1963 when the last train ran before the Beeching axe fell. Ten years later, in 1973, Eric Booth bought a section of the old railway line and laid a narrow gauge railway along a section of it. He built it up into a popular tourist attraction with a play area for children at the East Wheal Rose site. East Wheal Rose Station came into being in 1974. It has been upgraded on a couple of occasions during its history with a new station building and new paving being laid. In 2014, Lappa Valley was sold to Keith and Sara Southwell.

His execution caused a global outcry, and many argued that Afkari's conduct during the protests had been peaceful, the confession obtained from Afkari was under duress, and the reason for execution was because Afkari took part in the protests. Afkari's brothers Vahid and Habib were sentenced to 54 and 27 years, respectively, in prison in the same case. While Afkari initially accepted the murder charge, he would later state that it had been a forced confession, with him having been tortured into making a false confession. Despite the Islamic Republic's efforts to portray Afkari's execution as retribution for the deceased security guard, the murder charge was never proven. Afkari's death was followed by worldwide condemnation of the regime, ranging from individual to national statements, including statements released by the EU, the International Olympic Committee IOC, and individuals like UFC president Dana White and Reza Pahlavi, the last crown prince of Iran. Afkari was executed in the early morning hours of 12 September 2020 in the Adel-Abad prison in Shiraz. Wrestling career Afkari was a national champion in wrestling. Charges Afkari was among the people who took to the streets during the 2018 protests in Iran, opposing the dictatorship of Khameneihttps://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2018/01/03/tens-of- thousands-of-people-protested-in-iran-this-week-heres-why/ and the ever- worsening living conditions nation-wide. He was charged with multiple offenses after his sudden arrest shortly after the protests. Among his charges were \\"insulting the supreme leader\\", \\"waging war against God (a.k.a. moharebeh)\\", and the alleged case of Hasan Torkman's murder. Torkman was a secret security agent of IRGC which were tasked with silencing the protests and after his death he was buried as a \\"martyr\\" by the regime, signifying his position. Torkman was also working as a security guard for Water and Sewage company of Shiraz. The murder charge was strongly refuted by Afkari. As it turned out, there was no evidence linking him to that case. The court sentencing was influenced by two sources that they claim it showed Afkari as the murderer. For one, they used the CCTV footage of a street near where Torkman was found dead; The footage was from more than some two hours before Torkman's death and henceforth, one cannot base that as a piece of evidence for finding someone guilty of murder. In it, there is nothing out of the ordinary; Afkari was walking on the sidewalk while talking on the phone with someone. Interestingly enough, the prosecutor did not even present the so-called evidence to the defendant. In his hearings, Afkari even pointed that out to the court and asked the head-judge for the mentioned video to be presented before everyone; so that one can infer guilt, if that was the case. However, the head-judge Mehrdad Tahmtan was ignorant of his request. To be exact, no footage from the moment when the felony took place exists. In addition to the CCTV footage, the court used eye-witness accounts as the other evidence for linking Afkari with Torkman's murder case. The accounts were later dropped by the people that initially testified against Afkari. One testified under pressure, another said that their testimony was not right or accurate and another one mentioned that they had met Afkari for the first time during the court. Despite all the flaws in the murder case with no actual footage of the murder scene and the false testimonies, the court persisted with holding Afkari accountable. For his involvement in the protests, and further the alleged murder case, the court led by the head judge, Mehrdad Tahmtan, sentenced Afkari with two capital punishments. After that, Afkari found this ruling unjust, and he voiced his concerns. In one of his voice calls from the Adel-Abaad prison, he said: He insisted his innocence stating: He warned people about the systemic corruption infesting the judiciary system of Iran and how innocent lives get taken by their unjust rulings, stating: Forced confessions While Afkari initially issued a confession accepting the murder charge, he would later take it back stating he had been tortured into making a false confession. During the hearings in the privately held court, Afkari stated: His parents sent a letter to the chief justice of Iran claiming their son endured torture. In his voice- call from the prison, he clarified that he had been indeed tortured, to wrongly confess about murdering someone which he had not. He comes to the realization that this whole ordeal is not actually about the murder and rather the regime's irritation because of his participation in the protests, as the last thing they wanted to see, was a public figure in the protests alongside the people rallying against the dictatorship. His words are as follows: The eye-witness account that confirmed Afkari's torture came from Shaahin Naaseri who was in the police department when Afkari was being forcefully interrogated under pressure. In his report he clarified: Naaseri, who was an eye-witness to the tortures of Afkari, was later taunted and put under psychological pressure by the inspector of the national security court due to his testimony about the tortures. Recently, Naaseri has disappeared and his family have not been able to make contact with him since Afkari's execution. It has been said that he has been given to the same organization that he testified against their officers' use of torture on Afkari. Death sentence Afkari was given two death sentences for his charges. According to human rights activists in Iran, Afkari's brothers Vahid and Habib were sentenced to 54 and 27 years in prison for charges stemming from the same case. = Reactions = Afkari's death sentence sparked global outrage and calls to overturn his execution. Notable figures, including from U.S. President Donald Trump, International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach, and UFC President Dana White, pled for Iran not to execute Afkari. Trump tweeted on 4 September 2020: > Hearing that Iran is looking to execute a great and popular wrestling star, > 27-year-old Navid Afkarai [sic], whose sole act was an anti-government > demonstration on the streets. They were protesting the “country’s worsening > economic situation and inflation”. To the leaders of Iran, I would greatly > appreciate if you would spare this young man’s life, and not execute him. > Thank you! U.S. State Department spokeswoman, Morgan Ortagus, tweeted: \\"We join the world in outrage at the Iranian regime's death sentence for Navid Afkari, who was tortured into giving a false confession after participating in peaceful protests in 2018. The regime also tortured his two brothers and sentenced them to decades in prison. Let them go!\\" The World Players Association urged for the Iranian judiciary to issue a stay of execution. Iran's semi-official Tasnim News Agency dismissed Trump's tweet in a feature story, saying that US sanctions had hurt Iranian hospitals amid the pandemic, \\"Trump is worried about the life of a murderer while he puts many Iranian patients' lives in danger by imposing severe sanctions,\\" the agency said. This execution is not the first execution of an Iranian athlete, In August 1988, Foruzan Abdi also was executed in Evin prison. =Talks over banning Iran from the Olympics in the wake of Afkari's execution= Due to his unfair sentencing and the fabrication of pieces of evidence to show him guilty of a murder he did not commit, there have been talks whether Iran should be banned from the Olympic Games. Australian sports administrator Brendan Schwab, executive director of the Switzerland-based World Players Association, which represents tens of thousands of professional athletes around the world, stipulated that: Schwab stated that Afkari's execution \\"must result in Iran forfeiting its right to be a part of sport's universal community\\". Death and burial The vigil held for Afkari at Mel Lastman Square in TorontoOn 12 September, it was announced that Afkari had been executed. No one exactly knows how this was done. His burial was done at night-time with high-security presence and only Afkari's immediate family members. His execution was rushed, and that raised a lot of speculations as to why that might have been, especially with a massive global outcry urging Iran not to carry out the execution. According to the lawyers, his execution was unlawful. Given the pieces of evidence, the execution of Afkari cannot be considered the execution of a judicial verdict, and it is more of a \\"heinous crime\\" apparently aimed at poisoning the protesters and turning a blind eye to international public opinion. Officials say that Afkari was hanged; however, there is a lot of controversies regarding that narrative due to multiple anomalies. For one, Afkari was (supposedly) executed in the month of Muharram, during which the executions never take place as it is haram and forbidden to kill by sharia law, also written in the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran. Furthermore, apparently the family of Torkman was about to agree to drop their call for qisas. They were to have a meeting to discuss the matter with the other side the day Afkari was announced dead. His brother receives the news of Afkari's death through a call shortly before his plane was due to depart for Shiraz in order to go and visit the Torkmans. And so that adds to the lead that this was a politically-motivated murder of Afkari by the regime, as had the Torkman family would have dropped their call for qisas, Afkari should have been spared. Moreover and based on the law, any prisoner on the death row can have a meeting with their family the day prior to their execution. Also their family would be notified when their child is a day or two away from execution. Not only was Afkari stripped of his right to see his mother or father, but also their family did not know either that their son was about to be executed. It just happened so abruptly. The last voice call from Afkari was made at night and hours before his death, during which he is completely unaware of his fate. On top of all that, according to the witnesses, there were clear signs of blunt trauma on Afkari's body. His face was deformed and he had a broken nose. The family members were only allowed to see Afkari's face and they were forbidden from seeing his body. The cloth with which his body was carried to the burial was stained with blood from the inside. This begs the question as was this an actual execution by hanging or perhaps it was a mishap where Afkari had been tortured to death, so officials said he was executed in order to avoid an even greater public anger.

Career The son of one Safwan ibn Tuwayl, Bishr was an Arab of the Banu Kalb tribe. He and his family traced their genealogy back to the pre-Islamic chieftain Zuhayr ibn Janab.The exact rendering of Tuwayl's name is given variously in the sources. ; ; ; . In 720 Bishr was appointed governor of Egypt by the caliph Yazid ibn Abd al-Malik as a replacement for Ayyub ibn Sharhabil. During his time in that province, he cancelled several measures that had been enacted by his predecessor, including a salary increase for the local Muslims and fiscal exemptions for Christian churches, and implemented a reform of the diwan registers by segregating members of the Quda'ah from those of other tribes.; ; ; . It was also during Bishr's governorship that the city of Tinnis came under attack by the Byzantines, resulting in the deaths of several Muslims there.; . In 721 Bishr was ordered by Yazid to establish himself in Ifriqiyah (North Africa) following the murder of its governor Muhammad ibn Yazid, and he accordingly set out west, leaving his brother Hanzalah ibn Safwan to govern Egypt in his stead. Upon arriving in the province, he was informed that Abdallah ibn Musa ibn Nusayr had been behind Muhammad's death and wrote to Yazid of the matter. After receiving Yazid's reply that Abdallah should be put to death, Bishr executed him and sent his head on to the caliph. He also proceeded to confiscate Abdallah's property and implemented punitive measures against his former associates.; ; ; ; ; ; ; . In 723 Bishr set out from Ifriqiyah to meet the caliph in person, but while en route he learned that Yazid had died and been succeeded by Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik. Bishr therefore presented the new caliph with the tribute that had been meant for Yazid; Hisham responded by re-confirming his governorship over Ifriqiyah, and afterwards sent him to return to the province.; ; ; ; . , reports that Bishr made it as far as Egypt before learning that Yazid had died, upon which he turned around and returned to Ifriqiyah. While in Ifriqiyah Bishr dispatched his commanders on regular campaigns against Byzantine targets in the Mediterranean Sea. Sardinia came under attack in 721 and 727, while in 724 both Sardinia and Corsica were struck; raids against unknown objectives were also made in 722 and 726. Bishr himself led an expedition against Sicily which resulted in the acquisition of spoils, but this offensive ended badly when storms overtook his fleet and caused much of his army to perish.; ; ; .

C., USA) is an American producer and publicist, most notably for actress Marilyn Monroe.  Early Life  Margot Patricia \\"Pat\\" Newcomb was born on July 9, 1930 in Washington D.C. Her father, Carman Adams Newcomb Jr (1898–1978), was an American lawyer and represented coal companies, owned by George Skakel, father of Ethel Kennedy. He was the son of Carman A. Newcomb (1830–1902) and married social worker Lillian Levie (1906–2000) in 1929. Apart from Patricia, they had a second daughter named Hope Adrian. Newcomb grew up in Chevy Chase, Maryland until 1946. Due to Carman's work, the family then moved to California, where she attended the Immaculate Heart School in Hollywood. In 1952, she graduated in psychology at the Mills College in Oakland.  Career  Newcomb was introduced to Robert Kennedy, while working for his later press secretary Pierre Salinger as a researcher. She later worked for the public relations agency of Arthur Jacobs, becoming the publicist of Marilyn Monroe in 1960 and remaining in this position until Monroe's death in 1962. In the next years, Newcomb continued to work in Hollywood, representing Barbra Streisand and Natalie Wood, among other celebrities, and working for film productions, such as Hello, Dolly! (starring Streisand) and Ordinary People. She was an information specialist in the United States Information Agency and a consultant to the Justice Department, after helping in the senatorial campaign of Robert Kennedy in 1964. Newcomb was also Kennedy's campaign manager in the 1968 presidential election, working for him until his assassination. In 1970, Newcomb campaigned for democrat Eunice Kennedy. A year prior, she founded the Pickwick Public Relations agency with Pat Kingsley and Lois Weber Smith. In 1985, Newcomb was named vice-president of the motion picture production at MGM.  Marilyn Monroe  Newcomb became the publicist of Monroe in 1956, during the filming of Bus Stop. She was later replaced, but rehired in 1960, after Monroe's publicist Rupert Allan moved to Monaco. Newcomb accompanied her to many events, including to the Madison Square Garden on May 19, 1962, where Monroe performed Happy Birthday, Mr. President. Newcomb gave Monroe her dog Maf and remained her publicist until Monroe's death on August 5, 1962. The night before, Newcomb had slept at her residence at 12305 Fifth Helena Drive, before waking up around noon and having an argument with Monroe at the pool. At 4:30 p.m., Monroe's psychiatrist Ralph Greenson joined them to conduct therapy on Monroe, demanding Newcomb to leave. She was informed of her client's death sometime the next morning and arrived at the scene, shouting \\"Keep shooting, vultures!\\" towards the press. Following this outburst, Newcomb was fired by the Arthur Jacobs agency and attended Monroe's funeral on August 8. Throughout the years, Newcomb's work for the Kennedys and silence on Monroe's death have led to conspiracy theories regarding her involvement, outlined in biographies such as Did Pat Newcomb kill Marilyn Monroe? She has given rare statements to several writers, but has mostly rejected commenting on her former client. Newcomb remains one of the last people alive, who were closely linked to Monroe.  Personal Life  On June 28, 1982, Newcomb married film producer Gareth Wigan, who died in 2010. They had no children together.

Biography Otto Gschwantler was born in Tyrol, Austria on 13 April 1930. His father was a shoemaker. Initially trained a s a shoemaker by his father, Gschwantler studied at Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich under Otto Höfler. Gschwantler became a close assistant of Höfler, whom he accompanied to the University of Vienna in 1957. At Vienna, Gschwantler gained his PhD with a thesis on early Germanic literature. For this thesis he was awarded the Sub auspiciis Praesidentis by President Adolf Schärf, which is the highest possible distinction for academic achievements one can achieve in Austria. Gschwantler was known for his humility. He habilitated under the supervision of Höfler in 1971 with a thesis on Germanic philology. Along with Helmut Birkhan and Peter Wiesinger, Gschwantler belonged to the circle of Höfler's closest students, who jokingly called themselves the \\"Drachenrunde\\" (\\"dragon club\\"). Gschwantler was a specialist on the Eddas, runology, early Germanic literature and the christianization of the Germanic peoples. Gschwantler led the Institute for Germanic Studies at the University of Vienna until 1996. In 1992, after a long effort, Gschwantler succeeded in establishing Scandinavian Studies as a distinct study at the University. He eventually retired as professor emeritus, but continued to teach and research, particularly on his native Southern Bavarian dialect. Gschwantler was a devout Roman Catholic and actively engaged in mountain sports. He contracted parkinson's disease in his later life after a traffic accident, and was for many years admirably cared for by his beloved wife Gertraud.

Although Ahna had no plans to go to the theatre at first, the deterioration of her parents' financial circumstances forced her to turn to this profession. She received her vocal training from Eduard Mantius (1806-1874).

It was Gilbert's 19th novel and does not fall into one neat category. Over his long career, Gilbert wrote many kinds of novels, from police procedurals to espionage thrillers, from courtroom dramas to chase and adventure, from cathedral and public school mysteries to tales of municipal corruption. Like the works of his near contemporaries Victor Canning and Ross Thomas, many of his works examined the amorality and sometimes lethal reactions of those in high government positions when confronted by events that run contrary to their wishes. The Empty House combines many of these elements in sometimes unexpected and startlingly violent ways. Plot Written with Gilbert's usual urbane and understated style, the events mostly take place in the West Country of southwestern England, around the small cities and moors of Exmoor and Dartmoor and its extremely dangerous seacoast. The Empty House begins with the apparent death of Alexander Wolfe, a genius-level biologist working at the Biological Warfare Research Station under the close supervision of the Army's Western Command Headquarters at Exeter. His car has plunged, apparently accidentally, off a cliff far from the main roads into the churning waters of the Celtic Sea below, waters so turbulent that no thought is even given to trying to recover the car or his body. Wolfe has recently taken out a large, and unusual, insurance policy that specifies that if his body is ever lost at sea and never recovered, he is to be presumed dead and his sister shall be paid a large amount of money. The unhappy insurance underwriters send a young but highly qualified adjuster, Peter Manciple, to look into the peculiar circumstances of Wolfe's disappearance and to recommend whether the claim should be paid or not. A personable young man, Peter spends the next couple of weeks moving from town to town and one overnight stay to the next, meeting a variety of interesting people and gradually coming to a conclusion as to what has happened to Alexander Wolfe. Even for Gilbert, a writer who was comfortable writing many types of thrillers and mysteries, The Empty House contains an unusual number of disparate elements: there are domestic scenes; chases and violence on the moors; cross-country Buchanesque escapes; sympathetic but murderous Israeli agents; even more murderous Palestinian agents; stolid policemen; clever lawyers; affable innkeepers; shrewd schoolmasters; relentless Army soldiers and counter-agents; and unexpected shifts from one apparent sort of story to the next. In the end, in one final surprise, Manciple delivers his report to his employers, rejects an offer from the Army to join its counter-intelligence group, and goes off to become a schoolmaster at Blundell's School. Gilbert himself was a most Establishment figure, frequently writing about other Establishment figures, and was usually firmly on the side of England's police forces and shadowy (though lethal) Intelligent departments. In The Empty House, however, there is a sharp edge to the entire story that is entirely in keeping with what one of Gilbert's American editors said about him after his death in 2006, many years after the publication of this book: \\"He's not a hard-boiled writer in the classic sense, but there is a hard edge to him, a feeling within his work that not all of society is rational, that virtue is not always rewarded.\\".Douglas Greene of Crippen & Landrau, quoted in The New York Times, 15 February 2006 Reception The New York Times found it up to Gilbert's usual standard: > Michael Gilbert can always be relied on for a sharply written, tautly > constructed book, and his newest, THE EMPTY HOUSE (Harper and Row, $9.95), > does not disappoint. Mr. Gilbert gives us a scientist who vanishes when his > car hurtles over a cliff. There seems to be no doubt about the accident, but > a lot of insurance money is involved and an investigator named Peter > Manciple is sent in to look things over. Manciple is a man with some unusual > gifts, all of which he has to use before he winds things up. The dead man, > it turns out, was a top man in biological warfare. Thus, the British > Government gets into the act. As Manciple starts making headway, people > start getting killed. Mr. Gilbert handles all this in his usual suave > manner. Kirkus Review, however, was somewhat less enthusiastic: > British bio-warfare scientist Alexander Wolfe is presumed dead when his car > is seen careening off a west-coast English cliff into the sea; but young > insurance adjuster Peter Manciple is sent to investigate—something seems > fishy. And Peter's suspicions are confirmed when he finds himself being > followed, and when one of Wolfe's colleagues disappears and is soon found > dead. Convinced that Wolfe is alive, Peter, aided by a photographic memory, > picks up a scenic coastal trail to what he believes to be Wolfe's > hideout—but that is only one of Peter's miscalculations. He allows himself > to be seduced by a fairly obvious spy (oppressed by an insane mum, Peter's > an innocent with women), and he gets caught in the crossfire between Israeli > agents and assorted others—all of whom have an intense interest in Wolfe's > formula for a genetic poison that can kill off a whole nation in a single > generation. A well-concealed twist waits at the end of all the chasing and > shooting, followed by a neat coda, but only Gilbert's dependably lean prose > and the West Country atmosphere (though merely half-sketched) lift this a > small notch above the level of routine spy adventure.

It describes itself as an union that has the goal of confronting social and economic problems of students. These mainly concern topics such as dormitory debts, living expenses, de-qualification in education, future anxiety, careerism and exam stress. It is the second students' union in Turkey, following Genç-Sen, which was closed in 2011.  History  Students' groups and communities that had spent their summer holiday for educational meetings and discussions have made a general call on November 29, 2019 for the foundation of Students' Union. After that, Turkey's second ever students' union \\"Öğrenci-Sen\\" is found.  Activity  = 'No Exam with Hunger' Campaign = A shot from the street work of the 'No Exam With Hunger' campaign. The first campaign that Student's Union held is the 'No Exam with Hunger' campaign made on 2 February 2020, against to raises made to dining hall and transportation. While raises were being made to university dining halls, high school canteens and transportation, the raise declared by Istanbul University caused a reaction countrywide. The protests that took place in the university got supported by opposition figures and intellectuals. While rectorate's stepping back on 6 January was a progress for students, the suicide of university student Sibel Ünli due to poverty and lack of livelihood caused indignation in the country. Students' Union, after all of those events, started a signature campaign on 2 February 2020, via Change.org, against to life expenses of students. Union members that had started to open stands all over the country have asked for all dining expenses to be fixed to 1,5 TL. Students also demanded that municipalities should distribute soup in the mornings in front of the universities, withdrawing the raises made to transportation in Istanbul and fixation of such costs to an acceptable level in other cities. = COVID-19 Pandemic and Era of Distance Learning = After the COVID-19 pandemic starting in the country, while students were getting online education from EbaTV of primary, junior high and high school level, university students were getting the type of education their schools have decides themselves. Students' Union's '3 Problems 3 Demands' directive for staying safe during COVID-19 The reaction of Students' Union about that was started with the closure of student dormitories by government. By that unplanned decision, the students were forced to return their homes, and were filled in bus terminals uncontrollably due to the lack of planning. At the same time, the arrival of people coming from foreign countries to the dormitories which were being used for quarantine was also among concerns. Students' Union spread the decision of rectorate to close dormitories and demanded planning to related officials. Many rectorates starting with METU withdrew their decisions to some degree. Students' Union commited several actions during the pandemic. Alongside of \\"stay home\\" calls, they have done statements about staying safe during COVID-19 and kept their protests regarding dormitory debts, free internet and helping students whose dormitory scholarship are cancelled.  Recognition  Students' Union is recognized by Ministry of Family, Labour and Social Services of Republic of Turkey as a registered independent labor union with its own code.

It is the southernmost of a group of basins of similar age found along the southwest coast of Norway between Sognefjord and Nordfjord, developed in the hanging-wall of the Nordfjord-Sogn Detachment. It was formed as a result of extensional tectonics during the post-orogenic collapse of crust thickened during the Caledonian orogeny, towards the end of the Silurian period. It is named for the municipality of Solund in Vestland. Tectonic setting During the later part of the Silurian period, the western margin of the Baltic Plate was affected by the main collisional event of the Caledonian orogeny, known as the Scandian phase. This led to large-scale thrusting and the development of a mountain belt similar in scale to the Himalayas. Soon after the collision finished during the Early Devonian, the thickened crust began to extend. Initially the extension took place by reactivation of Caledonian thrust faults, known as Mode 1 extension. The uplift and exhumation led to a reduction of dip in these reactivated thrusts, making them progressively less mechanically viable. At this point Mode II extension took over, with development of large extensional shear zones that cross-cut the Caledonian thrust pile, such as the Nordfjord-Sogn Detachment. Extent The preserved part of the Solund Basin covers about 800 km2, including most of the islands of Ytre Sula, Steinsundøyna, Sula, Losna, many other smaller islands and the mainland peninsula on which the mountain of Lihesten lies. Basin fill The dominant lithology is conglomerate, with some breccia and subordinate amounts of sandstone, organised into somewhat irregular cycles of coarsening up and then fining on a scale of tens of metres up to more than 100 m. The conglomerate is typically very coarse, consisting of cobble to boulder sized clasts. A strong depositional fabric is present with clast long axes showing a marked preferred orientation of northwest–southeast, often with well-developed imbrication. =Hersvik landslides= In the area around Hersvikbygda, towards the north of the island of Sula, a series of large exotic lenticular bodies are found within the conglomerates towards the base of the sequence. They consist of a wide range of lithologies, including mafic and felsic volcanics, granite, diorite, gabbro and metasediments. When they were first described in 1926, they were interpreted as small thrust sheets involving the emplacement of slices of the underlying upper allochthon rocks beneath the basal unconformity into the conglomerate sequence. Later investigations failed to find any evidence for tectonic contacts at the base of the lenses and one large body of monomict brecciated gabbro was interpreted as a debris flow. At the base of one of the lenses a body of rhyolite was interpreted as a contemporaneous Devonian lava flow, the only example of volcanism of that age described from Norway. A reappraisal of these deposits, including dating the rhyolite body as Silurian, has interpreted all of these bodies as landslides, probably derived from rocks of the Solund-Stavfjord Ophiolite Complex on the basin margin to the north. Similar landslide deposits have also been recognised from the southeastern boundary of the basin near Kråkevåg, at the highest preserved stratigraphic level, demonstrating that such landslides were active throughout the deposition of the preserved part of the basin. Structure In the southeastern part of the basin, the conglomerate sequence dips 20–25° to the southeast. The main fold structure is the Lågøyfjorden anticline which runs southwest–northeast. To the northwest of the fold hinge the dip is towards the north or northwest. The southeastern margin of the basin is formed by the low- angle Solund Fault or Solund Detachment, part of the Nordfjord-Sogn Detachment. Close to this margin small down-to-the-northwest listric normal faults are developed within the conglomerates, which merge with the detachment itself. At the fault contact, the lowermost metre of the conglomerates is strongly sheared, with a foliation parallel to the fault and the clasts become elongated in a direction parallel to the lineation in the underlying mylonite. The conglomerate is also noticeably deformed with well-developed cleavage in zone about 2.5 km wide parallel to the Solund Fault. The conglomerates show evidence of very low-grade metamorphism with recognition of an assemblage of authigenic minerals that indicate temperatures in the range 230–330°C, consistent with maximum burial of up to 13 km. The mylonites immediately beneath the Solund Fault appear to be a highly deformed version of the mafic rocks of the upper allochthon. These mylonites contain a suite of minor structures that show slightly oblique top-down-to-the-northwest movement. The basin is cut by a prominent series of nearly north–south trending faults that are interpreted to be of latest Paleozoic to Mesozoic age, associated with west–east extension in the North Sea rift that began during the Permo- Triassic.
