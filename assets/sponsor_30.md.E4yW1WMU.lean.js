Biographical information Born Patrick Joseph O'Connor in Belfast to Bernard and Annie (n√©e McGarry) O'Connor, Fiacc's father was a barman who left for the United States when Fiacc was very young. Fiacc resided with his maternal grandparents who had recently moved to the Markets area of South Belfast after being burned out of their home in Lisburn in which all their furniture was burned by anti-Catholic rioters. His family emigrated to the United States in the late 1920s and he grew up in New York City. He returned to Belfast in 1946 where he lived for four years before returning to New York in 1950; he grew up in Hell's Kitchen. The multicultural influences, coupled with the poverty and violence of the neighbourhood impacted Fiacc's outlook and his writing, especially his early writing. =Education and early writing= He attended Commerce High School and later changed to Haaren High School to learn Latin. While at school, he produced several original plays and his first collection of poetry titled Innisfail Lost. The poems were reviewed by Padraic Colum who became a mentor to Fiacc, directing him away from themes of coming to America and encouraging him to research and write about his own people's history. Fiacc had already developed a distaste for America and found himself longing for Ireland as he dug deeper into its history and literary technique and style. Seminary was Padraic's next step. He attended St. Joseph's Seraphic Seminary and later studied with the Irish Capuchin Order for a total of three years spanning 1941‚Äì44. He includes in his main reasons for leaving the path to priesthood his lack of disciplinary habits and longing for a freer existence. =Relocation= On leaving the seminary, and to avoid signing up for military service, he returned to Belfast in 1946 where he lived for four years during which time his poetry was published in several magazines and the 1948 volume of New Irish Poets. Fiacc was the youngest poet in that edition. Publications of Fiacc's work from this time may be found in Irish Bookman, Irish Times, Poetry Ireland, and '. In 1952, upon the death of his mother, Fiacc returned to New York to look after his alcoholic father and younger siblings. It was during this time that he met his soon-to-be wife Nancy, who had read and enjoyed some of his early writings. Fiacc was unsettled and returned to Belfast in 1956, settling in Glengormley, a suburb of North Belfast, where they had a baby girl in 1962. He has since published a steady stream of poetry and other works. =Life in Belfast= Fiacc continued to write and won the 1957 AE Memorial Award. 1969 was a momentous year for Fiacc. The publishing of his first volume of poetry came alongside the return of pervasive violence. The breakdown of his marriage and his nerves, and the murder of a close friend, Gerry McLaughlin, ensued, as did his edited collection of poetry by his contemporaries surrounding the topic of the troubling times in Northern Ireland, The Wearing of the Black. In the early 1970s, he met poet Gerald Dawe with whom he met regularly, corresponded, and later acted as mentor. Dawe published a steady stream of poetry and other pieces, and still resides in Belfast. He was a member of Aosd√°na, the Irish Arts Academy. In the 1980s, Fiacc collaborated with Seamus Carmichael, who produced a series of color linoleum prints, three based on poems from the \\"Missa Terriblis\\" collection and 7 based on work from \\"Woe to the Boy\\". These images were widely exhibited in Ireland in 1985 and 1986. Many artists have depicted the poet such as Neil Shawcross, Paul Bradley, Dan Dowling, Michael McKernon, √öna O'Grady, Rory Lambe and Photographers such as Frankie Quinn, Stevie Raeylon (Chicago) and Bill Kirk. =Death= Padraic Fiacc died on 21 January 2019 in Belfast, Northern Ireland, aged 95.

A favourite (British) or favorite (American English) was the intimate companion of a ruler or other important person. In post-classical and early-modern Europe, among other times and places, the term was used of individuals delegated significant political power by a ruler. It was especially a phenomenon of the 16th and 17th centuries, when government had become too complex for many hereditary rulers with no great interest in or talent for it, and political institutions were still evolving. From 1600 to 1660 there were particular successions of all-powerful minister-favourites in much of Europe, particularly in Spain, England, France and Sweden.Elliott:5, summarising the work of French historian Jean B√©renger The term is also sometimes employed by writers who want to avoid terms such as \\"royal mistress\\", \\"friend\\", \\"companion\\", or \\"lover\\" (of either sex). Several favourites had sexual relations with the monarch (or the monarch's spouse), but the feelings of the monarch for the favourite ran the gamut from a simple faith in the favourite's abilities to various degrees of emotional affection and dependence, and sometimes even encompassed sexual infatuation. The term has an inbuilt element of disapproval and is defined by the Oxford English Dictionary as \\"One who stands unduly high in the favour of a prince\\", citing Shakespeare: \\"Like favourites/ Made proud by Princes\\" (Much Ado about Nothing, 3.1.9). Rises and falls of favourites The Duke of Buckingham by the workshop of Rubens Favourites inevitably tended to incur the envy and loathing of the rest of the nobility, and monarchs were sometimes obliged by political pressure to dismiss or execute them; in the Middle Ages nobles often rebelled in order to seize and kill a favourite. Too close a relationship between monarch and favourite was seen as a breach of the natural order and hierarchy of society. Since many favourites had flamboyant \\"over-reaching\\" personalities, they often led the way to their own downfall with their rash behaviour. As the opinions of the gentry and bourgeoisie grew in importance, they too often strongly disliked favourites. Dislike from all classes could be especially intense in the case of favourites who were elevated from humble, or at least minor, backgrounds by royal favour. Titles and estates were usually given lavishly to favourites, who were compared to mushrooms because they sprang up suddenly overnight, from a bed of excrement. The King's favourite Piers Gaveston is a \\"night-grown mushrump\\" (mushroom) to his enemies in Christopher Marlowe's Edward II.s:Edward the Second Their falls could be even more sudden, but after about 1650, executions tended to give way to quiet retirement. Favourites who came from the higher nobility, such as Leicester, Lerma, Olivares, and Oxenstierna, were often less resented and lasted longer. Successful minister-favourites also usually needed networks of their own favourites and relatives to help them carry out the work of government - Richelieu had his \\"cr√©atures\\" and Olivares his \\"hechuras\\".Elliott:6 Oxenstierna and William Cecil, who both died in office, successfully trained their sons to succeed them. The favourite can often not be easily distinguished from the successful royal administrator, who at the top of the tree certainly needed the favour of the monarch, but the term is generally used of those who first came into contact with the monarch through the social life of the court, rather than the business of politics or administration. Figures like William Cecil and Jean-Baptiste Colbert, whose accelerated rise through the administrative ranks owed much to their personal relations with the monarch, but who did not attempt to behave like grandees of the nobility, were also often successful. Elizabeth I had Cecil as Secretary of State and later Lord High Treasurer from the time she ascended the throne in 1558 until his death 40 years later. She had more colourful relationships with several courtiers; the most lasting and intimate one was with Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester, who was also a leading politician.Adams pp. 17-18 Only in her last decade was the position of the Cecils, father and son, challenged by Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex, when he fatally attempted a coup against the younger Cecil. Cardinal Wolsey was one figure who rose through the administrative hierarchy, but then lived extremely ostentatiously, before falling suddenly from power. In the Middle Ages in particular, many royal favourites were promoted in the church, English examples including Saints Dunstan and Thomas Becket; Bishops William Waynflete, Robert Burnell and Walter Reynolds. Cardinal Granvelle, like his father, was a trusted Habsburg minister who lived grandly, but he was not really a favourite, partly because most of his career was spent away from the monarch. Cardinal Richelieu, one of the most successful from the golden age of the favourite Some favourites came from very humble backgrounds: Archibald Armstrong, jester to James I of England infuriated everyone else at court but managed to retire a wealthy man; unlike Robert Cochrane, a stonemason (probably a senior one, more like an architect than an artisan) who became Earl of Mar before the Scottish nobles revolted against him, and hanged him and other low-born favourites of James III of Scotland. Olivier le Daim, the barber of Louis XI, acquired a title and important military commands before he was executed on vague charges brought by nobles shortly after his master died, without the knowledge of the new king. It has been claimed that le Daim's career was the origin of the term, as favori (the French word) first appeared around the time of his death in 1484. Privado in Spanish was older, but was later partly replaced by the term valido; in Spanish, both terms were less derogatory than in French and English.Elliott:1 Such rises from menial positions became progressively harder as the centuries progressed; one of the last families able to jump the widening chasm between servants and nobility was that of Louis XIV's valet, Alexandre Bontemps, whose descendants, holding the office for a further three generations, married into many great families, even eventually including the extended royal family itself. Queen Victoria's John Brown came much too late; the devotion of the monarch and ability to terrorize her household led to hardly any rise in social or economic position. Decline In England, the scope for giving political power to a favourite was reduced by the growing importance of Parliament. After the \\"mushroom\\" Buckingham was assassinated by John Felton in 1628, Charles I turned to Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford, who had been a leader of Parliamentary opposition to Buckingham and the King, but had become his supporter after Charles made concessions. Strafford can therefore hardly be called a favourite in the usual sense even though his relationship with Charles became very close. He was also from a well-established family, with powerful relations. After several years in power, Strafford was impeached by a Parliament now very hostile to him. When that process failed, it passed a bill of attainder for his execution without trial, and it put enough pressure on Charles that to his subsequent regret, Charles signed it, and Strafford was executed in 1641. There were later minister-favourites in England, but they knew that the favour of the monarch alone was not sufficient to rule, and most also had careers in Parliament. Prince Grigori Potemkin In France, the movement was in the opposite direction. On the death of Cardinal Mazarin in 1661, the 23-year-old Louis XIV determined that he would rule himself, and he did not allow the delegation of power to ministers that had marked the previous 40 years. The absolute monarchy pioneered by Cardinal Richelieu, Mazarin's predecessor, was to be led by the monarch himself. Louis had many powerful ministers, notably Jean-Baptiste Colbert, in finances, and Fran√ßois-Michel le Tellier, Marquis de Louvois, the army, but overall direction was never delegated, and no subsequent French minister ever equaled the power of the two cardinals. The Spanish Habsburgs were not capable of so much energy, but when Olivares was succeeded by his nephew, Luis M√©ndez de Haro, the last real valido, the control of government into a single pair of hands had already been weakened. In literature Favourites were the subject of much contemporary debate, some of it involving a certain amount of danger for the participants. There were a large number of English plays on the subject, amongst the best known to be Marlowe's Edward II in which Piers Gaveston is a leading character, and Sejanus His Fall (1603), for which Ben Jonson was called before the Privy Council, accused of \\"Popery and treason\\", as the play was claimed by his enemies to contain allusions to the contemporary court of James I of England. Sejanus, whose career under Tiberius was vividly described by Tacitus, was the subject of numerous works all around Europe.Elliott:2-3 Shakespeare was more cautious, and with the exceptions of Falstaff, badly disappointed in his hopes of becoming a favourite, and Cardinal Wolsey in Henry VIII, he gives no major parts to favourites.Blair Worden in Elliott:171 Bust of Antinous from Patras, (National Archaeological Museum of Athens) Francis Bacon, almost a favourite himself, devoted much of his essay On Friendship to the subject, writing as a rising politician under Elizabeth I: > It is a strange thing to observe, how high a rate great kings and monarchs > do set upon this fruit of friendship, whereof we speak: So great, as they > purchase it, many times, at the hazard of their own safety and greatness. > For princes, in regard of the distance of their fortune from that of their > subjects and servants, cannot gather this fruit, except (to make themselves > capable thereof) they raise some persons to be, as it were, companions and > almost equals to themselves, which many times sorteth to inconvenience. The > modern languages give unto such persons the name of favorites, or privadoes > ... . And we see plainly that this hath been done, not by weak and > passionate princes only, but by the wisest and most politic that ever > reigned; who have oftentimes joined to themselves some of their servants; > whom both themselves have called friends, and allowed other likewise to call > them in the same manner; using the word which is received between private > men. Writing of George III's old tutor, John Stuart, who became Prime Minister. Lord Macaulay wrote in 1844: \\"He was a favourite, and favourites have always been odious in this country. No mere favourite had been at the head of the government since the dagger of Felton had reached the heart of the Duke of Buckingham\\".Essay on \\"The Earl of Chatham\\", quoted Elliott:1 Notable favourites a manuscript of Froissart.

Bhai Mati Das, Bhai Dayala, and Bhai Sati Das were executed at a kotwali (police-station) in the Chandni Chowk area of Delhi, under the express orders of Emperor Aurangzeb just before the martyrdom of Guru Tegh Bahadur. Bhai Mati Das was executed by being bound between two pillars and cut in two. Biography =Birth= Bhai Mati Das was born a Hindu Punjabi family, and belonged to the Mohyal Hindu Brahmin family, he was a part of the Chhibber family. Converting to the Sikh faith later in his life. He lived in the ancient village of Karyala, about ten kilometres from Chakwal on the road to the Katas Raj Temples in the Jhelum District in Punjab (Pakistan). Bhai Sati Das was his younger brother. Bhai Mati Das was the son of Hira Nand, a disciple of Guru Har Gobind, under whom he had fought in many battles and was a great warrior. Hira Nand was the grandson of Lakhi Das, the son of the Bhai Praga, who was also a martyr and had been a Jathedar (leader) in Guru Hargobind's first battle. =Service of Guru Tegh Bahadur= During the time after Guru Har Krishan's death at Delhi, and the uncertainty over who would be the next Guru, Bhai Mati Das, and Bhai Sati Das are sometimes mentioned as being present looking for the Guru or directly after when Baba Makhan Shah Labana found Guru Tegh Bahadur in the village of Bakala where the new Guru was then residing. The new Guru entrusted all his financial activities to Bhai Mati Das, and thus he is sometimes given the name Diwan Mati Das, whereas Bhai Sati Das served Guru Tegh Bahadur as a cook. The two brothers accompanied Guru Teg Bahadur during his two-year stay at Assam. Guru Tegh Bahadur then bought a hillock near the village of Makhowal five miles north of Kiratpur and established a new town, Chakk Nanaki now named Anandpur Sahib (the abode of bliss) where Bhai Mati Das and Bhai Sati Das also resided. The Guru's eastern tours Bhai Mati Das and Bhai Sati Das were present on the Guru's eastern tours beginning in August 1665 including the tours of Saifabad and Dhamtan (Bangar) where they were arrested perhaps because of the influence of Dhir Mal, or the Ulemas and orthodox Brahmins. The Guru was sent to Delhi and detained for one month. After being freed in December 1665, he continued his tour and Bhai Mati Das and Bhai Sati Das were again in his company particularly at Dacca, and Malda. =Guru's Arrest= Inside view of Red Fort at Chandni Chowk, Delhi In 1675 the Guru was summoned by Emperor Aurangzeb to Delhi to convert to Islam. Aurangzeb was very happy that all he had to do was covert one man and the rest of the Hindus from Kashmir, Kurukshetra, Hardwar, and Beneras would follow suit. The Guru left for Delhi on his own accord but was arrested at Malikpur Rangharan near Ropar. While the Guru was traveling towards Delhi his company at this time consisted of his most devoted Sikhs including Bhai Dayala, Bhai Udai, and Bhai Jaita (Rangretta) as well as Bhai Mati Das and Bhai Sati Das. After visiting a few places where large crowds of devotees had gathered the Guru sent Bhai Jaita and Bhai Udai to Delhi to scout ahead and report back to him and to Anandpur as well. After being arrested Guru Tegh Bahadur was taken to Sirhind and from there he was sent to Delhi in an iron cage. At Delhi, the Guru and his five companions were taken into the council chamber of the Red Fort. The Guru was asked numerous questions on religion, Hinduism, Sikhism and Islam, such as why he was sacrificing his life for people who wear the Janeu and the Tilak when he himself was a Sikh. The Guru answered that the Hindus were powerless and weak against tyranny. They had come to the abode of Guru Nanak as refuge, and with the same logic he would have sacrificed his life for Muslims as well. On the Guru's emphatic refusal to abjure his faith, he was asked why he was called Teg Bahadur (gladiator or Knight of the Sword; before this, his name had been Tyag Mal). Bhai Mati Das immediately replied that the Guru had won the title by inflicting a heavy blow on the imperial forces at the young age of fourteen. Guru Tegh Bahadur was reprimanded for his breach of etiquette and outspokenness, and the Guru and his companions were ordered to be imprisoned and tortured until they agreed to embrace Islam. =Guru's Martyrdom= After a few days, Guru Tegh Bahadur and three of his companions were again brought before the Qazi of the city and again the Sikhs repeated their sentiments. Bhai Mati Das was offered marriage of the Nawab's daughter as well as governorship of the province if he converted to Islam. On November 11, 1676, large crowds gathered to see the Guru and the executioners were called to the kotwali (police-station) near the Sunehri Masjid in the Chandni Chowk. The Guru, who was kept in an iron cage, and his three companions were moved to the place of execution. Mughal Empire records from the 17th century explain Bhai Mati Das' death as punishment for challenging the authorities. Bhai Mati Das, Bhai Dayala and Bhai Sati Das were then tortured and executed. Martyrdom of Bhai Mati Das Bhai Mati Das, the first to be martyred, was asked if he had any final wishes. He replied that he desired to be facing towards the guru on his execution. Bhai Mati Das was made to stand erect between two posts and a double headed saw was placed on his head and he was sawed from his head to his loins. While this was happening, Bhai Mati Das recited the Japuji Sahib. There is a mystical belief that the recitation of the Gurbani continued and was completed even though the body was in two distinct halves. Seeing this, Dyal Das abused the Emperor and his courtiers for this infernal act. Martyrdom of Bhai Dayala and Bhai Sati Das Bhai Dayala was tied up like a round bundle and put into a huge bronze cauldron of boiling oil. He was roasted alive into a block of charcoal. No sign of grief was shown by the disciples of the Guru and the Guru also witnessed this savagery with divine calm. Bhai Sati Das was tied to a pole and wrapped in cotton fibre. He was then set on fire by the executioner. He remained calm and peaceful and kept uttering Waheguru Gurmantar, while fire consumed his body. Martyrdom of the Guru Gurudwara Sis Ganj Sahib, Chandni Chowk, Delhi Early the next morning Guru Tegh Bahadur was beheaded by an executioner named Jalal-ud-din Jallad, who resided in the town of Samana in present-day Punjab. The spot of the execution was under a banyan tree (the trunk of the tree and well near-by where he took a bath are still preserved), opposite the Sunheri Masjid near the Kotwali in Chandni Chowk where he was lodged as a prisoner, on November 11, 1675. His head was carried by Bhai Jaita, a disciple of the Guru, to Anandpur where the nine-year-old Guru Gobind Singh cremated it (The gurdwara at this spot is also called Gurdwara Sis Ganj Sahib). The body, before it could be quartered, was stolen under the cover of darkness by Lakhi Shah Vanjara, another disciple, who carried it in a cart of hay and cremated it by burning his hut. The Gurdwara Rakab Ganj Sahib stands today at this location. Later on, the Gurdwara Sis Ganj Sahib, was built at Chandni Chowk at the site of Guru's martyrdom. Legacy Bhai Mati Das is regarded as a great martyr by the Sikh. The date of his martyrdom, is celebrated in certain parts of India as a public holiday.[37][38][39] Bhai Mati Das' martydom finds explicit mention in the daily supplication prayers of Ardas. The Bhai Mati Das Sati Das Museum was built in honor of Bhai Mati Das and Bhai Sati Das in Delhi opposite Gurudwara Sis Ganj Sahib, Chandni Chowk the spot where they were martyred.

He also studies natural syntactical chains of behavior (e.g. grooming; taste response patterns) in animals with colleague Dr. J. Wayne Aldridge. With Dr. Piotr Winkielman, he has investigated the issue of unconscious emotion in humans. = Liking = Berridge is known for his work on the brain systems for pleasure (‚Äúliking‚Äù).Berridge, K.C. Pleasures of the Brain. Brain Cogn. 2003 Jun;52(1):106-28. Using an assay for ‚Äúliking‚Äù called Taste Reactivity Analysis developed by taste researchers, Berridge measures facial palatability responses to tastes, which are similar between rodents, primates and humans.Videos of Pleasure-elicited Reactions . When something enjoyably sweet is tasted, characteristic licking responses occur. When something aversively bitter is tasted, gaping and head shaking occur. Berridge has helped identify \\"hedonic hotspots\\" in the brain, such as the nucleus accumbens and ventral pallidum, where opioid, endocannabinoid, and GABA neurotransmission coordinate the ‚Äúliking‚Äù of tastes. Berridge postulates that these hedonic hotspots may be crucial for how the brain produces the hedonic pleasurable feelings common to delicious food, sex, drugs, and other rewards (a role previously thought to be played mostly by brain dopamine systems). = Addiction = Berridge and colleague Dr. Terry Robinson have formulated a contemporary theory of addiction called the Incentive Sensitization Theory of Addiction.Robinson, T.E., Berridge, K.C. The neural basis of drug craving: an incentive- sensitization theory of addiction. Brain Res Brain Res Rev. 1993 Sep- Dec;18(3):247-91. According to this theory, drug addiction develops from a sensitization of the mesolimbic dopamine system. Dopamine normally functions to attribute incentive salience to stimuli associated with rewards like food and sex, and triggers reward ‚Äúwanting‚Äù. Drugs hijack this ‚Äúwanting‚Äù system. Following repeated use of drugs, the dopamine system becomes hyper-responsive and drug cues become hyper-salient. This means drug cues are nearly impossible for addicts to ignore, and when they are encountered they can lead to intense cravings and/or relapse. This sensitized cue-triggered drug 'wanting' can persist for years after an addict quits drugs, and long after drug withdrawal has ceased. This fact may account for the tendency of former addicts to relapse to drug use after quitting, sometimes even after many years of abstinence. = Dopamine = Berridge and Robinson helped redefine the role of mesolimbic dopamine in the brain,Berridge, K.C., Robinson, T.E. What is the role of dopamine in reward: hedonic impact, reward learning, or incentive salience? Brain Res Brain Res Rev. 1998 Dec;28(3):309-69. which had previously been viewed as a pleasure neurotransmitter. Dopamine is no longer widely regarded as a pleasure transmitter. Instead, dopamine is thought to mediate reward, that is, to attribute incentive salience to reward-associated stimuli.

He married Dolores Moya in 1911, and they had four children (Carmen, Bel√©n, Mar√≠a Isabel and Gregorio).  Life and work  An austere, humanist and liberal man, he is considered one of the most brilliant Spanish intellectuals of the 20th century. Besides his erudition, he also stands out for his elegant literary style. As many other thinkers of his time, he involved himself social and politically: he was a Republican and fought the Miguel Primo de Rivera dictatorship (he was condemned to jail for a month) and showed his disagreement with Spanish communism. Moreover, he supported the Second Spanish Republic in its beginnings, but later criticised it because of its lack of cohesion among the Spanish people. Probably after going away from Madrid (around January 1937), and when asked his opinion of the republican Spain, Mara√±√≥n spoke in a meeting of French intellectuals as follows: \\"You don't need to try very hard, my friends; listen to this: eighty-eight percent of teachers from Madrid, Valencia and Barcelona (the three universities which, alongside Murcia's, had stayed on the republican side) have been forced to exile abroad. And do you know why? Simply because they were afraid of being murdered by the reds (communists in Spain), despite many of the threatened intellectuals were thought of as left-wing men.\\" In the article \\"Liberalism and comunism\\", published in Revue de Paris on 15 December 1937, he clearly expressed his change of opinion towards the Second Republic: From December 1936 to autumn of 1942, Mara√±√≥n lived abroad, in a de facto exile. Back in Spain again, the dictatorship (as it did with other intellectuals) used his figure to improve its exterior image. In overall terms, the Francoist state respected him. Miguel Artola, in 1987, stated that the biggest political contribution of Mara√±√≥n was clearly having raised the flag of freedom, in a time where no one or only a few could do it, understanding liberalism as the opposite to a specific political position. In this sense, he would state: His experience as a kind of insider served his knowledge about the Spanish state. After the students riot of 1956, he led, along with Men√©ndez Pidal, protests denouncing the dire political situation under Francoist rule, asking for the return of those exiled. His early contribution to Medicine was focused on endocrinology, in fact him being one of its forefathers. During his first year of graduate school (1909) he published seven works in the Clinical Magazine of Madrid, of which only one was related to endocrinology, about the autoinmune polyendocrine syndrome. In 1910, he published five works, two of them related to endocrinology, about the Addison disease. In following years, his attraction to endocrinology only grew larger. In 1930 he published Endocrinology (printed in Madrid by Espasa-Calpe) and thirty more works in scientific journals on that speciality, of which half were works as the only author, which is remarkable taking into account the political-historical context in which Mara√±√≥n was directly or indirectly involved. He wrote the first treatise of internal medicine in Spain, along with Doctor Hernando, and his book Manual of Etiologic Diagnostic (1946) was one of the most widespread medicine books in the world, because of its new focus on the study of diseases and its copious and unprecedented clinical contributions. Beyond his intense dedication to medicine, he wrote about other topics, such as history, art, travels, cooking, clothing, hairstyle, or shoes. In his works he analysed, creating the unique and unprecedented genre of \\"biological essays\\", the great human passions through historical characters, and their psychic and physiopathologic features: shyness in his book Amiel, resentment in Tiberio, power in The Count-Duke of Olivares, intrigue and treason in politics in Antonio P√©rez (one of the makers of the Spanish \\"black legend\\"), the \\"donjuanism\\" in Don Juan, etc. He was inducted and collaborated in five of the eight Spanish Real Academies. The blueprint of Mara√±√≥n is, in the opinion of Ram√≥n Men√©ndez Pidal, \\"indelible\\", on both the science domain and the relationships he built with his peers. Pedro La√≠n Entralgo recognised as far as five different personalities in this great doctor from Madrid: the doctor Mara√±√≥n; the writer Mara√±√≥n; the historian Mara√±√≥n, that greatly contributed to his \\"universality\\"; the moralist Mara√±√≥n; and the Spanish Mara√±√≥n. What makes his work even more singular is the \\"human\\" perspective that summarizes the multiplicity of domains that he is involved in, partaking in the scientific, ethical, moral, religious, cultural, and historic. He was a doctor for the Royal House, and for plenty of well-known people from the social life in Spain, but above it all he was a \\"beneficence doctor\\" (or of attention to the poorest people) at the Hospital Provincial de Madrid, nowadays called Hospital General Universitario Gregorio Mara√±√≥n, where in 1911 was appointed at his own request in the unit of infectious diseases. Along with this hospital, the biggest in Madrid, his name stands today on several streets and educational institutions all over Spain.  Foundation  The Gregorio Mara√±√≥n Foundation was established on 11 November 1988, with the aim of \\"perpetuate the thinking and work of Doctor Mara√±√≥n, spread the high magistrature of Medicine he worked in and promote research in the fields of Medicine and Bioethics\\". Furthermore, \\"it is a cornerstone of the Foundation the localization and recuperation of all the biographic and bibliographic documents to constitute a Documentary Fund available to all the learners who want to analyse and go deeper into the signification and validity of the thinking and work of Gregorio Mara√±√≥n\\". A Mara√±√≥n Week is annually held since 1990. The Mara√±√≥n Week of 1999 was devoted to the topic of emotion, in 2000, held in Oviedo, was devoted to Benito Jer√≥nimo Feijoo, in 2001, to the figure of don Juan, in 2002, held in the University Hospital Complex of Albacete, to the \\"Medical Work of Mara√±√≥n\\", in 2006, held in Valencia, to \\"Luis Vives: Spanish humanist in Europe\\" and in 2009, to the \\"liberal tradition\\". On 9 July 2010 the Jos√© Ortega y Gasset Foundation and the Gregorio Mara√±√≥n Foundation fused, creating a sole organization: the Jos√© Ortega y Gasset-Gregorio Mara√±√≥n Foundation, also known as the Ortega-Mara√±√≥n Foundation. However, the website of the new foundation, which still stands as http://www.ortegaygasset.edu, barely reveals any activity or interest related to Mara√±√≥n.  Ateneo of Madrid  It could be taken into consideration that it was not the Foundation, but the Ateneo of Madrid, who celebrated the 50th anniversary of the death of Mara√±√≥n, on 19 October 2010. In 1924 Mara√±√≥n \\"had been promoted to president of the Ateneo by acclamation of his partners, that viewed him as his true president, but his presidency was de facto because the dictatorship of Primo de Rivera did not allow the electoral session. After the factious assembly , not recognised by the associates, Mara√±√≥n was appointed as president of the Ateneo in March of 1930.\\"  Legacy  Mara√±√≥n‚Äôs sign is named after him, a clinical sign that increases the suspicion of a substernal goiter in patients.

Nauheim is located southwest of Frankfurt am Main and is part of the metropolitan region of Frankfurt. It lies in the Hessian Ried.  Geography  = Location = Nauheim lies 3 km northwest of the district seat of Gro√ü-Gerau 16 km northwest of Darmstadt and 6 km southeast of R√ºsselsheim. After the Second World War, many instrument makers from the Sudetenland such as W. Schreiber + S√∂hne found a new home in this community in the southern Frankfurt Rhein-Main Region, and helped give the place the epithet Musikgemeinde ‚Äì \\"Music Community\\". It is also well known for its \\"Nauheimer Musiktage\\" (\\"Nauheim Music Days\\"), held since 1970. = Neighbouring communities = Nauheim borders in the north on K√∂nigst√§dten, a constituent community of the town of R√ºsselsheim, in the east on the town of M√∂rfelden-Walldorf, in the south on the town of Gro√ü-Gerau and in the west on the community of Trebur.  History  * Nauheim had its first documentary mention in 830-850 in the Lorsch codex.  Manufacture of Saxophones  Schreiber & Keilwerth Musikinstrumente GmbH, a firm manufacturing saxophones are based in Nauheim as of 2010. Additionally, another saxophone manufacturer called D√∂rfler & J√∂rka was located in Nauheim between 1949 to 1968.http://doctorsax.biz/dorflerjorka.htm D&J; had a close and complicated relationship with Keilwerth. D&J; were originally employed as subcontractors for Keilwerth, making saxophone bodies and other component parts, then sending them back to the nearby Keilwerth factory for final assembly. Eventually, D&J; started to manufacture their own complete saxophones (without any Keilwerth involvement) before supplying them directly to German musical instrument retailers as well as the export market. Saxophones manufactured by D√∂rfler & J√∂rka for distribution direct to retailers featured their own key mechanisms which were very closely modelled on Keilwerth designs, though not completely identical. It is important to note that D&J; saxophones are not Keilwerth \\"stencils\\", but rather are nearly identical copies of Keilwerths from the same era e.g. they have rolled tone holes and are high quality, professional-grade instruments. As a result the tonal characteristics of D√∂rfler & J√∂rka saxophones are very similar to Keilwerth instruments and share the distinctive Keilwerth sound i.e. have the same \\"dark\\", \\"smoky\\", \\"punchy\\" and \\"woody\\" Keilwerth tone colours, compared to the \\"brighter\\" and more neutral sound of, say, Yamaha saxophones. Not surprisingly, it can be very difficult to distinguish the sound of D&J; instruments from Keilwerth-manufactured saxophones dating from the same time period e.g. the Keilwerth 'New King' and 'Tone King' models. Engraving on the bell of a D√∂rfler & J√∂rka tenor saxophone Rolled tone holes on the bell of a 'Roxy' tenor saxophone, made by D√∂rfler & J√∂rka in Germany circa 1955 D√∂rfler & J√∂rka tenor saxophone (engraved as 'Boucet') in its original case, dating from circa 1964 D&J; manufactured alto and tenor saxophones exclusively. There is no evidence of soprano or baritone saxophones ever being produced by them. Unusually for a saxophone manufacturer, D√∂rfler & J√∂rka rarely had their own name engraved on their instruments. The majority of D&J; saxophones were engraved with numerous different labelshttp://bassic- sax.info/version5/vintage-saxes/european-made-saxes/dorfler- jorka/http://bassic-sax.ca/blog/?tag=dorfler-jorka including (but not limited to) the following:- *Boucet *Carl Ludwig, Carl Schiller, Clinton, Convair, Condor *De Villiers, Diamond *Gebr.

Eventually, during the late 1960s the Keilwerth company sued D&J; and won their case. D√∂rfler & J√∂rka were subsequently absorbed into the Keilwerth company and production of all D&J; saxophones ended by 1968.

River Oaks Center is the seventh largest in the Chicago metropolitan area totaling . Today, there are over 140 stores and two anchors including JCPenney and Macy's with two vacant anchors last occupied by Carson Pirie Scott and Sears. Namdar Realty Group and Mason Asset Management manages and owns River Oaks Center.  History  It opened in 1966 and was a development of KLC Ventures, a firm that included the pioneering developer Philip M. Klutznick and his son Tom. The elder Klutznick had developed Park Forest, Illinois, after World War II, as well as Oakbrook Center in Oak Brook in 1959 and Old Orchard Shopping Center in Skokie in 1956. River Oaks originally opened as an outdoor mall with one minor and two major department stores. The original anchors were Marshall Field's, which built a store, Sears, and a branch of Edward C. Minas Company, which was based in nearby Hammond, Indiana. Other major stores included a Jewel supermarket and Osco Drug at the south end, and a S. S. Kresge dime store next to Sears. Kresge closed in 1987 and became a movie theater, while the closure of Jewel made way for a McDonald's restaurant and a second theater complex. Many of the stores in the mall in its first 20 years were outposts of Chicago retailers, including Chas A. Stevens, Kroch's and Brentano's and C.D. Peacock. Carson Pirie Scott took over the Edward C. Minas store in 1982. In 1985, the mall was expanded when JCPenney moved its store from downtown Hammond, Indiana, to the northwest portion of the mall's parking lot. A new wing was also built to connect JCPenney to the mall and a food court was added on the enclosed lower level. Expansion In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the then owner, JMB Corp. of Chicago, had several plans to expand and enclose the outdoor mall. These plans included adding a second level and possibly a fifth department store at the end of the southeastern wing of the mall. These plans coincided with Chicago's Lake Calumet Airport which would have been just a few miles north of the mall and would have transformed the area around the mall into an office and business hub. However, these plans never materialized and finally, in 1993, JMB began a smaller version of the redevelopment which included additional retail space and enclosing the common areas mall. In 1994, the redevelopment was completed. The mall was enclosed and of gross leasable area was added. New retailers opened at the mall and the tenant mix became more upscale bringing in some retailers who had not yet located in the Southern Suburbs. The mall's size was brought up to making it the largest mall in the South Suburbs. Carson Pirie Scott closed in January 2013. Sears closed on June 9, 2013. On June 4, 2020, JCPenney announced that it would be closing as part of a plan to close 154 stores nationwide. However as of August 2020, this store is no longer on the closing list and will stay open for now.https://www.nwitimes.com/business/jc-penney-to-close-at-river-oaks- center/article_e0ea716b-7dfb-5ae0-98bd-97a4590c8fb9.html Bus routes  Pace * 353 95th/Dan Ryan CTA/Calumet City/Homewood https://www.pacebus.com/route/353 * 358 Torrence https://www.pacebus.com/route/358 * 364 159th Street https://www.pacebus.com/route/364 References Category:Shopping malls established in 1966 Category:Calumet City, Illinois Category:Shopping malls in Cook County, Illinois Category:1966 establishments in Illinois Category:Namdar Realty Group ","title":"River Oaks Center"},{"id":"5670253","text":"Weinb√∂hla is a municipality in the district of Mei√üen, in the Free State of Saxony, Germany.

They are one of the easiest toads to recognize in their region because of their appearance looking more like a frog. Sometimes, they have light striping on their backs.  Evolutionary/Phylogenic relationships  The origins of Lissamphibia are not finalized. This has a lot to do with the fact that early stem amphibians were a lot more like amniotes in terms of biology. Much of amphibian biology appears to be derived evolution. The earliest known fossil of a burrowing frog is likely Prospea holoserisca. The most basal extant frog species are in the Archeabatrachia suborder. The most primitive frog is arguably Leiopelma. Salienta fossils are the earliest examples of anurans that show a split from Order Caudata. Examples include Triadobatrachus and Czatkobatrachus. Because amphibians might actually be highly derived, this could explain why their fossil record is poor. Multilocus sequence typing has proposed a Late Carboniferous/Early Permian origin around 270 mya.  Geographical distribution and conservation status  This species is found throughout the Midwest from Alberta to Mexico wherever there is suitable soil for a fossorial lifestyle. The species is listed by IUCN 2015 as \\"least concern\\" and appears to be expanding its range, at least northwards into Alberta, Canada.  Ecology, Behaviour and Physiology  Spea bombifrons are famous for thriving in xeric environments, but a related species, Scaphiopus holbrookii has similar adaptation but does not live in similar extreme environments. The adults of this species is primarily fossorial for most of the year, but terrestrial during warm, wet periods. It only enters the water for breeding when nocturnal temperatures are at their yearly maximums and within 2‚Äì3 days of rain. The tadpoles hatch from eggs after 2 days and metamorphose within 2 weeks. Froglets hide in cracks and shade and live off stored tissue in their tails until they can start feeding as adults. Frogs can only live where the ground is suitable for burrowing, and reproduce within 1 km of where they aestivate. Like all frogs, they are immobilized by low temperatures. This species prefers to burrow near large objects such as logs or rocks. They near a water source, but this can be a subterranean patch of wet sand. They have many predators, especially the hognose snake (Heterodon nasicus). Garter snakes predate most tadpoles, but often are not found in the desert, preferring riparian habitats. Many birds are opportunistic predators including burrowing owls and most wading birds. The tadpoles are also predated on by cannibal morphs, dragonfly larvae, giant scavenger beetles, and mosquito fish. Occasionally the will be eaten by Swainson's hawk and burrowing rodents. There have been a few parasites reported in at least 1 study: Polystoma nearcticum, Aplectana incerta, Aplectana itzocanensis, and Physaloptera spp.  Behavior  Plains spadefoot toads are nocturnal and secretive. They spend most of the dryer seasons buried in the soil in estivation, typically only emerging during spring and fall rains. Breeding takes place in temporary pools of water left by rainfall, which requires the tadpoles to metamorphose quickly, before the water dries up. Eggs, laid in clutches numbering from 10-250, often hatch within 48 hours of being laid, and the larvae can change into tadpoles in as little as two weeks. The tadpoles exhibit phenotypic plasticity, with some changing from an omnivorous morphology into a cannibalistic carnivorous morph with oversized jaw muscles and pronged beaks. In some cases, female spadefoot toads will choose to mate with Spea multiplicata rather than with males of their own species, if the resulting hybrid tadpole would have higher chances of survival. Character displacement has also been examined in ponds where Spea bombifrons and Spea multiplicata occur together. Reproductive and ecological competition between the two species likely causes selection for smaller and less reproductively successful individuals of Spea multiplicata. The adults travel by short hops and are generally poor swimmers. They swim in short bursts and only during periods of reproduction. this species is presumed to be non territorial and solitary except during breeding season. Satellite males have been shown to attempt to intercept females arriving at a breeding pond and are successful in about 20% of cases. Dominant, or first arriving males signal vocally from the deepest part of the ephemeral pool. Amplexus is a necessary stimulus to release eggs. Once the eggs are fertilized, there is little apparent parental care. The adults are strictly live insectivores. The tadpoles are detritivores, either scavengers or herbivores depending on morph Tadpole \\"nests\\" can bee seen in most xeric amphibians, and are well described in the fossil record, such as at the St. George Dinosaur Discovery site. The shallow depressions are a form of \\"vortex feeding\\" used to stir up debris for feeding. It is also theorized that the depressions formed could allow a lengthened hydroperiod to increase growth size.  Sensory modalities  Both tadpoles and adults have many senses. Studies support a theory that olfactory sense is important to tadpoles of this species. Adult breeding frogs detect breeding ponds by using auditory cues from other frog calls to gauge distance, size of pool, likelihood of predators and numbers as well as breeding condition of other frogs. Sources say frogs use low frequency sound of rain as a cue to emerge from aestivation. While olfactory cues are considered a secondary emergence stimulus, there is evidence in other anurans that the smell of emergent plant growth can also guide frogs to breeding sites, specifically pond weed species. Persistent emergent behaviour has been observed personally when a piece of moss was placed in an enclosure of two captive Spea bombifrons. Anuran tadpoles almost always have evidence of neuromasts arranged in lateral lines, although these only exist in adults of fully aquatic species, of which there are surprisingly few. There is poor research on how tadpoles use this sensory input during development. Frog hearing is pretty unique in that the lungs act as amplifiers for the hearing. Their columella-operculum complex has been theorized as a method they can use to detect earthquakes. Frogs have a unique form of green rods in their retinas which is theorized to help them see at very low light levels.  Physiology  Frogs in general, but fossorial frogs specifically are able to absorb water through a \\"seat patch\\" instead of drinking. The skin is selectively permeable via aquaporins, allowing them to absorb water from damp ground, standing water, and mossy substrates. According to David Pfenning's lab at the University of North Carolina, Desert spadefoots appear able to not only adapt their bodies to a carnivorous diet (Shorter gut, protein-digesting genes are activated) but also are more likely to have progeny that are adapted to meat. This is a major study that shows that Lamarckian characteristics are not as disproven as once thought. Both Spea species found in North America have been used for many years in the North Carolina lab of Karin Pfennig as model organisms to study hybridization and its effects on competition and evolution. The results appear to be mixed, but there is evidence of resource competition being linked to species divergence.

He started his career as an army officer under the Tang dynasty eunuch generals Yang Fuguang and Tian Lingzi, eventually seizing control of the modern Sichuan and Chongqing region, founding his state after Tang's destruction.  Background  Wang Jian was born in 847, during the reign of Emperor XuƒÅnzong of Tang. He was from Wuyang (ËàûÈôΩ, in modern Luohe, Henan), and was said to be ambitious and alert in his youth. However, he was also described to be a hoodlum, abandoning his ancestral craft of baking to be involved in butchering cattle, stealing donkeys, and privateering in salt. His father died while he was still a commoner. At one point, for misdeeds, he was incarcerated at the jail at Xuchang (Ë®±Êòå, in modern Xuchang, Henan), the capital of Zhongwu Circuit (), which Wuyang sat in, but the jailers privately released him. He subsequently stayed with the monk Chuhong () in the Wudang Mountains, and Chuhong encouraged him to change his ways, predicting that there would be great accomplishments in his future. He thus joined the Zhongwu Circuit army and became an officer under then-military governor (Jiedushi) Du Shenquan.Spring and Autumn Annals of the Ten Kingdoms (ÂçÅÂúãÊò•Áßã), vol. 35.  Early career  = Service under Yang Fuguang = As of 881, the major agrarian rebel Huang Chao had captured the Tang capital Chang'an, forcing then-reigning Emperor Xizong to flee to Chengdu. Zhongwu's then-military governor Zhou Ji initially submitted to Huang, who established a new state of Qi as its emperor, but at the urging by the eunuch general Yang Fuguang redeclared allegiance to Tang in summer 881. Yang took 8,000 Zhongwu troops and organized them into eight corps, commanded by Lu Yanhong, Jin Hui (), Wang Jian, Han Jian, Zhang Zao (), Li Shitai (), and Pang Cong () respectively. He then took the troops northwest to join the other Tang troops in campaign against Huang.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 254. = Service under Lu Yanhong = Yang Fuguang died in 883 while stationed at Hezhong Circuit (Ê≤≥‰∏≠, in modern Yuncheng, Shanxi) and still fighting against Huang. Instead of continuing to fight against Huang, Lu Yanhong decided to take his troops and rove around the region, pillaging as he went.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 255. Wang Jian, Han Jian, Zhang Zao, Jin Hui, and Li Shitai followed him as well.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 256. Later in 883, Lu captured Xingyuan (ËààÂÖÉ, in modern Hanzhong, Shaanxi) the capital of Shannan West Circuit (), expelling the military governor Niu Xu () and claiming the title of acting military governor. He commissioned Wang and the other Zhongwu corps commanders as prefects within Shannan West, but did not allow them to actually report to their prefectures. He was particularly suspicious of Wang and Han because of their deep friendship, but wanting to comfort them, he often treated them well. Wang and Han realized Lu's intentions, however, and in fall 884, with Emperor Xizong's trusted eunuch Tian Lingzi secretly tempting them with offers of good treatment, they, along with Zhang, Jin, and Li, abandoned Lu and fled to Chengdu to serve under Tian. = Service under Tian Lingzi = Tian Lingzi subsequently reorganized the Zhongwu troops that Wang Jian and the others commanded into a group of imperial guards directly under Tian's command, while sending imperial troops to attack Lu Yanhong, defeating him and forcing him to abandon Shannan West. Tian also adopted Wang and the others as his sons. Meanwhile, with Huang Chao having been defeated earlier, Emperor Xizong returned to Chang'an, in spring 885, with Tian and his troops accompanying him. Soon after Emperor Xizong returned to Chang'an, however, Tian got into a major dispute with Wang Chongrong the military governor of Hezhong over control of two salt ponds at Hezhong, which Tian wanted to use the revenue from to support the imperial Shence Armies. Wang Chongrong refused to yield control, and soon, a full confrontation between Tian and his allies (Zhu Mei the military governor of Jingnan Circuit (ÈùúÈõ£, headquartered in modern Xianyang, Shaanxi) and Li Changfu the military governor of Fengxiang Circuit (È≥≥Áøî, headquartered in modern Baoji, Shaanxi)) and Wang Chongrong and his ally Li Keyong the military governor of Hedong Circuit (Ê≤≥Êù±, headquartered in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi) occurred. In winter 885, Wang Chongrong's and Li Keyong's forces defeated those of Tian, Zhu, and Li Changfu. As Li Keyong's forces approached Chang'an, Tian escorted Emperor Xizong and fled again, initially to Fengxiang and then to Xingyuan when Zhu and Li Changfu also turned against him. During this flight, with Emperor Xizong's flight path blocked by waves of refugees, Wang Jian and Jin cleared the path, killing all in their way, to allow Emperor Xizong through, and during the confusion, Emperor Xizong had Wang Jian bear the imperial seal, and at night slept on Wang Jian's knees. With Tian realizing that the whole empire was against him by this point, he resigned while Emperor Xizong was at Xingyuan, recommending Yang Fuguang's brother Yang Fugong to succeed him as the commander of the Shence Armies, while having himself commissioned as the eunuch monitor of Xichuan Circuit (Ë•øÂ∑ù, headquartered at Chengdu) to join his brother Chen Jingxuan the military governor of Xichuan. Yang Fugong, not wanting Tian's trusted officers near him, had Wang, Jin, Zhang, and Li Shitai all sent out to prefectures to serve as prefect, with Wang becoming the prefect of Li Prefecture (Âà©Â∑û, in modern Guangyuan, Sichuan). After Yang Fuguang's adoptive son Yang Shouliang became military governor of Shannan West in spring 887, Wang became titularly his subordinate. = Service under Yang Shouliang = Yang Shouguang was apprehensive about Wang Jian's fighting ability and tried to summon him to Xingyuan several times, but Wang, fearful of Yang's intentions, refused the summons. At the suggestion of his subordinate Zhou Xiang, who pointed out that Li Prefecture was not an ideal defense position, he attacked Lang Prefecture (Èñ¨Â∑û, in modern Nanchong, Sichuan), expelled the prefect Yang Maoshi (), and took over Lang, claiming the greater title of defender. At the advice of Zhang Qianyu () and Qiwu Jian (), he submitted humble petitions to Emperor Xizong and comforted the people. He also entered into friendly relations with Gu Yanlang the military governor of Dongchuan Circuit (Êù±Â∑ù, headquartered in modern Mianyang, Sichuan), as the two were colleagues previously at the Shence Armies. = Campaign against Chen Jingxuan = Chen Jingxuan, however, feared the close alliance between Gu Yanlang and Wang Jian and was worried that Gu and Wang would attack him. He discussed the situation with Tian Lingzi. Tian opined that he, as Wang's adoptive father, could summon Wang and make him serve under Chen. Chen agreed and allowed Tian to do so in winter 887. Wang, after receiving the summons, was initially happy about the summons. He, leaving most of his family at Dongchuan's capital Zi Prefecture () with Gu, took 2,000 men, along with his nephew Wang Zonghui () and his adoptive sons Wang Zongyao (), Wang Zongbi, Wang Zongkan (), Wang Zongji, and Wang Zongbian (), and headed toward Chengdu. While Wang was en route to Chengdu, however, Chen's subordinate Li Ai () convinced Chen that Wang was not to be trusted, and Chen decided to try to stop Wang's advance. Wang, in anger, refused, defeating officers that Chen sent to stop him and advancing all the way to Chengdu. He was unable to capture it quickly, even with the assistance of Gu Yanlang's brother Gu Yanhui, so both he and Gu Yanhui withdrew to Han Prefecture (Êº¢Â∑û, in modern Deyang, Sichuan). Their hostilities continued, despite efforts by Emperor Xizong to mediate. It was said that Wang's army pillaged all 12 prefectures of Xichuan Circuit.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 257. However, Wang's attacks were stifled by Chengdu's strong defenses, and his supplies soon ran low. By summer 888, he considered abandoning the campaign altogether, but after Zhou Xiang and Qiwu Jian convinced him otherwise, continued the campaign. He, believing that he needed imperial sanction in order to succeed in the campaign, had Zhou draft a petition for him to Emperor Zhaozong ‚Äî Emperor Xizong's brother, who succeeded Emperor Xizong after Emperor Xizong died early in 888 ‚Äî asking to be given the rich Qiong Prefecture while asking the emperor to send a new military governor of Xichuan, offering to assist the new military governor. Gu Yanlang also submitted a petition requesting that Chen be moved from his post. Emperor Zhaozong, who had previous grudges against Tian and Chen for Tian's ill treatment of him while he was an imperial prince, issued an edict summoning Chen back to Chang'an to serve as an imperial guard general, while making the chancellor Wei Zhaodu the new military governor of Xichuan. When Chen subsequently refused the summons, Emperor Zhaozong stripped him of all of his titles and put Wei in charge of the operations against him, with Yang Shouliang, Wang, and Gu assisting him. Emperor Zhaozong also carved out four prefectures from Xichuan and made it into a new Yongping Circuit, with its capital at Qiong, for Wang to serve as military governor. In spring 890, Wang put Qiong Prefecture under siege. Around the same time, Wei arrived in Chengdu's vicinity, and Wang outwardly honored him greatly. A number of prefectures began to submit to Wang, and in winter 890, Qiong fell to him, allowing him to use Qiong as his basis of operations.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 258. However, in spring 891, with imperial forces having recently conducted a failed campaign against Li Keyong and the imperial treasury drained, Emperor Zhaozong decided to abandon the campaign against Chen. He restored Chen's titles and ordered Gu and Wang to return to their posts at Dongchuan and Yongping. Wang, believing that Chengdu was on the verge of falling, decided to disobey the imperial orders and continue the campaign. He intimidated Wei by having Dongchuan soldiers arrest and execute Wei's associate Luo Bao () on charges of corruption, and Wei transferred the command of the army to him. Wang continued the siege against Chengdu, and a famine began in the city. In fall 891, after Wang made assurances that he would continue to respect Chen and honor Tian as a father, Chen and Tian surrendered Chengdu. Emperor Zhaozong soon made Wang the military governor of Xichuan, merging Yongping back into Xichuan.  As military governor of Xichuan  = Campaign against Dongchuan = It was said that Wang Jian, after he took over Xichuan, ruled it diligently, listened to good advice, promoted capable people, put people in rightful positions, and was humble and frugal. However, he was also said to be suspicious, and that many subordinates with accomplishments suffered deaths due to his suspicions of them. Around the same time that Wang took over Xichuan, his ally Gu Yanlang died, and Gu Yanhui succeeded Gu Yanlang as the acting military governor of Dongchuan. Emperor Zhaozong was ready to commission Gu Yanhui as the full military governor, but Yang Shouliang reacted by sending his brother Yang Shouhou () to attack Dongchuan, trying to take it over. Wang sent his officers Hua Hong, Li Jian (), Wang Zongkan, and Wang Zongbi to aid Gu ‚Äî with secret instructions to, once they repelled the Yangs' attack, seize Gu Yanhui and take over Dongchuan at a feast that Gu would surely be holding in their honor. After Wang Zongkan defeated Yang Shouhou and forced his withdrawal, Gu was ready to hold such a feast ‚Äî but Wang Zongbi leaked the plot to Gu, causing Gu to cancel the feast and eventually ending the alliance between Wang and Gu. Meanwhile, Tian Lingzi's and Chen Jingxuan's remaining subordinate Yang Sheng (), who continued to hold Peng Prefecture (ÂΩ≠Â∑û, in modern Chengdu) and holding out against Wang, tried to jointly attack Wang with Yang Shouliang, but Li Jian repelled Yang Sheng and killed his officer L√º Yao () in spring 892. Wang then sent his nephew Wang Zongyu (), Wang Zongkan, Wang Zongyao, and Hua to attack Peng Prefecture. When Yang Shouliang tried to send troops to aid Yang Sheng, Hua intimidated Yang Shouliang's officer Fu Zhao () into withdrawing. Hua subsequently attacked Lang Prefecture and defeated Yang Shouliang there, too.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 259. Meanwhile, in 893, Gu entered into an alliance with Li Maozhen the military governor of Fengxiang Circuit, and Li Maozhen sent troops to aid Gu. However, after Wang then defeated Fengxiang and Dongchuan troops at Li Prefecture, Gu sought peace against with Wang, claiming to be willing to break relations with Li Maozhen, and Wang agreed. Around the same time, Emperor Zhaozong bestowed on Wang the honorary chancellor title of Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangzhi (). Meanwhile, Wang had repeatedly sought permission to execute Chen and Tian, and when imperial permission never came, Wang executed them anyway. By 894, Peng Prefecture was suffering from a famine due to the siege that Wang's forces had placed on it. Yang Sheng could not hold the defense any further, and it fell. Yang Sheng tried to fight still, but was killed in battle. His territory was merged back into Xichuan. Meanwhile, when Yang Shouhou, who was then the prefect of Mian Prefecture (Á∂øÂ∑û, in modern Mianyang) died in fall 894, with Yang Shouliang having been defeated by Li Maozhen by that point and his territory largely taken by Li Maozhen, Yang Shouhou's officer Chang Zairong () surrendered Mian to Wang. In 895, Li Maozhen, Han Jian (who was then the military governor of Zhenguo Circuit (ÈéÆÂúã, in modern Weinan, Shaanxi)), and Wang Xingyu the military governor of Jingnan Circuit, jointly attacked Chang'an, seizing and killing the former chancellors Wei Zhaodu and Li Xi (whom they considered hostile to their agenda). In reaction, Li Keyong launched his troops and headed for Chang'an, claiming to be coming to the emperor's aid. Wang also launched his troops, put Wang Zongyao in command, and had them stationed at Mian Prefecture, claiming to be coming to the emperor's aid as well. Wang then claimed that Gu was cutting off his path and declared a campaign against Gu. (Meanwhile, Li Keyong defeated and killed Wang Xingyu, forcing Li Maozhen and Han to, for the time being, resubmit to the imperial government.) Hua spearheaded Wang's attack against Dongchuan, and over the next few years, Wang's Xichuan forces gradually stripped Gu's territory prefecture by prefecture, despite Emperor Zhaozong's attempt to mediate. In 896, when Li Maozhen again attacked Chang'an, forcing Emperor Zhaozong to flee to Zhenguo to depend on Han, Wang submitted a petition for Emperor Zhaozong to move the capital to Chengdu, while Yang Xingmi the military governor of Huainan Circuit (Ê∑ÆÂçó, headquartered in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu) submitted a petition for Emperor Zhaozong to move the capital to Huainan; neither idea was implemented.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 260. In 897, Wang again launched a major attack on Dongchuan, commanded by Hua and another adoptive son, Wang Zongyou (), while sending Wang Zongjin () to attack Fengxiang to cut off any relief forces that might come from Fengxiang, and Wang Zongjin defeated Li Maozhen's adoptive son Li Jihui. When Li Maozhen subsequently sent Li Jizhao () to try to relieve Dongchuan, Wang Jian's adoptive son Wang Zongbo () defeated and captured him. Around the same time, Wang Zongkan and Wang Zongruan () captured the Three Gorges region, opening a trade path to the east down the Yangtze River.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 261. In summer 897, Wang Jian took 50,000 men and joined the attack against Dongchuan himself. Li Maozhen reacted by submitting a petition against Wang Jian for failing to follow imperial orders to stop his attacks against Gu. Emperor Zhaozong, wanting to exploit the situation himself, issued an edict demoting Wang to be the prefect of Nan Prefecture (ÂçóÂ∑û, in modern Chongqing), while naming Li Maozhen the new military governor of Xichuan and Li Sizhou () the Prince of Qin as the new military governor of Fengxiang ‚Äî hoping to take control of Fengxiang back into imperial hands. Both Wang and Li Maozhen refused the orders, and Li Maozhen reacted by blocking Li Sizhou's advance, forcing Li Sizhou to return to Zhenguo. Emperor Zhaozong soon thereafter restored Wang Jian's titles. Wang Jian's siege of Zi Prefecture put Gu in dire straits. In winter 897, Gu had his adoptive son Gu Yao () kill his entire family and then commit suicide. Wang Jian took over Dongchuan and made Hua (whom he formally took as an adoptive son, with the new name of Wang Zongdi) the acting military governor of Dongchuan. The imperial government initially tried to make the official Liu Chongwang () the military governor of Dongchuan, but upon hearing that Wang Jian had already commissioned Wang Zongdi, gave up the attempt and allowed Wang Zongdi to take over as acting military governor (and later, full military governor). (Subsequently, at Wang Zongdi's suggestion (that Dongchuan was too large to be a single circuit), Wang Jian requested, and the imperial government approved, the division of Dongchuan into two circuits, with five prefectures carved out into a Wuxin Circuit (), with its headquarters at Sui Prefecture (ÈÅÇÂ∑û, in modern Suining, Sichuan).) = After seizing Dongchuan = In spring 900, Emperor Zhaozong gave Wang Jian the greater honorary chancellor title of Zhongshu Ling (). Soon thereafter, he also granted Wang Jian the title of commander over Dongchuan and Wuxin as well.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 262. He also created Wang the Prince of Langye. In 901, Wang Zongdi offered to resign on account of illness, and Wang Jian sent Wang Zongyu to Dongchuan to replace him. Later in the year, when the Taoist priest Du Congfa () started a rebellion with the people of Chang (ÊòåÂ∑û, in modern Chongqing), Pu (ÊôÆÂ∑û, in modern Ziyang, Sichuan), and He (ÂêàÂ∑û, in modern Chongqing) Prefectures. Wang Jian sent his adoptive son Wang Zong'an to attack Du, but Wang Zongkan subsequently suppressed Du's rebellion. Late in the year, the eunuch Han Quanhui, fearing that Emperor Zhaozong and the chancellor Cui Yin were planning to massacre the eunuchs, seized Emperor Zhaozong. Cui, in response, summoned Zhu Quanzhong the military governor of Xuanwu Circuit (ÂÆ£Ê≠¶, headquartered in modern Kaifeng, Henan) to bring an army to Chang'an. As Han was allied with LI Maozhen, he forcibly took Emperor Zhaozong to Fengxiang. Zhu then put Fengxiang under siege, claiming that he wanted to restore the emperor to the proper place in Chang'an. Both Zhu and Li Maozhen sought an alliance with Wang Jian. Wang played both sides ‚Äî outwardly announcing agreement with Zhu, while secretly sending messengers to Li Maozhen urging him to resist Zhu ‚Äî and yet at the same time sent Wang Zongji and Wang Zongdi north, seeking to seize the prefectures south of the Qinling Mountains that Li Maozhen still controlled. By spring 902, Li Maozhen's adoptive son Li Jizhong () the military governor of Zhaowu Circuit (Êò≠Ê≠¶, headquartered at Li Prefecture) abandoned Li Prefecture, allowing Xichuan forces to seize it. Subsequently, Wang Zongbo and Wang Zongdi captured Xingyuan, and Li Maozhen's adoptive son Li Jimi (), then the military governor of Shannan West, was forced to surrender as well. Wang Jian initially made Wang Zongdi the military governor of Shannan West, but subsequently, getting reports from Wang Zongji that made accusations against Wang Zongdi, and fearing that Wang Zongdi was both loved by the soldiers, he summoned Wang Zongdi back to Chengdu and had him strangled. He made another adoptive son, Wang Zonghe (), the acting military governor of Shannan West. Subsequently, Li Sijing () the military governor of Wuding Circuit (Ê≠¶ÂÆö, headquartered in modern Hanzhong) surrendered as well. By this point, Wang Jian had captured all of Li Maozhen's former territory south of the Qinling Mountains, partially leading to Li Maozhen's subsequent agreement in 903 with Zhu to kill Han and his associates and to give the emperor to Zhu in return for lifting the siege on Fengxiang.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 263. After Emperor Zhaozong returned to Chang'an, Cui and Zhu ordered that all eunuchs be massacred. However, Wang protected Yu Quanyan () the eunuch monitor for Xichuan and the prominent retired eunuch Yan Zunmei () from execution, instead executing two inmates that he claimed to be Yu and Yan.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 264. Later in 903, Wang Jian entered into a peace agreement with Zhu. Subsequently, Emperor Zhaozong created Wang the greater title of Prince of Shu. Soon thereafter, at the suggestion of his adoptive son Wang Zongben (), Wang Jian had Wang Zongben lead an army east on the Yangtze River, intending to capture Jingnan Circuit (ËçäÂçó, headquartered in modern Jingzhou, Hubei). At that time, the military governor of Jingnan, Cheng Rui, had just been killed in battle against Yang Xingmi's forces, and so Cheng's subordinate, Hou Ju (), surrendered Kui Prefecture (Â§îÂ∑û, in modern Chongqing) to Wang Zongben, allowing Wang Jian to take over Kui, Zhong (Âø†Â∑û, in modern Chongqing), Wan (Ëê¨Â∑û, in modern Chongqing), and En (ÊÅ©Â∑û, in modern Enshi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture, Hubei) as well. However, believing that the Qutang Gorge would serve as a good natural defense, Wang Jian decided to make no further attempt to capture Gui () and Xia () (both in modern Yichang, Hubei) as well. He made Wang Zongben the acting military governor of Wutai Circuit (Ê≠¶Ê≥∞, headquartered in modern Chongqing) to govern over the region. In 904, Zhu, wanting to put the emperor even firmer under control as a prelude to usurping the throne, forcibly moved Emperor Zhaozong from Chang'an to Luoyang. Emperor Zhaozong sent secret messengers to Wang Jian, asking him to come to the emperor's aid. Wang Jian sent Wang Zongyou north, claiming to be wanting to rendezvous with Fengxiang forces and jointly rescue the emperor, but when Wang Zongyou encountered Xuanwu forces, he abandoned the campaign. Thereafter, though, Wang Jian began to be issuing imperial edicts in the name of the emperor, claiming that he was temporarily taking imperial authority until the emperor would return to Chang'an (which Emperor Zhaozong would eventually never be able to do). Another subsequent secret edict issued by Emperor Zhaozong to Wang, Yang, and Li Keyong also drew no further response from Wang immediately. Later in the year, when Zhao Kuangning the military governor of Zhongyi Circuit (Âø†Áæ©, headquartered in modern Xiangfan, Hubei) attempted to capture the Jingnan prefectures that Wang had seized earlier, Wang Zongruan repelled Zhao's attack. Zhang Wu () the prefect of Wan Prefecture further built an iron chain across the Yangtze, intending to secure it from further invasion from the east. Meanwhile, believing that it would be advantageous to enter into an alliance with Li Maozhen for Li Maozhen to serve as a protective neighbor to the north, Wang Jian did so in early 905, and also jointly issued a declaration with Li Maozhen and Li Maozhen's adoptive son Li Jihui the military governor of Jingnan condemning Zhu. Thereafter, Wang gave his daughter in marriage to Li Maozhen's nephew LI Jichong () the military governor of Tianxiong Circuit (Â§©ÈõÑ, headquartered in modern Pingliang, Gansu), and often supplied Li Maozhen's army from this point on. At the suggestion of Feng Juan (), who believed that Wang's tax burdens were too high, Wang reduced the tax burdens on the people.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 265. Soon thereafter, a marriage alliance was also concluded between Wang Jian and Zhao. Alarmed by the situation, Zhu Quanzhong attacked Zhao, defeating him and annexing his territory, forcing Zhao to flee to Huainan, while Zhao's brother Zhao Kuangming fled to Wang Jian. Around the same time, Wang sent another adoptive son, Wang Zonghe (), to attack Feng Xingxi the military governor of Zhaoxin Circuit (Êò≠‰ø°, headquartered in modern Ankang, Shaanxi). Feng fled, and his subordinate Quan Shilang () surrendered Zhaoxin's capital Jin Prefecture (). Wang adopted Quan as a son (renaming him Wang Zonglang () and made him the governor of Jin Prefecture and three other surrounding prefectures. Meanwhile, Emperor Zhaozong had been assassinated by Zhu's soldiers and replaced by his son Emperor Ai. Zhu disavowed involvement, and subsequently sent messengers in Emperor Ai's name to various circuits to announce Emperor Zhaozong's death. When the messenger to Xichuan, Sima Qing (), arrived at Xichuan, Wang, under the suggestion of Wei Zhuang, refused to meet with Sima; rather, he had his adoptive son Wang Zongwan (), then the military governor of Wuding, meet with Sima, and Wang Zongwan publicly stated, on Wang Jian's behalf, openly breaking with Zhu: In late 906, Wang also official established a mobile imperial government, with himself as its head. He ceremonially danced toward the east (in a sign of respect to the emperor) and stated that he was exercising authority on the emperor's behalf, under the precedents of Li Sheng and Zheng Tian. In 907, Zhu Quanzhong (who had changed his name to Zhu Huang by that point) forced Emperor Ai to yield the throne to him, ending Tang and establishing a new Later Liang. Most of the circuit governors in the former Tang emperor, whether actually under Zhu's authority or not, recognized Zhu as the new emperor, with the exceptions of Wang, Li Keyong (the Prince of Jin), Li Maozhen (the Prince of Qi), and Yang Xingmi's son and successor Yang Wo (the Prince of Hongnong). Wang and Yang initially issued declarations claiming that they would rendezvous with Li Keyong and Li Maozhen to reestablish Tang, but the other circuits who recognized Zhu did not respond. Wang thereafter decided that he should claim imperial title as well and tried to encourage Li Keyong to do so as well; Li Keyong refused, but that did not sway Wang, and neither did contrary advice from Feng Juan. Wang thereafter declared himself emperor of a new state of Shu (known to historians as Former Shu to distinguish it from the later Later Shu).  As Emperor of Shu  = Early reign = It was said that while Wang Jian was illiterate, he favored talking with the intelligentsia, and was often retaining members of Tang aristocratic families so that they could pass on their knowledge. However, as his oldest son Wang Zongren () was disabled from his childhood, he created his second son Wang Zongyi initially the Prince of Sui while creating no other son imperial princes, hinting that Wang Zongyi was to be his heir. (He would not create his other sons imperial princes until late 910; a few, but not most, of his adoptive sons would be created imperial princes as well then.)Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 267. Wang Jian made Wang Zongji and Wei Zhuang his chancellors. However, Wang Zongji viewed himself as the oldest among the adoptive sons and a potential heir, and he was arrogant toward all other officials, including Wang Jian's close associate Tang Daoxi the director of palace communications. In 908, unhappy about this situation, Wang Jian gave Wang Zongji the honorific title of Taishi () but stripped him of his chancellor status, replacing him with Zhang Ge. When Wang Zongji submitted a petition in which he challenged Wang Jian to name either him or Wang Zongyi crown prince, Wang Jian was offended; when Wang Zongji further offended him at a face-to-face meeting, Wang Jian had Wang Zongji put to death and then created Wang Zongyi crown prince. In late 908, Qi, Former Shu, and Jin forces launched a joint attack on Chang'an, but after the Later Liang generals Liu Zhijun and Wang Zhongshi () defeated Qi forces, the Former Shu and Jin forces withdrew. Also in 908, Wang Jian created his wife Lady Zhou empress. He would also create his concubines Consort Zhang (Wang Zongyi's mother) Guifei and two Consorts Xu (who were sisters) Xianfei and Defei respectively; he thereafter favored the Consorts Xu greatly. In 910, Wang Zongyi and Tang began to have disputes with each other. Not wanting to see an open struggle between them, Wang Jian sent Tang out of the capital to serve as the military governor of Shannan West. Meanwhile, he continued his alliance with Qi, sending Qi such supplies as tea, silk, and textiles, but when Li Maozhen requested that he cede Ba (Â∑¥Â∑û, in modern Bazhong, Sichuan) and Jian (ÂäçÂ∑û, in modern Guangyuan) Prefectures, he refused. In 911, though, the Shu-Qi alliance would break up over marital relations ‚Äî as Wang's daughter, who had married Li Jichong and whom Wang had created the Princess of Puci, wrote a letter to Wang complaining of Li Jichong's arrogance and drunkenness. Wang thus summoned her back to Chengdu, ostensibly just to visit the family. When she arrived at Chengdu, he kept her and refused to return her to Li Jichong. Li Maozhen, in anger, broke off the alliance with Shu. Later in the year, Li Maozhen amassed troops on the Shu-Qi border. Wang Jian reacted by mobilizing a large force and commissioning Wang Zongkan as the overall commander, with Wang Zongyou, Wang Zonghe, and Tang as his deputies, to counteract the Qi move. Qi forces subsequently attacked Xingyuan but were repelled by Tang. Wang Jian himself headed for Li Prefecture, while leaving Wang Zongyi in command at Chengdu. After several victories by Shu forces over Qi forces, Wang Jian returned to Chengdu and left Wang Zonghui in charge at Li Prefecture. After he did, however, Li Jichong and Liu Zhijun (who had by this point surrendered to Qi and was serving as a Qi general) jointly attacked Xingyuan, nearly capturing it. Wang Jian sent Wang Zonghui and Wang Zongbo to relieve the siege, and they defeated Qi forces in conjunction with Tang. However, Qi forces continued to threaten Xingyuan and the nearby Anyuan Base (), and it was not until Wang Jian himself went to Xingyuan late in the year to aid the Xingyuan and Anyuan forces that Shu forces were able to decisively defeat Qi forces, forcing them to withdraw. (Hearing of the war between Qi and Shu, Zhu Quanzhong wanted to take advantage of it, and sent messengers to Wang Jian, calling him \\"older brother.\\" There was no record of what Wang Jian's reactions were.)Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 268.Spring and Autumn Annals of the Ten Kingdoms, vol. 36. = Late reign = In 913, Tang Daoxi returned from Shannan West and again served as director of palace communications. His old rivalry with Wang Zongyi (whose name had been changed to Wang Yuanying by this point) soon flared up, as Wang Yuanying accused him of crimes that made it inappropriate to again serve that point. Wang Jian, while displeased, gave Tang the honorary post of advisor to Wang Yuanying instead. In fall 913, Wang Jian planned a vacation away from Chengdu for the Qixi Festival. Also for the occasion, the night before Wang Yuanying held a feast for the imperial princes and high-level officials, but three invitees ‚Äî Wang Jian's adoptive son Wang Zonghan () the Prince of Ji, and the officials Pan Qiao (ÊΩòÂ≥≠, who succeeded Tang as the director of palace communications) and Mao Wenxi (the chief imperial scholar) ‚Äî did not attend. Wang Yuanying, in anger, accused Pan and Mao in absentia of alienating his brothers from him. Meanwhile, Wang Yuanying's trusted officers Xu Yao () and Chang Qian () were gazing at Tang. Tang, in fear, fled from the feast. The next day, both Wang Yuanying and Tang made accusations against each other, and the accusations soon flared up into military confrontations, as Wang Jian agreed to Tang's request to mobilize the regular troops to defend the palace (rather than the imperial guards, who were formally under Wang Yuanying's command). Upon hearing that the regular troops had been mobilized, Wang Yuanying mobilized his own Tianwu Army () and attacked Tang. Tang initially resisted, but tried to retreat when an arrow hit him. The crown prince's troops then routed his, killing him, and many of the troops under Tang were killed. In response, at Pan Kang's suggestion, Wang Jian summoned his adoptive sons Wang Zongkan (), Wang Zonghe (), and Wang Zonglu (), ordering them to launch an attack against Wang Yuanying's troops. They did so, along with another adoptive son, Wang Zong'an (). They killed Xu in battle. Chang and Wang Yuanying fled to Longyao Pond () and hid on a boat there. The next morning, Wang Yuanying came out of hiding and requested food from the boat owner. This was reported to Wang Jian, and he dispatched Wang Zonghan to try to comfort Wang Yuanying. However, before Wang Zonghan arrived at Longyao Pond, Wang Yuanying was killed by his own guard. Wang Jian initially mourned Wang Yuanying bitterly, but later decided that without declaring Wang Yuanying a renegade, he could not comfort the people, and therefore demoted Wang Yuanying to commoner rank, although, apparently at Wang Jian's direction, Wang Zonghan had Wang Yuanying's killer executed. Many of Wang Yuanying's associates were killed or exiled. Late in the year, Wang Jian considered whom to create as the new crown prince, as Pan repeatedly requested him to. He initially considered Wang Zonglu () the Prince of Ya, whom he considered most like himself, and Wang Zongjie () the Prince of Xin, whom he considered the most talented. However, Consort Xu the Xianfei wanted her son Wang Zongyan the Prince of Zheng, the youngest, created crown prince. She thus entered into an alliance with Tang Wenyi () the overseer of the imperial stables and Zhang Ge. Zhang falsely informed a number of high-level officials, including Wang Zongkan, that Wang Jian had settled on Wang Zongyan but wanted their public support. He then drafted a petition to have Wang Zongyan made crown prince, and had Wang Zongkan and the others sign the petition. When Wang Jian received the petition, believing that Wang Zongyan did have the high- level officials' support, he, despite his doubts about Wang Zongyan's abilities, created Wang Zongyan crown prince. In 914, Gao Jichang the Later Liang military governor of Jingnan Circuit wanted to attack Former Shu to recapture the four prefectures that previously belonged to Jingnan. He first started by attacking Kui Prefecture. The prefect of Kui Prefecture, Wang Chengxian (), despite the refusal by his superior Wang Zongshou () the Prince of Jia (Wang Jian's nephew) to provide supplies, was able to repel the Jingnan attack. When he subsequently tried to submit a secret report to Wang Jian accusing Wang Zongshou of holding back supplies, though, Wang Zongshou intercepted the report, arrested him, and executed him. Later in the year, Wang considered reacting by destroying a dam to flood Jingnan, but at Mao's urging, under the argument that there would be too many civilian casualties, he did not do so. Also late in 914, when Changhe (also known as Nanzhao) attacked Li Prefecture (ÈªéÂ∑û, in modern Ya'an, Sichuan), Wang Jian sent his adoptive sons Wang Zongfan () and Wang Zongbo, as well as Wang Zongshou, to respond, and they defeated Changhe forces, forcing their withdrawal. When Wang Zongfan, Wang Zongbo, and Wang Zongshou considered further advancing into Changhe territory, Wang Jian recalled them. It was said that thereafter, Changhe did not dare to again attack Shu territory.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 269. In fall 915, Wang Jian launched a major attack against Qi, sending Wang Zongwan, assisted by Wang Zongbo, to attack Qin Prefecture (Áß¶Â∑û, the capital of Tianxiong), and Wang Zongyao, assisted by Wang Zonghan, to attack Feng Prefecture (È≥≥Â∑û, in modern Baoji). Both attacks were successful, as Feng Prefecture fell, and Li Jichong surrendered Qin. With his wife and children among the captives at Qin, Liu Zhijun, who was commanding Qi forces in resisting the Shu attack, also surrendered, leaving Qi with little more territory than its capital Fengxiang. In fall 916, Wang Jian prepared another major attack against Qi, sending Wang Zongwan, assisted by Wang Zonghan and Wang Zongshou to launch their attack from Feng, while sending Wang Zongbo, assisted by Liu, Wang Zongchou (), and Tang Wenyi's brother Tang Wenyi (ÂîêÊñáË£î, note different character), to launch their attack from Qin. They captured Baoji (ÂØ∂Èõû, in modern Baoji) and put Fengxiang under siege. The siege, however, was hampered by snowstorms, and Wang Jian decided to lift the siege and recall the forces. He then declared a change of the state's name from Shu to Han. In 917, a power struggle developed between Tang Wenyi, who was aligned with Zhang, and Mao. Based on Tang's accusations, Wang Jian exiled Mao and confiscated his assets, and also demoted the chancellor Yu Chuansu. Also, fearing Liu's abilities, he falsely accused Liu of treason and executed Liu. In early spring 918, Wang Jian changed the name of the state from Han back to Shu. That year, Wang Jian, who began to see that Wang Zongyan (whose name was changed to just Wang Yan by that point so that his brothers and adoptive brothers would not have a problem observing naming taboo) was not an appropriate crown prince due to Wang Yan's obsession with gaming and feasting, and thus became resentful of Zhang ‚Äî but with Consort Xu supporting Zhang, he did not remove Zhang from his chancellor post. He did, however, consider replacing Wang Yan with Wang Zongjie. When Wang Zongjie died suddenly, he became very suspicious that the death was the result of foul play, but thereafter took no further action to replace Wang Yan. Wang Jian became very ill in summer 918, and he summoned a group of high-level officials to entrust Wang Yan to them. Tang, however, wanted to eliminate the high-level officials so that he could take power by himself. The high-level officials realized this, and they forced their way into the palace to inform Wang Jian. Wang Jian thus exiled Tang, while issuing a final edict in which he put the eunuch Song Guangsi (), as well as Wang Zongbi, Wang Zongyao, Wang Zongwan, and Wang Zongkui () in charge of assisting Wang Yan in his reign. He also left instructions that the family of Consort Xu's family was not to be given military commands. He soon died, and Wang Yan took the throne as emperor.

It is a Grade II listed building. The house and garden are owned by the National Trust and are open to the public.Hinton Ampner. The National Trust, 2008. History Garden, Hinton Ampner House The garden was created by Ralph Stawell Dutton (1898‚Äì1985), the 8th and last Baron Sherborne, starting in 1930, making this a modern 20th-century garden. The property is now more noted for its garden than the house. Previously, the parkland came directly up to the house, which was designed to be a hunting lodge. An earlier Tudor house stood close to the current site, before the present-day house was built. Hinton Ampner was built in 1790 but remodelled extensively in 1867. It was remodelled again in the Neo-Georgian style by Trenwith Wills and Lord Gerald Wellesley for Ralph Dutton between 1936 and 1939 to his vision of what it would have been like had it been built on its current scale in 1790 ‚Äì a Georgian country house. It was badly damaged by fire in 1960, and restored again much as it had appeared in 1936. The house contains a number of fine paintings. There is a set of paintings of the four seasons by Jacob de Wit, depicting cherubs painted in a three-dimensional monochrome style. Ralph Dutton, with no direct heirs, gave the estate to the National Trust, on his death in 1985. Poltergeist claims The old Tudor house attained notoriety, in the 18th century, after it was said to have become uninhabitable due to loud noises attributed to a poltergeist. One tenant, Mary Ricketts, wrote about her experiences in the house. That house was pulled down in 1793, after its replacement had been built about to the south. Harry Price citing Ricketts' statements wrote at length about the case in his book Poltergeist Over England (1945). Claims about the poltergeist were disputed by Trevor H. Hall who suggested that \\"underground water was mainly responsible for the noises at Hinton, although the account of some of them is highly suggestive of seismic disturbance.\\"Hall, Trevor H.

The present tower of the station is 406 feet (124 Meters) tall and the station is a 24-hour operation transmitting with a power output of 1,000 watts. 1230 AM is a Class C local channel within the lower 48 states. History =The beginning= The first license issued to this radio station‚Äîlater moved to the Calumet Area‚Äîwas on November 12, 1923, with Dr. George F. Courier and Lawrence J. \\"Butch\\" Crowley, a reputed Joliet mobster, as the licensees. The original callsign of this station was WWAE. The license was renewed on May 27, 1925, as Electric Park (Plainfield, Illinois) with L. J. Crowley as the sole licensee. A transmitter was then built at the Alamo Dance Hall in Joliet, Illinois. The transmitter was later moved to 915 North Raynor Boulevard, Joliet with broadcasting facilities located at 321 Clinton Street, Joliet. The broadcast facilities were moved shortly after that to the Hammond Douglas Park Area, where today it is known as Pulaski Park. A small studio was built on the northwest side of the park. From there, the broadcasting facilities were moved to a main studio at 402 Fayette Street, Fayette and Hohman Avenue, which today sits the former home of Bank Calumet (Calumet National Bank Building). =The WJOB era= It remained at that address until the station was sold to O.E. Richardson, Fred L. Adair, and Robert C. Adair, and the callsign was changed to the present WJOB on October 7, 1940. The new owners then moved the main studios to 449 State Street, above the Millikan Building, across from the Edward C. Minas Department Store, and the name of the Corporation was changed to The South Shore Broadcasting Corporation. It was during this time, that the station grew in popularity offering a variety of programming under the leadership of Sam Weller as the Programming Director. Some of the programs offered were the Happy Hour, which had a membership of 1,200 young members and was broadcast every Saturday morning from 10:30 to 11:30 am under the direction of Mrs. O.E. Richardson, the wife of one of the owners. The new programming schedule was also included interesting programs in five foreign languages, including Eddie Oskierko of the Polish Musical Varieties Program, Cornelius Szakatis, of the Hungarian Hour, John Babinec of the Slovac Hour, Stella Lutefisk directing the Greek Hour, and Gilbert Vasquez as the director of the Spanish Program. Included in this schedule of programming were Eddie Honesty of the \\"Rockin-In-Rhythm\\" program, the first black program on WJOB heard every Wednesday from 3:15 to 4 o‚Äôclock and also Saturday afternoons from 2 to 3 o‚Äôclock. Paul E. X. Brown, the only black newscaster in the country, was heard every Sunday at 10 a.m. Included in the programming were the Rev. Odell Reed, who conducted his services from 4635 State Street in Chicago, the first remote broadcast of radio station WJOB. Also included were Rev. William Carr and Clarence Parsons, with the Royal Quartet singing the well loved Negro spirituals. One of the most popular shows of that era was the Sun-Dodgers show which featured daily from Midnight until 4 a.m. with Wayne Osborne as the announcer and Dave Erickson as its director. Not to be outdone, Women‚Äôs programming was conducted by Miss Kitty Blake who produced the ‚ÄúIt Happened in Hammond‚Äù program daily at 11:15 a.m. and Frances Benson read stories for children each Friday at 1:15 p.m. Also featured at the time were all Lake County High Schools who took part in the ‚ÄúHigh Schools On Parade Program‚Äù heard every Thursday. The station remained at 449 State Street in downtown Hammond until May 5, 1956 when it erected a new tower and broadcasting facility at 6405 Olcott Avenue in the Woodmar section of Hammond where it remains there still today. =The 1960s= On December 30, 1960, the ownership of the station was sold to Julian Colby and became The Colby Broadcasting Corporation. Judy Grambo started a program called \\"The Ladies Program\\" and eventually became the President and Station Manager of WJOB. Mr. Colby and Ms. Grambo would guide the station to prominence for 26 years. =The 1970s-1990s= Until just before the end of the century, WJOB continued as a regional staple for local news and information. Personalities Larry Peterson, and later Thurm Ferree, Mike Bonaventura, Greg Doffin and others continued to provide quality local programming for WJOB's audience, just as did Irv Lewin until his 1995 death. As the 1990s drew to a close, however, WJOB floundered soon after M&M; Broadcasting, owners for the past 13 years, ceded control of the station to George and Norma Stevens of St. George Broadcasting. Through staff changes, as it tried to continue to be relevant to local trends and demands, treasured local personalities were dismissed. By the early 2000s, WJOB had all but gone off the air. =The 2000s= The station was purchased by a partnership composed of Vazquez Development LLC and Ric Federighi in 2004. Several local and syndicated programming formats have aired. Steven 'The Preacher' Glover, hosted a very popular afternoon show. The September 2008 Northwest Indiana flood catapulted WJOB back into the local consciousness with its 24-hour coverage of emergency evacuations and local leaders' messages to the public. WJOB continued to relay important notices about the flood and host several local leaders to give their views of the natural disaster. WJOB also revived its tradition of hosting politicians with its coverage of then Democratic candidate Barack Obama's rallies in Gary, Indiana and Highland, Indiana at Wicker Memorial Park. With this rebirth, WJOB recommitted itself to local broadcasting with nearly 90% local programming. Syndicated shows such as Dave Ramsey and Lou Dobbs would fill the remaining ten percent. Listener- assisted concepts such as the Citizens Traffic Authority and the Community Programming Initiative gave WJOB's local audience an unprecedented role in on- air participation. By the end of 2010, all syndicated programming had been forgone and live local programming became the station's focus. WJOB boasted nearly eighteen hours of live local programming with the remainder being dedicated to \\"Region Flashbacks,\\" archived soundbites from previous shows. As of April 2012, WJOB reintroduced syndicated programming with The Mike Huckabee Show. WJOB continued as the \\"Sports Voice of the Region\\" with its dedication to local and Big Ten sports events and was one of the first local radio stations to broadcast WFA (Women's Football Association) games featuring the Chicago Force and Collegiate Baseball League baseball featuring the NWI Oilmen games. WJOB has been a member of the Purdue University Sports Broadcast Network since the 1960s and continues to broadcast Purdue football and men's basketball games in season. WJOB broadcasts over 150 local high school baseball, basketball, football, hockey, soccer, and softball games per calendar year, many produced in-house and some as an affiliate of the Regional Radio Sports Network In February 2012, longtime host Steven \\"The Preacher\\" Glover died suddenly at his home. The station, in addition to The Preacher's listeners, mourned his death, and the after-effects left the station in a quandary concerning the popular afternoon slot. In March 2012, comedian Nick Gaza was tapped to host the 4-6 p.m. show. The afternoon show underwent further change in September 2012, when Ron Harlow, Larry \\"the K,\\" and 'Big' George Vincent split hosting duties on the renamed \\"The Afternoon Scramble.\\" As of February 2013, the afternoon slot was filled with \\"The Afternoon Fix\\" hosted by Ron Harlow. In the fall of 2013, WJOB re-joined the Indiana University Sports Radio Network, airing games that are non-conflicting with Purdue University Sports Radio Network broadcasts. Also in the fall of 2013, WJOB began broadcasting out-of-market NFL games and out-of-market NCAA Football games. The studio is located in the Purdue Commercialization & Excellence Center, less than a mile south of the tower and broadcast facility. Current ownership The station is now owned by Vazquez Development LLC. Former station personalities John Whitaker, well-known WJOB sportscaster, is the only man in the country who made play by play broadcasts of Nine Tournament Basketball games in one day, without assistance. He set the record in 1944 and again in 1945. Other personalities who worked at WJOB early in their careers include Jean Shepherd, Frank Reynolds (later with ABC News), Emery King (later with NBC News, WBBM-TV and WDIV-TV), Steve King (later at WLS, now at WGN), Melissa McGurren (now morning traffic reporter for Eric & Kathy on WTMX) Tommy Williams, (formerly of WSCR 670) and Felicia Middlebrooks (now at WBBM.http://www.airwaves.com/archive1/3711.html References External links * WJOB OFFICIAL WEBSITE * *Radio Locator Information for W284CY *A Short History of AM Radio Broadcast Pioneer WWAE, Electric Park Plainfield, Illinois JOB Category:Radio stations established in 1923 ","title":"WJOB (AM)"},{"id":"5670331","text":"M√∂glingen is a municipality in the district of Ludwigsburg, Baden-W√ºrttemberg, Germany.

In addition to all 50 states, the BRFSS is also conducted by health departments in The District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Individual states can add their own questions to the survey instrument, which consists of a core set of questions on certain topics like car safety, obesity, or exercise. States get funding from the federal government to administer these questionnaires, and they pay for the additional questions themselves. The U.S. federal government can then compare states based on the core questions to allocate funding and focus interventions. The states themselves also use the survey results to focus interventions for the public and to decide what is worth their while to focus on.

Common commercial and industrial practices use dimensioned versions which are of equal utility. Specific speed is most commonly used in pump applications to define the suction specific speed ‚Äîa quasi non-dimensional number that categorizes pump impellers as to their type and proportions. In Imperial units it is defined as the speed in revolutions per minute at which a geometrically similar impeller would operate if it were of such a size as to deliver one gallon per minute against one foot of hydraulic head. In metric units flow may be in l/s or m¬≥/s and head in m, and care must be taken to state the units used. Performance is defined as the ratio of the pump or turbine against a reference pump or turbine, which divides the actual performance figure to provide a unitless figure of merit. The resulting figure would more descriptively be called the \\"ideal-reference-device-specific performance.\\" This resulting unitless ratio may loosely be expressed as a \\"speed,\\" only because the performance of the reference ideal pump is linearly dependent on its speed, so that the ratio of [device-performance to reference-device- performance] is also the increased speed at which the reference device would need to operate, in order to produce the performance, instead of its reference speed of \\"1 unit.\\" Specific speed is an index used to predict desired pump or turbine performance. i.e. it predicts the general shape of a pumps impeller. It is this impeller's \\"shape\\" that predicts its flow and head characteristics so that the designer can then select a pump or turbine most appropriate for a particular application. Once the desired specific speed is known, basic dimensions of the unit's components can be easily calculated. Several mathematical definitions of specific speed (all of them actually ideal-device- specific) have been created for different devices and applications.  Pump specific speed  Low-specific speed radial flow impellers develop hydraulic head principally through centrifugal force. Pumps of higher specific speeds develop head partly by centrifugal force and partly by axial force. An axial flow or propeller pump with a specific speed of 10,000 or greater generates its head exclusively through axial forces. Radial impellers are generally low flow/high head designs whereas axial flow impellers are high flow/low head designs. In theory, the discharge of a \\"purely\\" centrifugal machine (pump, turbine, fan, etc.)is tangential to the rotation of the impeller whereas a \\"purely\\" axial-flow machine's discharge will be parallel to the axis of rotation. There are also machines that exhibit a combination of both properties and are specifically referred to as \\"mixed-flow\\" machines. Centrifugal pump impellers have specific speed values ranging from 500 to 10,000 (English units), with radial flow pumps at 500-4000, mixed flow at 2000-8000 and axial flow pumps at 7000-20,000. Values of specific speed less than 500 are associated with positive displacement pumps. As the specific speed increases, the ratio of the impeller outlet diameter to the inlet or eye diameter decreases. This ratio becomes 1.0 for a true axial flow impeller. N_s = \\\\frac { n \\\\sqrt Q } { (gH)^{ 3/4 } } where: :N_s is specific speed (dimensionless) :n is pump rotational speed (rpm) :Q is flowrate (l/s) at the point of best efficiency :H is total head (m) per stage at the point of best efficiency Note that the units used affect the specific speed value in the above equation and consistent units should be used for comparisons. Pump specific speed can be calculated using British gallons or using Metric units (m3/s or L/s and metres head), changing the values listed above. The following equation gives a dimensionless specific speed. N_s = \\\\frac { n \\\\sqrt Q } { (gH)^{ 3/4 } }  Net suction specific speed  The net suction specific speed is mainly used to see if there will be problems with cavitation during the pump's operation on the suction side. It is defined by centrifugal and axial pumps' inherent physical characteristics and operating point. The net suction specific speed of a pump will define the range of operation in which a pump will experience stable operation . The higher the net suction specific speed, then the smaller the range of stable operation, up to the point of cavitation at 8500 (unitless). The envelope of stable operation is defined in terms of the best efficiency point of the pump. The net suction specific speed is defined as: N_{ss} = \\\\frac{n\\\\sqrt{Q}} {{NPSH}_R^{0.75}} where: :N_{ss} = net suction specific speed :n = rotational speed of pump in rpm :Q = flow of pump in US gallons per minute :{NPSH}_R = Net positive suction head (NPSH) required in feet at pump's best efficiency point  Turbine specific speed  The specific speed value for a turbine is the speed of a geometrically similar turbine which would produce unit power (one kilowatt) under unit head (one meter).http://www.thermopedia.com/content/859/ The specific speed of a turbine is given by the manufacturer (along with other ratings) and will always refer to the point of maximum efficiency. This allows accurate calculations to be made of the turbine's performance for a range of heads. Well-designed efficient machines typically use the following values: Impulse turbines have the lowest ns values, typically ranging from 1 to 10, a Pelton wheel is typically around 4, Francis turbines fall in the range of 10 to 100, while Kaplan turbines are at least 100 or more, all in imperial units. n_s=n\\\\sqrt{P}/H^{5/4} (dimensioned parameter), n = rpm where: :\\\\Omega = angular velocity (radians per second) :H_n = Net head after turbine and waterway loss (m) :Q = water flow (m¬≥/s) * N = Wheel speed (rpm) * P = Power (kW) * H = Water head (m) =English units= Expressed in English units, the \\"specific speed\\" is defined as ns = n /h5/4 * where n is the wheel speed in rpm * P is the power in horsepower * h is the water head in feet =Metric units= Expressed in metric units, the \\"specific speed\\" is ns = 0.2626 n /h5/4 * where n is the wheel speed in rpm * P is the power in kilowatts * h is the water head in meters The factor 0.2626 is only required when the specific speed is to be adjusted to English units. In countries which use the metric system, the factor is omitted, and quoted specific speeds are correspondingly larger. =Example= Given a flow and head for a specific hydro site, and the RPM requirement of the generator, calculate the specific speed. The result is the main criteria for turbine selection or the starting point for analytical design of a new turbine. Once the desired specific speed is known, basic dimensions of the turbine parts can be easily calculated.

Service dress uniform is the informal type of uniform used by military, police, fire and other public uniformed services for everyday office, barracks and non-field duty purposes. It frequently consists of a jacket, trousers, white dress shirt, and neck tie, sometimes for ceremonial occasions along with orders and medals insignia. Design may depend on regiment or service branch, e.g. army, navy, air force, marines, etc. In Western dress codes, service dress uniform is a permitted supplementary alternative equivalent to the civilian suit - sometimes collectively called undress or \\"dress clothes\\". As such, service dress uniform is considered less formal than both full dress uniform and mess dress uniform, but more formal than casual wear combat uniform. Service dress uniforms were originally worn on active service in the field or at sea, but became relegated to office, barracks, and walking out dress as more practical field uniforms evolved. In some parts of some armed forces such as the British Army, service dress uniform may also be used for ceremonial occasions, gradually replacing in this role the full dress uniforms that had preceded them as field uniforms. In the United States Navy, for example, service dress uniforms are worn for official functions not rising to the level of full dress uniform or mess dress uniform. They are also commonly worn when travelling in official capacity, or when reporting to a command. They may be seasonal, with a white uniform worn in summer and darker versions in winter. The American Service Dress Blue may be worn year round for travel only. Service dress uniform by country =Canada= Members of the Royal Canadian Air Force and Royal Canadian Navy wearing their service's respective No. 3B Service Dress uniforms Although the Canadian Armed Forces is a single service, its respective environmental commands maintain \\"distinctive environmental uniforms,\\" distinct for its specific environmental branch (including the Canadian Army, the Royal Canadian Air Force, and the Royal Canadian Navy). Service dress is listed as No. 3 Service Dress in the Canadian Armed Forces order of dress. The order of dress may be further split into five variant. The complete service dress uniform, known as No. 3 Duty includes the service's headgear, neck tie, name tag. The uniform's jacket, trousers, and collared shirt, are coloured in the style of their environmental command. A skirt may be used by females members in place of trousers. Service dress with a long-sleeve collared shirt and no jacket is known as No. 3A, while service dress with a short-sleeved collared shirt and no jacket is No. 3B. Wearing an authorized sweater over the collared shirt, instead of a jacket is known as No. 3C. No. 3D Service Dress is the Canadian Armed Forces tropical service dress, and is similar in wear to No. 3B, except it is coloured in tan; and shorts may be worn in place of trousers. = Israel = Members of the Israeli Defence Force in their olive-green Madei Alef service dress uniform. When founded in 1948, only khaki combat uniforms were issued to the Israeli Defence Force Ground Arm. In April, 1948, the first military parade was held, in which soldiers wore the Hittlemacher hat, a square cap with a flap at the back to protect the neck from sun exposure. A winter uniform similar to British Army No. 2 Dress was introduced in the 1950s, and uniforms similar to British Army Barrack Dress was often worn for ceremonial parades from the 1950s and 1960s. For female soldiers, these uniforms included skirts, brown dress shoes (known as Golda shoes for Golda Meir) and caps similar to those worn by airline stewardesses known as rooster caps.Cut from the Same Cloth: A Look Back at the IDF's Uniforms. IDF Blog Presently, the Madei Alef uniforms serves as the IDF's service dress uniform. Made out of rayon, the uniforms consist of a shirt, trousers, sweater, jacket or blouse, and shoes or boots. The general service dress uniform is coloured olive-green, although the Madei Alef uniforms used by the Israeli Sea Corps and Air Force are coloured beige. =United Kingdom= British Army General Sir Nicholas Houghton dressed in the British Army's No. 2 Service Dress. The British Army has issued khaki Service Dress uniforms for use in the field shortly after the Second Boer War, in the early 1900s. Since World War II, the uniform has been referred to as No. 2 Dress, with the tunic being swapped out for a jacket with an open collar for wear with collared shirt and tie. Berets may be worn in place of a peaked cap. Additionally, officers of the British Army are authorized to wear a second variant of service dress, known as No. 4 Warm Weather Service Dress. The uniform is similar to No. 2 Service Dress, except it is stone grey coloured, made from a polyester/wool worsted mix. No. 4 Service Dress is typically worn on warm-weather formal occasions not including parades. =United States= The five service branches of the United States Armed Forces each maintain their own variant of service dress. United States Air Force The first service dress uniforms used by the United States Air Force were known as \\"Uxbridge Blue\\" and were developed and manufactured at the former Bachman Uxbridge Worsted Company in Uxbridge, Massachusetts. The United States Air Force Auxiliary (Civil Air Patrol), is authorized by Congress to wear the United States Air Force uniform since it was recognized as a department of it in 1942. United States Army Members of the United States Army modelling the Class A Army Service Uniform. The United States Army authorizes a blue uniform known as Army Service Uniform, which serves as the service dress uniform for officers and warrant officers since 1956. It was also authorized for wear by enlisted men and women at their own expense when off duty. The Army blue uniform comprises a dark-blue coat, light-blue or dark-blue (general officers) trousers, a white turndown-collar shirt, black four-in-hand or double Windsor necktie, a black beret, and often a ceremonial belt. When worn with a black bow tie, the Army blue uniform constitutes a formal uniform and corresponds to a civilian tuxedo. When worn with a black four-in-hand or double Windsor necktie, the Army blue uniform is an informal uniform. The uniform's colours are based on the traditional colours used by most Continental/U.S. Army uniforms from 1774 until 1902, with the introduction of khaki and olive drab relegating dark blue tunics and light blue trousers for full dress use and off duty wear until 1917. From 1954 to 2006, Green Service Uniform were used as the primary service dress uniform in the U.S. Army. In 2006, it was decided that all U.S. Army personnel were to transition to the blue Army Service Uniform. The blue Army Service Uniforms were issued to initial entry training soldiers beginning in the fourth-quarter of fiscal year 2010. In November 2018, the U.S. Army announced the blue Army Service Uniform would be phased out in favour of new Army Greens as a service dress, which are scheduled to be phased out of between 2018 and 2020. United States Coast Guard Members of the United States Coast Guard pose for a photo in service dress blue uniforms. In 1972, the current Coast Guard Service Dress Blue uniform was introduced for wear by both officers and enlisted personnel; the transition was completed during 1974. Relatively similar in appearance to the old-style U.S. Air Force uniforms, the uniform consists of a blue four-pocket single breasted jacket and trousers in a slightly darker shade. Unlike the U.S. Navy, officers and CPO's do not wear khaki; all personnel wear the same colour uniform. USCG officers (and 1/c cadets preparing for graduation from the U.S. Coast Guard Academy) are issued Dress Whites for change of command and other formal ceremonies. The Dress White uniform is slightly different for the men's and women's versions - men wear a high stand-collared white tunic, white trousers, and white shoes, while women wear a uniform similar to the Service Dress Blue uniform but with a white coat and skirt or trousers. Both genders wear shoulder boards rather than sleeve stripes, as well as medals (for Full Dress White) or ribbons (for Service Dress White), combination cover, and sword (for Full Dress White). The uniform is nearly identical to the Navy's Full Dress Whites, but the buttons and combination cover device are Coast Guard specific.

Route description Gervais Street Bridge over the Congaree River US Route 1 enters South Carolina in North Augusta. From North Augusta to Aiken, US 1 is a divided four-lane highway. It goes through the historic district of Aiken, heading north through Batesburg-Leesville, Lexington, into Columbia up to Camden. US 1 parallels I-20, crossing it three times until it branches northeast at Camden. It also has junctions with I-26 and I-77 in Columbia. In Richland County, it goes through downtown Columbia along Gervais Street, passing directly in front of the State Capitol building; connecting via Millwood Avenue, it continues northeast along Two Notch Road, named for when the road was marked by posts with two notches carved. From Camden, it continues northeast as a two-lane road to the town of Cheraw and Cheraw State Park before entering the state of North Carolina. The entire route is part of the Jefferson Davis Highway, named after Civil War Confederate leader Jefferson Davis; with exception between North Augusta and Aiken, where US 1 was realigned, leaving SC 421 its section of the highway name. Markers of the highway dot all along the route, though most sections do have other road names too. Though US 1 connects to several urban areas in the state, it has fallen out of favor with most causal and business travelers not seeking to drive along a historic highway, as Interstate travel has generally become a much faster and more efficient means of ground transportation. US Route 1 has thus been replaced as primary route by I-20 and I-95. Most urban areas of US-1 are multi-lane with some sections divided, while the rural areas continue to be two-lane. History US 1 was established in 1927 as an original US route. It traveled generally as it does now, overlapping with SC 12, from North Augusta to West Columbia, SC 2, from West Columbia to Columbia, and SC 50, from Columbia to the North Carolina border. The following year, both SC 12 and SC 50 were dropped along the route. The entire route was paved by 1932. Around 1938, US 1 was rerouted between Cheraw and Wallace, going further north along its now current alignment, leaving behind Hickson Road (S-35-52) and Brickyard Road (S-35-36). The first section widen to four-lane was a section north of Columbia, in 1940. Between 1940-1946, US 1 was rerouted in Columbia; originally using Gervais Street, Assembly Street, Taylor Street, and Two Notch Road, switching to Gervais Street, Harden Street, Taylor Street, and Two Notch Road. By 1952, US 1 was rerouted again in Columbia, switching to Gervais Street, Millwood Avenue, and Two Notch. Also by 1952, US 1/US 78 were given new alignment bypassing Clearwater, Bath, Langley, and Gloverville; the old alignment became SC 421\\\\. By 1957, US 1/US 78 was rerouted from Fifth Street Bridge to its current alignment over the Savannah River.

Birkenfeld has a stop on route S6 of the Karlsruhe Stadtbahn, which operates over the Enztalbahn railway. Geography Birkenfeld is located about from Pforzheim in the Enz river valley at an elevation of to meters above sea level (NHN). Birkenfeld borders Pforzeim and the Enzkreis municipalities of Keltern, Straubenhardt, Neuenb√ºrg and Engelsbrand. The former municipality of Gr√§fenhausen falls within Birkenfeld, therefore placing the villages Gr√§fenhausen and Obernhausen within Birkenfeld. History The earliest known history in Birkenfeld is to be found in grave finds in a Celtic settlement in the municipality dated to 400 BC. Around 100 AD, the area came under the control of the Roman Empire and a Roman estate was built nearby. Birkenfeld was inhabited from 500 AD by the Alemanni and then the Franks. Birkenfeld is first mentioned in a 1302 document. Twenty years it came under the control of the County of W√ºrttemberg, at which time a mill was documented for the first time. The first school in the village was constructed in 1566. Though not destroyed during the Thirty Years' War, Birkenfeld was still plundered. When the Kingdom of W√ºrttemberg reorganized its in 1810, the township was placed under Neuenb√ºrg. Birkenfeld was connected to the traffic of Pforzheim when the Royal W√ºrttemberg State Railways opened the Enz Valley Railway in 1836. Its first industrial enterprise, a branch of Neuenb√ºrg's scythe factory, opened in 1856. THe district reform of 1938 under the Nazi Party placed Birkenfeld under the administration of Calw District.

Lake Dunlap offered mostly calm water due to its narrow size (in parts) and protection from wind by shoreline trees. Wakeboarders, skiers and other recreational enthusiasts used Lake Dunlap daily due to its family friendly calmness, temperature, and status of near-private lake.

It stars Clive Owen, Paul Giamatti, Monica Bellucci, and Stephen McHattie. The film follows Smith (Owen), a drifter who rescues a newborn from being killed by assassin Hertz (Giamatti) and his henchmen. Smith flees from the gang, enlisting the help of prostitute Donna Quintano (Bellucci) to keep the baby safe as he unravels the conspiracy. According to Davis, the idea for the film came about after he saw a gun-battle scene from John Woo's critically acclaimed Hard Boiled in which Chow Yun-fat rescues newborn babies from gangsters. Desiring to make an action film centering on guns, he expanded the idea into a screenplay in 2000, accompanied by an animated footage with 17,000 drawings for the action scenes. After a deal with New Line Cinema, filming began in Toronto. The film was photographed by Hong Kong cinematographer Peter Pau. Before its September 2007 release, the film was previewed at that year's San Diego Comic-Con and received a positive response. Despite a mediocre commercial performance (recouping less than its budget), critical reception to the film was largely favorable. Plot At a bus stop in a rough part of town, a carrot-eating drifter named Smith sees a pregnant woman on the verge of giving birth while fleeing a hitman. Following them into a warehouse, Smith kills the hitman by stabbing him in the face with a carrot and retrieves the woman's pistol. As more thugs arrive the woman goes into labor, and Smith delivers her baby boy during a shootout. Pursued by head assassin Hertz, the woman is shot dead; Smith narrowly escapes with the newborn. Leaving the baby in a park, Smith hopes someone will adopt the child but a passing woman is killed with a shot from Hertz's sniper rifle. Realizing that Hertz is trying to kill the baby, Smith saves him and tries unsuccessfully to leave him with a prostitute named Donna Quintano. Hertz soon arrives at the brothel and tortures Donna for information; Smith returns and kills Hertz's henchmen. After a brief confrontation, Smith shoots Hertz and leaves with Donna and the baby. Having secretly worn a bulletproof vest, however, Hertz is alive albeit wounded. Taking Donna to his hideout, Smith realizes that the baby (whom he names Oliver) stops crying when he hears heavy-metal music; he concludes that Oliver's mother lived near a heavy-metal club. Pursued by Hertz, Smith shoots his way out of the hideout and he and Donna head to a nearby club. Above the club they discover an apartment with medical equipment and two dead, pregnant women; Smith concludes that the women were all impregnated with one man's sperm in order to give birth to matching bone marrow donors. While they are having sex in a motel room, Smith and Donna are attacked by masked men; Smith notices that his assailants' weapons are Hammerson models, unavailable to the public. He brings Donna and Oliver to a war museum and hides them in a M24 Chaffee tank for safekeeping. Smith infiltrates the Hammerson factory, and hears Hertz and Hammerson saying that they do not want the next president to repeal the right to bear arms. He also notices that Hammerson owns a German Shepherd dog named Duchess. Smith booby-traps the facility with an array of firearms, allowing him to kill the thugs and escape. Smith sees an article about Senator Rutledge, a Democratic presidential candidate who favors stricter gun laws. He deduces that Rutledge has cancer and requires a bone- marrow transplant, which is why he had surrogates impregnated with his sperm (and why Hertz and Hammerson want Oliver dead). If the infants die, the senator would not receive a transplant and would be unable to run for president. Smith tells Donna to leave town and contacts one of Rutledge's henchmen to request an appointment. Meeting on an airplane, the senator confirms Smith's suspicions and Smith notices dog hair on Rutledge's trousers. Deducing that the hair belongs to Duchess and that the senator made a deal with Hammerson, Smith takes Rutledge hostage. Hertz appears and reveals that he agreed to help Rutledge find a bone-marrow donor, on the condition that Rutledge protects Hertz's constitutional right to bear arms when elected president. Smith kills the senator, whose assassination he explains \\"will cause public outrage and trigger immense support\\" for his gun control proposals. Smith parachutes from the airplane and kills several pursuing henchmen, but is himself shot and collapses after he lands. He awakens in Hammerson's mansion; Hertz tortures him, breaking his fingers in an attempt to learn where Smith sent Donna and Oliver. As Hertz prepares to cut Smith's eyes, Smith breaks free and kills Hammerson and several thugs. Cornered and struggling to use his gun, Smith places live bullets between his broken fingers and detonates them with a fireplace, critically wounding Hertz. As they grab pistols and struggle, Smith fires first and kills Hertz. Smith boards a bus with Duchess, and stops at an ice-cream parlor where Donna works as a waitress while watching Oliver. Surprised to see each other alive, he and Donna kiss passionately. A group of amateur armed robbers suddenly enters the parlor; his hands in bandages, Smith shoots them by using a carrot to pull the trigger. Cast The protagonist, known only as Smith, is an homage to the Man with No Name of Sergio Leone's Spaghetti Westerns. Smith's misanthropy derived from writer-director Michael Davis's frustration when his 1989 script about Alfred Kinsey failed to materialize as a feature film. His research about Kinsey and human sexuality in general inspired the character of Donna Quintano, a prostitute and Smith's eventual love interest. Hertz, a former FBI profiler who lives a double life as an assassin and a family patriarch, pursues Smith. According to co-producer Susan Montford, the antagonist was modeled after the BTK Killer. Hertz's feud with Smith has been compared to that of Bugs Bunny and Elmer Fudd in Looney Tunes because Smith (like Bugs) spends considerable time eating carrots in the film. Davis acknowledged that the Looney Tunes reference was deliberate. Production John Woo's film, Hard Boiled, significantly influenced the conception of Shoot 'Em Up. Davis had wanted to make an action film which focused on guns and was devoid of explosions. He conceived the film after seeing a scene from John Woo's critically acclaimed action film Hard Boiled (1992), in which star Chow Yun- fat rescues newborn babies from gangsters while engaged in a gunfight. Davis felt that the scene could be expanded into a feature-length film, a \\"gun-like\\" version of Run Lola Run (1998). By 2000, Davis had begun writing the screenplay; when the script was finished, however, studios refused to get it made after the Columbine High School massacre happened, causing him to shelve the project and return to making low-budget independent films. During his subsequent years as an independent filmmaker, Davis started putting together an animatic of the script's action scenes using a Wacom tablet and the iMovie app. The animatic, which he made originally as a hobby, became his pitch animation in finding a producer for the project. He sent the script to Don Murphy, a producer he went to film school with at the USC School of Cinematic Arts, and Murphy as well as co-producers Susan Montford and Rick Benattar enjoyed it. Murphy, Montford and Benattar also saw the film's potential as a big-budget production, so they sent the animatic to major film studio New Line Cinema. New Line executives Jeff Katz and Cale Boyter liked it and they passed it on to Toby Emmerich, who greenlit the project at the behest of New Line founder Bob Shaye. Davis's first choice to play Smith was Clive Owen, who signed as the lead because the script impressed him. The role of Donna went to Monica Bellucci, who liked the script and the character: an independent woman who \\"does dangerous, dark dirty things in a playful way\\". The multilingual Bellucci dubbed herself in the film's French and Italian versions. Davis cast Paul Giamatti, who usually played \\"nice guy\\" roles, against type to avoid the stereotype of a physically imposing villain, and because he believed Giamatti could deliver the duality of the role. Shoot 'Em Up was produced on a budget of $39 million. Principal photography took place in Toronto and lasted fifty- five days, with Hong Kong's Peter Pau serving as cinematographer. Before filming, Owen and Giamatti were trained in firearms. Although he found the stunts physically demanding, Owen resolved to perform most of them himself. In the skydiving scene, he was aided by a Cirque du Soleil safety harness. Eighty firearms were used during production, and $70,000 of the film's budget was allocated for 6,000 squibs. Music The score for Shoot 'Em Up was composed by Paul Haslinger and recorded at NRG Recording Studios in North Hollywood, California. It was released on CD and as a digital download on August 28, 2007, by Var√®se Sarabande. A soundtrack album of nu metal and rock songs by various artists was made available on February 12, 2008. Marketing In July 2007, Shoot 'Em Up was publicized with a guerrilla marketing campaign by the London-based agency New Media Maze. The campaign included a viral video and a website selling bogus items ranging from bulletproof strollers to riot helmets for infants. A video was released on YouTube in which the company claimed to test the bulletproof stroller by shooting at it with a submachine gun while a baby was in it. The baby was then removed from the stroller unharmed. The hoax campaign was taken seriously by global media and the blogging community; Aftonbladet, Sweden's largest evening tabloid, carried the story on its online edition for some time. In November 2007, two ads that showed Owen and Giamatti holding guns were banned in the United Kingdom by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) on the grounds that they had \\"glamorized and glorified gun crime\\" and \\"were offensive and insensitive toward families directly affected by gun crime\\". At the time of the ruling, it was also reported that gun violence in the UK was on the rise. Release Although Variety reported a planned release during the 2006 holiday season, Shoot 'Em Up was previewed in September of that year. The film was released in American theaters on September 7, 2007. It was released on the same day in Canada, opening on 235 screens against 3:10 to Yuma. Audience response to a screening at the 2007 San Diego Comic-Con was positive. Shoot 'Em Up opened in fourth place on its first weekend, earning $5,716,139 at 2,108 locations. Overall, the film grossed $12,807,139 over six weeks in North American theaters and $26,820,641 worldwide. It was regarded as a box-office failure, recouping less than its budget. The film's DVD and Blu-ray versions were released in January 2008 by New Line Home Entertainment with a behind-the-scenes featurette titled \\"Ballet of Bullets\\", 17 minutes of animatics and audio commentary from director Michael Davis, trailers and deleted scenes. New Line released another DVD and Blu-ray of the film in a two-disc version in August 2011. Critical response Rotten Tomatoes gives the film an approval rating of 67%, with an average rating of 6.15 out of 10, based on reviews from 161 critics. The website's \\"Critics Consensus\\" for the film reads, \\"As preposterous and over- the-top as Shoot 'Em Up may be, its humor and non-stop action make for a very enjoyable film.\\" On Metacritic it has a weighted average score of 49 out of 100, based on reviews from 23 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore during its opening weekend gave the film an average grade of \\"B‚àí\\" on a scale ranging from A+ to F. Peter Travers, who scored the film 3 out of 4 stars for Rolling Stone, called it \\"eighty-two minutes of hardcore pow. [...] You'll be exhilarated - also exhausted.\\" Roger Ebert for the Chicago Sun-Times scored the film 3 out of 4 stars, comparing it favorably with Sin City as \\"the most audacious, implausible, cheerfully offensive, hyperactive action picture [he had] seen\\". Frank Scheck in The Hollywood Reporter called the film a \\"ramped-up action movie on steroids\\" that \\"makes Hard Boiled look restrained\\". Ebert extended his praise toward the film's acting, calling Owen's character sympathetic and Giamatti's \\"surprisingly, teeth-gnashingly evil\\". Scheck said Owen played his character \\"like a low-rent James Bond\\", and was delighted to see Giamatti cast against his usual \\"nerdy\\" on-screen persona. A. O. Scott gave it a scathing review for The New York Times, and called the film \\"a worthless piece of garbage\\" and said that it was one of several \\"witless, soulless, heartless movies that mistake noise for bravura and tastelessness for wit\\". Stephen Hunter in the Washington Post said the film \\"is just gunfights strung together, without a whisper of coherence or meaning. The fights are staged so that they all look the same, and the principle is always the same: The gunman's multiple antagonists never hit, and he never misses.\\" James Berardinelli gave the film a mixed review, saying that while it delivered gunfights as advertised, he complained that it \\"pretty much consists of shoot-outs and chases overtaking each other like waves rolling onto a beach, each more over-the-top than its predecessor\\". Berardinelli scored the film 2 out of 4 stars, writing that he \\"like[d] the audacity and its willingness to push the envelope beyond the limits of good taste. In the end, it's a little too long and uneven to recommend outright, but [he] won't deny having enjoyed aspects of what Davis is offering.\\" In 2016, Shoot 'Em Up made the list of \\"25 great action films that are 90 minutes or under\\" compiled by Nick Horton of Den of Geek. Rotten Tomatoes ranked Shoot 'Em Up at 111 on its list of the \\"140 Essential Actions Movies To Watch\\".

For example, nucleotides are not needed in the diet as they can be constructed from small precursor molecules such as formate and aspartate. Methionine, on the other hand, is needed in the diet because while it can be degraded to and then regenerated from homocysteine, it cannot be synthesized de novo. De novo is a Latin phrase, literally translating to \\"from the new\\", but implying \\"anew\\", \\"from scratch\\", or \\"from the beginning.\\"  Nucleotide  De novo pathways of nucleotides do not use free bases: adenine (abbreviated as A), guanine (G), cytosine (C), thymine (T), or uracil (U). The purine ring is built up one atom or a few atoms at a time and attached to ribose throughout the process. Pyrimidine ring is synthesized as orotate and attached to ribose phosphate and later converted to common pyrimidine nucleotides.  Cholesterol  Cholesterol is an essential structural component of animal cell membranes. Cholesterol also serves as a precursor for the biosynthesis of steroid hormones, bile acid and vitamin D. In mammals cholesterol is either absorbed from dietary sources or is synthesized de novo. Up to 70-80% of de novo cholesterol synthesis occurs in the liver, and about 10% of de novo cholesterol synthesis occurs in the small intestine. Cancer cells require cholesterol for cell membranes, so cancer cells contain many enzymes for de novo cholesterol synthesis from acetyl-CoA.  Fatty-acid (de novo lipogenesis)  De novo lipogenesis (DNL) is the process by which carbohydrates (primarily, especially after a high-carbohydrate meal) from the circulation are converted into fatty acids, which can by further converted into triglycerides or other lipids. Acetate and some amino acids (notably leucine and isoleucine) can also be carbon sources for DNL. Normally, de novo lipogenesis occurs primarily in adipose tissue. But in conditions of obesity, insulin resistance, or type 2 diabetes de novo lipogenesis is reduced in adipose tissue (where carbohydrate-responsive element-binding protein (ChREBP) is the major transcription factor) and is increased in the liver (where sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP-1c) is the major transcription factor). ChREBP is normally activated in the liver by glucose (independent of insulin). Obesity and high-fat diets cause levels of carbohydrate-responsive element-binding protein in adipose tissue to be reduced. By contrast, high blood levels of insulin, due to a high carbohydrate meal or insulin resistance, strongly induces SREBP-1c expression in the liver. The reduction of adipose tissue de novo lipogenesis, and the increase in liver de novo lipogenesis due to obesity and insulin resistance leads to fatty liver disease. Fructose consumption (in contrast to glucose) activates both SREBP-1c and ChREBP in an insulin independent manner. Although glucose can be converted into glycogen in the liver, fructose invariably increases de novo lipogenesis in the liver, elevating plasma triglycerides, more than glucose. Moreover, when equal amounts of glucose or fructose sweetened beverages are consumed, the fructose beverage not only causes a greater increase in plasma triglycerides, but causes a greater increase in abdominal fat. DNL is elevated in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and is a hallmark of the disease. Compared with healthy controls, patients with NAFLD have an average 3.5 -fold increase in DNL. De novo fatty-acid synthesis is regulated by two important enzymes, namely acetyl-CoA carboxylase and fatty acid synthase. The enzyme acetyl CoA carboxylase is responsible for introducing a carboxyl group to acetyl CoA, rendering malonyl-CoA. Then, the enzyme fatty-acid synthase is responsible for turning malonlyl-CoA into fatty-acid chain. De novo fatty-acid synthesis is mainly not active in human cells, since diet is the major source for it. In mice, FA de novo synthesis increases in WAT with the exposure to cold temperatures which might be important for maintenance of circulating TAG levels in the blood stream, and to supply FA for thermogenesis during prolonged cold exposures.  DNA  De novo DNA synthesis refers to the synthetic creation of DNA rather than assembly or modification of natural precursor template DNA sequences. Initial oligonucleotide synthesis is followed by artificial gene synthesis, and finally by a process cloning, error correction, and verification, which often involves cloning the genes into plasmids into Escherichia coli or yeast. Primase is an RNA polymerase, and it can add a primer to an existing strand awaiting replication. DNA polymerase cannot add primers, and therefore, needs primase to add the primer de novo.

Overview  System of Systems Engineering (SoSE) methodology is heavily used in U.S. Department of Defense applications, but is increasingly being applied to non-defense related problems such as architectural design of problems in air and auto transportation, healthcare, global communication networks, search and rescue, space exploration and many other System of Systems application domains. SoSE is more than systems engineering of monolithic, complex systems because design for System-of- Systems problems is performed under some level of uncertainty in the requirements and the constituent systems, and it involves considerations in multiple levels and domains (as per Daniel DeLaurentis, \\"Understanding Transportation as a System-of-Systems Design Problem,\\" 43rd AIAA Aerospace Sciences Meeting, Reno, Nevada, January 10‚Äì13, 2005. AIAA-2005-0123. and Daniel DeLaurentis, Oleg Sindiy, William Stein, \\"Developing Sustainable Space Exploration via a System-of-Systems Approach,\\" AIAA Space 2006 Conference, San Jose, CA.). Whereas systems engineering focuses on building the system right, SoSE focuses on choosing the right system(s) and their interactions to satisfy the requirements. System-of-Systems Engineering and Systems Engineering are related but different fields of study. Whereas systems engineering addresses the development and operations of monolithic products, SoSE addresses the development and operations of evolving programs. In other words, traditional systems engineering seeks to optimize an individual system (i.e., the product), while SoSE seeks to optimize network of various interacting legacy and new systems brought together to satisfy multiple objectives of the program. SoSE should enable the decision-makers to understand the implications of various choices on technical performance, costs, extensibility and flexibility over time; thus, effective SoSE methodology should prepare decision-makers to design informed architectural solutions for System-of- Systems problems. Due to varied methodology and domains of applications in existing literature, there does not exist a single unified consensus for processes involved in System-of-Systems Engineering. One of the proposed SoSE frameworks, by Dr. Daniel A. DeLaurentis, recommends a three-phase method where a SoS problem is defined (understood), abstracted, modeled and analyzed for behavioral patterns.Daniel DeLaurentis, Oleg Sindiy, William Stein, \\"Developing Sustainable Space Exploration via a System-of-Systems Approach,\\" AIAA Space 2006 Conference, San Jose, CA. More information on this method and other proposed methods can be found in the listed SoSE focused organizations and SoSE literature in the subsequent sections.

Formed in 1981, the province had 25,000 members in April 2013. Its members in South America are thinly spread, making it one of the smaller provinces in the Anglican Communion in terms of numbers, although one of the largest in geographical extent.Q&A;: Bishop Zavala of Cono Sur, The Living Church, 29 April 2013 The province was known as \\"The Province of the Southern Cone of America\\" from its formation in 1981 until September 2014, when it formally changed its name to \\"The Anglican Church of South America\\".Change recorded at Anglican Communion website. The province also included Chile, until the inception of the new Anglican Church of Chile as an autonomous province of the Anglican Communion, on 4 November 2018. History During the 19th century, British immigrants to South America brought Anglicanism with them . In Britain, a voluntary Anglican society was formed in 1844 to evangelize the indigenous peoples of Tierra del Fuego. This later became the South American Mission Society (SAMS) and extended its activities to the Araucanian regions of Chile and the Chaco. It still has an important place in the life of the church.But, since 2010, SAMS has been part of the new Church Mission Society.History: Church Mission Society, Official website The first diocese was established in 1869 as the Diocese of the Falkland Islands and the rest of South America, excepting British Guiana. The see of the bishop was in Buenos Aires .This was due to legal requirements at the time, which did not allow the Church of England to consecrate or appoint bishops outside those territories under the jurisdiction of the Crown. Despite its title, the diocese's effective territory was restricted to the Southern Cone plus Peru and Bolivia. By contrast, Anglican/Episcopal congregations in Brazil and the more northern Spanish-speaking countries were effectively under the wing of the Episcopal Church of the USA . As the Anglican Church and its mission grew in South America, new dioceses were created from that larger one. Missionary bishops were appointed to smaller dioceses. Until 1974, these missionary dioceses were under the metropolitical oversight of the Archbishop of Canterbury. For the next seven years, they were administered by an ad hoc council known by the acronym CASA (Consejo Anglicano de Sud Am√©rica) , which also had Brazilian members. In 1981, the five dioceses of Argentina (at the time including Uruguay, which became an independent diocese only in 1988 ), Northern Argentina, Peru and Bolivia (separated into two dioceses subsequent to 1988), Chile, and Paraguay came together to form the Province of the Southern Cone. In November 2010, at a provincial synod held in Argentina, Bishop Tito Zavala, Diocesan Bishop of Chile, was elected primate. He was the first South American-born primate of the province, and served for six years. In November 2016, at the provincial synod in Santiago, Chile, Bishop Gregory Venables, who had previously served from 2001-2010, was re-elected primate of the Province of South America. In early 2018 the Diocese of Chile split into four dioceses, and in November that year those dioceses were removed from the Anglican Church of South America and formed into an autonomous province named the Anglican Church of Chile, with Tito Zavala as their first primate. Doctrine The province is distinguished by a conservative interpretation of Biblical texts and church practice while some dioceses are more liberal. =Ordination of women= The province has been outspoken in its opposition to the ordination of women to the priesthood, generally appealing to scriptural issues of headship as the basis for such opposition. The Diocese of Uruguay, which has historically been more liberal than other parts of the province, made a formal request in 2011 to be allowed to admit women to the priesthood. This request was received by the provincial synod meeting held in Asunci√≥n, Paraguay, in November 2011, and was rejected.Account of synod at Anglican Communion News Service. However, in 2015 Bolivia became the first diocese in the province to ordain women as priests, ordaining the Rev. Tammy Smith Firestone. Later that year Rev. Susana Lopez Lerena, the Rev. Cynthia Myers Dickin and the Rev. Audrey Taylor Gonzalez became the first women Anglican priests ordained in the Diocese of Uruguay. =Human sexuality= The Anglican Church of South America is a part of GAFCON, a conservative coalition of Anglican provinces opposing non-celibate homosexuality and same-sex marriage. Some representatives in the Diocese of Uruguay have supported gay and lesbian rights.

The four dioceses were to be formed by splitting the current Diocese of Peru into the new dioceses of Lima, Arequipa, Chiclayo, and Huancayo. No date was announced for the formation of the province, but the intended first bishops of each diocese were consecrated. Bishops Alejandro Mesco, Juan Carlos Revilla, and Jorge Luis Aguilar, were all consecrated in July 2015; they are the first indigenous Peruvian bishops to be consecrated in the Anglican Communion.The consecrations, and the intended new provincial structure, all announced at the Anglican Communion News Service. The decision to become an independent province was rescinded at the diocesan synod in 2017. The new bishops remain in post as auxiliary bishops within the diocese. Separation of Chile In July 2015 it was announced by the Anglican Communion secretariat that the Diocese of Chile was working towards emancipation from the Province of South America, with the intention of becoming an autonomous province of the Anglican Communion, consisting of four dioceses. The four dioceses were to be formed by splitting the current Diocese of Chile into the new dioceses of Concepci√≥n, Santiago, Temuco, and Valpara√≠so. The intended first bishops of the four dioceses were Tito Zavala (then the diocesan bishop), Abelino Manuel Apeleo (then the auxiliary bishop), and two new bishops who were consecrated in 2016 as additional auxiliaries, namely Alfred Cooper and Nelson Ojeda. The split into the four new dioceses took place in the early part of 2018, and the new province was formally constituted on 4 November 2018 by Archbishop Justin Welby and Presiding Bishop Gregory Venables. Tito Zavala and Abelino Manuel Apeleo became diocesan bishops as planned, along with former archdeacons Samuel Morrison and Him Enrique Lago. The two bishops consecrated in 2016 remain in post as auxiliary bishops within the diocese. Anglican realignment In 2003, after the consecration of Gene Robinson, a partnered homosexual, as the Bishop of New Hampshire in the Episcopal Church in the United States of America, the Province of the Southern Cone severed its relationship with the Episcopal Church (the sole dissent in the diocesan synod was the vote of the Diocese of Uruguay, which voted to maintain full communion with both the Anglican Church of Canada and the Episcopal Church). The Province has been involved in the Anglican realignment, as a member of the Global South (Anglican), (GAFCON), and it is in full communion with the Anglican Church in North America, formed in 2009 by former members of the Episcopal Church. The Church of the Province of the Southern Cone decided previously to extend ecclesiastical jurisdiction to conservative congregations or dioceses (including some from the Diocese of Virginia) that departed from the Episcopal Church, but were located within its geographical authority. The bishops and a number of communicants of four dioceses in the United States ‚Äî the Diocese of San Joaquin (ACNA), the Anglican Diocese of Pittsburgh (ACNA), the Episcopal Diocese of Fort Worth (ACNA) and the Diocese of Quincy (ACNA) ‚Äì voted in their conventions to separate from the Episcopal Church and affiliate \\"on an emergency and temporary basis\\" with the Anglican Church of the Southern Cone of America. Those who have chosen to remain in the Episcopal Church in the United States have reformed their dioceses and have elected new leadership. In Canada, 72 parishes in Canada have formed the Anglican Network in Canada and identify as an \\"ecclesial body under the jurisdiction of the Anglican Province of the Southern Cone\\". The province also had provisional oversight over one diocese in Brazil, the Diocese of Recife (Diocese do Recife) under Bishop Robinson Cavalcanti, which withdrew from the Anglican Episcopal Church of Brazil, due to the Diocese's opposition to the Brazilian policy of blessing same-sex unions, but later become an extra-provincial diocese of the Global South.\\"Southern Cone offers haven to disaffected US dioceses\\", Church Times, 16 November 2007 The Anglican Communion Office does not recognize jurisdiction of the Southern Cone bishops over dioceses and ecclesiastical bodies located geographically outside Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Paraguay, Peru, and Uruguay.http://www.aco.org/tour/province.cfm?ID=S5 Notes and references Notes References Bibliography External links * http://www.anglicana.org.ar/ (official website of the Iglesia Anglicana Argentina, Diocese of Argentina) * South American Missionary Society * Iglesia Anglicana de Chile (Anglican Church of Chile) * Iglesia Anglicana del Uruguay (Anglican Church of Uruguay) * The Anglican Church in Paraguay South America Category:Members of the World Council of Churches Category:Christian organizations established in 1981 Category:Anglican denominations in South America Category:Anglicanism in South America Category:Anglican realignment denominations South America Category:Anglican dioceses in South America ","title":"Anglican Church of South America"},{"id":"5670592","text":"The Rotoitidae are a very small family of rare, relictual parasitic wasps in the superfamily Chalcidoidea, known primarily from fossils (14 extinct species in two genera, Baeomorpha and Taimyromorpha).Huber JT, Shih C, Dong R (2019) A new species of Baeomorpha (Hymenoptera, Rotoitidae) from mid-Cretaceous Burmese amber.

Early history  He was born George Francis Furnival in Liverpool to a working class family of Irish descent, to parents who were staunchly Roman Catholic. In conversation with the writer Ken Irwin in 1972, he remarked that \\"the rough and ready upbringing of Catholics in Liverpool brings out the humour in a family\\": > He's another comic who has known poverty. There were five children in the > Roper family, three girls and two boys. Dad saw a lot of life ‚Äì he was a > window cleaner. 'Times were hard when I started at school, in the early war > years,' says George. 'We never went without, but a jam butty was often a > meal'. He left school at the age of fifteen to join the Merchant Navy as a galley boy, then as steward. Later he served his national service in the Royal Air Force (RAF), based in Eindhoven in the Netherlands. It was during this period in the Netherlands that Roper began to sing with big bands at RAF concert parties. He married Linda Groves in December 1968, and they had three children: Nicholas, Louise and Matthew.  Career  Working mainly in the North West England region, Roper began to sing semi-professionally in clubs and hotels during the early 1960s while supporting himself in various jobs, but soon found his real talent lay in performing comedy. He was encouraged by the music hall comedian Sandy Powell. In his stage act the number of songs soon constricted and the gags expanded. By 1965, with his portly figure, bejewelled fingers, deadpan style and a laid back microphone technique he began to draw sizeable audiences as a stand-up comic on the booming club and casino scene of Manchester. Regular at Manchester's Cabaret Club were the young reporter Michael Parkinson and Johnnie Hamp, a producer from Granada Television, who said of Roper, \\"When I had the idea for The Comedians, he was one of the first people I called. It wasn't necessarily the gags he told, it was the face. There was always a twinkle in the eye.\\" Hamp was on the look-out for new acts for a new show, which was to become The Comedians, a groundbreaking television series which ran intermittently between 1971 and 1993. Filmed in Manchester before a live audience, the programme consisted mainly of Northern club comedians telling jokes. It was a major success at the time, garnering several industry awards and a BAFTA nomination, though the jokes told often contained racist or sexist stereotypes. This was acceptable on British TV during the 1970s but would not be acceptable today. Nevertheless, the show stands as a major social document of the era. Ken Irwin: > The Comedians are totally and unashamedly outrageous in all that they do. > This is why they have succeeded. Nothing, or no one, apparently, is sacred. > And their jokes prove it. They joke about nothing and everything. Anyone and > everyone. They joke about false teeth and parrots and homosexuals virtually > in the same breath. They joke about Catholics and Protestants. They joke > about Pakistanis, the Irish and the Jews. They joke about Enoch Powell, the > Queen and the Pope. When they go out in front of the cameras, it is > invariably a no-holds-barred encounter with the British viewing public. You > can either take it or switch over to another channel. Viewing figures have > already conclusively proved that viewers, who are always the final judges in > these things, stay tuned in. In June 1971 he was one of a group of artists invited to perform in a televised Royal Gala Performance at the Empire Theatre, Liverpool in the presence of the Queen. The show featured only Liverpool-born performers and marked the opening of the Mersey Tunnel. George Roper later made a number of notable television appearances including The Wheeltappers and Shunters Social Club, Celebrity Squares, At Long Last, This and The Grumbleweeds. In 1980 he performed on the experimental comedy show Here Comes Channel 8 (taking a look into the future of television, set in 1999) alongside Spike Milligan, Rula Lenska and Michael Bentine. He was also a regular comic performer on the ITV gameshow 3-2-1. His work for the BBC in radio comedy included appearances on The Frankie Howerd Variety Show, Windsor Davies Presents, The Arthur Askey Show, the panel show Wit's End for BBC Radio 2 and You've Got To Be Joking for BBC Radio 4. By the 1990s, comic tastes in the UK had changed quite radically, and many variety performers who filled the television schedules often found work difficult to come by. Roper was still in demand in clubs and in summer shows. He could also be seen as a contributor to documentaries including Heroes of Comedy. He appeared regularly in the Spanish resort of Benidorm, sharing the headline spot at the Talk of the Town with jazz musician Eric Delaney. He frequently performed for expatriates in Hong Kong and the Middle East. He also toured Australia several times, where The Comedians made him a star.  Death  George Roper died of cancer in 2003 at the age of 69. The previous year had seen him reunited with his co-stars from The Comedians for a long season at the Opera House, Blackpool. His final stage appearance was at the Liverpool Empire in May 2003. His funeral was attended by many figures from the world of comedy and sport, including Ricky Tomlinson, Ken Dodd, Frank Worthington, Tommy Docherty and all of his contemporaries from The Comedians.

It's a member of the Fair Youth sequence, in which the poet expresses his love towards a young man. Synopsis Sonnet 66 is a world-weary, desperate list of grievances of the state of the poet's society. The speaker criticizes three things: general unfairness of life, societal immorality, and oppressive government. Lines 2 and 3 illustrate the economic unfairness caused by one's station or nobility: > As, to behold desert a beggar born, And needy nothing trimm'd in jollity, > (66.2-3) Lines 4-7 portray disgraced trust and loyalty, unfairly given authority, as by an unworthy king \\"gilded honour shamefully misplaced\\", and female innocence corrupted \\"Maiden virtue rudely strumpeted\\". Lines 8, 10, and 12, as in lines 2 and 3, characterize reversals of what one deserves, and what one actually receives in life. As opposed to most of his sonnets, which have a \\"turn\\" in mood or thought at line 9, (the beginning of the third quatrain (See: Sonnets 29, 18) the mood of Sonnet 66 does not change until the last line, when the speaker declares that the only thing keeping him alive is his lover. This stresses the fact that his lover is helping him merely survive, whereas sonnets 29 and 30 are much more positive and have 6 lines in which they affirm that the lover is the fulfillment of the poet's life. Structure Sonnet 66 is an English or Shakespearean sonnet. The English sonnet has three quatrains, followed by a final rhyming couplet. It follows the typical rhyme scheme of the form, ABAB CDCD EFEF GG, and is composed in iambic pentameter, a type of poetic metre based on five pairs of metrically weak/strong syllabic positions. The tenth line exemplifies a regular iambic pentameter: √ó / √ó / √ó / √ó / √ó / And folly doctor-like controlling skill, (66.10) :/ = ictus, a metrically strong syllabic position. √ó = nonictus. This line and its rhyme-mate, line 12, happen to have a fully stressed syllable for each ictus; all the other regular lines have one unstressed syllable taking the ictus (for example the final syllables of line four's \\"unhappily\\" and line eight's four-syllable \\"disabled\\"). These highly-patterned lines are bookended by four lines ‚Äî two at the beginning and two at the end ‚Äî with an initial reversal, as in line one: / √ó √ó / √ó / √ó / √ó / Tired with all these, for restful death I cry, (66.1) Interpretations and adaptations Dmitri Shostakovich set Boris Pasternak's Russian translation of this sonnet to music as part of his 1942 song cycle Six Romances on Verses by English Poets (Op. 62). Because Pasternak's translation is also in iambic pentameter, the piece can be, and sometimes is, performed with Shakespeare's original words instead (for example, by Gerald Finley on his 2014 album of Shostakovich songs for Ondine). The critic Ian MacDonald suggested that Shostakovich may have used this sonnet, with its reference to \\"art made tongue-tied by authority,\\" as an oblique commentary on his own oppression by the Soviet state; however, the scholar Elizabeth Wilson pointed out that Pasternak's translation \\"somewhat watered down\\" the original's meaning, with his version of that line translating as \\"And remember that thoughts will close up the mouth.\\" Alan Bates performed this sonnet for the 2002 compilation album, When Love Speaks (EMI Classics).

He is at present considered an exemplary image of an anti-hero: uneducated, ignorant, egoistic and poor villager. Sometimes perceived as a stereotype of the uneducated, profit-driven Bulgarian and indeed the average Balkan person, he is often seen merely as a social stereotype, a member of the Principality of Bulgaria's newly formed lower middle-class. The archetype of the fictional character was inspired by Ganyo Somov, a rose trader from Enina (a village in the Kazanlak municipality). At the international fair in Chicago in 1893, Aleko Konstantinov met Ganyo Somov and used him to create one of the most famous Bulgarian literature characters. Bay is a Bulgarian honorary title to refer to older or more influential persons: the character's first name is Ganyo, and his family name has been attested as either Ganyo Somov or Ganyo Balkanski. Bay Ganyo is the protagonist of a novel-like series of satirical feuilletons by Aleko Konstantinov. The first part of the series tells of Bay Ganyo's journeys to various European cities and compares the character's culture to that of their residents. The second part satirizes the political problems of the day of the post-Liberation Bulgarian society in the late 19th century. The character has been a subject of films picturing his adventures in Bulgaria and Western Europe which were largely based on the original literary work of Aleko Konstantinov. Konstantinov was inspired to create Bay Ganyo during a visit to Chicago's World's Columbian Exposition in 1893. Debuting in the cinemas in a silent short of 1922, Bay Ganyo was the subject of a full- length feature film by Ivan Nichev in 1991; the character was played by Georgi Kaloyanchev. Bay Ganyo has been likened in importance and symbolism for the Bulgarians to ≈†vejk for the Czechs, Tartarin of Tarascon for the French and Ostap Bender for the Russians. Feuilletons The collection of feuilletons consists of two parts. Each feuilleton is presented by a different narrator, a member of a group of like-minded Bulgarians telling of Bay Ganyo's adventures; this group of narrators is itself a direct opposition to Bay Ganyo: they are educated, courteous and civilized people with European manners and clothing. =Bay Ganyo goes around Europe= The first part tells of the retail rose oil merchant Bay Ganyo's travels around Europe, seeking to sell his produce. The prototype of the character was a real person whom Konstantinov met during his journey to the United States described in To Chicago and Back. Bay Ganyo is compared to the residents of the countries he visits (Austria-Hungary, German Empire, Russia, Switzerland, etc.) to contrast him in a funny but unsympathetic way. Bay Ganyo is simple-minded, swindling, speculating and manipulating, yet tenacious, struggling and breaking-through. * Beginning * Bay Ganyo travels (through Budapest to Vienna) * Bay Ganyo at the opera (in Vienna) * Bay Ganyo at the public baths * Bay Ganyo in Dresden * Bay Ganyo at the Prague Exhibition (through Serbia to Prague) * Bay Ganyo stays with Jireƒçek * Bay Ganyo on a visit (in Prague) * Bay Ganyo in Switzerland * Bay Ganyo in Russia =Political feuilletons= The second part consists of several independent feuilletons and deals with the new major middle-class and Bulgaria's political life. Bay Ganyo is not a petty rose oil dealer anymore, but a big-time politician who writes a petition to the Prince, runs for National Assembly of Bulgaria member, issues a political newspaper. Instead of working alone as in the first part, Bay Ganyo is the leader of a group of like-minded people propelled by mean acts. * Bay Ganyo comes back from Europe * Bay Ganyo organizes elections * Bay Ganyo is a journalist * Bay Ganyo at the palace * Bay Ganyo in the deputation * Bay Ganyo and the opposition ‚Äî no way * Association of Teetotalism * Letter from Bay Ganyo to Konstantin Velichkov * Out of Bay Ganyo Balkanski's correspondence References Further reading  * External links * Full collection of Bay Ganyo works at Slovo.bg * Who is Bay Ganyo?

Taxonomy The genus name comes from the Greek apisto meaning uncertain and the Latin lorica or loricare meaning cuirass or corslet of leather. Apistoloricaria is not well diagnosed and upon further examination, may prove to be a synonym of Rhadinoloricaria.  Species  There are currently four recognized species in this genus: * Apistoloricaria condei Isbr√ºcker & Nijssen, 1986 * Apistoloricaria laani Isbr√ºcker & Nijssen, 1988 * Apistoloricaria listrorhinos Isbr√ºcker & Nijssen, 1988 * Apistoloricaria ommation Isbr√ºcker & Nijssen, 1988 Distribution and habitat Representatives of this genus are distributed in the upper Amazon and Orinoco drainages, along the Atlantic slope of the Andes. Appearance and ecology These fish range from 10-14 centimetres (4-5.5 in) SL. In members of this genus and other closely related genera, the body is strongly depressed and the pelvic fins are used for locomotion, enabling these fish to appear to ‚Äúwalk‚Äù on the substrate. Sexual dimorphism is apparent through differentiated lip structure. The lip surfaces of the male are rather papillose while those of the female are filamentous. These species are abdomino-lip brooders; eggs are laid in a single layered mass, and are attached to the surface of the lower lip and abdomen of the male.

History Safnern is first mentioned in 1251 as Savenieres. The oldest trace of a settlement in the area is the ruins of a Roman settlement in the Moosm√ºhle section. During the Middle Ages there were several scattered villages and settlements within the modern municipal borders. The villages of B√ºttenberg and Stadholz (also known as Stadowe) and the castle on the Schl√∂sslihubel hill all flourished and then were abandoned. The major landholders in Safnern were the Counts of Neuch√¢tel-Nidau and Gottstatt Abbey. With the extinction of the Neuch√¢tel-Nidau line in 1375, Safnern came under Bernese control. It formed the Safnern Court within the bailiwick of Nidau until the 1798 French invasion. After which Safnern became part of the B√ºren district under the Helvetic Republic. With the Act of Mediation in 1803, it became part of the Nidau district. By 1783 the large village had 50 houses. Located along the Zihl/Thielle and Aare rivers the residents grew crops in the rich farmland and fished the rivers. The Jura water correction project of 1847-48 changed the course of the Aare river but helped protect the village from flooding. The Nidau-B√ºren Canal of 1868-75 further reshaped the landscape around Safnern. Today the municipal boundary still follows the old Zihl/Thielle and Aare riverbeds. As Biel grew into an industrial city in the 1950s, Safnern became a suburb. Despite having several industrial factories in the municipality, about three-quarters of the working population commute to jobs in Biel or other towns. In 2005 about 60% of the jobs in Safnern were in industry, while 28% were in the services sector. However, Safnern is also surrounded with green spaces, it shares the H√§ftli nature reserve with the neighboring municipalities of B√ºren an der Aare and Meinisberg.

Laboratory automation professionals are academic, commercial and government researchers, scientists and engineers who conduct research and develop new technologies to increase productivity, elevate experimental data quality, reduce lab process cycle times, or enable experimentation that otherwise would be impossible. The most widely known application of laboratory automation technology is laboratory robotics. More generally, the field of laboratory automation comprises many different automated laboratory instruments, devices (the most common being autosamplers), software algorithms, and methodologies used to enable, expedite and increase the efficiency and effectiveness of scientific research in laboratories. The application of technology in today's laboratories is required to achieve timely progress and remain competitive. Laboratories devoted to activities such as high-throughput screening, combinatorial chemistry, automated clinical and analytical testing, diagnostics, large-scale biorepositories, and many others, would not exist without advancements in laboratory automation.An autosampler for liquid or gaseous samples based on a microsyringe Some universities offer entire programs that focus on lab technologies. For example, Indiana University-Purdue University at Indianapolis offers a graduate program devoted to Laboratory Informatics. Also, the Keck Graduate Institute in California offers a graduate degree with an emphasis on development of assays, instrumentation and data analysis tools required for clinical diagnostics, high-throughput screening, genotyping, microarray technologies, proteomics, imaging and other applications. History At least since 1875 there have been reports of automated devices for scientific investigation. These first devices were mostly built by scientists themselves in order to solve problems in the laboratory. After the second world war, companies started to provide automated equipment with greater and greater complexity. Automation steadily spread in laboratories through the 20th century, but then a revolution took place: in the early 1980s, the first fully automated laboratory was opened by Dr. Masahide Sasaki. In 1993, Dr. Rod Markin at the University of Nebraska Medical Center created one of the world's first clinical automated laboratory management systems. In the mid-1990s, he chaired a standards group called the Clinical Testing Automation Standards Steering Committee (CTASSC) of the American Association for Clinical Chemistry, which later evolved into an area committee of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute. In 2004, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and more than 300 nationally recognized leaders in academia, industry, government, and the public completed the NIH Roadmap to accelerate medical discovery to improve health. The NIH Roadmap clearly identifies technology development as a mission critical factor in the Molecular Libraries and Imaging Implementation Group (see the first theme ‚Äì New Pathways to Discovery ‚Äì at https://web.archive.org/web/20100611171315/http://nihroadmap.nih.gov/). Despite the success of Dr. Sasaki laboratory and others of the kind, the multi-million dollar cost of such laboratories has prevented adoption by smaller groups. This is all more difficult because devices made by different manufactures often cannot communicate with each other. However, recent advances based on the use of scripting languages like Autoit have made possible the integration of equipment from different manufacturers. Using this approach, many low-cost electronic devices, including open-source devices, become compatible with common laboratory instruments. Some startups such as Emerald Cloud Lab and Strateos provide on-demand and remote laboratory access on a commercial scale. A 2017 study indicates that these commercial-scale, fully integrated automated laboratories can improve reproducibility and transparency in basic biomedical experiments, and that over nine in ten biomedical papers use methods currently available through these groups. Low- cost laboratory automation A large obstacle to the implementation of automation in laboratories has been its high cost. Many laboratory instruments are very expensive. This is justifiable in many cases, as such equipment can perform very specific tasks employing cutting-edge technology. However, there are devices employed in the laboratory that are not highly technological but still are very expensive. This is the case of many automated devices, which perform tasks that could easily be done by simple and low-cost devices like simple robotic arms, universal (open-source) electronic modules, or 3D printers. So far, using such low-cost devices together with laboratory equipment was considered to be very difficult. However, it has been demonstrated that such low-cost devices can substitute without problems the standard machines used in laboratory. It can be anticipated that more laboratories will take advantage of this new reality as low-cost automation is very attractive for laboratories. A technology that enables the integration of any machine regardless of their brand is scripting, more specifically, scripting involving the control of mouse clicks and keyboard entries, like AutoIt. By timing clicks and keyboard inputs, different software interfaces controlling different devices can be perfectly synchronized.

Early life Natarus was born in Wausau, Wisconsin. He graduated from University of Wisconsin in 1956 and University of Wisconsin Law School in 1960. Natarus continued his education at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard. He was admitted to the Wisconsin bar in 1960 and practiced law in Chicago. Later, he taught at Chicago's Loyola University on the subject of local government. Natarus also served in the U.S. Army and the U.S. Army Reserves, earning paratrooper's \\"jump wings\\".State Bar of Wisconsin-Rotunda Report-State bar breaks tradition, will honor 50-year members at special summer event Public service Natarus is active in a number of community groups: City Club of Chicago, Streeterville Organization of Active Residents, Central Michigan Association, North Dearborn Association, and River North Association. Aldermanic career Natarus was a Democrat. Natarus was a prot√©g√© of longtime 42nd Ward Democratic Committeeman and Cook County Board President George Dunne. Natarus was first elected Alderman of the 42nd Ward in 1971. He was re-elected eight times, serving for thirty-six years. The 42nd Ward encompasses some of Chicago's wealthiest neighborhoods, including Streeterville, the Gold Coast, the Magnificent Mile, River North, and the Loop. Natarus was Chairman of the Traffic and Safety Committee. He also served on six other committees: Finance; Zoning; Committees, Rules and Ethics; License and Consumer Protection; Budget and Government Operations; and Housing and Real Estate. In addition, he was a member of the Chicago Plan Commission, the Central Area Planning Task Force, and the Regional Transportation Task Force. Natarus' pushed \\"good government\\" projects that appealed to his predominantly liberal constituents, such as arts funding, park expansion, and gun control. He became known as the Council's most skilled author of legislation, and was dubbed \\"the Master of the Ordinance.\\" Natarus avoided challenging then-Mayor Richard J. Daley and the Party on issues such as corruption, favoritism, racism, and police brutality. He was a reliable vote in favor of the Mayor's budget, and of any zoning changes requested by other Aldermen. The ordinances he crafted often included language that allowed the Mayor to give tax breaks, subsidies, and sweetheart deals to favored business interests. He was consistently supportive of property developers in his ward, and pointed to the vast array of big new buildings there as his accomplishment. In turn developers donated heavily to his campaign fund. Natarus always supported Democratic Party endorsed candidates for state and county office in Democratic primaries. This continued under Daley's successors, Bilandic and Byrne. However, after Harold Washington won the Democratic nomination for Mayor, and subsequently the Mayoralty itself, in 1983, Natarus supported Washington (who was black) in the racially charged \\"Council Wars\\" that followed. After Washington's death and eventual replacement by Richard M. Daley, Natarus was as loyal to the son as he had been to his father. When Dunne finally retired as Ward Committeeman in 2003 precinct captains selected Natarus as his replacement. Natarus' son owns an architectural metal company that was among the vendors for the build-out of the Park Grill restaurant in Millennium Park. Defeat By 2006, Natarus had developed hostile relations with some members of the press. At times he responded to criticism with vulgar language or angry harangues. He had also lost the support of important labor unions, notably the SEIU. In 2007, Natarus sought re-election for a tenth term. Observers noted that Natarus barely campaigned, missing several events at which he was to share a podium with challenger Brendan Reilly. The SEIU and other unions backed Reilly. Natarus was defeated in the General Election of February 27 by 8.6%. In 2007, Natarus had a red light camera installed \\"near his condo in an intersection that had virtually no accidents\\". In 2019, the Chicago Tribune inadvertently reported Natarus as dead. Personal life Natarus had two children, Jill Ellen and Michael, and one grandchild, Jacob. He died on June 5, 2020 at the age of 86. References External links * Aldermanic website * Neighbors Page Category:Chicago City Council members Category:Illinois Democrats Category:John F.

He was regarded as a promising prop and although he had not made his Leicester debut he had been an unused bench replacement. He had played both for Bedford Blues and Nuneaton R.F.C. while on loan. He had also played for England U18 and England U21. Training accident Hampson's accident happened on 15 March 2005 at Franklin's Gardens, when the England U21 team were preparing for an under 21 Six Nations match against Scotland. In what he described as a freak accident, a scrum collapsed and dislocated his neck, severing his spinal cord. Referee and former paramedic Tony Spreadbury was praised for his quick reaction to stabilise Hampson's neck, saving him even further damage that could have resulted in his death. Hampson was taken first to Northampton General Hospital and then to the specialist spine unit at Stoke Mandeville Hospital, where he had an operation to relocate his spine. He spent 18 months in Stoke Mandeville, where he contracted a life-threatening Clostridium difficile infection. Charitable work Hampson divides his time between raising money for spinal care both for himself and others, and UK charity Spinal Research, coaching youngsters at Oakham School, physiotherapy sessions and writing columns for the Leicester Mercury's Sporting Green and International Rugby News. He is particularly supported by his sister Amy, her boyfriend Adam Wheatley and former England U21 captain Matt Cornwell. In 2011 the Matt Hampson trust gained full charity status and became the Matt Hampson Foundation. Matt works with the foundation to provide advice, support and relief for anyone suffering serious injury or disability which has arisen from any cause, but in particular from participation in or training for any sport, sporting activity or other form of physical education or recreation. Matt regularly visits beneficiaries, schools and societies where he gives advice and motivational talks taken from his own experiences. Get Busy Living Centre Hampson's ambition was to create a dedicated physical rehabilitation centre for sufferers of serious injuries through sports-accidents, resulting in life-changing conditions with long-term effects including permanent disability, to help them to recover to the best of their abilities.Serious injury through sport Matt Hampson Foundation.

Her novels featured credible young characters confronting difficult situations such as family separation and death. She was born in New York City but grew up in Glens Falls, New York, with parents Michael and Jean Garlan Fox. Mazer graduated from Glens Falls High School, then went to Antioch College, where she met Harry Mazer, whom she married in 1950; they had four children, three of whom survived Mazer, one of whom, Anne Mazer, is also a writer. In addition to Antioch, Mazer also studied at Syracuse University. In 2009, she died at the age of 78 from brain cancer. Mazer began writing professionally as a young mother and for several years she and her husband Harry wrote confessional stories for pulp magazines; they would later write several novels together. Mazer's books were praised for the intelligence of their dialogue, psychological acumen, and the nuance with which domestic difficulties and tragedies were portrayed in the lives of young people. Rather than offering simple resolutions, her stories charted more complex and sometimes suspenseful paths that followed the characters' growth and self-knowledge. New York Times Book Review contributor Ruth I. Gordon wrote that Mazer \\"has the skill to reveal the human qualities in both ordinary and extraordinary situations as young people mature....it would be a shame to limit their reading to young people, since they can show an adult reader much about the sometimes painful rite of adolescent passage into adulthood\\". In 1988 Mazer said: > I hesitate to say I'm delivering messages....I'm writing stories and novels. > I hope there's an underlying feeling for the reader -- a hope, perhaps a > moral. But I'm not preaching. I'm telling stories. Among the honors Mazer earned for her writing were a National Book Award nomination in 1973, an American Library Association Notable Book citation in 1976, inclusion on the New York Times Outstanding Books of the Year list in 1976, the Lewis Carroll Shelf Award in 1978, an Edgar Award in 1982, German Children's Literature prizes in 1982 and 1989, and a Newbery Medal in 1988.

Like other species of spadefoot toad, they get their name from a distinctive spade-like projections on their hind legs which enable them to dig in sandy soils. Spea multiplicata can be identified by its wedge-shaped spade. Some sources also refer to the species as the Mexican spadefoot toad, desert spadefoot toad or southern spadefoot toad.  Description  The New Mexico spadefoot toad grows from 1.5 to 2.5 inches in length, and has a round body, with relatively short legs. They are green, to grey, to brown, usually reflecting the soil color of their native habitat, often with black and orange colored speckling on their back, and a white underside. They have large eyes, with vertical pupils.  Behavior  Like all species of spadefoot toad, the New Mexico spadefoot toad is nocturnal and secretive. If handled, these frogs might emit a peanutlike odor, which can cause tearing and nasal discharge if in close contact with the face. Spending most of its time buried in the ground, the spadefoot emerges during periods of summer rainfall to feed on insects and to breed. Breeding takes place in temporary pools left by the rain. Eggs laid in large masses, often hatch in as little as 48 hours. The tadpoles are forced to metamorphose quickly, before the water dries up. S. multiplicata tadpoles exhibit phenotypic plasticity. Tadpoles that ingest fairy shrimp, when present, may express a novel carnivore phenotype. This novel phenotype increases the rate of development, helping the tadpoles to escape drying ponds more rapidly.  Taxonomy  The species was once classified as a subspecies of the western spadefoot toad, Spea hammondii, but distinctive morphological characteristics led researchers to reclassify it as its own species. The New Mexico spadefoot toad is also known to hybridize with the Plains spadefoot toad, Spea bombifrons in the areas where their ranges overlap, making distinguishing the species from each other difficult.

The college is named for benefactor and former Citigroup chairman Sanford Weill. As one of the most selective medical schools in the United States, Cornell enrolls approximately 100 students per class from a pool of over 6,000 applicants, interviewing 700-750 applicants. For the class of 2022, the average undergraduate GPA and MCAT scores for successful applicants were 3.85 and 518, respectively.

Oliver H. Payne. It was established in New York because Ithaca, where the main campus is located, was deemed too small to offer adequate clinical training opportunities. James Ewing was the first professor of clinical pathology at the school, and for a while was the only full-time professor.James B. Murphy James Ewing Biographical Memoir National Academy of Sciences Washington D.C., 1951. NewYork‚ÄìPresbyterian/Weill Cornell A branch of the school operated in Stimson Hall on the main campus. The two-year Ithaca course paralleled the first two years of the New York school. It closed in 1938 due to declining enrollment. Weill Cornell became affiliated with New York Hospital, now NewYork‚ÄìPresbyterian Hospital, in 1913. The institutions opened a joint campus in Yorkville in 1932. In 1927, William Payne Whitney's $27 million donation led to the building of the Payne Whitney Psychiatric Clinic, which became the name for Cornell's large psychiatric effort. Its Training School for Nurses became affiliated with the university in 1942, operating as the Cornell Nursing School until it closed in 1979. In 1998, New York Hospital merged with Presbyterian Hospital, the affiliate hospital of Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons. The combined institution operates today as NewYork‚ÄìPresbyterian Hospital. Despite the clinical alliance, the faculty and instructional functions of the Cornell and Columbia units remain largely distinct and independent. Each hospital in the NewYork‚ÄìPresbyterian Healthcare System is affiliated with one of the two colleges. Originally called Cornell University Medical College, the school was renamed the Weill Medical College of Cornell University after receiving a substantial endowment from then-Citigroup Chairman Sanford I. Weill in 1998. In 2015, the school renamed itself Weill Cornell Medicine to better reflect its mission. Weill Medical Center from Rockefeller University On September 16, 2019, Dr. Augustine M.K. Choi announced Weill Cornell Medicine would make the cost of attendance free for all students who qualify for financial aid, made possible by a $160 million gift from The Starr Foundation, directed by Weill Cornell Medicine Overseer Maurice R. Greenberg, in partnership with gifts from Joan and Board of Overseers Chairman Emeritus Sanford I. Weill. Weill Cornell Medical College founded the medical fraternity Phi Delta Epsilon on October 13, 1904.  Weill Cornell Center for Human Rights  Founded in 2010 in partnership with Physicians for Human Rights, the Weill Cornell Center for Human Rights (WCCHR) provides services to torture victims seeking asylum in the United States on grounds of racial, gendered, religious, sexual, or political persecution. Run by medical students, the WCCHR provides forensic medical evaluations for survivors of torture; clinicians provide clients to prepare an affidavit in support of a client‚Äôs asylum application.

The following is an incomplete list of training centres, research and development sites, administrative sites and other establishments used by the Special Operations Executive during the Second World War. Numbered stations Establishments concerned with experimental work, storage and production were given Roman numerals (mostly in Hertfordshire). Active stations and training schools had Arabic numbers. These included paramilitary schools around Arisaig in Scotland, \\"finishing\\" schools around Beaulieu in Hampshire and operational schools in various counties including Gloucestershire, Leicestershire, Oxfordshire. Active stations These were SOE's radio stations, established when SOE's signals establishments were separated from that of SIS / GCCS at Bletchley Park (originally \\"Station X\\").

Much of the work of this station involved the final equipping of agents who came through the Thatched Barn prior to going to France. Typical of the work was reproducing French clothing which was copied from newspaper photographs, catalogues etc. and had to be perfect down to the last stitch and button. Maps were hand sewn into silk underwear, agents were made up with false humped backs etc. to enhance their disguise. Strict anonymity was observed. The station was also concerned with the development of booby traps including very original devices such as bicycle pumps which were swapped and exploded when used. Other work included packing hand grenades into tins labelled as fruit. The labels were reproduced by skilled artists to look like the real thing.

The site was purchased in 1881 by the Hackensack Water Company, which developed it for water supply use. The facility was built between 1881 and 1911, and it includes a brick pumping station from 1882, a tall filtration tower, and huge underground infrastructure.http://cues.rutgers.edu/hackensack- water-works/pdfs/1_History_of_the_Hackensack_Water_Works.pdf The Hackensack Water Company was merged into United Water in the 1980s; the successor today is Suez North America. Van Buskirk Island Van Buskirk Island is a man-made island formed in 1802, and was created by the dams for the mills, The Southern End was known as the old Dock, Upper Landing or Old Landing and was the official head of navigation on the Hackensack River (the highest point of navigable water on the river). Schooners plied the river regularly between Old Dock and New York City. The land was also an industrial center from Pre- Revolutionary War times with several types of mills: saw mills, bark mills, a woolen mill, and finally a gristmill. After this it was used as the site for the Hackensack Water Company from 1882. The site remains historically intact from 1911, including important steam equipment from the Industrial Revolution. Preservation In 1990, United Water (formerly Hackensack Water Company) ceased using the site and offered it to Oradell, then Bergen County. The island is currently in a state of transition and the focus of a battle between the county and conservation groups regarding its future status and use as a park and/or recreational area. Preservation New Jersey voted the plant \\"One of 10 Most Endangered Historic Sites\\" in 1996. In 2002, the National Trust for Historic Preservation placed Hackensack Water Company site on its list of 11 Most Endangered National Historic Places. In May 2001, the site was listed on New Jersey Register of Historic Places - Period of Historic Importance 1882-1914. The site is currently in a state of disrepair, and although proposals have been made by Bergen County for what to do with the site, its future is uncertain. Bergen County Division of Historic and Cultural Affairs is attempting to build public support for redeveloping the site. In August 2011, the state awarded $704,000 to be administered by the New Jersey Historic Trust for the stabilization of buildings at the complex so that the site could be opened to the general public.

It is written by and stars Mitch Benn and Robin Ince. It also features Mitch's group The Distractions (Kirsty Newton and Tash Baylis) and in the first two series Alfie Joey. It began in 2004, and has run for three series so far. Format =Series One and Two= The first two series had a discussion format in which, every week, the presenters would talk about some aspect of the music industry, inevitably tying into whatever songs Mitch had prepared (something Robin would comment sarcastically upon). Running gags included regular appearances by Satan (Robin Ince) complaining that heavy metal was getting soft; Robin's obsession with The Smiths and talking head clip shows he had appeared in; Alfie's obsession with Lindisfarne; and, in the first series, Mitch's paranoia that Richard Stilgoe is a better musical satirist. In both series the final episode was a \\"format-buster\\" with a special guest star. The last episode of series one started out as a discussion of manufactured bands, but was derailed when Richard Stilgoe appeared and attempted a coup, with Robin taking his side. The series two finale, Journey to the Centre of Rick Wakeman, a parody of 1970s progressive rock \\"concept albums\\", was set in the near future (2009, to be exact), when England and Wales are on the point of war and the Crimes team must reform to bring Rick Wakeman out of a coma so he can bring peace. =Series Three= The third series worked the musical satire into a sitcom format. The concept was that Mitch and Robin were taking the show on tour, but consistently failing to arrive at their destinations and performing wherever they ended up. The first two episodes were set in fictional small towns in Canada and Wales, respectively. In the third they were trapped at London Stansted Airport, trying to get to Australia. This led directly into the final episode, in which their plane crashed on a mysterious island, in a parody of Lost. Recurring jokes in this series included Morrissey (played by Ince) appearing at some point, and the fact the Distractions were present during the musical numbers, and occasionally referred to, but almost never directly involved in the plot. Crimes Against Music album Crimes Against Music is a 2005 album by Mitch Benn and The Distractions named after and featuring songs from the show, as well as The Now Show and It's Been a Bad Week. \\"The Curse Of Robin Ince\\" Series one made a regular feature of Robin Ince's celebrated impression of the well-loved DJ John Peel. Peel's death in October 2004 required that this feature be dropped for series two; accordingly Ince wrote and recorded a series of sketches using his impression of rock DJ Tommy Vance. By a bizarre quirk of fate, Vance himself died shortly before series two was due to begin broadcasting; Ince had to be hurriedly smuggled into a recording of The Now Show in order to record re-written versions of the Vance sketches in his \\"Satan\\" persona, Satan being less vulnerable to The Curse. Ince's John Peel impression was resurrected for the last episode of series two, where he played \\"The Ghost of John Peel\\".

The Daily Herald called this day Red Friday; a union defeat four years earlier had been called \\"Black Friday\\". The 1926 General Strike followed nine months later. Background There had been a long history of labour unrest in the British coal mining industry. A triple alliance had been formed in 1914 of the Miners Federation, the Transport and General Workers Union and the National Union of Railwaymen, for mutual support in trade disputes, but had been unable to undertake united action due to World War I. In 1916, at the height of World War I, Lloyd George's government had taken control of the industry, but with inflation the purchasing power of miners' wages had fallen. After the war government control was relaxed, and the triple alliance was revived. In 1919, as a conciliatory measure, the government appointed a royal commission to investigate the industry under Mr Justice Sankey, which recommended the nationalisation of mining royalties but did not explain how this would be achieved. The government, citing the lack of unanimity of the commission, declined to implement its report. The government responded to a strike by the Yorkshire miners in July 1919 by planning measures to maintain the mines during the strike. In April 1921 the miners went on strike, seeking equalisation of wages between coalfields, but the unity of the triple alliance collapsed, leaving the miners to fight on until hunger drove them back to work on Black Friday, leaving the employers (who had come together in the Mining Association) in control. There was a small concession to the miners of a temporary subsidy of ¬£10M, but their average pay fell by 30% during 1921. Red Friday In April 1925 Britain returned to the gold standard. This was effectively a revaluation of sterling, and led to deflation in the British economy over the following years. This made it difficult for the coal owners to export coal profitably in the face of resurgent German exports. On 30 June the Mining Association gave notice to terminate the 1924 wage agreement, after which wages would be cut (with no national minimum) and hours increased. Negotiations took place, but it was soon apparent that, without a subsidy, a strike or lock-out was inevitable. The miners had secured an agreement from the railwaymen that they would not handle coal. This was likely to result in the railway companies sacking those who refused, leading to a railway strike. The government reviewed emergency arrangements and Prime Minister Baldwin concluded, \\"We were not ready\\". In consequence the government backed down, and negotiated a subsidy for the coal industry to last nine months to enable the employers to maintain wages and conditions. This cost ¬£23M. It seems that an emergency plan existed on paper, but would require the recruitment of many volunteers to implement it, and the staff did not exist. Reaction The subsidy could only be a temporary measure. The government immediately put in hand measures to be implemented in the event of a general strike, which seemed inevitable when the subsidy ended.

The D.III was the first major original design from Pfalz Flugzeugwerke. Though generally considered inferior to contemporary Albatros and Fokker fighters, the D.III was widely used by the Jagdstaffeln from late 1917 to mid-1918. It continued to serve as a training aircraft until the end of the war. Design and development Pfalz D.III prototype in April 1917 Pfalz D.III (serial 4114/17) of Marine Feld Jasta II Prior to World War I, Pfalz Flugzeugwerke produced Morane-Saulnier monoplane designs under license.Herris 2001, p. 10. These aircraft entered military service as the Pfalz A- and E-series. In September 1916, Pfalz began producing the first of 20 Roland D.I and 200 Roland D.II fighters under license.Herris 2001, pp. 27‚Äì28. In November 1916, Pfalz hired Rudolph Gehringer from Flugzeugbau Friedrichshafen GmbH.VanWyngarden 2006, p. 18. As Pfalz's new chief engineer, Gehringer immediately commenced work on an original fighter design. The resulting D.III emerged in April 1917. Like the Rolands, the D.III used a plywood monocoque fuselage. Two layers of thin plywood strips were placed over a mold to form one half of a fuselage shell.Herris 2001, p. 30. The fuselage halves were then glued together, covered with a layer of fabric, and doped. This Wickelrumpf (wrapped body) method was a patented invention of the LFG firm.Wagner 1971, pp. 75-76. It gave the fuselage great strength, light weight, and smooth contours compared to conventional construction techniques.Herris 2001, p. 30. However, it also proved to be more labor-intensive and expensive. Furthermore, fuselages of the Wickelrumpf type proved to be liable to twisting or warping in service, affecting performance as well as causing control problems. This has been attributed to moisture absorption in damp front-line conditionsHerris 2001, pp. 61‚Äì62. or to the use of insufficiently seasoned wood. The wings were of conventional construction, with a flush Teves und Braun radiator offset to the right side of the upper wing. The ailerons were wooden, rather than the more usual steel tube construction.Gray and Thetford 1962, p. 188. The horizontal stabilizer had an inverted airfoil section, which facilitated dive recovery and permitted the use of an unbalanced elevator. Idflieg found the prototype promising. It directed Pfalz to halt production of the Roland D.III and to complete the balance of the contract, 70 aircraft, to the new design. After a Typenpr√ºfung (type test) at Adlershof in May, the Idflieg ordered various modifications, including an enlarged rudder and horn-balanced ailerons.VanWyngarden 2006, p. 19. In June 1917, Pfalz received a second order for 300 aircraft. Operational history Pfalz D.IIIa (serial 8143/17) flown by Oberleutnant Walter Ewers of Jasta 77b. The aircraft displays hastily applied Balkenkreuz markings Deliveries to operational units began in August 1917. Jasta 10 was the first recipient of the new aircraft, followed by Jasta 4. While markedly better than the earlier Roland designs, the D.III was generally considered inferior to the Albatros D.III and D.V. German pilots variously criticized the Pfalz's heavy controls, low speed, lack of power, or low rate of climb compared to the Albatros.Herris 2001, pp. 61‚Äì62.Gray and Thetford 1962, p. 189.VanWyngarden 2006, pp. 50, 62. The D.III slipped in turns, leading to crashes when unwary pilots turned at very low altitudes.Herris 2001, pp. 61‚Äì62.VanWyngarden 2006, p. 77. Moreover, the Pfalz stalled sharply and spun readily. Recovery from the resulting flat spin was difficult, though some pilots took advantage of this trait to descend quickly or evade enemy aircraft.VanWyngarden 2006, pp. 45‚Äì46. The Pfalz's primary advantage was its strength and sturdiness. The Albatros scouts were plagued by failure of their single-spar lower wings.Herris 2001, p. 29. The Pfalz, however, could safely dive at high speeds due to its twin-spar lower wing.Guttman 2005, p. 9. For this reason, the Pfalz was well-suited to diving attacks on observation balloons, which were usually heavily defended by anti- aircraft guns trained to the balloon's altitude.Guttman 2005, pp. 7‚Äì9. =D.IIIa= The most pressing complaint about the new Pfalz was that the guns were buried in the fuselage, preventing pilots from clearing gun jams in flight.Herris 2001, p. 30. This feature had been carried over from the earlier Roland designs. In November 1917, Pfalz responded by producing the slightly modified D.IIIa, which relocated the guns to the upper fuselage decking.Herris 2001, p. 30. The D.IIIa was distinguishable by its enlarged semicircular horizontal stabilizer and cropped lower wingtips.Herris 2001, p. 30. It also featured a more powerful version of the Mercedes D.III engine. Pfalz built approximately 260 D.III and 750 D.IIIa aircraft. Most were delivered to Bavarian Jastas.VanWyngarden 2006, p. 45. Once Pfalz completed the final batch in May 1918,Grosz 1995, p. 2. production shifted to the D.IIIa's successor, the D.XII. Some aircraft from the final D.IIIa batch were delivered to Turkey.Grosz 1995, p. 2. As of 30 April 1918, 433 D.IIIa scouts were still in frontline use.Herris 2001, p. 154. By 31 August, that number had declined to 166.Herris 2001, p. 154. Many serviceable aircraft were sent to advanced training schools, but approximately 100 aircraft remained in frontline use at the time of the Armistice.

Launched in 2006 as the UK Clinical Aptitude Test (UKCAT), it was renamed in 2019 following the launch of the test in Australia and New Zealand. It is one of two main admissions tests used in the UK for medical, dental and other health-related courses, the other being the BioMedical Admissions Test (BMAT). Format The UCAT is designed to be a test of aptitude and attitude, not academic achievement. The latter is already demonstrated by A-Levels, Scottish Highers or undergraduate degrees. It attempts to assess a certain range of mental abilities and behavioural attributes identified as useful. These mental abilities include critical thinking as well as logical reasoning and inference. For candidates sitting the examination in summer 2019, the UCAT consists of five subtests: four cognitive tests, and one testing your professional demeanour. Each test has a time allocation as below: * Verbal Reasoning ‚Äì assesses candidates' ability to think logically about written information and arrive at a reasoned conclusion. The candidate is given 22 minutes, with 11 passages to read and 44 questions to answer in that time. * Decision Making ‚Äì assesses ability to apply logic to reach a decision or conclusion, evaluate arguments and analyse statistical information. The candidate is allocated 32 minutes to answer 29 items associated with text, charts, tables, graphs or diagrams. * Quantitative Reasoning ‚Äì assesses candidates' ability to solve numerical problems. The candidate is given 25 minutes to answer 36 questions associated with either tables, charts, graphs etc. as information. * Abstract Reasoning ‚Äì assesses candidates' ability to infer relationships from information by convergent and divergent thinking. The candidate is allocated 14 minutes to answer 55 questions associated with sets of shapes. The situational judgement test is a different type of test from the tests above: * Situational Judgement ‚Äì measures candidates' responses in situations and their grasp of medical ethics. This section of the test is 27 minutes long, with 69 questions associated with 22 scenarios. The test is an online test taken at a Pearson Vue centre near the candidate. Candidates are not allowed to bring external materials in to the exam. A basic calculator is provided on the screen in the quantitative reasoning and decision making tests, along with a white board and a marker pen for taking notes. The equipment and conditions vary slightly between different test centers. Including warm-up time (time allocated to reading the instructions), the test lasts a maximum of 2 hours (or 2.5 hours for the UCATSEN version of the test). Each of the UCAT subtests is in a multiple choice format and is separately timed. The test must be sat in the summer of 2019 by candidates who want to apply to member universities for entry in 2020 (or deferred entry in 2021). Content and preparation There is no curriculum content, as the test is designed to probe innate skills. These include basic arithmetic, reading and writing ability, along with character, and personal and social attitudes. Past papers are not available. There are however specimen questions and fully timed practice tests on the UCAT website. All candidates are urged to read this attentively. The UCAT Consortium recommend that candidates prepare for the test, and provide extensive free materials on their site to assist. Widening Participation The UCAT Consortium offers a bursary scheme to cover the full test fee to UK and EU candidates in financial need who meet a set eligibility criteria.

It is the sequel to Night Watch and Day Watch and the third part of a saga that continues with Last Watch and New Watch and concludes with Sixth Watch. Structure and style Lukyanenko returns to a structure closer to that he used in the Night Watch novel than the Day Watch novel. Twilight Watch is divided into three stories- Nobody's Time, Nobody's Space, and Nobody's Power. Each story begins with a prologue followed by seven numbered chapters and concluding with an Epilogue. Except for the prologues, the events of each story are written in a first person narrative using the voice of the Light Magician character Anton Gorodetsky, a member of Night Watch. Events in each of the prologues are written in a third person narrative and take place entirely outside of Gordetsky's presence. The entire novel is written in the past tense. Plot Among us live the Others. They are humans who can enter the Twilight, a shadowy world that exists alongside our real world, and gain unnatural powers from it. As long as they are in the Twilight, Others are drained of their life essence and may be consumed if they remain in it for too long. Others are made up of two distinct groups - the Light Others and Dark Others. A long time ago, the Light and Dark others fought a fierce battle in which neither side could win. In the end, both sides signed a Great Treaty - a set of laws which would govern them and the use of powers. Light Others created Night Watch, to ensure that the Dark Others wouldn't break the Treaty while Dark Others created Day Watch, to watch the Light Others as well. Both sides answer to the Inquisition--an organization which ensures that neither of the two sides become too powerful. The book is separated into three novellas: =Nobody's Time= Anton Gorodetsky is assigned by Gesser to investigate mysterious warning letters sent to both the Watches and the Inquisition. In the letters, a powerful Great Light Other promises a human that they will turn him into an 'Other', which the human deeply desires. However, as far as the Others are concerned this is impossible and as such, the Light Other is in danger because refusal to fulfill this human's request means that he or she will dematerialise in the Twilight. Anton is assigned the case and goes to the Assol, a rich district in Moscow where the letters came from. Vampire Kostya Saushkin from the Day Watch has also been assigned to the case, along with Edgar and Vitezislav from the Inquisition. Anton discovers that the human is a 60-year-old businessman, the son of Gesser. The four confront Gesser about making the promise to turn his son into an Other, but Gesser denies even knowing his son was alive. It is then revealed that his son is a potential Other for whom Gesser claims the right to initiate. It is revealed later in the book that the witch, Arina, used the book of Fuaran to transform Gesser's son into an Other. =Nobody's Space= Anton joins his wife Svetlana (who left the Night Watch), her mother, and their daughter (Nadya) on a vacation in a remote area. Whilst there, he learns of an incident where werewolves tried to attack two human children but who were saved by a mysterious woman living in the forest. Anton magically reads the older girl's memory, and notices that she saw a book titled \\"Fuaran\\" on the shelf. Anton can hardly believe it, as Fuaran is a legendary and extremely powerful artifact, believed to be lost ages ago or maybe never to have existed at all. According to stories, the book, written by an ancient witch (named Fuaran) contains a spell able to turn an ordinary human into an Other. Anton finds the witch's cottage and the witch, Arina, who turns out to be level 1 or higher, but not Fuaran. Instead, all Anton finds is a book about the legend of Fuaran which is co-authored by Arina. The book explains how Fuaran discovered how to raise the power of an Other, and grant a human the powers of an Other. According to the book, the average magical temperature of the world was 97 degrees, while humans had a magical temperature of 97 or higher. Their warmth is fed into their surroundings, while the Others have a magical temperature under 97, and thus soak up the 'warmth' that surrounded them. The lower an Other's magical temperature, the more they soaked up. Seventh level Others had a magical temperature of about 90, while Others without Classification were in the 40s. The rarest type of other is one who had no magical temperature at all, a Zero Other, whose power was near limitless due to the fact they only absorbed magic. After a talk with Svetlana, Anton discovers Nadya is an absolute Zero Other. Later, as Anton is relaxing in a hammock, he opens his eyes to find Edgar (an Inquisitor) standing over him. Edgar explains to Anton that Arina was wanted for questioning. In turns out the witch played a major role in a joint Watch experiment to create the perfect socialist state in the 20s. Arina was meant to put a potion in the bread that, over time, would cause whoever ate it to fully believe in newly arising government. Instead, all the subjects were turned quickly to the cause, which lead to the downfall of the government and the death of nearly all the subjects, supposedly due to Arina's intentional sabotage. Confronted by Anton and Edgar, Arina dives into the fourth level of the twilight, where it takes time before the pair manage to follow her, only to find that she had escaped. Edgar and Anton return to the real world and decide that it would not be smart to search a Higher Other's house, as Arina had proven herself to be. Having lost their target, the duo split ways, Edgar to get backup in order to find the witch and Anton to return to his family. Once back home Sveta and Anton learn that while Sveta's mother was out in the forest with their daughter, her 'old friend' took their daughter for a walk. Sveta and Anton knew instantly it was Arina, and through magical means contact her. The Inquisition had erected a dome to stop the witch from escaping, and she was holding Nadya hostage with demands that they find her a means to escape. After Sveta sends out magical means to search for Nadya (which nearly blew Anton away) and discovers nothing, the werewolves, who had felt Sveta's power and were afraid she would come after them, showed up. It turned out to be a man in his twenties with three children. They admitted having seen where Arina took Nadya and agreed that as long as they were pardoned for hunting the children, they would help track down and fight Arina. In the end, after a battle between Arina and a very angry Sveta, Nadya is saved, and with no deaths. Sveta, who traveled to Arina via the fifth level of the twilight, seemed changed, as though she had a new understanding on life. After forcing Arina to agree not to hurt any human or Other unless in self-defense, Sveta agreed to help her find a means to leave. =Nobody's Power= Anton later travels to Moscow in order to talk to Gesar, at which point Gesar receives a phone call, asking him to go to the witches hut, where Anton had only just been. After traveling there with Anton through magical means, they meet Kostya, Edgar, Zabulon and Svetlana. Vitezoslav's ashes have been found in a hidden room with no indication of who could have killed him, except that it would have to be someone powerful, as Vitezoslav was a Higher Vampire. At first, they suspect Arina. However, it soon turns out that the Other who killed Vitezoslav and took the book is Kostya, who himself became a Higher Vampire after drinking a blood cocktail made from donors in order to raise a vampire to this max potential. Originally, Vitezoslav found the book and phoned Edgar, who didn't believe the vampire had found the actual book of Fuaran. But Kostya wasn't convinced the book was a fake and joined Vitezoslav at the hut. The Inquisitor wanted to see if the book actually worked and tried it on Kostya, using his cocktail of a blood mixture made from 12 donors, increasing his powers exponentially, after which Kostya challenged Vitezoslav to a vampire duel. The loser of such a duel is ashed. His ultimate goal is to travel to the International Space Station and read the book while looking at the Earth from orbit (the spell of Fuaran works on everyone in the caster's range of sight), turning all humans into Others, so at last he will not be different from the rest. All but Kostya realize that this will be a disaster - \\"you step on someone's foot in a tram, he curses at you; now he can incinerate you.\\" Also, what most Others do not realize is that it is, in fact, humans who emit magical energy. The Others absorb it more than they emit, allowing them to use it. The magic level of an Other depends on the absorb/emit ratio. There were several \\"zero\\" Others in history: Jesus (Yehoshua), Merlin, and Anton and Svetlana's daughter, Nadya. Their power is nearly unlimited as all they do is absorb magic. If Kostya manages to turn all humans into Others, the amount of magic energy available will drastically decrease. To demonstrate the effectiveness of \\"Fuaran\\" to Anton, he uses it on a human, turning him into a low-level Other. What neither Kostya nor Anton realized at the moment was that Anton was affected too - as he was standing right in front of Kostya - turning him into a mage without classification (Gesser/Zabulon/Sveta's level). Kostya makes it to the Baikonur Cosmodrome and mind-controls the humans there to suit him up for the rocket launch. Anton catches up and confronts him, with Gesar, Zabulon, and Edgar all linked to his mind, and feeding him energy from everyone they have the right to leach it from. Each is telling him to use a different destructive spell on the vampire. They realize that Kostya is not planning to steal a rocket, as not even the Higher Vampire is capable of launching a rocket into orbit by himself. He is instead planning to open a portal to the space station. As a precaution, he is still putting on a spacesuit. However, when Kostya was about to open the portal, Anton took all the energy channeled into him by Gesar, Zabulon, and Edgar and spent it to create a shield around himself in order to shield his thoughts from Kostya. What Anton did not want the vampire to realize was that because Kostya was an Other (an Other without classification to boot), he would not be able to perform any magic in the vast emptiness of space. There would be no energy there from which he could draw on, in space he was separated from the source of all Others' energy. Kostya, assuming the shield was put up because Anton was afraid and wanted to protect himself from harm, expressed his surprise at such an act of cowardice and opened the portal. Only when the vampire stepped through it did Anton relax - the threat was over. It takes thousands of calculations to put a rocket into orbit. He knew that Kostya could not possibly calculate the exact position of the station. The portal deposited Kostya into orbit, leaving him to float in his spacesuit, unable to perform any magic. He could not make a corrective teleport into the space station - he could not open a portal back to the planet. He could only remain in orbit as that orbit decayed and he ended up burning up in the atmosphere upon re-entry, along with the book. With the death of Kostya and others in the recent past, the Day Watch in Moscow is down to one Higher Level Magician (Zavulon) while The Night watch in Moscow has four (Gesar/Olga/Sveta/Anton).

The politically motivated faction within JM is primarily made up of former Ba'athist members mainly from the Sunni region. Many who enjoyed special status during the leadership of Saddam Hussein were from Tikrit, which is in turn within an area of Iraq where the Arab population is mostly Sunni. People who generally hold the ex-vice-president, Izzat Ibrahim ad-Douri, in exceptionally high esteem were members of the security, intelligence and police forces from the previous government. Jaysh Muhammad was initially believed to consist of fighters who had infiltrated Iraq from Saudi Arabia and other Arab countries. Later it was reported by the Iraq Survey Group, that membership appears to be primarily of Iraqi citizens, former regime officers. This was supported by their ability to use a pre-war information network and supply infrastructure. The JM was responsible for sophisticated attacks on Coalition forces during early 2004, assisted by former intelligence and security officers. Attacks On August 19, 2003, a masked man claiming to speak for the Islamic Jihad Brigades of Muhammad's Army, Abdallah Bin-Iyad Brigade, took responsibility for the a bombing at the UN compound in Baghdad through an audiotape provided to Lebanon's LBC satellite television. A group calling itself the Armed Vanguards of the Second Muhammad Army claimed responsibility for the bombing of the UN headquarters in Baghdad, The claim took the form of a typewritten, Arabic statement shown on the Al-Arabiya station on August 21, 2003. On January 31, 2004, men with their faces covered circulated a declaration in Fallujah outlining their plan for taking control of Iraqi cities after the US occupation forces withdraw. The declaration was signed by 12 organizations and groups including: The Iraqi Islamic Patriotic Resistance (al-Muqawamah al-Wataniyah al-Islamiyah al-'Iraqiyah), the Salafi Movement for Propagation and Jihad (al-Harakah as- Salafiyah li-d-Da'wah wa-l-Jihad), the al-Qari'ah Organization (Tanzim al- Qari'ah), the Army of Partisans of the Sunnah (Jeish Ansar as-Sunnah), and the Army of Muhammad. An anonymous interview with a member of Jaysh Muhammad from Ba'qubah gave to the Institute for War and Peace Reporting was published on May 14, 2004. The insurgent stated that the majority of Jaysh Muhammad combatants are farmer workers who joined the Salafist Sunni movement to drive the coalition from Iraq. He said there were only a few foreign fighters in the group and that they had \\"lived with us [before the war] and did not come from abroad after the war.\\" He denied that the group, which he described as not Wahhabi, is linked to Al-Qaeda. He also claimed that the group received no funding from abroad, but that it is funded \\"from honorable and good people in this country.\\" He said that Jaysh Muhammad opposed the Iraqi Governing Council because it was not elected, and since so many of the Council members were exiles. \\"They do not understand Iraqis' suffering and Arab traditions. [They] were distorted by the Western life they lived,\\" he said. He also claimed that his group is affiliated with an Islamic political party, but declined to identify which party, only to say that it is not the Iraqi Islamic Party. While he denied the group targeted Iraq police officers, he condoned the kidnapping of foreigners, saying that \\"kidnapping is an obligation.\\" He also said: \\"There is no real United Nations. It is an organization completely controlled by the United States and its resolutions always serve U.S. interests.\\" In November 2004 during Operation Phantom Fury, the U.S. staged a large scale assault on Fallujah and captured Moayad Ahmed Yasseen, the leader of Jaysh Muhammad. Yasseen while under detention of the Coalition soldiers confessed to seeking aid from the Iranian government and having contacts with Iranian intelligence officers. Yasseen was a former colonel in Saddam Hussein's army. Yaseen went on to state Iranian officials provided money, weapons \\"and as far as I know even car bombs\\" for the group. He said among the officials they met in Iran was its supreme leader Ali Khamenei. He further stated he received permission from Saddam Hussein, before his capture, to seek money and weapons from the Syrian government, he did not state if that request was granted. Stratfor however reported that no evidence has been produced to date that Hussein oversaw strategic decision-making for, or provided money to, any guerrilla force.Iraq Insurgency: Not About Saddam Hussein Stratfor Furthermore, Jeish Muhammad in a statement to Basra Network denied that Yassen was ever a commanding general in the group, as was claimed in the media.Statement by the General Command of the Army of Muhammad Regarding the arrest of Moayad Ahmed Yassin Basra Network Composition It is rumored that Jaysh Muhammad is the military wing of the Arab Socialist Ba'th Party (ASBP).http://www.conflictsforum.com/Briefs/Briefing1.pdf The group is said to have been founded in 2003 by a group of insurgents in Diyala during a meeting between representatives from the towns of Ramadi, Fallujah, Samarra and Baquba.

Members of the group do not produce tubular or subcylindrical pseudopodia, like amoebae of the class Tubulinea. When a discosean is in motion, a transparent layer called hyaloplasm forms at the leading edge of the cell (see lamelliopodium). In some discoseans, short \\"subpseudopodia\\" may be extended from this hyaloplasm, but the granular contents of the cell do not flow into these, as in true pseudopodia. Discosean amoebae lack hard shells, but some, like Cochliopodium and Korotnevella secrete intricate organic scales which may cover the upper (dorsal) surface of the cell. No species have flagella or flagellated stages of life. The composition of Discosea is similar to that of the class Flabellinea, proposed by Alexey Smirnov and his collaborators in 2005. However, Discosea is a more comprehensive taxon, including several groups not included in Flabellinea. In 2011, Smirnov et al. accepted Discosea as a class, and reduced Flabellinea to the rank of a subclass with the name Flabellinia.

The settlement has several outposts and covers a total area of approximately 7,000 dunams of land. Itamar's residents have been the target of several lethal attacks by Palestinian militants, most notably the 2011 massacre of the Fogel family by residents of the nearby village of Awarta. HRW reports an extensive number of violent acts by settlers from Itamar and its outposts against local Palestinians. History According to ARIJ, Itamar was founded on land which Israel had confiscated from several nearby Palestinian villages: * 2,450 dunums from Awarta,‚ÄòAwarta Village Profile, ARIJ, p. 15 * 441 dunums from Beit Furik for Itamar and Michola,Beit Furik Town Profile, ARIJ, p. 16 * 1,085 dunums from Yanun/Aqraba for Itamar and Gitit.Aqraba Town Profile (including Yanun Locality), ARIJ, p. 16 The settlement was established in 1984 by several families from the Machon Meir Yeshiva in Jerusalem with the assistance of Gush Emunim's settlement organization Amana.Amana:\\"Itamar\\" Originally named Tel Chaim, commemorating Chaim Landau, it was later named for Ithamar, the youngest son of Biblical figure Aaron (Exodus 28:1).

According to Palestinians at Yanun,Haaretz staff, 'Settlers attack Palestinian olive-pickers in West Bank,' at Haaretz 19 October 2002 before the al-Aqsa Intifada, relations between local villagers and Itamar, the nearest legal settlement, had been on a good footing. After the killing of 13 Israeli Arabs in Jerusalem, matters rapidly deteriorated, and over 3 years, Palestinian militants killed some 11 Itamar settlers. In Itamar, blame for these killings was laid at the door of local Palestinian villagers, who according to Californian emigrant Alon Zimmerman, were believed to provide militants with local support.Vikram Sura,'No olive branch for Yanun?,' at The Hindu, 12 October 2003. The whole village of Yanun, though never linked to any violence or attack, itself was so harassed by local Itamar hilltop settlers that its entire population was put to flight, and sought refuge in Awarta, and became, according to Joel Greenberg 'the first case in memory in which harassment by Jewish settlers has emptied an entire Palestinian community'.Joel Greenberg ‚ÄòIsraeli Settlers' Zeal Forces Palestinians To Flee Their Town,‚Äô New York Times, 21 October 2002. At the time of the uprising Itamar had a reputation among Israelis one of the hard core settlements. One visitor at the time remarked that many of its recent residents were immigrants from the former Soviet empire, and from Argentina, who spoke poor Hebrew and dwelt in trailers and appeared to have little awareness of where they were or why anyone should object to their presence there.Matt Rees, Cain's Field: Faith, Fratricide, and Fear in the Middle East, Simon & Schuster 2004, p.247. The Itamar settlement is the object of land disputes. The borders of the settlement stretch out south-east to take in an area 14 times the actual area of construction, in a way that completely blocks any possibility for the development of the Palestinian village, with a population of 9,000, of Beit Furiq.Yehezkel Lein, Eyal Weizman, Terra Rubata: La politica israeliana di insediamento in Cisgiordania, B'Tselem (n.d.) pp.96-7:'I confini municipali dell‚Äôinsediamento di Itamar si estendono su una diagonale in direzione sud-est per un‚Äôarea di circa 7000 dunam, quattordici volte l‚Äôattuale area di costruzione, che include anche un certo numero di nuovi avamposti. Questa enorme area blocca completamente lo sviluppo della citt√† di Beit Furiq (9,000) a sud. Inoltre, nel corso degli anni, i coloni di questi insediamenti hanno esercitato violenza contro i palestinesi del luogo mentre le autorit√† israeliane non-si impegnano a far rispettare la legge'. A Peace Now analysis in 2006 provided the following breakdown of the situation at Itamar. The settlement area extended over 4.780 square kilometres (1,195 acres) of which 2.094 square kilometers (523.5 acres) or 43.80% was private land. The land owned by Jews amounted to 0.002 square kilometres (60 acres) or 0.05%.Dror Etkes & Hagit Ofran, One Violation Leads to Another:Israeli Settlement Building on Private Palestinian Property (A Report of Peace Now‚Äôs Settlement Watch Team) at BBC News, 2006 p.28 A follow up report specified that in the data provided by the Israeli Civil Administration \\"there is no mention of whether the private land is owned by Palestinians or by Jews privately owned... Nevertheless, it is highly probable that most of the land that is marked here as private land (if not all of it) is privately owned Palestinian land\\". The settlement of Itamar, not including the outposts, grew from a population of less than 300 in 1995 to 785 in 2008, and reached a population of over 1,000 in 2009, predominantly Orthodox ‚Äì most of them newly religious ‚Äì Jewish settlers. Locals state that low property prices account for part of the attraction, with a three-bedroom Itamar house priced around ¬£75,000, compared to roughly ¬£375,000 in Jerusalem.Nick Meo, 'The wave of radical Israeli settlers digging in for the long haul in the West Bank,' at The Daily Telegraph, 22 December 2012. According to resident Leah Zak, following the Fogel family massacre, much of the community became invested in growing and developing Itamar; this included naming several social projects after members of the Fogel family. In the year following the attack, it was reported that 21 families had moved to Itamar. Geography Samarian hills, 2011 Itamar is situated east of the Israel-Westbank separation barrier, 28 kilometers from the Green line in the region known as \\"Gav Hahar\\" (Hump of the Mountain). Its municipal boundaries extend in a south-east diagonal over an area of some 7,000 dunam including several outposts, the furthest of which is about eight kilometers from Itamar. Itamar and its outposts partly encircled the small Palestinian village of Yanun, and block the development of the Palestinian town of Beit Furik, according to a report by Israeli human rights organization B'tselem. In the 1990s, Itamar seized the surrounding hills, establishing the outposts The Point in 1996, Hill 836, Hill 851 and Giv'ot Olam in 1998, Hill 777 and Hill 782 in 1999, and in 2002 Itamar North. Five of these outposts were approved by former prime minister Ehud Barak in 2000. At the time, a master plan gave the settlement a total area of some 6,000 dunams. In addition to Itamar, three other settlements are located in the Harey Kadem mountains: Yitzhar, Har Bracha, and Elon Moreh. Leah Goldsmith, the wife of Rabbi Moshe Goldsmith, wrote about the town: > It is hill country, tremendously big, picturesque and mysterious, varied > with long and wide valleys who resemble a mosaic coat of many colors ranging > from pea to deep jade greens and chestnut browns in the winter and spring > months. In the summertime the colors are dry, like the colors of Rebecca's > jug, in which she served Eliezer and the camels in Babylon. > > There are springs and wells in the hills.

In every direction that one looks, the > views are emanated with authentic biblical greatness and Jewish nobility. > This is the chief feature of the landscape, of your life in it, and you are > struck by the feeling of having lived here in the past. Economy Itamar was among the settlements which were designated a \\"national priority zone\\" in December 2009, and is entitled to an average of NIS 1,000 per person per year in subsidies in addition to the ordinary settlement subsidies. There are several businesses in the settlement, and many of the residents grow organic crops and raise sheep and goats;Itamar: Religious West Bank settlers BBC News, 21 June 2002 larger farms produce a range of further products, such as cheese and olive oil.Itamar website According to local residents, 80% of Israel's domestically sold organic eggs are produced at Itamar's chicken farm.

According to B'Tselem, \\"settlers from these settlements have exerted violence against local Palestinians; the Israeli authorities have been delinquent in enforcing the law on the offenders\\". One of Itamar's founders, Brigadier General Avichai Ronski, in the wake of the Fogel massacre, went on record advocating collective punishment for Palestinian villages when any of their residents are found to be responsible for a murder of a Jew: > \\"A village like this, like Awarta, from which the murderers of the Fogel > family and of the Shebo family emerged, must suffer as a village.

Arieh Arnaldo Leon Agranionic (48) was shot and killed at close range on 8 May 2001 while defending Itamar. A number of infiltrations into Itamar have also resulted in deaths. In May 2002, a Palestinian shot and killed two students playing basketball outside of the Hitzim yeshiva high school. He then entered the yeshiva and shot three more teenagers, one of whom died from his wounds, before being shot by one of the teachers. Less than a month later, two Palestinians broke into the home of the Shabo family and opened fire, killing Rachel Shabo (40) and three of her children, Neria (15), Zvika (12), and Avishai (5). Two other children, Asahel (10) and Avia (13), were shot and severely wounded. Yosef Twito (31), father of five, who served as commander of the neighborhood preparedness team, was also shot to death in the attack, as he approached the family's home to help. Another eight Israelis were injured when soldiers stormed the house to rescue trapped civilians. Ambulances carrying the wounded were delayed by roadblocks and pelted with stones. The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine claimed responsibility for the attack. Twitos successor, Shlomo Miller (50), was killed in August 2004 by a Palestinian identified as a member of the preventive security forces of the Palestinian Authority. In July 2002, an armed Palestinian broke into the home of David (44) and Orna Mimran (40), stabbing both of them. He also stabbed the empty beds of their eight children, who were away visiting their grandparents. They fought back and survived the attack, and an army officer killed the attacker.

Palestinian newspapers spread the unsubstantiated claim that the massacres were carried out by a disgruntled Thai worker.http://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/Itamar-killings-carried-out-by- foreign-worker Dozens of women and children from Itamar protested in October 2011 when Palestinians from Awarta were allowed to harvest olives within their security zone, as they said they were not informed prior and relatives of the murderers of the Fogel family were among the harvesters. According to the Shomron Residents Committee, Palestinian harvesters allegedly taunted the surviving Fogel children, threw rocks at Itamar residents, yelling \\"We'll Fogel you\\" and other threats. Tamar Fogel joined the protestors. Gershon Mesika, head of the Shomron Regional Council, said that Hakim Awad had used the harvest a year prior to gather information in preparation for the attack, and Brigadier General (Res.)

Violence against Jewish shepherds has also been reported. In April 2012, a skirmish took place between several Itamar settlers and Palestinians on Hill 777, a nearby outpost. Both sides reported injuries and stated that the other had initiated a confrontation. According to the Israeli account, a group of Palestinians threw rocks at them and beat them with clubs.

It is alleged that they have set fire to hundreds of olive trees and thousands of dunam of cultivated land belonging to local Palestinians.

The intermolecular mechanism is partially illustrated by the side products found in the following example: Jacobsen rearrangement Furthermore, the reaction is limited to benzene rings with at least four substituents (alkyl and/or halogen groups). The sulfo group is easily removed, so the Jacobsen rearrangement can also be considered as a rearrangement of polyalkylbenzenes. It was Herzig who described this type of rearrangement for the first time in 1881 using polyhalogenated benzenesulfonic acids, but the reaction took the name of the German chemist Oscar Jacobsen, who described the rearrangement of polyalkylbenzene derivatives in 1886.

They are best known for their various \\"Roland\\" designs, notably the Roland C.II Walfisch (whale), Roland D.II haifisch (Shark) and Roland D.VI, although they also produced a number of airships and many experimental designs. Airships The PL 18 next to an airship hangar. This was delivered to the Royal Navy as Parseval No.4 in 1913. Luft-Fahrzeug-Gesellschaft formed on April 30, 1908, from the assets of an experimental airship engine company located in Bitterfeld, Motorluftschiff Studiengesellscaft (MStG). Additional funding for the new enterprise was provided primarily by Krupp, AEG, and a local chemical company. The company's offices were located in Berlin along with the factory at Adlershof. Manufacture was transferred to Charlottenburg following a fire on 6 September 1916, allegedly caused by the British Secret Service.German Aircraft of the First World War, Gray P. & Thetford O., 1970 Putnam Their first project was an airship design by August von Parseval, a German airship designer. This entered service as the PL.II in 1910. During World War I, four were delivered to the German Army and Navy. In total some 25 \\"PL\\" airships were built, flown and delivered to various customers. The PL-26, one of the last, crashed on landing and burnt inside hangar Luftschiffhalle 2 with no fatalities. For the rest of the war the hangars were used mostly for repairs of observation balloons. Aeroplanes LFG Roland C.II Walfisch In 1913 LFG started producing new designs under the trade name Roland to avoid confusion with the Luftverkehrsgesellschaft (L.V.G.) firm. In 1916 the company developed a floatplane version of the Albatros C.Ia as the LFG W. Some parts were built in Bitterfeld, but final assembly and checkout was carried out in new factories in Stralsund. Their first successful design was the Roland C.II Walfisch (whale), a two-seat reconnaissance biplane. It had a semi-monocoque fuselage, skinned with two layers of long plywood strips glued at opposing diagonal angles around a mold and skinned with fabric both inside and outside. The fuselage filled the full gap between the wings, leaving the pilot and observer/gunner over the top wings with an excellent view upward. The fuselage \\"half-shells\\" were each fitted onto a supporting framework of wooden formers and longerons. The \\"wrapping\\" technique of the long plywood strips for the outer fuselage surface led to this particular technique of manufacture being described in German as the Wickelrumpf (wrapped body) style of construction, and was subsequently patented by the firm, licensing the construction method to Pfalz in 1917 for construction of their own single-seat fighter designs. Although it was said to have tricky handling, the Roland C.II had excellent performance, and was also used on long-range missions as a bomber escort. A version with the 200 hp Benz Bz.IV engine and new wing struts was built as the D.III, but only one prototype was ever built, as was the case for the 160 hp Mercedes D.III-powered C.V. The C.II was adapted to the pure fighter role as the Roland D.I, but in this role the poor forward view proved to be a problem. A fire at the factory severely constrained production, and only 20 were built. A newer version with a more conventional layout, the Roland D.II, followed, whose fuselage was reduced in height to leave a gap with the upper wing but was otherwise similar overall. The competing Albatros D.I was preferred, and only about 230 examples were built, which were then mostly used on the eastern front and in Macedonia. The fuselage to wing gap was further increased in the D.III, but the temperamental 180 hp Argus As.III limited production to only a handful. Six D.IIs were delivered in July 1917 to the Bulgarian Air Force, and six D.IIIs were delivered in May 1918.Aviation in Bulgaria in the Wars from 1912 to 1945, Vol I, Milano Y., 1995 Sveti Gueorgui Pobedonosetz, Sofia An LFG V 44 Although the Wickelrumpf style of wood-structure monocoque fuselage was extremely strong, it was also very difficult and time-consuming to build. A new method of construction was introduced that used spruce planking running the length of the aircraft in place of the formed plywood, and the D.III was adapted using this technique to produce D.IV triplane and D.V biplane, both powered by the D.III's 160 hp Mercedes. The fuselage shell's construction technique for these aircraft resembled a clinker-planked boat hull in appearance when finished, and was named Klinkerrumpf (clinker body) construction, and was also patented by the firm. A further adaptation of the D.IV with the 185 hp Benz Bz. III resulted in the Roland D.VI, which was entered in the First Fighter Competition trials at Adlershof in early 1918. Although the Fokker D.VII won that contest, the D.VI was also ordered into production as it used a different engine, and by the end of the war about 350 had been delivered. A large number of different versions using various engines were built as prototypes without entering production, as well as a triplane adaptation as the D.VI (also known as the Dr.I). The next major design from Roland were parasol monoplane designs, the D.XVI with the Siemens-Halske Sh.III or 170 hp Goebel Goe.IIIa rotary piston engines, and the otherwise similar D.XVII with the inline 185 hp BMW IIIa. Both were entered into the Second Fighter Competition at Adlershof, but lost to the Fokker D.VIII. After the war all aircraft production in Germany was banned, and the company was forced to close the Bitterfeld plant and reopen in Seddin, producing airplanes, balloons and life boats. In 1933, aircraft production shut down. Three additional Parseval pattern airships were also built during this period. = Aeroplane types = An LFG Roland Pfeilflieger observation biplane This is a list of aeroplane produced, taken from Nowarra, Heinz: Flugzeuge 1914‚Äì1918, M√ºnchen 1959 and Emmanuel Gustin's list of German military aircraft., Emmanuel Gustin, 1997-07-04 * C.II und C.IIa \\"Walfisch\\" biplane reconnaissance, two- seater * C.III variant of C.II, one built ‚Äì destroyed by fire when LFG plant burned, 6 September 1916Abbott, Dan S., and Grosz, Peter M. \\"The Benighted Rolands\\", Air Enthusiast Quarterly, Bromley, Kent., U.K., Volume 3, 1976, pages 39‚Äì40. * LFG Roland C.V- two-seat version of D.II, prototype only * C.VIII ‚Äì prototype only * C.X ‚Äì reconnaissance * D.I \\"Haifisch\\" ‚Äì biplane fighter with top wing mounted on fuselage * D.II ‚Äì fighter, about 230 built * D.III ‚Äì fighter, few built * D.IV ‚Äì triplane, prototype only (also known as Dr. I) * D.V ‚Äì D.III variant, only three prototypes * D.VI ‚Äì fighter, 350 built, similar to D.III, ordered as backup for D.VII * D.VII ‚Äì one prototype built * D.VIII ‚Äì one prototype built * D.IX ‚Äì three prototypes built * D.X ‚Äì projected only * D.XI ‚Äì projected only * D.XII ‚Äì projected only * D.XIII ‚Äì development abandoned when destroyed in a fire * D.XIV ‚Äì fighter, variant of D.XIII, very unreliable * D.XV ‚Äì fighter, three of a first design built, two of a second design also named D.XV * D.XVI ‚Äì fighter, prototypes only * D.XVII ‚Äì parasol-wing monoplane fighter, one built * G.I ‚Äì single engine biplane bomber, only one built * LFG Roland ME 8 ‚Äì Seaplane fighter, only projected * LFG Roland MD 14 ‚Äì reconnaissance, only projected * LFG Roland MD 15 ‚Äì reconnaissance, only projected * V 3 Susanna ‚Äì pusher flying boat * V 8 B√§rbel ‚Äì pusher flying boat * V 13 and V 130 Strela ‚Äì airliner, latter mounted on floats * V 14 - design only * V 15 - design only * V 16 - design only * V 17 - design only * V 18 Sassnitz - pusher flying boat airliner * V 19 ‚Äì single-seat submarine reconnaissance floatplane, prototype completed after 1918 * V 20 ‚Äì floatplane airliner * V 23 - design only * V 25 - design only * V 26 - design only * V 27 - design only * V 28 - design only * V 36 - design only * V 39 * V 40 * V 42 * V 44 ‚Äì one prototype builtLFG V 44 * V 52 * V 59 * V 60 * V 61 * V 101 ‚Äì floatplane airliner * LFG Roland W ‚Äì Floatplane version of Albatros C.Ia * LFG Roland WD ‚Äì Floatplane version of LFG Roland D.I rejected due to poor visibility * LFG Roland W 1 ‚Äì Seaplane, single seater fighter * LFG Roland W 16 ‚Äì Seaplane See also *List of aircraft manufacturers References Further reading *Jahrbuch der Motorluftschiff-Studiengesellschaft / Luft- Fahrzeug-Gesellschaft m.b.H. ‚Äì company year books from 1907 to 1912 digitized (German) Category:Defunct aircraft manufacturers of Germany ","title":"Luft-Fahrzeug-Gesellschaft"},{"id":"5671092","text":"Gliese 876 d is an exoplanet approximately 15 light-years away in the constellation of Aquarius. The planet was the third planet discovered orbiting the red dwarf Gliese 876. It was the lowest-mass extrasolar planet apart from the pulsar planets orbiting PSR B1257+12 at the time of its discovery. Due to this low mass, it can be categorized as a super-Earth. Characteristics =Mass, radius, and temperature= The mass of Gliese 876 d from radial velocity has one problem, it is that only a lower limit on the mass can be obtained. This is because the measured mass value also depends on the orbital inclination, which in general is unknown. However, models incorporating the gravitational interactions between the resonant outer planets enables the inclination of the orbits to be determined. This reveals that the outer planets are nearly coplanar with an inclination of around 59¬∞ with respect to the plane of the sky. Assuming that Gliese 876 d orbits in the same plane as the other planets, the true mass of the planet is revealed to be 6.83 times the mass of Earth. The low mass of the planet has led to suggestions that it may be a terrestrial planet. This type of massive terrestrial planet could be formed in the inner part of the Gliese 876 system from material pushed towards the star by the inward migration of the gas giants. Alternatively the planet could have formed further from Gliese 876, as a gas giant, and migrated inwards with the other gas giants. This would result in a composition richer in volatile substances, such as water. As it arrived in range, the star would have blown off the planet's hydrogen layer via coronal mass ejection. In this model, the planet would have a pressurised ocean of water (in the form of a supercritical fluid) separated from the silicate core by a layer of ice kept frozen by the high pressures in the planetary interior. Such a planet would have an atmosphere containing water vapor and free oxygen produced by the breakdown of water by ultraviolet radiation. Distinguishing between these two models would require more information about the planet's radius or composition. The planet does not transit its star, which makes obtaining this information impossible with current observational capabilities. Based on models, the radius of the exoplanet, based on the mass, can probably be estimated around 1.65 . The equilibrium temperature of Gliese 876 d, is estimated to be around .http://www.hpcf.upr.edu/~abel/phl/hec_plots/hec_orbit/hec_orbit_Gliese_876_d.png =Host star= The planet orbits a (M-type) star named Gliese 876. The star has a mass of 0.33 and a radius of around 0.36 . It has a surface temperature of 3350 K and is 2.55 billion years old. In comparison, the Sun is about 4.6 billion years old and has a surface temperature of 5778 K. =Orbit= Gliese 876 d is located in an orbit with a semimajor axis of only 0.0208 AU (3.11 million km). At this distance from the star, tidal interactions should in theory circularize the orbit; however, measurements reveal that it has a high eccentricity of 0.207, comparable to that of Mercury in the Solar System. Models predict that, if its non-Keplerian orbit could be averaged to a Keplerian eccentricity of 0.28, then tidal heating would play a significant role in the planet's geology to the point of keeping it completely molten. Predicted total heat flux is approximately 104‚Äì5 W/m2 at the planet's surface; for comparison the surface heat flux for Io is around 3 W/m2. This is similar to the radiative energy it receives from its parent star of about 40,000 W/m2. Discovery Gliese 876 d was discovered by analysing changes in its star's radial velocity as a result of the planet's gravity. The radial velocity measurements were made by observing the Doppler shift in the star's spectral lines. At the time of discovery, Gliese 876 was known to host two extrasolar planets, designated Gliese 876 b and c, in a 2:1 orbital resonance. After the two planets were taken into account, the radial velocity still showed another period, at around two days. The planet, designated Gliese 876 d, was announced on June 13, 2005 by a team led by Eugenio Rivera and was estimated to have a mass approximately 7.5 times that of Earth.

The planet was discovered in April 2001 and is the second planet in order of increasing distance from its star. Discovery At the time of discovery, Gliese 876 was already known to host an extrasolar planet designated Gliese 876 b. On January 9, 2001, it was announced that further analysis of the star's radial velocity had revealed the existence of a second planet in the system, which was designated Gliese 876 c. The orbital period of Gliese 876 c was found to be exactly half that of the outer planet, which meant that the radial velocity signature of the second planet was initially interpreted as a higher eccentricity of the orbit of Gliese 876 b. Orbit and mass The orbits of the planets of Gliese 876. Gliese 876 c is the second planet from the star. Gliese 876 c is in a 1:2:4 Laplace resonance with the outer planets Gliese 876 b and Gliese 876 e: for every orbit of planet e, planet b completes two orbits and planet c completes four. This leads to strong gravitational interactions between the planets, causing the orbital elements to change rapidly as the orbits precess. This is the second known example of a Laplace resonance, the first being Jupiter's moons Io, Europa and Ganymede. The orbital semimajor axis is only 0.13 AU, around a third of the average distance between Mercury and the Sun, and is more eccentric than the orbit of any of the major planets of our solar system. Despite this, it is located in the inner regions of the system's habitable zone, since Gliese 876 is such an intrinsically faint star. A limitation of the radial velocity method used to detect Gliese 876 c is that only a lower limit on the planet's mass can be obtained. This is because the measured mass value depends on the inclination of the orbit, which is not determined by the radial velocity measurements. However, in a resonant system such as Gliese 876, gravitational interactions between the planets can be used to determine the true masses. Using this method, the inclination of the orbit can be determined, revealing the planet's true mass to be 0.72 times that of Jupiter. Characteristics Based on its high mass, Gliese 876 c is likely to be a gas giant with no solid surface. Since it was detected indirectly through its gravitational effects on the star, properties such as its radius, composition, and temperature are unknown. Assuming a composition similar to Jupiter and an environment close to chemical equilibrium, the planet is predicted to have a cloudless upper atmosphere. Gliese 876 c lies at the inner edge of the system's habitable zone. While the prospects for life on gas giants are unknown, it might be possible for a large moon of the planet to provide a habitable environment. Unfortunately tidal interactions between a hypothetical moon, the planet, and the star could destroy moons massive enough to be habitable over the lifetime of the system. In addition it is unclear whether such moons could form in the first place. This planet, like b and e, has likely migrated inward.

The purpose of the highway is to provide easier access to the F.E. Everett Turnpike and U.S. Route 3 in Nashua. Most of the highway is planned to be built in Hudson, with small sections also built through the towns of Litchfield and Merrimack as well as the city of Nashua. The extant road does not have a state route designation, and is signed as \\"TO US 3 / Everett Turnpike\\" in the westbound direction and \\"TO NH 3A\\" in the eastbound direction. Route description The only segment that has been built is a short interchange road between US 3, the Daniel Webster Highway, and N.H. Route 3A. This section utilizes the Sagamore Bridge, one of the two bridges over the Merrimack River connecting Hudson to Nashua. The completed section begins at US 3, has a single interchange with the D.W. Highway, crosses the river, and terminates at NH Route 3A in Hudson. History =Justification= The Circumferential Highway has been planned since the 1950s, as the need for such a road has been apparent for a long time. To date, however, only a short segment has been built. One of the major provisions of the plan for the highway is to provide a new crossing over the Merrimack River. Currently there are four bridges over the Merrimack River between Lowell, Massachusetts and Manchester, New Hampshire. Drivers wishing to access U.S. Route 3 from the east side of the river have the following options (listed here from south to north): * The Tyngsboro Bridge, which provides access to US 3 via Massachusetts Route 113. * The Sagamore Bridge, connecting the Everett Turnpike (US 3) to New Hampshire Route 3A in Hudson, with an intermediate exit at the Daniel Webster Highway in the South Nashua retail district. * The Taylor Falls/Veterans Memorial Bridges (a.k.a. The Hudson Bridge), which puts traffic through the city streets of Nashua, such as Hollis Street and Canal Street, streets which cross several train tracks, and which lack the capacity to handle the demand. * Raymond Wieczorek Drive via the Pearl Harbor Memorial Bridge to the Manchester Airport (built in 2011). This provides a connection between NH Route 3A in the southern tip of Manchester, a few miles south of Interstate 293, and the Everett Turnpike in the southern corner of Bedford, with an interchange connecting the road with US 3. The Circumferential Highway would provide an additional river crossing between Nashua and Manchester, where one does not exist. The Sagamore Bridge crossing south of downtown Nashua was expanded and forms the only portion of the Circumferential Highway that has been constructed. =Opposition= The project has not been without controversy. Political and environmental roadblocks have caused delays for years. The highway would be built mostly through the town of Hudson, as well as small portions of Litchfield and Merrimack. This would require the seizure and destruction of many homes, and the filling in of several wetlands. A 1993 report by the EPA expressed an \\"intent to veto\\" the project as it was then planned, all but killing the full highway. Of particular concern is the impact on the Pennichuck Brook watershed, a series of ponds and creeks along the Nashua/Merrimack border. A second study has been ongoing since 1995, but no action has been made on it. Additionally, despite the population boom, there may no longer be the need for the entirety of the road as planned. The part of the highway that has been built, including the Sagamore Bridge rebuild, has bypassed the worst traffic problem, and allows easy access to U.S. 3 as well as the D.W. Highway shopping district. Widening of Route 3A in Hudson has alleviated a lot of the traffic problem as well. Travellers also have alternate routes, especially for longer distance north-south travel. Drivers heading north of Manchester or south of Lowell can take I-93 to the east. Also, US 3 in Nashua has been extensively rebuilt and widened, improving access and capacity. =Proposed alternatives= Ten different alternatives have been proposed to the road. A brief description of some of them: *A \\"No Build\\" option, which leaves the entire situation at the current status quo. *Alternatives to the northern crossing, planned in the vicinity of the Pennichuck Watershed, by choosing a less damaging crossing site. This could possibly include crossings that do not include connections to the Everett Turnpike. *Rather than a four lane freeway, the road could be built as a \\"super-two\\" highway, with at-grade crossings, a lower speed limit, and limited driveway access. *A southern crossing that may also include the removal of the Taylor Falls/Veterans Memorial bridges connecting Hudson and Nashua. This option may alleviate much of the traffic problems, but would also generate considerable social and economic stress. Future Although recent road improvements have helped alleviate some of the traffic problems, other problems that the Circumferential Highway project is supposed to remedy still have not been addressed: * There is still no river crossing between the Taylor Falls/Veterans Memorial Bridges and the Pearl Harbor Memorial bridge in Manchester. Residents of Litchfield or Merrimack must travel in either direction to cross the river. This has been cited as the major cause for keeping the project going despite years of historical setbacks. * Use of the Taylor Falls/Veterans Memorial Bridges still causes problems. East Hollis Street can still be a huge traffic problem, especially with the train crossings so close to the bridge. The US 3 Exit 5 rebuild and expansion has helped access at the highway, but getting to and from the highway can still create problems. * Though eminent domain has been cited as a possible concern, the towns of Hudson and Litchfield have specifically avoided zoning for additional construction near the proposed path of the highway. Though no official right-of-way has been established, this has created a virtual right-of-way for most of the proposed course. As of 2013, the northern terminus plan was considered abandoned by NH-DOT. In Merrimack, former easements are being reclaimed as buildable land. Major intersections See also Several other road improvement projects have been considered to complement the Circumferential Highway: * The now completed Broad Street Parkway along a realigned NH 130 was closely tied to this project. It has been completed as a two-lane road, and allows more direct access between the northwest Nashua commercial district along Broad and Amherst streets and central Nashua, allowing drivers to bypass several congested intersections. * Amherst Street (NH 101A) widening is included in all proposals for the Circumferential Highway. * Raymond Wieczorek Drive, completed in 2011, is a spur off the Everett Turnpike and provides a crossing of the Merrimack River a few miles south of I-293 in Manchester. It includes interchanges with US 3 and NH Route 3A.

It completes one orbit in approximately 61 days. Discovered in June 1998, Gliese 876 b was the first planet to be discovered orbiting a red dwarf. Discovery Gliese 876 b was initially announced by Geoffrey Marcy on June 22, 1998 at a symposium of the International Astronomical Union in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada. The discovery was made using data from the Keck and Lick observatories. Only 2 hours after his announcement, he was shown an e-mail from the Geneva Extrasolar Planet Search team confirming the planet. The Geneva team used telescopes at the Haute-Provence Observatory in France and the European Southern Observatory in La Serena, Chile. Like the majority of early extrasolar planet discoveries it was discovered by detecting variations in its star's radial velocity as a result of the planet's gravity. This was done by making sensitive measurements of the Doppler shift of the spectral lines of Gliese 876. It was the first discovered of four known planets in the Gliese 876 system. Characteristics =Mass, radius, and temperature= An artist's impression of Gliese 876 b as an enormous Jupiter-like planet with a hypothetical satellite system. Given the planet's high mass, it is likely that Gliese 876 b is a gas giant with no solid surface. Since the planet has only been detected indirectly through its gravitational effects on the star, properties such as its radius, composition, and temperature are unknown. Assuming a composition similar to Jupiter and an environment close to chemical equilibrium, it is predicted that the atmosphere of Gliese 876 b is cloudless, though cooler regions of the planet may be able to form water clouds. A limitation of the radial velocity method used to detect Gliese 876 b is that only a lower limit on the planet's mass can be obtained. This lower limit is around 1.93 times the mass of Jupiter. The true mass depends on the inclination of the orbit, which in general is unknown. However, because Gliese 876 is only 15 light years from Earth Benedict et al. (2002) were able to use one of the Fine Guidance Sensors on the Hubble Space Telescope to detect the astrometric wobble created by Gliese 876 b. This constituted the first unambiguous astrometric detection of an extrasolar planet. Their analysis suggested that the orbital inclination is 84¬∞¬±6¬∞ (close to edge-on). In the case of Gliese 876 b, modelling the planet-planet interactions from the Laplace resonance shows that the actual inclination of the orbit is 59¬∞, resulting in a true mass of 2.2756 times the mass of Jupiter. The equilibrium temperature of Gliese 876 b, is estimated to be around .http://www.hpcf.upr.edu/~abel/phl/hec_plots/hec_orbit/hec_orbit_Gliese_876_b.png This planet, like c and e, has likely migrated inward. =Host star= The planet orbits a (M-type) star named Gliese 876. The star has a mass of 0.33 and a radius of around 0.36 . It has a surface temperature of 3350 K and is 2.55 billion years old. In comparison, the Sun is about 4.6 billion years old and has a surface temperature of 5778 K. =Orbit= The orbits of the planets of Gliese 876. Gliese 876 b is the third planet from the star. Gliese 876 b is in a 1:2:4 Laplace resonance with the inner planet Gliese 876 c and the outer planet Gliese 876 e: in the time it takes planet e to complete one orbit, planet b completes two and planet c completes four. This is the second known example of a Laplace resonance, the first being Jupiter's moons Io, Europa and Ganymede. As a result, the orbital elements of the planets change fairly rapidly as they dynamically interact with one another. The planet's orbit has a low eccentricity, similar to the planets in the Solar System. The semimajor axis of the orbit is only 0.208 AU, less than that of Mercury in the Solar System. However Gliese 876 is such a faint star that this puts it in the outer part of the habitable zone. Future habitability Gliese 876 b currently lies beyond the outer edge of the habitable zone but because Gliese 876 is a slowly evolving main-sequence red dwarf its habitable zone is very slowly moving outwards and will continue to do so for trillions of years. Therefore, Gliese 876 b will, in trillions of years time, lie inside Gliese 876's habitable zone, as defined by the ability of an Earth-mass planet to retain liquid water at its surface, and remain there for at least 4.6 billion years. While the prospects for life on a gas giant are unknown, large moons may be able to support a habitable environment. Models of tidal interactions between a hypothetical moon, the planet and the star suggest that large moons should be able to survive in orbit around Gliese 876 b for the lifetime of the system. On the other hand, it is unclear whether such moons could form in the first place. However, the large mass of the gas giant may make it more likely for larger moons to form. For a stable orbit the ratio between the moon's orbital period Ps around its primary and that of the primary around its star Pp must be < 1/9, e.g. if a planet takes 90 days to orbit its star, the maximum stable orbit for a moon of that planet is less than 10 days. Simulations suggest that a moon with an orbital period less than about 45 to 60 days will remain safely bound to a massive giant planet or brown dwarf that orbits 1 AU from a Sun-like star. In the case of Gliese 876 b, the orbital period would have to be no greater than a week (7 days) in order to have a stable orbit. Tidal effects could also allow the moon to sustain plate tectonics, which would cause volcanic activity to regulate the moon's temperature and create a geodynamo effect which would give the satellite a strong magnetic field. To support an Earth-like atmosphere for about 4.6 billion years (the age of the Earth), the moon would have to have a Mars-like density and at least a mass of 0.07 . One way to decrease loss from sputtering is for the moon to have a strong magnetic field that can deflect stellar wind and radiation belts. NASA's Galileo's measurements hints large moons can have magnetic fields; it found that Jupiter's moon Ganymede has its own magnetosphere, even though its mass is only 0.025 .

Many employment websites are designed to allow employers to post job requirements for a position to be filled and are commonly known as job boards. Other employment sites offer employer reviews, career and job-search advice, and describe different job descriptions or employers. Through a job website a prospective employee can locate and fill out a job application or submit resumes over the Internet for the advertised position.

Features and types The success of jobs search engines in bridging the gap between jobseekers and employers has spawned thousands of job sites, many of which list job opportunities in a specific sector, such as education, health care, hospital management, academics and even in the non-governmental sector. These sites range from broad all-purpose generalist job boards to niche sites that serve various audiences, geographies, and industries. Many industry experts are encouraging jobseekers to concentrate on industry specific sector sites. =Job postings= A job board is a website that facilitates job hunting and range from large scale generalist sites to niche job boards for job categories such as engineering, legal, insurance, social work, teaching, mobile app development as well as cross-sector categories such as green jobs, ethical jobs and seasonal jobs. Users can typically deposit their r√©sum√©s and submit them to potential employers and recruiters for review, while employers and recruiters can post job ads and search for potential employees. The term job search engine might refer to a job board with a search engine style interface, or to a web site that actually indexes and searches other web sites. Niche job boards are starting to play a bigger role in providing more targeted job vacancies and employees to the candidate and the employer respectively. Job boards such as airport jobs and federal jobs among others provide a very focused way of eliminating and reducing time to applying to the most appropriate role. USAJobs.gov is the United States' official website for jobs. It gathers job listings from over 500 federal agencies. =Metasearch and vertical search engines= Some web sites are simply search engines that collect results from multiple independent job boards. This is an example of both metasearch (since these are search engines which search other search engines) and vertical search (since the searches are limited to a specific topic - job listings). Some of these new search engines primarily index traditional job boards. These sites aim to provide a \\"one-stop shop\\" for job-seekers who don't need to search the underlying job boards. In 2006, tensions developed between the job boards and several scraper sites, with Craigslist banning scrapers from its job classifieds and Monster.com specifically banning scrapers through its adoption of a robots exclusion standard on all its pages while others have embraced them. Industry specific posting boards are also appearing. These consolidate all the vacancies in a very specific industry. The largest \\"niche\\" job board is Dice.com which focuses on the IT industry. Many industry and professional associations offer members a job posting capability on the association website. =Employer review website= An employer review website is a type of employment website where past and current employees post comments about their experiences working for a company or organization. An employer review website usually takes the form of an internet forum. Typical comments are about management, working conditions, and pay. Although employer review websites may produce links to potential employers, they do not necessarily list vacancies.CIO - Top Sites for Researching Your Next Employerurl=http://www.cio.com/article/2387201/careers-staffing/top-8-sites- for-researching-your-next-employer.html =Websites providing information and advice for employees, employers and job seekers= Although many sites that provide access to job advertisements include pages with advice about writing resumes and CVs, performing well in interviews, and other topics of interest to job seekers there are sites that specialize in providing information of this kind, rather than job opportunities. One such is Working in Canada. It does provide links to the Canadian Job Bank. However, most of its content is information about local labor markets (in Canada), requirements for working in various occupations, information about relevant laws and regulations, government services and grants, and so on. Most items could be of interest to people in various roles and conditions including those considering career options, job seekers, employers and employees. Revenue models Employment sites typically charge fees to employers for listings job postings. Often these are flat fees for a specific duration (30 days, 60 days, etc). Other sites may allow employers to post basic listings for free, but charge a fee for more prominent placement of listings in search results. A few sites use a pay-for-performance model, where the employer listing the job pays for clicks on the listing. S In Japan, some sites have come under fire for allowing employers to list a job for free for an initial duration, then charging exorbitant fees after the free period expires. Most of these sites seem to have appeared within the last year in response to the labor shortage in Japan. Risks Many jobs search engines and jobs boards encourage users to post their resume and contact details. While this is attractive for the site operators (who sell access to the resume bank to headhunters and recruiters), job-seekers exercise caution in uploading personal information, since they have no control over where their resume will eventually be seen. Their resume may be viewed by a current employer or, worse, by criminals who may use information from it to amass and sell personal contact information, or even perpetrate identity theft.

Frank Blair. Description The Plains leopard frog grows from in length, and is typically brown in color. Their common name originates from the distinctive irregular, dark colored spotting on their backs. They have long, powerful legs, and are capable of leaping great distances. Behavior Although found throughout semiarid regions, the Plains leopard frog is almost always found in or very near permanent water sources, such as streams, creeks, and ponds. They are nocturnal, and primarily insectivorous, though they will eat almost anything they can overpower and swallow, including other frogs. They are shy animals, often fleeing beneath the water if approached. Geographic distribution The Plains leopard frog, as its name implies, is found throughout the Great Plains of the United States, from Indiana west across central and southern plains to South Dakota, south to Colorado, New Mexico, and Texas, with a disjunct population in Arizona. Conservation status The Plains leopard frog Frog is fairly common throughout its range, and holds no special conservation status, except in the state of Indiana, where it is endangered. This is probably because of the use of fertilizers and pesticides in farms located near this frog's habitats.

Both languages are split in numerous and highly divergent dialects. They, along with Hungarian, are often thought to comprise the Ugric branch of the Uralic languages, though the acceptance of Ugric is less frequent than acceptance of Ob-Ugric. The languages are spoken in the region between the Urals and the Ob River and the Irtysh in central Russia. The forests and forest steppes of the southern Urals are thought to be the original homeland of the Ugric branch. Beginning some 500 years ago the arrival of the Russians pushed the speakers eastward to the Ob and Irtysh. Some Mansi speakers remained west of the Urals until as late as the early 20th century. Hungarian split off during the 11th century BC. The Ob-Ugric languages have also been strongly influenced by nearby Turkic languages, especially Tatar. Khanty (reddish and greenish) and Mansi (bluish) dialects Mansi has about 1,000 speakers while Khanty has about 10,000 speakers, all within Russia. Until 1930, these languages had no written or literary traditions, but since 1937 have used a modified Cyrillic alphabet. However, no significant texts have been created in these languages and they have few official usages. Nature of the relationship The status of the Ob- Ugric languages as a close areal grouping is clear, with adjacent varieties regularly sharing isoglosses and having loaned vocabulary back and forth (as well as from common external sources, e.g. from eastern dialects of Komi into northern dialects of Mansi and Khanty). This effect is particularly clear between the more eastern and northern varieties of Mansi, and the more western varieties of Khanty. Modern-day Northern Mansi and Northern Khanty continue to affect each other's evolution. Some areal similarities are also shared with their eastern Samoyedic relatives, in particular between Khanty and Selkup, but also Forest Nenets. The relationship to Hungarian is looser: in their current state, the Ob-Ugric languages are radically different from Hungarian in phonology, syntax, and vocabulary. The existence of a common Ob-Ugric period after the separation from Hungarian and the rest of Uralic is not universally accepted: some linguists treat all common features of Mansi and Khanty as either later convergence under mutual influence, or retentions from the common Ugric and earlier periods. Most Uralic classifications group Khanty and Mansi together even if they reject Ugric, but Salminen (2007) and Janhunen (2009) reject Ob-Ugric as well. (Janhunen classifies Hungarian and Mansi together, omitting Khanty.) Glottolog and Ethnologue take the agnostic approach of Salminen. Typological features distinguishing the Ob-Ugric languages include: * The lack of a systematic voicing contrast. , however, is a frequent consonant word-medially. * Retention of Proto-Uralic word-initial *w as . (Also a feature of Nenets.) * Vowel harmony is found in the most archaic varieties, southern Mansi and eastern Khanty. * Ablaut of vowels, particularly in eastern Khanty * In the northern dialects: a change *k ‚Üí before back vowels. (A similar change also occurred in Hungarian.) * Retention of subject‚Äìobject‚Äìverb (SOV) word order * Retention of dual number * Partial or full replacement of the original 2nd person pronominal and suffixal elements; marked by the consonant in most Uralic languages but for the most part in Ob-Ugric. * A smaller case system than in other Uralic languages, including a lack of the genitive case.

The Murder In the early morning hours of June 5, Marcell Young, Malak Hussian, and Mustafa Hussian were shot and killed while their mother, Mary Hussian, wrestled with another gunman in a separate part of the house. On July 5, 1995, the prosecutor charged Riley Noel with the capital murders of the three children and the attempted capital murder of Mary Hussian. On June 4, 1995, Noel, appellant Carroll, Curtis Lee Cochran, and Tracy Trinette Calloway were riding around Little Rock in Cochran's car, \\"getting high\\" on drugs. Noel believed that another child of Mary Hussian, a daughter, had been involved in his brother's death. Noel apparently believed one of Hussian's daughters had set up his brother's death in a drive-by shooting, which had occurred about a week earlier. Noel told three children in the residence to get down on the floor, and Calloway testified that she told them to do what Noel said. Calloway watched Noel shoot each of the children in the head and kill them. A co- defendant tried to shoot the mother with a shotgun but it jammed, and she was able to wrestle it away, records state. Prosecutors argued that Noel, 24, killed the children to avenge his brother's slaying. Prior convictions Noel's prior convictions were: *Theft By Receiving 02/13/1990 Pulaski County (5 Yrs); *Battery-1st Degree 02/13/1990 Pulaski (5 Yrs); *Robbery 02/13/1990 Pulaski (15 Yrs); *Escape-2nd Degree - Habitual Offender 09/11/1996 Pulaski (120 Mo). Appeals Noel's supporters felt that Noel had a very strong case for appeal or clemency. The main reasons cited were: 1) He was mentally retarded; 2) Scientific evidence, unavailable at trial, indicates that severe brain damage hinders his ability to control his behavior; 3) The victim's mother, Mary Hussian, who initially supported the death penalty for Noel at his trial, has since decided to support his bid for clemency. Supporters claim that Noel's IQ was measured at 69, which is below the standard benchmark of 70 for determining mental retardation. In 2002, the U.S. Supreme Court banned the execution of people with mental retardation in Atkins v. Virginia, ruling that the practice constitutes cruel and unusual punishment. However, Court records show that Noel's most recent tests placed his score at 80. His defense lawyers argued that, despite tests showing an IQ of 80, Noel had a brain disorder and that executing him would have violated a U.S. Supreme Court directive. The lawyers also argued that medical tests not developed by the time of Noel's 1996 trial might have revealed more about his mental health. It was argued that psychologists and neurologists learned significantly more about Noel's brain damage since his trial, and have established strong connections between his neuropsychological deficit and his aggressive, impulsive behavior. Medical experts diagnosed him with Attention Deficit Disorder, poor abstract thinking skills, mental confusion, and serious visual-motor problems at an early age. When he was 13 years old, experts determined that he had a developmental age of 7. One psychological examiner observed that he was \\"extremely slow\\" in processing basic information. At trial, the jury heard that Noel had likely suffered \\"minimal\\" brain damage. Medical evidence showing the possibility that he suffers from severe brain abnormalities, were discussed in his appeals and clemency petition. However on March 6, 2003, in Noel v State the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas, ruled that Noel scientific evidence was not substantially better than the evidence of brain abnormality that he produced at the sentencing phase of his trial, and that even if Mr. Noel currently had substantial evidence that he had a brain abnormality, his claim would necessarily fail whatever the nature of that abnormality.\\" Also at trial, Hussian, the victims' mother, supported the death sentence, and gave a powerful victim impact statement. However, she has had a change of heart, and is now supporting Noel's clemency petition. She argued that the state should consider this ‚Äì the same way the jury considered her trial testimony ‚Äì when deciding on his clemency petition. However, Governor Mike Huckabee signed his death warrant June 1, 2003. Execution Kyle Jones of Miami, who had been Marcell Young's fiance, was one of the victims' family witnesses who viewed the execution on closed-circuit television. \\"He chose to make the decision to take their lives,\\" Jones said after the execution. \\"Today the state of Arkansas chose to take his and I'm happy with it. I can move on knowing I won't have to live with this again.\\" Kelly Kissel, The Associated Press' Arkansas news editor, was one of three media witnesses to the execution. He said that within 20 seconds of the injection, Noel's chest heaved \\"fairly violently.\\" Kissel added that Noel's reaction to the injection was probably the most intense of the seven executions he has witnessed. \\"Within the first 20 seconds, it was clear that something was happening,\\" Kissel said. Kissel said Noel stared at the ceiling without blinking. \\"(He) died with his eyes open,\\" Kissel said. His Final meal was Fried chicken, mashed potatoes with gravy, hot rolls, a green garden salad with ranch dressing, Kool-Aid and cookies. Noel was executed by lethal injection at 9:07 p.m at the Cummins unit of the Arkansas Department of Corrections on Wednesday, July 9, 2003. Noel was the 25th person executed by the state of Arkansas since Furman v. Georgia, , after new capital punishment laws were passed in Arkansas and that came into force on March 23, 1973.

In 1950, the song was a highlight of the Kalmer- Ruby biopic Three Little Words, performed by Debbie Reynolds and Carleton Carpenter as Helen Kane and vaudeville performer Dan Healy. Helen Kane dubbed the vocal for Reynolds‚Äô voice.  In popular culture  In 1950, the song was performed by Debbie Reynolds and Carleton Carpenter in the movie, Three Little Words, with Reynolds's voice dubbed by Helen Kane. On a Gilligan's Island episode Ginger Grant sings the song on at least one occasion for the castaways to entertain them. Her performance so impresses Mary Ann Summers that she takes on Ginger's personality and identity after hitting her head. However, when Mary Ann tries to sing the song, her lack of talent makes her uncomfortable and she faints, snapping out of her amnesia. In the Australian musical adaptation of King Kong, the number is performed as Ann Darrow is robbed by thugs who taunt her. The song also been recorded by performers Vaughn De Leath, Annette Hanshaw, Jack Lemmon, Frank Sinatra, Miss Miller and The Chipettes, Rose Murphy, Verka Serduchka, Patricia Kaas, Sin√©ad O'Connor, Jinx Titanic, Shiina Ringo, Claire Johnston, Eve's Plum and Barry Manilow (in a duet with the Marilyn Monroe recording) among others.

The Screaming Skull marked Nicol's directorial debut; he decided to try it because he felt that he was not acting in the roles which he wanted. The film was distributed by American International Pictures as a double feature in different markets with either Earth vs. the Spider or Terror from the Year 5000. The film's storyline concerns a neurotic newlywed woman who believes she is being haunted by the ghost of her new husband's previous wife. Plot An opening prologue explains that The Screaming Skull is so frightening that it may kill its viewers. Over a scene of an opening coffin, a narrator explains that the film's climax is so terrifying that it may kill the viewer, while reassuring the audience that should they die of fright they will receive a free burial service. Inside the coffin is a card that reads \\"Reserved for You\\". Newlyweds Jenni (Peggy Webber) and Eric (John Hudson) move into Eric's palatial country home. Jenni is Eric's second wife; his first wife Marion died when she accidentally slipped and hit her head on the edge of a decorative pond on the estate. At the home they meet Eric's friends, the Reverend Snow (Russ Conway) and his wife (Tony Johnson), as well as Mickey (Alex Nicol), the developmentally disabled gardener. Eric privately mentions to the Snows that Jenni spent time in an asylum following the sudden death of both her parents, and Mrs. Snow reveals that Jenni is very wealthy. Jenni is disturbed both by Mickey's belief that Marion's ghost wanders the estate and by Marion's self- portrait inside the house, which Jenni believes resembles her mother. When she begins to hear unexplained screaming noises and see skulls around her house, she believes that Marion is haunting her. Though Eric speculates to Jenni that Mickey, who was a childhood friend of Marion and thus dislikes Jenni, may be behind the trickery, Jenni worries that she is going insane. Eric suggests to remove Marion's self-portrait from the home. Eric and Jenni take the painting outside and burn it, later uncovering a skull from the ashes. Jenni panics at the sight of the skull, but Eric denies that the skull is there. Jenni faints and Eric withdraws the skull and hides it, revealing that he has been gaslighting her all along. Believing she has finally lost her sanity, Jenni resolves to be committed. She tells Eric that the entire property will be meticulously searched for the skull as a last resort. Mickey secretly steals the skull and brings it to Snow before Eric can retrieve it. That night, Eric prepares to murder Jenni and stage it as a suicide. Jenni sees Marion's ghost in Mickey's greenhouse and flees back to the house, where Eric begins throttling her. The ghost appears and chases Eric outside, corners and attacks him, drowning him in the decorative pond. After Jenni regains consciousness, the Snows arrive. Mrs. Snow comforts a hysterical Jenni and the Reverend discovers Eric's body in the pond. Some undisclosed time later, Jenni and the Snows depart from the house. Reverend Snow declares whether or not Marion's death was an accident will remain a mystery. The film ends with the gardener drinking from the pond and saying, \\"They've left. Rest in peace.\\" a vision of a woman's face appears in the pond. Cast Jon Hudson and Peggy Webber *Jon Hudson as Eric Whitlock *Peggy Webber as Jenni Whitlock *Russ Conway as Rev. Edward Snow *Tony Johnson as Mrs. Snow *Alex Nicol as Mickey Production The Screaming Skull was directed by Alex Nicol, an actor who had roles on Broadway productions and often played supporting characters. He decided to try directing a film, as he felt that he had not been performing the roles that he desired. Nicol noted that \\"as an actor, you're in perfect position, if you choose to do so, to watch the directors you're working with setting up the shots, making decisions as to where to place the camera, and so I picked up a lot over the years\\". The film is based on a horror story written by Francis Marion Crawford, which itself drew its inspiration from \\"folklore surrounding the so-called screaming skull that was kept on display at Bettiscomb Manor in Dorset, England.\\" The skull is said to have belonged to a black slave who was refused a burial in his native country following his death, and \\"there were strange occurrences and unexplainable shrieking noises that came from the wooden box in which the skull was kept.\\" John Hudson stars as Eric, Jenni's new husband. Jenni is played by Peggy Webber. In order to get Webber interested in starring in the film, Nicol told her that he was planning to do a remake of the Alfred Hitchcock film Rebecca and brought a copy of the screenplay to her house. Other cast members include Russ Conway as Reverend Snow and Toni Johnson as Snow's wife. Nicol also stars as Mickey, the gardener. The film's cinematographer was Floyd Crosby, who had previously won an Academy Award for his work on Tabu. John Kneubuhl wrote the film's screenplay; he also produced the film alongside executive producer T. Frank Woods and associate producer John Coots. The music was composed by Ernest Gold, and the film was edited by Betty Jane Lane. The film was shot over a period of six weeks at the Huntington Hartford Estate, on a small budget. The film did not have a large crew, and according to Webber, the actors were paid around $1,000 for their performances. During the production, Nicol promised the actors a cut of the film's ultimate box office earnings, but due to an issue with the film's distributor, this never occurred. During filming, Webber discovered she was pregnant, and so several scenes had to be re-written, like one where she was meant to fall down a staircase. The Screaming Skulls opening disclaimer that a free burial would be provided to anybody who died of fright while watching the film was inspired by a gimmick that had been used by William Castle in his film Macabre (1958), in which he offered every viewer who bought a ticket life insurance in case they died watching the film. Unlike Castle, Nicol did not actually contact an insurance company. Reception and DVD release The Screaming Skull was released in August 1958. It was never copyrighted, despite the presence of an onscreen copyright notice belonging to Madera Productions. As a result, it has seen many public domain DVD releases by video companies, such as Alpha Video, Echo Bridge Home Entertainment, and Mill Creek Entertainment. Erick Harper of DVD Verdict remarked that the film was \\"of questionable value\\" and opined it was a \\"truly awful example of drive- in cinema\\". He believed that the film was not \\"worth the time to watch\\". Leonard Maltin gave the film one and a half stars, calling it \\"dreary\\", but he believed that it became \\"reasonably eerie toward the end, with a twist that's actually a surprise\\". Authors Phil Hardy and Tom Milne wrote of the film, \\"Nicol, an actor here directing for the first time, lets the action spin out much too slackly, dissipating the grasp of moody tension he displayed in his unpretentiously excellent war movie, Three Came Back. Film historian Steven H. Scheuer graded the film one and a half stars, writing \\"Wife is terrorized by unexplainable happenings. Or is it inexplicable? Both describe the film\\". VideoHound's Golden Movie Retriever by Jim Craddock also gave the film one and a half stars, and TV Guide gave it two. Webber herself did not like the film, stating that \\"it didn't impress me\\" and she \\"wanted to throw up\\" after watching it. However, Nicol took a more positive stance, saying: \\"I liked it; it had some nice dolly shots, a good atmosphere. So I was happy with that; it was a nice change from the films I'd been doing\\". The Screaming Skull was featured in a ninth season episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000, a comedy television series which features a human and his robot creations watching bad films while providing a running commentary which mocks the film being shown. It was featured alongside an episode of The Gumby Show entitled \\"Robot Rumpus\\". Series writer Bill Corbett disliked the film, saying that \\"making someone watch this even once is specifically outlawed by the Geneva Convention\\".

He is believed to have been the first navigator to have circumnavigated the island of Cuba in 1508. Under the authority of the Governor of Hispaniola, Ocampo sailed along the northern coast of the island through the Old Bahama Channel and around the western point, Cape San Antonio. The voyage took eight months, and was against the Gulf Stream. Europeans had already frequented Cuba by the time Ocampo embarked on his journey, but his circumnavigation confirmed that the area was indeed surrounded by water, and not a peninsula as was speculated. Ocampo returned to Hispaniola with news of the body of water that lay beyond. Before that, and after the Spanish discovery of the Antilles, several maps portrayed what latter-day interpreters have assumed to be the Gulf of Mexico, thereby disputing the actual discovery date. He died at an old age in a year no one is sure of.

Designed by Vekoma, Blue Hawk was originally built for Conko's Party Pier in New Jersey, where it was known as Kamikaze. It was relocated to Six Flags Over Georgia in 1992 as Ninja, and was the tallest roller coaster in the park at that time. In 2016, Six Flags announced that the ride would be renovated and renamed, with members of the public voting on the ride's new name. History Hunt's Pier in Wildwood, New Jersey purchased and installed this roller coaster, naming it Kamikaze, in 1989. Kamikaze was purchased by Six Flags and relocated to Six Flags Over Georgia, where it was given the new name Ninja. Ninja was placed in the park's Cotton States section and sits roughly where Z-Force was previously located prior to its removal after the 1990 season, opening to the public on March 1, 1992. The ride received extensive work in 2016 and did not open with the park for its new season. The ride was repainted with blue track and gray supports, the track was inspected and repaired as needed to improve smoothness, and the trains were replaced with two new models featuring soft vest restraints instead of the previous over-the-shoulder harnesses. Park guests were invited to vote for one of three potential new names for the ride‚ÄîAmerican Eagle, Air Commander or Blue Hawk. After more than 6,000 votes were cast, voters selected Blue Hawk as the new name, followed by American Eagle and Air Commander. The renovated ride is themed to the American military and re-opened to guests on June 9, 2016. Track layout One of Blue Hawk's new trains Blue Hawk uses two 28-passenger trains, each with seven cars carrying four passengers in two rows of two seats. Riders are held in place using vest-style restraints. As Blue Hawk departs the station, it turns to the right, dropping slightly before another right turn to start up the 122-foot- tall lift hill. Upon cresting the lift, the roller coaster dives downward to the right before swooping up into the first major element, a two-inversion butterfly. Exiting the butterfly, the train enters a wide-radius 270-degree curve to the left, setting up the third inversion, a reverse sidewinder. Blue Hawk climbs a gentle slope before making a U-turn to the left and entering its final element, a double corkscrew. After completing the final inversion, the train banks to the left and passes very close to the station and under the reverse sidewinder, then turns right prior to entering the main brake run. The train exits the brakes and makes a final U-turn to the right to set up the return to the station. In popular culture Prior to renovation, the coaster was featured as Walley World's \\"Velociraptor\\" in the 2015 film Vacation.

He also was the first one to regularly leave the penalty area to defend his goal and the first one to use goal kicks as a strategy to start counterattacks. His way of playing has inspired many famous South American keepers, most notably Hugo Orlando Gatti, Ren√© Higuita, and Jos√© Luis Chilavert. Germany's Manuel Neuer is a more recent exponent of this style. He made his debut in the Argentine First Division on 6 May 1945, playing for River Plate. The match was against Independiente, River Plate won 2‚Äì1. During his time at River Plate, he played alongside stars such as Jos√© Manuel Moreno, F√©lix Loustau, Adolfo Pedernera, √Ångel Labruna and the young Alfredo Di St√©fano. He won seven national Championship trophies in 1945, 1947, 1952, 1953, 1955, 1956 and 1957. With River he also won the Copa Aldao of 1945 and 1947 and the Copa Ibarguren of 1952, and reached the 1966 Copa Libertadores Finals, losing out after three matches against CA Pe√±arol of Uruguay. He played for the Argentina national football team with significant success, especially against Brazil, but he also suffered a 6‚Äì1 defeat against Czechoslovakia, in the 1958 FIFA World Cup. In 1964 he won with Argentina the Ta√ßa das Na√ß√µes, a tournament held in Brazil, featuring also England and Portugal, to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Brazilian Football Confederation. In 1968, Carrizo simultaneously established two records for his time: official matches for River Plate in the Argentine First Division (521) and consecutive matches without conceding any goals (8, resp. 769 minutes). In 1969 he reinforced two Peruvian teams in one match for each: Alianza Lima in a match against Lev Yashin's Dynamo Moscow and Club Universitario de Deportes in a match against SC Corinthians Paulista from Brazil. In April 1969 he joined the Colombian team Millonarios where he ended his career as keeper in April 1970. His sometimes acrobatic saves earned him the moniker Tarzan from the local audience. In 1973 Carrizo managed Deportivo Armenio, a club from the Province of Buenos Aires and led the team to promotion to the league Primera C.

It belonged to Manjil Hamdan Abu Shok and it was bombed by the British in 1940, as a prelude to the invasion of Ethiopia by the Allies. The palace had been occupied by the Italians, who had established a military base there. The other palace, in the plain, was built by his son, who had the same name. The palace was lavishly built: it had several rooms for Abu Shok's many wives and a mosque. Dutch explorer Juan Maria Schuver visited the town in the 1880s and reported on a visit to the Shinasha people living in the nearby mountains.

It is notable as the location of one of the largest central galactic black holes in the known universe, which has also apparently produced the most powerful active galactic nucleus eruption discovered until 2020 when evidence for the Ophiuchus Supercluster explosion of about five times the energy of the MS 0735.6+7421 eruption was published.  Black hole eruption  Using data from the Chandra Space Telescope, scientists have deduced that an eruption has been occurring for the last 100 million years at the heart of the galaxy cluster, releasing as much energy over this time as hundreds of millions of gamma ray bursts.Most Powerful Eruption In The Universe Discovered NASA/Marshall Space Flight Center (ScienceDaily) January 6, 2005 (The amount of energy released in a year is thus equivalent to several GRBs.) The remnants of the eruption are seen as two cavities on either side of a large central galaxy. If this outburst, with a total energy budget of more than 1055 J, was caused by a black hole accretion event, it must have consumed nearly 600 million solar masses. Work done by Brian McNamara et al. (2008) point out the striking possibility that the outburst was not the result of an accretion event, but was instead powered by the rotation of the black hole. Moreover, the scientists mentioned the possibility that the central black hole in MS 0735.6+7421 could be one of the biggest black holes inhabiting the visible universe. This speculation is supported by the fact that the central cD Galaxy inside MS 0735.6+7421 possess the largest break radius known, as of today. With a calculated light deficit of more than 20 billion solar luminosities and an assumed light-to-mass ratio of 3, this yields a central black hole mass much above 10 billion solar masses, as far as the break radius was caused by the merger of several black holes in the past. In combination with the gargantuan energy outburst it is therefore very likely that MS 0735.6+7421 hosts a supermassive black hole in its core.

It is aimed at stylus interaction, making it more suitable for tablet computers and handheld PCs. It was created at the University of Toronto as Anand Agarawala's master's thesis. Agarawala also gave a presentation at the TED conference about his idea. The 1.0 version was released on April 8, 2009, along with a fully featured pro version as a paid upgrade. On April 30, 2010 the author announced that BumpTop was being discontinued and that they were taking the software \\"in an exciting new direction.\\" Two days later, it was announced that the company had been acquired by Google. On January 5, 2011, Google released a sneak preview video of Android 3.0 Honeycomb showing a 3D desktop with features purportedly taken from BumpTop.  Product  In BumpTop, documents are represented as three- dimensional boxes lying on a virtual desk. The user can position the boxes on the desk using the stylus or mouse. Extensive use of physics effects like bumping and tossing is applied to documents when they interact, for a more realistic experience. Boxes can be stacked with well-defined gestures. Multiple selection is performed by means of a LassoMenu, which fluidly combines in one stroke the act of lasso selection and action invocation via pie menus. BumpTop currently supports Windows XP, Vista, and 7, and a version for Mac OS X was released into private beta on January 18, 2010. The Mac edition omits the pie menu in favor of a more normal selection menu. The software installer and the application phone home. While the download page on the official website does state: \\"Internet connection required for activation\\", this may not appear in other sources such as Cnet. There is no explicit dialog box asking the user to confirm this connection at the time it is required. BumpTop automatically updates to the latest version.  Multi- Touch  With the release of BumpTop 1.2 on October 9, 2009, multi-touch support was added for Windows 7. It added 14 new gestures to the system that used multiple touches on the screen. One such gesture is ‚Äúscrunching‚Äù your hand to pull files into a pile. Just like the regular version of BumpTop, the extensive use of physics is applied to these multi-touch gestures. Multi-touch support has since been added to Mac OS X as well. Multi-touch support is currently only available in the Pro version of the software.  BumpTop Inside  On August 18, 2009, BumpTop announced their new ‚ÄúBumpTop Inside‚Äù program. Partnering with HIS, PowerColor, and SAPPHIRE, a free copy of BumpTop will be included with their graphics cards. The reasoning behind the partnership was to allow BumpTop to be spread to more customers, as well as allowing BumpTop to use the power of the newly bought graphics card. ‚ÄúBumpTop creates a brand new user experience for computer desktops,‚Äù said Ted Chen, CEO of TUL Corporation. ‚ÄúWe are excited to add this innovative application into our graphics solution. Backed by the power of PowerColor graphics, BumpTop will make the user experience more vivid and change the way the traditional computer desktop is used.‚Äù  Reception  BumpTop has been generally well received by critics, with many of them excited about the possibility of BumpTop's features becoming standard in GUIs. CNET Editor Seth Rosenblatt gave it 5 stars, citing that ‚Äúit could push how we use our computers into a whole new dimension.‚Äù Thanks to the added multi-touch support, Engadget says that ‚ÄúBumptop gives Windows 7 touchscreen PCs purpose.‚Äù CrunchGear simply says ‚ÄúBumpTop: A Better Windows desktop.‚Äù On BumpTop's website, they have 23 quotes of positive reviews from professional editors.  Acquisition by Google  In April 2010, it was announced that Bumptop had been acquired by Google. It was unknown what Google had planned for the software, though there were speculations about plans to revamp it for a new Android based tablet UI. Shortly after its acquisition, Bumptop announced plans to remove the software completely from its website, only giving \\"End of Life\\" support to those who bought the Pro version. The server-side licensing and validation system was then removed from Google and users that had the licensed version got it reverted to the free version after some time. This actually made activating the software impossible without using cracks. As a final step, in August 2012, Google released the source code of BumpTop on GitHub under the Apache license. According to released source code, the project is no longer maintained. See Also * Project Looking Glass * Metisse References Further reading * Agarawala, Anand. Ravin Balakrishnan.

The Daily Record and The York Dispatch have worked under a joint operating agreement since 1990. Gannett announced June 1, 2015, that it had acquired The Daily Record. History In 1796, Solomon Meyer created Die York Gazette, a weekly, German-language newspaper, which The York Daily Record credits as its earliest incarnation. After several years without publication of Die York Gazette, William C. Harris created the English- language Gazette in 1815. Between 1821 and 1891, The Gazette also published a weekly German edition. The Gazette was taken over by David Small in 1836. Small, who also served as York postmaster, county director of the poor and York's chief burgess, remained owner of the paper for nearly 50 years. Prominent businessman Adam Geesey converted The Gazette into a daily publication in 1887. The Gazette became the third York-area newspaper to publish daily. In 1915, Allen C. Wiest and law partner J.W. Gitt acquired the foundering Gazette, which began Gitt's 55-year reign as Gazette owner. Under Gitt, the newspaper gained a national reputation for its independent‚Äîsome considered it leftist‚Äînews orientation and editorial positions. The Gazette purchased The Daily, York's first daily newspaper, and the York Legal Record in 1915. In 1918, The Gazette was renamed The Gazette and Daily. After nearly 150 years of continuous publication, the paper shut down in 1970 because of labor problems. Gitt sold the paper's assets to a local group headed by attorney Harold N. Fitzkee Jr. and retired The Gazette and Daily name. The paper soon reopened under a York Daily Record nameplate. In 1973, The Daily Record was sold to Jimmy D. Scoggins, a veteran newspaperman, who changed the paper's format from tabloid to its current broadsheet form. The Gazette and Daily had become a tab in 1943 because of newsprint shortages during World War II. Buckner News Alliance purchased the newspaper from Scoggins in 1978 and modernized the paper's appearance and operations. MediaNews Group, owner of The York Dispatch, purchased the York Sunday News in 1988. The next year, The Daily Record and The York Dispatch sought government approval for a joint operating agreement, a partial merger because \\"The Daily Record\\" was facing financial troubles. The U.S. Justice Department approved the JOA in 1990, creating the York Newspaper Co. to manage merged production, circulation and advertising departments. The Daily Record and Dispatch newsrooms were not part of the merger and to this day remain under separate ownership. In 2004, Buckner News Alliance sold the York Daily Record to MediaNews Group, which also owned the York Sunday News the news organization operated as the York Daily Record/Sunday News.

Plot summary The story concerns an abandoned truck owned by Otto Schenck and George McCutcheon, wealthy Castle Rock businessmen in the post-depression era. After Otto deliberately crushes George beneath his derelict vehicle, the murderer becomes fixated on the truck. Otto insists that the truck is not only moving on its own accord, but planning to kill him. At the same time, he becomes a social recluse, living in a house he built across from the truck itself, and generally begins to lose his sanity. His nephew, who tells the story, finally finds him dead‚Äìthe corpse has been drowned with oil and there is a spark plug rammed down his throat. The nephew goes on to describe how, on the day he found his uncle dead, he began to see strange happenings with the truck himself. Also, he couldn't accept his uncle's death as a suicide because there was no jug near the body with which Otto could have fed himself the oil. The nephew would dismiss what he saw as a hallucination, were it not for the derelict sparkplug he took away from the corpse and kept as a reminder. Adaptations \\"Uncle Otto's Truck\\" has been adapted by artist Glenn Chadbourne for the book The Secretary of Dreams, a collection of comics based on King's short fiction released by Cemetery Dance in December 2006. \\"Uncle Otto's Truck\\" has also been made into a short film via King's \\"Dollar Baby\\" program, directed by Brian Johnson in 2019.

History In 1878 Russia and the Ottoman Empire were at war, and it was perceived by the British Government that Britain might be drawn into the conflict. This perception has become known to posterity as \\"the Russian war scare of 1878\\". In order to enhance the forces available to the Royal Navy, four ships were quickly purchased for a total cost of ¬£2 million; Belleisle, Orion and from Turkey and from Brazil. It would have been necessary in any case to detain the Turkish ships in British ports for the duration of hostilities to observe neutrality agreements, and in this situation compensation by purchase was essentially obligatory. The ships were designed by a Turkish naval architect, Ahmed Pasha, as small ironclad rams of limited size and endurance for use in the eastern Mediterranean. They required considerable dockyard work after purchase to bring them up to anything near British standards in armament and equipment, but were never comparable in military value to other contemporary Royal Naval battleships. They were poorly armed and of low speed, and their meagre coal supply prevented their being used on blockade work or at any distance from a home port. They were, however, of shallow draught, allowing them to work close inshore, and after being labelled as \\"armoured rams\\" and \\"second-class battleships\\" they ultimately received their correct appellation as \\"coast-defence ships\\".

His trusty sidekick, Yellow Dog, always seems to get caught up in Blinky's adventures, and is very keen to get rid of him. When Blinky first appeared in 1990, the design of the character seemed to be a younger version of an earlier Beezer comic strip called Colonel Blink. However, when The Beezer and Topper folded, and Nick Brennan began drawing the strip in January 1994, Blinky took on a new look that was now quite unlike Colonel Blink. The design was altered further over the next few years. Following the relaunch in late 2007, Nick Brennan, the artist, left The Dandy, and so there were no Blinky strips being produced from then on. However, from issue 3438 in January 2008, the character has returned as reprints from the late 1990s. Nick Brennan came back in September 2011 with his strip Watch this Space.

The civil parish covers an area of and had a population of 2,078 in 944 households at the time of the 2001 Census, increasing to 2,367 at the 2011 Census. Grand architecture surrounds the historic market place and town greens. According to an 18th-century source, a fire destroyed many of the town's buildings, leading the better-off local families to build the handsome Georgian homes for which the town is known. The same source claims that the Hingham gentry were \\"so fashionable in their dress that the town is called by the neighbours 'Little London'\\". Hingham is west from Norwich, Norfolk's county town. While many Hingham people now work in Norwich, commuting by car or bus, the town has maintained a range of shops and businesses in its historic streets and an industrial estate on Ironside Way. Despite the influence and attractions of Norwich, an active and independent town life continues to thrive and grow in Hingham. A fair visits every year, setting up on the historic Fairlands (an area of several triangular greens). There is a state-run school, providing education for children from the ages of 4-11. The nearest railway stations are Wymondham and Attleborough, both on the Breckland Line.

Thomas de Morley, 5th Baron Morley is buried in its chancel. In the years that followed, the town was a clear royal domain, for William the Conqueror and many others. In 1414 the town was exempted from an English toll and in 1610, the town was granted a royal charter by Queen Anne.Upcher, History of Hingham, Norfolk, and its church of St. Andrew, 5. Over the years, from 1154 to 1887, the town's church is recorded as having had 32 rectors.Upcher, History of Hingham, Norfolk, and its church of St. Andrew, 33-48. By the 1600s, the town of Hingham was still agricultural. John Speed's maps of the Kingdom of England during the Tudor period in 1610 and 1611 showed that the town was near Wymondham (also called Wimundham or Windham).John Speed, Britain's Tudor Maps: County by County (London: British Library, reprint, 2016, originally published in 1988), p. 16-19. The first map was drawn in 1610, the second around the same time but based on a 1579 map of the islands by Christopher Saxton. This town was, at the time, situated in the countryside with diverse terrain, profuse windmills, well-watered soil, a large degree of inland water traffic, and few urban centres apart from Norwich, where a thriving cloth industry boomed.Speed, Britain's Tudor Maps: County by County, p. 70-71. With Speed's drawing of a castle at the location of Hingham, the town must have been of some stature. Many Puritans refused to conform to the wishes of the King (Charles I) and his loyal Archbishop (William Laud), so they fled to the Plymouth Bay or Massachusetts Bay colonies, in what has been labelled the \\"Great Migration.\\"Carolyn St. John Elliott Battles and James Bruce Battles, A Puritan Family's Journey: From Hingham to Hingham and onto Sanbornton, New Hampshire: The Ancestors of Marion Gilmon Elliott (Carolyn St. John Elliott Battles, 2013), 29.

Once most of the passengers settled there, the population of the town had doubled.Battles and Battles, A Puritan Family's Journey, 30 More specifically they were called East Anglicans, possibly named after the former Kingdom of East Angles in which Hingham resided, as John Speed described it in 1610, and maybe after the Anglican Church.Speed, Britain's Tudor Maps: County by County, p. 21. Speed called the Kingdom \\"East Angle\\" but this is a variation of the name East Angles. Amongst those had emigrated included Samuel Lincoln, ancestor of President Abraham Lincoln, and Edward Gilman Sr., ancestor of Nicholas Gilman, New Hampshire delegate to the Continental Congress and signer of the U.S. Constitution.

To commemorate the lineage of Lincoln and the sister town in Massachusetts, today the town hall \\"is named the Lincoln Hall, and ... the bust of Abraham Lincoln takes pride of place in the north aisle of the church\\" along with memorials to the Gilman family.Several centuries later, the Gilmans of Hingham supplied two mayors of Norwich. The Gilman family came from nearby Caston in Norfolk to Hingham in the 16th century. Samuel Lincoln's mother Bridget was the sister of Edward Gilman Sr., who emigrated to America. Memorials to the Gilman family, ancestors of those who went to America, are still visible in St Andrew's Church in Hingham, which also has a bust of Abraham Lincoln on the wall.Upcher, History of Hingham, Norfolk, and its church of St. Andrew, 25-32. The parishioners who left Hingham had been so prominent in the Hingham community that the town was forced to petition British Parliament, saying their town had been devastated by the emigration. They told the House of Commons that \\"most of the able Inhabitants have forsaken their dwellings and have gone severall ways for their peace and quiett and the town is now left and like in the misery by reason of the meanness of the [remaining] Inhabitants.\\"Waters Jr., The Otis Family in Provincial and Revolutionary Massachusetts, 11-14.Roger Thompson, Mobility and Migration: East Anglican Founders of New England, 1639-1640 (Boston: University of Massachusetts Press, 1994), 23, 108, 141, 200, 206, 221, 261-262. The argument by the remaining residents of Hingham that their town had been devastated was not unfounded. Historians and original documents from the time attest that \\"physically, mentally, socially, and spiritually\\" the town was moved from England to New England with the founding of \\"New\\" Hingham in 1635, with Peter Hobart and Robert Peck as some the most powerful and well-off individuals in the new town, at the top of the Old Ship Church.Waters Jr., The Otis Family in Provincial and Revolutionary Massachusetts, 11-14, 17-18.Peck, A Genealogical History of the Descendants of Joseph Peck, 25-26.The Diary of William Bentley Vol. III Jan. 1803-December 1810 (Salem, MA: The Essex Institute, 1911), 282.John Winthrop, Winthrop's Journal: \\"History of New England\\" 1630-1649 (ed.

Town sign in Hingham In the years the followed, Hingham continued to develop. Apart from the \\"sentimental attachment\\" between the Hingham in England and that in the Americas, St Andrew's Church continued to stand, inns were created, and what is today a conservation area was created which \\"contains many Georgian buildings,\\" although many of the buildings were destroyed in a \\"disastrous fire in 1688.\\" Even with changing prices and inconsistent weather, the town remained agricultural and had a stayed gentry in place into at least the 1740s.Upcher, History of Hingham, Norfolk, and its church of St. Andrew, 22-24. By the 1800s, Admiral Philip Wodehouse lived in the town. By the 1890s, it was still a \\"small market town.\\"UK Genealogy Archives, \\"Hingham, Norfolk,\\" 2017. During World War I, 200 men from the town participated in England's military, 38 of whom perished on the battlefield, others who formed a company, and some who paid for war certificates.Upcher, History of Hingham, Norfolk, and its church of St. Andrew, 49-51. In later years, World War I general Edmund Ironside lived in Southernwood, a house created in the 1700s where he died in 1959, an old windmill continued to turn in the town until 1937, later becoming a \\"4 storey stump\\", a radio link between the two Hinghams was established in World War II, and the Lincoln Hall was built in 1922, later rebuilt and extended in 1977. Other than that, the town has also maintained its connection with its sister town in the United States; for instance, in September 1985, a number of Hingham residents attended \\"the 350th birthday celebrations of Hingham, Mass.\\" =21st century= In 2000, it was reported that Adrian Semmence, whose family had farmed at Hingham for three generations, was opening a woodland park (to be funded by the sale of plots, mainly to Americans having connections with Hingham) to commemorate the links between this Hingham and Hingham, Massachusetts.Family Tree Magazine, September 2000. The Caterham F1 team, previously Team Lotus, was based in Hingham, but left Norfolk and relocated to the old Arrows team factory near Silverstone Circuit in Northamptonshire. It used to be based in nearby Hethel, but following its bankruptcy in 1994 there wasn't much activity until Lotus was resurrected as an F1 team in 2010. Governance There is a town council which is the parish council for the civil parish. For the purposes of local government, the parish falls within the district of South Norfolk. It was previously in the Forehoe and Henstead Rural District. Hingham is part of the electoral ward called Hingham and Deopham, which returns one councillor to South Norfolk Council, elected every four years. The population of this ward at the 2011 Census was 2,908.

Located at the intersection of Elmhurst Avenue, 45th Avenue, and Broadway in Elmhurst, Queens, it is served by the M train on weekdays, the R train at all times except nights, and the E train at night.  History  =Construction and opening= The Queens Boulevard Line was one of the first built by the city-owned Independent Subway System (IND), and was planned to stretch between the IND Eighth Avenue Line in Manhattan and 178th Street and Hillside Avenue in Jamaica, Queens, with a stop at Elmhurst Avenue.See: * *Board of Transportation of the City of New York Engineering Department, Proposed Additional Rapid Transit Lines And Proposed Vehicular Tunnel, dated August 23, 1929 The line was first proposed in 1925. Construction of the line was approved by the New York City Board of Estimate on October 4, 1928. The line was constructed using the cut-and-cover tunneling method, and to allow pedestrians to cross, temporary bridges were built over the trenches. The first section of the line opened on August 19, 1933 from the connection to the Eighth Avenue Line at 50th Street to Roosevelt Avenue in Jackson Heights. Later that year, a $23 million loan was approved to finance the remainder of the line, along with other IND lines. The remainder of the line was built by the Public Works Administration. In 1934 and 1935, construction of the extension to Jamaica was suspended for 15 months and was halted by strikes. Construction was further delayed due to a strike in 1935, instigated by electricians opposing wages paid by the General Railway Signal Company.See: * * The chief engineer of the Elmhurst Avenue station was Robert Ridgway and the design engineer was Aaron I. Raisman. In August 1936, tracks were installed all the way to 178th Street, and the stations to Union Turnpike were completed. On December 31, 1936, the IND Queens Boulevard Line was extended by eight stops, and , from its previous terminus at Roosevelt Avenue to Union Turnpike. = Later years = The opening of the Elmhurst Avenue station resulted in the development of Elmhurst as a commercial and residential neighborhood. This station was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on July 6, 2005, as structure number 05000672.Queens County Listings at the National Register of Historic Places (Structure #05000672)National Register of Historic Places Listings March 25, 2005 (Structure #05000672)  Station layout  Southwestern (railroad north) entrance stair This underground station has four tracks and two side platforms. The two center express tracks are used by the E train during daytime hours and the F train at all times. Both platform walls have a teal trim line on a black border with small \\"ELMHURST\\" signs in white lettering on a black background beneath them. They also have name tablets reading \\"ELMHURST AVE.\\" in white sans serif lettering on a black background and teal border. The tile color was part of a color-coded tile system for the entire Independent Subway System. There are also advertising recesses between the tablets, as well as grates at the top of the platform wall. The ceiling of the platform level is held up by yellow I-beam piers located every , which support girders underneath the mezzanine that runs above the platform level. The roof girders are also connected to columns in the platform walls. The tunnel is covered by a \\"U\\"-shaped trough that contains utility pipes and wires. The outer walls of this trough are composed of columns, spaced approximately every with concrete infill between them. There is a gap between the tunnel wall and the platform wall, which is made of -thick brick covered over by a tiled finish. The columns between the tracks are also spaced every , with no infill. This station has a full-length mezzanine above the platforms and tracks supported by yellow I-beam columns located every . It is separated into three sections by two chain-link fences, which separate the paid areas along the outer walls from the unpaid area in the center of the station. However, underneath the westernmost staircase of the station, there is a passageway that connects the mezzanines from each direction, allowing free transfers between directions. The token booth is at the center in the middle section outside fare control with a small turnstile bank to either outer section. Each platform has seven staircases going up to the mezzanine. =Exits= There are five entrances to the station in total, two on the northwestern end of the mezzanine and three on the southeastern end. The staircases to the street are at either end of the mezzanine. On the northwest (railroad south) side, one staircase goes up to the southwest corner of 82nd Street and Broadway while another goes up to the southwest corner of Britton Avenue and Broadway. At this end, there are two exit-only turnstiles from the Forest Hills-bound side of the mezzanine and two High Entry-Exit Turnstiles from the Manhattan-bound side. On the southeast (railroad north) side of the mezzanine, there are two staircases going up to either southern corner of 45th Avenue and Broadway. Another goes up to the northwest corner of Elmhurst Avenue and Broadway, which is built within a store front and goes through a small underground shopping arcade. On this side, there are two exit- only turnstiles and one High Entry-Exit Turnstile from the Forest Hills-bound side and two High Entry-Exit Turnstiles from the Manhattan-bound side. =Nearby infrastructure= The Elmhurst station on the Long Island Rail Road's Port Washington Branch was about one block to the south of this station before it closed in 1985. Between this station and Jackson Heights‚ÄìRoosevelt Avenue, there are holes on the tunnel's ceiling, which accommodate the never- used tunnels coming from the Roosevelt Avenue station's unused upper-level terminal.

They are best known for their series of fighters, notably the Pfalz D.III and Pfalz D.XII. The company went bankrupt after the Armistice, when the French occupation forces confiscated all of the equipment, but the factory was re-used by various other companies until re-forming in 1997. Today they are a parts manufacturer referred to as PFW.  Early history  Pfalz E.I Pfalz was the brainchild of Alfred Eversbusch, son of a foundry owner in Neustadt an der Weinstra√üe. It appears that he had built his own aircraft between 1912 and 1913, although the exact origin of the design is unclear. On June 3, 1913, the Pfalz company was registered, consisting of Alfred, his brother Ernst, and his brother-in-law Willy Sabersky-M√ºssigbrodt, as well as several investors: Richard and Eugen Kahn, and August Kahn (unrelated). They initially proposed to build designs from Albatros, but their attempts at a deal amounted to nothing. Their next deal was with Gustav Otto Flugzeugwerke, building examples of his pusher- propeller biplane design. The original example was sent to Africa on a tour, and ended up being pressed into service as a scout. The company had always planned to set up shop at the new airfield in Speyer, but they initially had problems securing land for a factory. The Gustav designs were actually built in the Speyer Festival Hall, which was unused at the time. It was not until February 6, 1914, that the city agreed to sell Pfalz 7,000 m¬≤ to build their factory. Construction was completed in July, only one month before the start of World War I.  World War I  Pfalz Dr.I Pfalz D.VIII Pfalz D.XV By this point, the company had arranged a license to produce Morane-Saulnier monoplanes, which were quickly put into German service. When these became uncompetitive on the Western Front, Pfalz shifted production to the LFG Roland D.I and D.II. The D.II was produced into late 1916, by which point it too was no longer competitive. Instead of licensing another design, Pfalz instead licensed the previously patented Roland firm's Wickelrumpf (wrapped-fuselage) plywood strip-covered semi-monocoque fuselage design and combined it with the new 160 hp Mercedes D.III engine to create the Pfalz D.III. The D.III entered service in August 1917, but was not considered a match for contemporary designs like the Albatros D.V, and instead found a niche role in attacking observation balloons where its high diving speed was a major advantage. About 600 D.IIIs and slightly modified D.IIIas were built between its introduction in August and its replacement a year later. Many were still in service at that time, about 450. Adaptations of the D.III with the new Siemens-Halske Sh.III rotary resulted in the Pfalz D.VIII, which featured an incredible rate of climb (which it shared with the other Sh. III powered fighter, the Siemens- Schuckert D.IV). The Sh. III proved to be rather unreliable due to the ersatz engine oil available, and only a small number of D.VIIIs were built. These did see front-line use by Jasta 2 (Jasta Boelcke) at least, although it is unclear how many were built in total. The D.VIII was also adapted to triplane configuration as the Pfalz Dr.I for entry in the First Fighter Competition at Adlershof in January 1918. Like the D.VIII, it was powered by the Sh. III, and therefore completely outpowered its Oberursel UR.II powered contemporaries. Nevertheless, the Fokker Dr.I was the winner of the contest, which is not surprising considering that it was the only aircraft entered that was designed from the outset as a triplane, as opposed to being a quickly-adapted biplane. About a dozen Dr. Is were built and used operationally for some time. The final major production model was the Pfalz D.XII, a development of the D.III that abandoned the sesquiplane configuration in favor of two-bay wings, similar in appearance to what looked like two-bay wings on the French SPAD fighters designed by Louis B√©chereau. It entered the Second Fighter Competition in June 1918 against the famous Fokker E.V monoplane and other designs. Although generally similar to the Fokker D.VII in looks and performance, the D.XII was widely considered to be inferior in handling characteristics and difficult to land. Nevertheless, the D.XII was ordered into production, and about 800 were produced before the Armistice. Many of these survived the war and were taken as booty by the Allies. A few aircraft were eventually featured in various movies, notably Hell's Angels and The Dawn Patrol. A derivative of the D.XII, the D.XIV, was not ordered into the production. Pfalz's final scout, the D.XV, participated in the Third Fighter Competition. The Idflieg ordered the D.XV into production just before the Armistice, but it did not see operational service.  Interbellum  At the end of the war, the Pfalz factory fell into the French-occupied area, and was stripped of anything useful. On June 4, 1919, the company was re-established as A.G. Pfalz, which listed its main businesses as \\"shipbuilding, production, and the buying and selling of industrial goods.\\" This company eventually went bankrupt during the Great Depression in 1932.  World War II  On October 1, 1937 the factories once again turned to aircraft work, this time under the name Saarpfalz Flugwerke, a maintenance company. The Speyer airfield was no longer operational, so aircraft repaired there had to be transported to Mannheim-Neuostheim for flight, but the city decided to rebuild the airport over the next year and it re-opened in 1938. The new company grew quickly, starting with over 200 employees by the end of 1937, growing to 500 by the start of the war, and to 1,500 by the time the war ended. They maintained many designs during this time, including the Focke-Wulf Fw 58, Heinkel He 45, He 46, He 51 and He 111, Junkers Ju 52, and Ju 88. Work at the plants ended in March 1945 due to the approach of American and French troops.  Ernst Heinkel, VFW and MBB  Ernst Heinkel introduced his famous bubblecar, the Heinkel Kabine, in 1955, receiving a roadworthiness certificate in February 1956. He soon purchased the Speyer plants for additional production capability, adding to the major assembly line in Karlsruhe. Given the location at the airfield, it appears he may have been planning to start aircraft production at Speyer as well. Over the next five years, 3,800 Heinkelkabine's were produced at the Speyer plants, reaching 50 a day. However, Heinkel's death in 1958 ended any plans for expansion into aircraft, and in 1961 the two assembly lines were sold off to Ireland and Argentina. In 1964 the remains of Heinkel, Focke Wulf and Weser Flugzeugbau merged to form VFW (and for a time, VFW-Fokker). The Speyer plants were then involved in production of the Transall C-160, building 169 of them. They also produced on parts for the UH-1 Iroquois and CH-53 Sea Stallion, produced under license by VFW. Some work was also carried out for other aviation companies, notably Messerschmitt-B√∂lkow- Blohm (MBB), Dornier, and the engine manufacturer MTU. In 1983 MBB bought the Speyer factories and turned them into a primary helicopter repair center. MBB ran into financial difficulties, and merged with Deutsche Aerospace in 1989.  Pfalz Flugzeugwerke reforms  On January 1, 1997 the Speyer plant was handed over to the remaining 523 employees, and once again renamed Pfalz Flugzeugwerke. They continue their work in helicopter maintenance to this day. In 1996, the DASA factory was transferred into an employee-owned joint stock company. Three managers from the DASA factory took over the management. The company became a supplier for cargo loading systems, ducts and manifolds, as well as additional fuel tanks and fairings. On January 1, 1997 the Speyer plant was officially handed over to the remaining 523 employees, and the name of the first Speyer aircraft plant, Pfalz-Flugzeugwerke was again selected. After one year (on January 22, 1998), the Mannheimer Morgen reported of a: 'fantastic morale among the emploees at PFW.' There was no question about personnel cuts and, in the meantime, the number of employees had even been reinforced with temporary workers. There were 617 employees at the time and the planned turnover of 125 million DM had been achieved. Today the Pfalz- Flugzeugwerke is in a good position. Positive developments in the aviation industry and in Airbus are giving the company a major boost. In 2001 the decision was made to sell shares to the Safeguard International Fund to acquire further capital and to meet the additional requirements of a rapidly growing aerospace market in the future. This step allowed a fast expansion especially in regard to the international market.

Early history oldest operating McDonald's on Lakewood and Florence in Downey, California, was the chain's third restaurant and the second to be built with the Golden Arches. = Founded by Richard and Maurice McDonald = The McDonald family moved from Manchester, New Hampshire to Hollywood, California in the late 1930s, where brothers Richard and Maurice McDonald (\\"Dick\\" and \\"Mac\\") began working as set movers and handymen at Motion-Picture studios. In 1937, their father Patrick McDonald opened \\"The Airdrome\\", a food stand, on Huntington Drive (Route 66) near the Monrovia Airport in the Los Angeles County city of Monrovia, California with hot dogs being one of the first items sold. Hamburgers were later added to the menu at a cost of ten cents with all-you-can-drink orange juice at five cents. In 1940, Maurice and Richard moved the entire building east, to West 14th and 1398 North E Streets in San Bernardino, California. The restaurant was renamed \\"McDonald's Bar-B-Que\\" and had 25 menu items, mostly barbecue. In October 1948, after the McDonald brothers realized that most of their profits came from selling hamburgers, they closed down their successful carhop drive-in to establish a streamlined system with a simple menu which consisted of only hamburgers, cheeseburgers, potato chips, coffee, soft drinks, and apple pie. After the first year, potato chips and pie were swapped out for french fries and milkshakes. The carhops were eliminated, making the new restaurant a self- service operation. Richard and Maurice took great care in setting up their kitchen like an assembly line to ensure maximum efficiency. The restaurant's name was changed again, this time to simply \\"McDonald's,\\" and reopened on December 12, 1948. In April 1952, the brothers decided they needed an entirely new building in order to achieve two goals: further efficiency improvements, and a more eye-catching appearance. They collected recommendations for an architect and interviewed at least four, finally choosing Stanley Clark Meston, an architect practicing in nearby Fontana. The brothers and Meston worked together closely in the design of their new building. They achieved the extra efficiencies they needed by, among other things, drawing the actual measurements of every piece of equipment in chalk on a tennis court behind the McDonald house (with Meston's assistant Charles Fish). The new restaurant's design achieved a high level of noticeability thanks to gleaming surfaces of red and white ceramic tile, stainless steel, brightly colored sheet metal, and glass; pulsing red, white, yellow, and green neon; and two 25-foot yellow sheet-metal arches trimmed in neon, called \\"golden arches\\" even at the design stage. A third, smaller arch sign at the roadside hosted a pudgy character in a chef's hat, known as Speedee, striding across the top, trimmed in animated neon. Further marketing techniques were implemented to change McDonald's from a sit down restaurant to a fast food chain. They used such things as turning off the heating to prevent people wanting to stay so long, fixed and angled seating so the customer would sit over their food promoting them to eat faster, spreading the seats further apart so being less of a sociable place to dine in, and giving their customers branded cone shaped cups forcing them to hold their drink whilst eating which would speed up the eating process. Other companies followed McDonald's strategies to turn their own restaurants into fast food establishments, in the 1950s, including Burger King and White Castle. In late 1953, with only a rendering of Meston's design in hand, the brothers began seeking franchisees. Their first franchisee was Neil Fox, a distributor for General Petroleum Corporation. Fox's stand, the first with Meston's golden arches design, opened in May 1953 at Central Avenue and Indian School Road in Phoenix, Arizona. Their second franchisee was the team of Fox's brother-in-law Roger Williams and Burdette \\"Bud\\" Landon, both of whom also worked for General Petroleum. Williams and Landon opened their stand on August 18, 1953 at 10207 Lakewood Boulevard in Downey, California. The Downey stand has the distinction of being the oldest surviving McDonald's restaurant. The Downey stand was never required to comply with the McDonald's Corporation's remodeling and updating requests over the years because it was franchised not by the McDonald's Corporation, but by the McDonald brothers themselves to Williams and Landon. Ray Kroc joined the chain in 1954 and built it into an eventually global franchise, making it the most successful fast food corporation in the world = Ray Kroc joins the company and expands its franchise operation = In 1954, Ray Kroc, a seller of Prince Castle brand Multimixer milkshake machines, learned that the McDonald brothers were using eight of his machines in their San Bernardino restaurant. His curiosity was piqued, and he went to take a look at the restaurant. He was joined by good friend Charles Lewis who had suggested to Kroc several improvements to the McDonald's burger recipe. At this point, the McDonald brothers had six franchise locations in operation. Believing the McDonald's formula was a ticket to success, Kroc suggested they franchise their restaurants throughout the country. The brothers were skeptical, however, that the self-service approach could succeed in colder, rainier climates; furthermore, their thriving business in San Bernardino, and franchises already operating or planned, made them reluctant to risk a national venture. Kroc offered to take the major responsibility for setting up the new franchises elsewhere. He returned to his home outside of Chicago with rights to set up McDonald's restaurants throughout the country, except in a handful of territories in California and Arizona already licensed by the McDonald brothers. The brothers were to receive one-half of one percent of gross sales. Kroc's first McDonald's restaurant opened on April 15, 1955, at 400 North Lee Street in Des Plaines, Illinois, near Chicago. The Des Plaines interior and exterior was painted by master painter Eugene Wright, who owned Wright's Decorating Service. Eugene was asked to come up with a color scheme and he chose yellow and white, with dark brown and red being secondary trim colors. Those colors would go on to become the colors of all McDonald's franchises. The restaurant was demolished in 1984. Recognizing its historic and nostalgic value, in 1990 the McDonald's Corporation acquired the stand and rehabilitated it to a modern but nearly original condition, and then built an adjacent museum and gift shop to commemorate the site now called McDonald's #1 Store Museum. Once the Des Plaines restaurant had become operational, Kroc sought franchisees for his McDonald's chain. The first snag came quickly. In 1956 he discovered that the McDonald brothers had licensed the franchise rights for Cook County, Illinois to the Frejlach Ice Cream Company. Kroc was incensed that the McDonalds had not informed him of this arrangement. He purchased the rights back for $25,000 ($ today), five times what the Frejlacks had originally paid, and pressed forward. = Sonneborn model and shift to real estate holdings = In 1956, Ray Kroc met Harry J. Sonneborn, a former VP of finance for Tastee-Freez, who offered an idea to accelerate the growth and investment grade of Kroc's planned McDonald's operation: Own the real estate that future franchises would be built on. Kroc hired Sonneborn and his plan was executed through forming a separate company called Franchise Realty Corp. which was solely designed to hold McDonald's real estate. The new company signed leases and took out mortgages for both lands and buildings, in turn then passing these costs on to the franchisee with a 20-40% markup and a reduced initial deposit of $950. The \\"Sonneborn model\\" of real estate ownership within the franchise persists to this day, possibly being the most important financial decision in the company's history. McDonald's present-day real estate holdings represent $37.7Bn on its balance sheet, about 99% of the company's assets and 35% of its annual gross revenue. McDonald's grew slowly for its first three years. By 1958, there were 34 restaurants. In 1959, Harry Sonneborn became the president and CEO of McDonald's. The same year, the company opened 68 new restaurants, bringing the total to 102 locations.  1960s and 1970s  The Big Mac hamburger made its debut in 1968 In 1960, the McDonald's advertising campaign \\"Look for the Golden Arches\\" gave sales a big boost. Kroc believed that advertising was an investment that would in the end come back many times over, and advertising has always played a key role in the development of the McDonald's Corporation. In 1962, McDonald's introduced its now world-famous Golden Arches logo. A year later, the company sold its millionth hamburger and introduced Ronald McDonald, a red-haired clown designed to appeal to children. In the early 1960s, McDonald's really began to take off. The growth in U.S. automobile use that came with suburbanization and the interstate highway system contributed heavily to McDonald's success. In 1961 Kroc's conflict over the vision of the company with the founding brothers had grown to an unbearable extent, and he asked them how much money they wanted to leave their business to him entirely. The brothers asked for $2.7 million (about $21.6 million in today's dollars), which Kroc did not have. Harry J. Sonneborn was able to raise the money for him, and Kroc bought the founding brothers out. This purchase laid the groundwork to positioning the company for an IPO and furthering the aim at making McDonald's the number one fast-food chain in the country. The exact process of how the company was sold is not well-recorded; it is depicted as hostile takeover sides Ray Kroc in the movie The Founder but that portrayal is disputed, and interviews of the time speak of a more voluntary transition. In 1965, McDonald's Corporation went public. Common shares were offered at $22.50 per share. By the end of the first day's trading, the price had risen to $30. A block of 100 shares purchased for $2,250 in 1965 was worth, after 12 stock splits (increasing the number of shares to 74,360), over $5.7 million as of year-end market close on December 31, 2010. In 1980, McDonald's Corporation became one of the 30 companies that make up the Dow Jones Industrial Average. McDonald's success in the 1960s was in large part due to the company's skillful marketing and flexible response to customer demand. In 1962, the Filet-O-Fish sandwich, billed as \\"the fish that catches people\\", was introduced in McDonald's restaurants. The new item had originally met with disapproval from Kroc, but after its successful test marketing, he eventually agreed to add it. Another item that Kroc had backed a year previously, a burger with a slice of pineapple and a slice of cheese, known as a \\"hulaburger\\", had flopped (both it and the Filet-O-Fish were developed in Catholic neighborhoods where burger sales dropped off markedly on Fridays and during Lent). The market was not quite ready for Kroc's taste; the hulaburger's tenure on the McDonald's menu board was short. Kroc and Sonneborn had a falling-out over expansion of McDonalds and Sonneborn resigned in 1967; Kroc took over the title of CEO and president. In 1968 the now legendary Big Mac made its debut, and in 1969 McDonald's sold its five billionth hamburger. Two years later, as it launched the \\"You Deserve a Break Today\\" advertising campaign, McDonald's restaurants had reached all 50 states. In 1968, McDonald's opened its 1,000th restaurant, and Fred L. Turner became the company's president and chief administrative officer. Kroc became chairman and remained CEO until 1973. Turner had originally intended to open a McDonald's franchise, but when he had problems with his backers over a location, he went to work as a grillman for Kroc in 1956. As operations vice president, Turner helped new franchisees get their stores up and running. He was constantly looking for new ways to perfect the McDonald's system, experimenting, for example, to determine the maximum number of hamburger patties one could stack in a box without squashing them and pointing out that seconds could be saved if McDonald's used buns that were presliced all the way through and were not stuck together in the package. Such attention to detail was one reason for the company's extraordinary success. By the late 1960s, many of the candy-striped Golden Arches stores had been modified with enclosed walk-up order areas and limited indoor seating. In June 1969, McDonald's introduced a new \\"mansard roof\\" building design featuring indoor seating. The natural brick and cedar shake look mansards were a response to critics who berated McDonald's architecture as too garish. It became the standard for McDonald's restaurants, and franchise holders were ultimately required to demolish older restaurants and replace them with the new design. The first McDonald's restaurant using the \\"mansard roof\\" design opened that same year in the Chicago suburb of Matteson. McDonald's spectacular growth continued in the 1970s. Americans were more on-the-go than ever, and fast service was a priority. In 1972, the company passed $1 billion in annual sales. By 1976, McDonald's had served 20 billion hamburgers, and system wide sales exceeded $3 billion. The company pioneered breakfast fast food with the introduction of the Egg McMuffin in 1972 when market research indicated that a quick breakfast would be welcomed by consumers. Five years later McDonald's added a full breakfast line to the menu, and by 1987 a quarter of all breakfasts eaten out in the United States came from McDonald's restaurants. In test market locations, such as New York City, McDonald's added a full breakfast line to its menus in 1975. Kroc was a firm believer in giving \\"something back into the community where you do business\\". In 1974 McDonald's acted upon that philosophy in an original way by opening the first Ronald McDonald House, in Philadelphia, to provide a \\"home away from home\\" for the families of children in nearby hospitals. Twelve years after this first house opened, 100 similar Ronald McDonald Houses were in operation across the United States. New Zealand's first McDonald's restaurant, Porirua. There was some skepticism in the company's phenomenal growth internationally. When Wally and Hugh Morris approached the corporation in 1974 to bring McDonald's into New Zealand, they were firmly shunned by Kroc, citing a visit to the country and saying \\"There aren't any people... I never met a more dead-than-alive hole in my life.\\" Persistence by the brothers eventually led to their request being granted in May 1975. They managed to negotiate a deal with the corporation by selling New Zealand cheese to the US to offset the high costs of importing plant equipment. The first New Zealand restaurant opened in June 1976 at Porirua, near Wellington, to much more success than the corporation predicted. In 1975, McDonald's opened its first drive-thru window in Sierra Vista, Arizona, following Wendy's lead. This service gave Americans a fast, convenient way to procure a quick meal. The company's goal was to provide service in 50 seconds or less. Drive-thru sales eventually accounted for more than half of McDonald's systemwide sales. Meantime, the Happy Meal, a combo meal for children featuring a toy, was added to the menu in 1979. A period of aggressive advertising campaigns and price slashing in the early 1980s became known as the \\"burger wars\\". Burger King suggested to customers: \\"have it your way\\"; Wendy's offered itself as the \\"fresh alternative\\" and launched their \\"Where's the beef?\\" campaign. McDonald's sales and market still predominated, however. During the 1980s, a period of substantial expansion, McDonald's further diversified its menu to suit changing consumer tastes. The company introduced the McChicken in 1980; it proved to be a sales disappointment, and was replaced with Chicken McNuggets a year later (having originally been invented by Rene Arend in 1979). In 1985, ready-to-eat salads were introduced. Efficiency, combined with an expanded menu, continued to draw customers. McDonald's began to focus on urban centers and introduced new architectural styles. The first McDonald's Express locations opened in 1991. These are smaller-scale prototypes, usually constructed in prefabricated buildings or urban storefronts, that do not feature certain menu items such as milkshakes and Quarter Pounders. In 1992 Michael R. Quinlan became president of McDonald's Corporation, and Fred L. Turner became chairman. Quinlan, who took over as CEO in 1987, had started at McDonald's in the mail room in 1963, and gradually worked his way up. In his first year as CEO, the company opened 600 new restaurants. By 1991, 37 percent of system-wide sales came from restaurants outside the United States. McDonald's opened its first foreign restaurant in British Columbia, Canada, in 1967. By the early 1990s the company had established itself in 58 foreign countries, and operated more than 3,600 restaurants outside the United States, through wholly owned subsidiaries, joint ventures, and franchise agreements. Its strongest foreign markets were Japan, Canada, Germany, Great Britain, Australia, and France. In the mid-1980s, McDonald's, like other traditional employers of teenagers, was faced with a shortage of labor in the United States. The company met this challenge by being the first to entice retirees back into the workforce. Focusing on off-site training, it opened its Hamburger University in 1961 to train franchisees and corporate decision-makers. By 1990, more than 40,000 people had received \\"Bachelor of Hamburgerology\\" degrees from the Oak Brook, Illinois, facility. The corporation opened a Hamburger University in Tokyo in 1971, in Munich in 1975, and in London in 1982. Braille menus were first introduced in 1979, and picture menus in 1988. In March 1992, combination Braille and picture menus were reintroduced to accommodate those with vision, speech, or hearing impairments. Clamshell grills, which cooked both sides of a hamburger simultaneously, were tested. New locations such as hospitals and military bases were tapped as sites for new restaurants. In response to the increase in microwave oven usage, McDonald's, whose name is the single most advertised brand name in the world, stepped up advertising and promotional expenditures stressing that its taste was superior to quick-packaged foods.  1990s  The first McDonald's in Mainland China opened in Dongmen, Shenzhen in October 1990. McRecycle USA began in 1990 and included a commitment to purchase at least $100 million worth of recycled products annually for use in construction, remodeling, and equipping restaurants. Chairs, table bases, table tops, eating counters, table columns, waste receptacles, corrugated cartons, packaging, and washroom tissue were all made from recycled products. McDonald's worked with the U.S. Environmental Defense Fund to develop a comprehensive solid waste reduction program. Wrapping burgers in paper rather than plastic led to a 90 percent reduction in the wrapping material waste stream. It took McDonald's 33 years to open its first 10,000 restaurants. The 10,000th unit opened in April 1988. Incredibly, the company reached the 20,000-restaurant mark in only eight more years, in mid-1996. By the end of 1997 the total had surpassed 23,000, and by that time McDonald's was opening 2,000 new restaurants each year, an average of five every day. Much of the growth of the 1990s came outside the US, with international units increasing from about 3,600 in 1991 to more than 11,000 by 1998. The number of countries with McDonald's outlets nearly doubled from 59 in 1991 to 114 in late 1998. In 1993, a new region was added to the empire when the first McDonald's in the Middle East opened in Tel Aviv, Israel. As the company entered new markets, it showed increasing flexibility with respect to local food preferences and customs. In Israel, for example, the first kosher McDonald's opened in a Jerusalem suburb in 1995. In Arab countries the restaurant chain used \\"Halal\\" menus, which complied with Islamic laws for food preparation. In 1996 McDonald's entered India for the first time, where it offered a Big Mac made with lamb called the Maharaja Mac. That same year the first McSki-Thru opened in Lindvallen, Sweden. Overall, the company derived increasing percentages of its revenue and income from outside the US. In 1992 about two-thirds of systemwide sales came from U.S. McDonald's, but by 1997 that figure was down to about 51 percent. Similarly, the operating income numbers showed a reduction from about 60 percent of sales derived from the US in 1992 to 42.5 percent in 1997. In the US, the number of units grew from 9,000 in 1991 to 12,500 in 1997, an increase of about 40 percent. Although the additional units increased market share in some markets, a number of franchisees complained that new units were cannibalizing sales from existing ones. Same-store sales for outlets open for more than one year were flat in the mid-1990s, a reflection of both the greater number of units and the mature nature of the U.S. market. The Extra Value Meal, a burger, fries and drink combination deal, was introduced from 1993, originally as part of a Jurassic Park-themed tie-in. The company made several notable blunders in the US in the 1990s which hurt stateside profits. The McLean Deluxe sandwich, which featured a 91 percent fat-free beef patty, was introduced in 1991, never really caught on, and was dropped from the menu in February 1996 to make room for the Arch Deluxe, itself an underperforming product. The \\"grown-up\\" (and pricey) Arch Deluxe sandwich was launched in May 1996 and the Deluxe Line was launched in September 1996 in a $200 million campaign to gain the business of more adults, but were bombs. The following spring brought a 55-cent Big Mac promotion, which many customers either rejected outright or were confused by because the burgers had to be purchased with full-priced fries and a drink. The promotion embittered still more franchisees, whose complaints led to its withdrawal. In July 1997 McDonald's fired its main ad agency, Leo Burnett, a 15-year McDonald's partner, after the nostalgic \\"My McDonald's\\" campaign proved a failure. Several other 1990s-debuted menu items, including fried chicken, pasta, fajitas, and pizza failed as well. A seemingly weakened McDonald's was the object of a Burger King offensive when the rival fast-food maker launched the Big King sandwich, a Big Mac clone. Meanwhile, internal taste tests revealed that customers preferred the fare at Wendy's and Burger King. In response to these difficulties, McDonald's drastically cut back on its U.S. expansion. In contrast to the 1,130 units opened in 1995, only about 400 new McDonald's were built in 1997. Plans to open hundreds of smaller restaurants in Wal-Marts and gasoline stations were abandoned because test sites did not meet targeted goals. Reacting to complaints from franchisees about poor communication with the corporation and excess bureaucracy, the head of McDonald's U.S.A. (Jack M. Greenberg, who had assumed the position in October 1996) reorganized the unit into five autonomous geographic divisions. The aim was to bring management and decision-making closer to franchisees and customers. On the marketing side, McDonald's scored big in 1996 and 1997 with a Teenie Beanie Baby promotion in which about 80 million of the toys/collectibles were gobbled up virtually overnight. The chain received some bad publicity, however, when it was discovered that a number of customers purchased Happy Meals just to get the toys and threw the food away. For a similar spring 1998 Teenie Beanie giveaway, the company altered the promotion to allow patrons to buy menu items other than kids' meals. McDonald's also began to benefit from a seven years global marketing alliance signed with Disney/Pixar in 1998. Initial Disney/Pixar movies promoted by McDonald's included A Bug's Life, Monsters, Inc., Finding Nemo and The Incredibles. Perhaps the most important marketing move came in the later months of 1997 when McDonald's named DDB Needham as its new lead ad agency. Needham had been the company's agency in the 1970s and was responsible for the hugely successful \\"You Deserve a Break Today\\" campaign. Late in 1997, McDonald's launched the Needham-designed \\"Did Somebody Say McDonald's?\\" campaign, which appeared to be an improvement over its predecessors. = Late 1990s = Following the difficulties of the early and mid-1990s, several moves in 1998 seemed to indicate a reinvigorated McDonald's. In February the company for the first time took a stake in another fast-food chain when it purchased a minority interest in the 16-unit, Colorado-based Chipotle Mexican Grill chain. The following month came the announcement that McDonald's would improve the taste of several sandwiches and introduce several new menu items. McFlurry desserts, developed by a Canadian franchisee in 1997, proved popular when launched in the United States in the summer of 1998. That same month, McDonald's said that it would overhaul its food preparation system in every U.S. restaurant. The new just-in-time system, dubbed \\"Made for You\\", was in development for a number of years and aimed to deliver to customers \\"fresher, hotter food\\"; enable patrons to receive special-order sandwiches (a perk long offered by rivals Burger King and Wendy's); and allow new menu items to be more easily introduced thanks to the system's enhanced flexibility. The expensive changeover was expected to cost about $25,000 per restaurant, with McDonald's offering to pay for about half of the cost; the company planned to provide about $190 million in financial assistance to its franchisees before implementation was completed by year-end 1999. In May 1998, Greenberg was named president and CEO of McDonald's Corporation, with Quinlan remaining chairman; at the same time Alan D. Feldman, who had joined the company only four years earlier from Pizza Hut, replaced Greenberg as president of McDonald's U.S.A., an unusual move for a company whose executives typically were long-timers. The following month brought another first, McDonald's first job cuts. The company said it would eliminate 525 employees from its headquarters staff, a cut of about 23 percent. In the second quarter of 1998 McDonald's took a $160 million charge in relation to the cuts. As a result, the company, for the first time since it went public in 1965, recorded a decrease in net income, from $1.64 billion in 1997 to $1.55 billion in 1998. McDonald's followed up its investment in Chipotle with several more moves beyond the burger business. In March 1999 the company bought Aroma Caf√©, a UK chain of 23 upscale coffee and sandwich shops. In July of that year McDonald's added Donatos Pizza, a midwestern chain of 143 pizzerias based in Columbus, Ohio. Donatos had revenues of $120 million in 1997. In 1999, McDonald's 25,000th unit opened, Greenberg took on the additional post of chairman, and Jim Cantalupo was named company president. Cantalupo, who had joined the company as controller in 1974 and later became head of McDonald's International, had been vice-chairman, a position he retained. In May 2000 McDonald's completed its largest acquisition yet, buying the bankrupt Boston Market chain for $173.5 million in cash and debt. At the time, there were more than 850 Boston Market outlets, which specialized in home-style meals, with rotisserie chicken the lead menu item. Revenue at Boston Market during 1999 totaled $670 million. McDonald's rounded out its acquisition spree in early 2001 by buying a 33 percent stake in Pret A Manger, an upscale urban-based chain specializing in ready-to-eat sandwiches made on the premises. There were more than 110 Pret shops in the United Kingdom and several more in New York City. Also during 2001, McDonald's sold off Aroma Caf√© and took its McDonald's Japan affiliate public, selling a minority stake through an initial public offering.  2000s  As it was exploring new avenues of growth, McDonald's core burger chain had become plagued by problems. Most prominently, the Made for You system backfired. Although many franchisees believed that it succeeded in improving the quality of the food, it also increased service times and proved labor-intensive. Some franchisees also complained that the actual cost of implementing the system ran much higher than the corporation had estimated, a charge that McDonald's contested. In any case, there was no question that Made for You failed to reverse the chain's sluggish sales. Growth in sales at stores open more than a year (known as same-store sales) fell in both 2000 and 2001. Late in 2001 the company launched a restructuring involving the elimination of about 850 positions, 700 of which were in the US, and several restaurant closings. In 2000, a McDonald's in Dearborn, Michigan in Greater Detroit was the first one in Michigan and the only one east of the Mississippi River to offer halal food for Muslim customers.\\"Restaurant caters to Muslim customers.\\" The Detroit News. September 28, 2000. Retrieved on July 5, 2013. \\"A Dearborn McDonald's has become the first McDonald's restaurant in the state and the only McDonald's east of the Mississippi to offer food acceptable to strict Muslim dietary laws.

Halal meat is prepared according to the dictates of the Koran, much like kosher food. Muslims are[...]\\" Available from the archives of The Detroit News: Article ID det8723702. There were further black eyes as well. McDonald's was sued in 2001 after it was revealed that for flavoring purposes a small amount of beef extract was being added to the vegetable oil used to cook the french fries. The company had cooked its fries in beef tallow until 1990, when it began claiming in ads that it used 100 percent vegetable oil. McDonald's soon apologized for any \\"confusion\\" that had been caused by its use of the beef flavoring, and in mid-2002 it reached a settlement in the litigation, agreeing to donate $10 million to Hindu, vegetarian, and other affected groups. Also in 2001, further embarrassment came when 51 people were charged with conspiring to rig McDonald's game promotions over the course of several years. It was revealed that $24 million of winning McDonald's game tickets had been stolen as part of the scam. McDonald's was not implicated in the scheme, which centered on a worker at an outside company that had administered the promotions. McDonald's also had to increasingly battle its public image as a purveyor of fatty, unhealthy food. Consumers began filing lawsuits contending that years of eating at McDonald's had made them overweight. McDonald's responded by introducing low-calorie menu items and switching to a more healthful cooking oil for its french fries. McDonald's franchises overseas became a favorite target of people and groups expressing anti-American and/or anti-globalization sentiments. In August 1999 a group of protesters led by farmer Jos√© Bov√© destroyed a half-built McDonald's restaurant in Millau, France. In 2002 Bov√©, who gained fame from the incident, served a three-month jail sentence for the act, which he said was in protest against U.S. trade protectionism. McDonald's was also one of three multinational corporations (along with Starbucks Corporation and Nike, Inc.) whose outlets in Seattle were attacked in late 1999 by some of the more aggressive protesters against a World Trade Organization meeting taking place there. In the early 2000s McDonald's pulled out of several countries, including Bolivia and two Middle Eastern nations, at least in part because of the negative regard with which the brand was held in some areas. Early in 2002, Cantalupo retired after 28 years of service. Sales remained lackluster that year, and in October the company attempted to revive U.S. sales through the introduction of a low-cost Dollar Menu. In December 2002, after this latest initiative to reignite sales growth failed and also after profits fell in seven of the previous eight quarters, Greenberg announced that he would resign at the end of the year. Cantalupo came out of retirement to become chairman and CEO at the beginning of 2003. Cantalupo started his tenure by announcing a major restructuring that involved the 2002 quarterly loss, which included the closure of more than 700 restaurants (mostly in the United States and Japan), the elimination of 600 jobs, and charges of $853 million. The charges resulted in a fourth-quarter 2002 loss of $343.8 million, the first quarterly loss in McDonald's 38 years as a public company. The new CEO also shifted away from the company's traditional reliance on growth through the opening of new units to a focus on gaining more sales from existing units. By 2003, with Ray Kroc's McDonald's Corporation nearly 50 and the McDonald's fast food restaurant concept itself old enough to qualify for AARP membership, the brand had perhaps become too familiar and sales figures stalled. Analysts, management, owners, and customers alike recognized that the aged chain required revivification. The question in need of solution was: How should McDonald's reinvent itself without losing its core values and maintain relevance in the marketplace? To that end, several new menu items were successfully launched, including entree salads, McGriddles breakfast sandwiches (which used pancakes in place of bread), and white-meat Chicken McNuggets. Some outlets began test-marketing fruits and vegetables as Happy Meal options. It was quickly determined that focus on customer experience was key in reversing the slippage. Then, a new global marketing campaign was adopted which was designed around the notion of the \\"Rolling Energy\\" phase. Launched on September 29, 2003, the campaign began featuring youthful images, hip music, and pop culture celebrities touting the tagline, \\"I'm lovin' it\\". Next, James R. Cantalupo was called back from retirement to head the corporation and its efforts to recapture golden luster. His plan was to keep things simple with a focus on the basics like customer service, clean restrooms, and reliable appealing food (not unlike Ray Kroc's mantra of QSC and V: Quality, Service, Cleanliness, and Value). In addition to the basics he determined to position the company with a more modern coherent image in order to foster a McDonald's \\"experience\\" for customers. More than an advertising campaign he and his team approved sweeping new architecture for McDonald's restaurants, the first major overhaul since 1969 when the now universally recognized signature double mansard roof became standard. In fact, Mr. Cantalupo personally approved abandonment of the ubiquitous and familiar mansard in favor of what became the \\"Forever Young\\" prototype topped with its swish eyebrow. This was the first global campaign in McDonald's history, as the new slogan was to be used in advertising in more than 100 countries. It also proved to be the first truly successful ad campaign in years; sales began rebounding, helped also by improvements in service. Cantalupo did not live to see the fruits of his labor and he died in 2004 just as his modern vision for McDonald's was getting underway. Nonetheless he had set things into motion causing a paradigm shift for the company resulting in a refreshed image without a dilution of brand identity. In December 2003, for instance, same- store sales increased 7.3 percent. Same-store sales rose 2.4 percent for the entire year, after falling 2.1 percent in 2002. Also, in that month, McDonald's announced that it would further its focus on its core hamburger business by downsizing its other ventures. The company said that it would sell Donatos back to that chain's founder. In addition, it would discontinue development of non-McDonald's brands outside of the United States. This included Boston Market outlets in Canada and Australia and Donatos units in Germany. McDonald's kept its minority investment in Pret A Manger, but McDonald's Japan was slated to close its Pret units there. These moves would enable the company to concentrate its international efforts on the McDonald's chain, while reducing the non-hamburger brands in the United States to Chipotle and Boston Market, both of which were operating in the black. McDonald's continued to curtail store openings in 2004 and to concentrate on building business at existing restaurants. Much of the more than $1.5 billion budgeted for capital expenditures in 2004 was slated to be used to remodel existing restaurants. McDonald's also aimed to pay down debt by $400 million to $700 million and to return approximately $1 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Cantalupo also set several long-term goals, such as sustaining annual systemwide sales and revenue growth rates of 3 to 5 percent. In a move to both simplify the menu and make its offerings less fattening, McDonald's announced in March 2004 that it would phase out Super Size french fries and soft drinks by the end of the year. In the 1960s, the 1970s, the 1980s, and the 1990s, \\"no loitering\\" had been McDonald's motto. Ray Kroc had decreed upon the origins of his version of the chain that pay telephones, jukeboxes, and vending machines of any kind were forbidden at McDonald's restaurants. The goal had been to quickly serve customers and not force them to stay in the restaurants any longer than it took them to eat a hamburger. Along that line of thinking, dining areas were designed with minimalist hard plastic tables and chairs which were more often than not bolted in place. Thus customers consumed their fast food in scant comfort without dillydally allowing room for the next hurrying customers. With the new \\"Forever Young\\" design (adopted in 2006), the first major redesign since 1969, McDonald's turned a new page for itself. New and remodeled restaurants feature dining zones with \\"distinct personalities\\". Most of them offer three sections or zones. A linger zone was designed to accommodate people who were inclined to dawdle and socialize while sitting comfortably on armchairs or sofas using free wifi access. Another zone offers counters and stools for patrons in a hurry who might just grab and go. The third and perhaps most important zone is the one for families or groups where seating arrangements can be reconfigured to meet a variety of needs. Harsh colors and hard plastics have been replaced with custom earth tones and flexible, padded, fabric-covered booth-seating, all in hopes of engaging diners to loiter and perhaps spend more money. In addition to architecture and furnishings, the McDonald's menu has been tweaked to offer a larger variety of what the corporation refers to as more healthy food. McDonald's franchises are required to follow the directions of the parent company and perhaps more than a few have complained about the Forever Young changes. First, customers needed to recognize the mansard buildings and identify McDonald's with them‚Äîa new look may initially generate some degree of confusion. The next objection is cost: as of 2008, a newly built swish-brow store was said to cost upwards of $1 million and renovation of an existing unit to meet the new standards as much as $400,000. With a large percentage of sales from drive-in business, franchises could argue that the expensive interior redesign is unwarranted for their bottom lines. 2010s In May 2010, McDonald's redesigned its US website to a sleeker, HTML 5 friendly interface. Along with those changes, McDonald's also introduced new advertising material to its website, including the unveiling of new pictures used exclusively for in-restaurant ads, television commercials, print advertising, and online advertising, which consist of more realistic pictures of its products, which are now up close and face the camera instead of facing left or right. In July 2011, McDonald's announced that their largest pop-up restaurant in the world would be built on the 2012 London Olympics site. The temporary restaurant contained over 1,500 seats and was half the length of an American football field. Over 470 staff were employed serving on average (during the 2012 Olympics) 100,000 portions of fries, 50,000 Big Macs and 30,000 Milkshakes. In January 2012, the company announced revenue for 2011 reached an all-time high of $27 billion, and that 2,400 restaurants would be updated and 1,300 new ones opened worldwide. In the middle of the decade, the restaurant began to suffer from declining profits. In response, McDonald's began to offer a limited selection of its breakfast menu all day starting in 2015. At first, the launch was unpopular with franchisees who claimed that the changes caused service to slow down. However, the plan paid off with CNBC reporting that the company's fourth quarter earnings \\"easily topped analysts' forecasts\\". Timeline * 1937: Patrick McDonald opens a food and drinks stand called \\"The Airdrome\\" on historic Route 66 (now Huntington Drive) near the Monrovia Airport in Monrovia, California. * 1940: Brothers Richard and Maurice McDonald move The Airdrome building east to San Bernardino, California, where they open the first McDonald's restaurant, near U.S. Route 66, at West 14th St and 1398 North E St., on May 15. Its menu consisted of 25 items, mostly barbecue. As was common at the time, they employed around 20 carhops. It became a popular and highly profitable teen hangout. * 1948: After noticing that almost all of their profits came from hamburgers, the brothers closed the restaurant for several months to remodel it and implement their innovative \\"Speedee Service System\\", a streamlined assembly line for hamburgers. The carhops are fired, and when the restaurant reopens it sells only hamburgers, milkshakes, and french fries. At 15 cents, the burgers are about half as expensive as at standard diners, and they are served immediately. The restaurant is extremely successful, and its fame spreads by word of mouth. McDonald's Sign circa 1955 * 1952: The brothers hire Southern California architect Stanley Clark Meston to design a replacement for the San Bernardino stand which is to have even greater efficiency and a more eye- catching appearance.

The first franchisee is Neil Fox. * 1953: Fox's McDonald's opens in May in Phoenix, Arizona at N. Central Ave and Indian School Road. It is the first to feature the Golden Arches design. * 1953: The third McDonald's restaurant, franchised to Roger Williams and Burdette Landon, opens in Downey, California at the corner of Lakewood Blvd and Florence Avenue. Today it is the oldest McDonald's restaurant still in operation. * 1954: Entrepreneur and milkshake- mixer salesman Ray Kroc becomes fascinated by the McDonald's restaurant during a sales visit, when he learns of its extraordinary capacity and popularity. Others who had visited the restaurant and come away inspired were James McLamore, founder of Burger King, and Glen Bell, founder of Taco Bell. After seeing the restaurant in operation, Kroc approaches the McDonald brothers, who have already begun franchising, with a proposition to let him franchise McDonald's restaurants outside the company's home base of California and Arizona, with himself as the first franchisee. Kroc works hard to sell McDonald's franchises. First restaurant franchised under Kroc's efforts, the tenth-ever location, at Blackstone and Shields Avenues (though torn down and rebuilt twice) in Fresno, California. * 1955: Ray Kroc founds \\"McDonald's Systems, Inc.\\" on March 2, as a legal structure for his planned franchises.

In a handshake agreement, the brothers would also receive an overriding royalty of 1% on the gross sales. At the closing table the brothers told Kroc that they were giving the real estate and rights to the original unit to the founding employees. Kroc closed the transaction, then refused to acknowledge the royalty portion of the agreement because it wasn't in writing. The brothers keep their original restaurant, but in an oversight they fail to retain the right to remain a McDonald's franchise. It was renamed \\"The Big M\\", while Kroc drives it out of business by opening a McDonald's just one block north; he attended the opening in person. Had the brothers maintained their original agreement, which granted them 0.5% of the chain's annual revenues, they or their heirs would have been collecting in excess of $100 million per year today. Had Kroc adhered to the handshake agreement, these royalties would now be over $200 million a year. *1961: Hamburger University opens in the basement of the Elk Grove Village, Illinois, McDonald's restaurant.

Washington, D.C. franchisees John Gibson and Oscar Goldstein (Gee Gee Distributing Corporation) sponsor a children's show on WRC- TV called Bozo the Clown, a franchised character played by Willard Scott from 1959 until 1962. After the show was cancelled, Goldstein hires Scott to portray McDonald's new mascot, named Ronald McDonald. According to Scott, they wanted to pay him in stock, but Scott decided to take the money. Scott, looking nothing like the familiar appearance of any McDonaldland character as is known today, appeared in the first three television advertisements featuring the character. After changing the character's first name to \\"Ronald\\" and replacing Scott with a new actor, and giving him the more familiar red, white, and yellow clown features, the character eventually spreads to the rest of the country via an advertising campaign.

In 2007, Furst received the award for Excellence in Cancer Awareness, and in March 2010, Furst received the 2nd Annual Cancer Champion Award. Furst teamed up with his friend Kim Scheinberg in 2010 to launch Presumed Abundance a new type of venture philanthropy fund which holds its profits in trust for the social entrepreneurs it has funded, in order that they may later \\"fund it forward.\\"  Community curation Furst curates a community called Accelerating Possibilities which \\"connects ideas, people and resources to make good things happen faster.\\" In a few years, the community has grown from several close friends to over 1,700 members. Furst is also an active member of the TED community and has sponsored over a dozen first-time attendees through a program he dubbed \\"TED Forward\\", in which recipients agree to similarly sponsor others in the future.  Science and philosophy Furst's blog, The Emergent Fool, explores topics in complex adaptive systems ranging from cancer to economics, psychology, technology and the limits of science. Some of his ideas have been picked up and written about by FreakonomicsFurst cited on Freakonomics blog and New York Times Magazine. In October 2009, Furst wrote about an experiment\\"Investing in Superstars,\\" Emergentfool.com he and Phil Gordon undertook to invest in the lifetime future income of Furst's brother-in-law, filmmaker Jon Gunn.Jon Gunn's IMDb IMDb.com The blog entry went viral and was picked up by Wired\\"Investing In Our Geeklets: A Methodology,\\" Wired.com and Reuters, and soon there were others who began selling portions of their future income stream. Furst spoke in 2010 at the TEDActive ConferenceYouTube \\"Investing in Superstars,\\" YouTube about the experiment, and by 2012 several efforts were underway to commercialize the concept. Furst became an advisor to the business startup Pave, which has adapted and refined Furst's initial concept. Furst has devoted a good portion of his writing and thinking to the question of why cancer mortality rates have not improved in the U.S., despite the billions of dollars spent each year on research, treatment and the search for a cure. Though not formally trained in oncology or biology, Furst is well-respected in the cancer research community and been invited to participate in cancer conferences and gatherings at the Santa Fe Institute, Van Andel Institute, UCSF Medical Center, Summit Series and X Prize Foundation.

Many of these have involved trademark issues, but McDonald's has also launched a defamation suit which has been described as \\"the biggest corporate PR disaster in history\\". Partnership suits = El Salvador = In 1996, McDonald's revoked businessman Roberto Bukele's franchise for his restaurants in El Salvador. McDonald's told Bukele the franchise he had operated for 24 years had expired and wouldn't be renewed. Bukele, who had a 1994 agreement that he believed extended the franchise to 2014, refused to close or rebrand his restaurants. McDonald's won in the lower courts, but appellate courts sided with Bukele and eventually in 2012 McDonald's was ordered to pay a $23.9 million judgment to Bukele. Bukele alleged that he never received the $23.9 million judgment and has filed a new demand in court for $21 million in interest on the award. =McDonald's India ‚Äì Vikram Bakshi partnership case= On 30 August 2013, McDonald's published a public notice in select newspapers, declaring that McDonald's India partner Vikram Bakshi had ceased to be the managing director of Connaught Plaza Restaurants (CPRL) pursuant to the expiration of his term on July 17, 2013. CPRL was a joint venture between McDonald's and Vikram Bakshi, and was responsible for managing the over 150 McDonald's outlets in North and East regions of India. Bakshi had been the face of the company in India for almost two decades. After being ousted abruptly, Bakshi sought to fight for his stake and rights before the Company Law Board (CLB). Bakshi said he brought over worth of revenue for the American food chain. McDonald's sought to buy the 50% share in CPRL held by Bakshi and his wife for , whereas Bakshi sought for the same. Bakshi accused Amit Jatia, who manages the chain in West and South India under Hardcastle Restaurants, of instigating McDonald's. McDonald's had sold their 50% share of the Hardcastle Restaurants joint venture to Jatia at a reported loss of 99% in 2011, making it a master franchisee. The court is under the ambit of CLB with hearing beginning in early October 2013. In 2017, the National Company Law Tribunal (the successor of the CLB) reinstated Bakshi as managing director of Connaught Plaza Restaurants. In 2019, Bakshi and McDonald's reached a settlement where McDonald's would buy Bakshi share in CPRL for an undisclosed amount and become the sole owner. Defamation =McLibel (UK)= In 1990, McDonald's took environmental campaigners Helen Steel and Dave Morris to court after they distributed leaflets entitled \\"What's Wrong with McDonald's?\\" on the streets of London. The high-profile trial, which came to be known as the McLibel Case, lasted nearly ten years, the longest in English legal history. An anti- McDonald's leafletting campaign in front of the McDonald's restaurant in Leicester Square, London, during the European Social Forum season, 2004-10-16. Though a High Court judge eventually ruled in favour of McDonald's on some counts, John Vidal called it a Pyrrhic victory. The extended legal battle was a PR disaster, with every aspect of the company's working practices being scrutinised and the media presenting the case as a David and Goliath battle. Additionally, the damages received were negligible compared to the company's estimated ¬£10 million legal costs because the court ruled in favour of a number of the defendants' claims, including that McDonald's exploited children in its advertising, was anti-trade union and indirectly exploited and caused suffering to animals. McDonald's was awarded ¬£60,000 damages, which was later reduced to ¬£40,000 by the Court of Appeal. Steel and Morris announced they had no intention of ever paying, and the company later confirmed it would not be pursuing the money. Steel and Morris went on to challenge UK libel laws in the European Court of Human Rights, claiming that the lack of access to legal aid and the heavy burden of proof that lay with them, as the defendants' requirement to prove their claims under UK law was a breach of the right to a fair trial and freedom of expression. The court ruled in their favour and the UK Government was forced to introduce legislation to change defamation laws. Intellectual property =MacJoy (Philippines)= In 2004, McDonald's sued Cebu-based fast food restaurant MacJoy for using a very similar trade name. In its defense, MacJoy insisted that it was the first user of the mark under the title \\"MACJOY & DEVICE\\" for its business in Cebu City which started in 1987, whereas McDonald's only opened its first outlet in the same city in 1992, although it had used the name in Manila since 1971. MacJoy stated that the requirement of ‚Äúactual use‚Äù in commerce in the Philippines before one may register a trademark pertains to the territorial jurisdiction on a national scale and is not merely confined to a certain locality or region. It added that \\"MacJoy\\" is a term of endearment for the owner's niece whose name is Scarlett Yu Carcel. In response, McDonald's claimed that there was no connection with the name Scarlett Yu Carcel to merit the coinage of the word \\"MacJoy\\" and that the only logical conclusion over the name is to help the Cebu restaurant ride high on their (McDonald's) established reputation. In February 2007, the Philippine Supreme Court upheld the right of McDonald's over its registered and internationally recognized trademarks.Philippine Supreme Court upholds McDonald's trademark rights . MarketWatch. February 7, 2007. As a result, the owners of MacJoy, the Espina family, was forced to change its trademark into MyJoy, which went into effect with the re-opening of its two branches in Cebu City on August that year. =McCoffee (US)= In 1994, McDonald's successfully forced Elizabeth McCaughey of the San Francisco Bay Area to change the trading name of her coffee shop McCoffee, which had operated under that name for 17 years. \\"This is the moment I surrendered the little 'c' to corporate America,\\" said Elizabeth McCaughey, who had named it as an adaptation of her surname. =Norman McDonald's Country Drive-Inn (US)= From the early 1960s to the mid-1980s, Norman McDonald ran a small \\"Country Drive-Inn\\" restaurant in Philpot, Kentucky called simply \\"McDonald's Hamburgers; Country Drive-Inn\\", which at the time also had a gas station and convenience store. McDonald's the restaurant chain forced Norman to remove the arches and add the full Norman McDonald's name to its sign so customers would not be confused into thinking the restaurant was affiliated with the McDonald's restaurant chain. The restaurant is still open to this day (though it no longer has the gas station). =McChina Wok Away (UK)= In 2001, McDonald's lost a nine-year legal action against Frank Yuen, owner of McChina Wok Away, a small chain of Chinese takeaway outlets in London. Justice David Neuberger ruled the McChina name would not cause any confusion among customers and that McDonald's had no right to the prefix Mc. =McMunchies (UK)= In 1996, McDonald's forced Scottish sandwich shop owner Mary Blair of Fenny Stratford, Buckinghamshire to drop McMunchies as her trading name. Mrs. Blair did not sell burgers or chips. She said she chose the name because she liked the word munchies and wanted the cafe to have a Scottish feel. The cafe's sign reflected this, featuring a Scottish thistle and a St Andrew's flag. But in a statement to Mrs. Blair's solicitors, McDonald's said if someone used the Mc prefix, even unintentionally, they were using something that does not belong to them. = MacDonald's (UK - Cayman Islands) = An often reported urban legend maintains that McDonald's filed a lawsuit against MacDonald's Family Restaurant, an actual fast food establishment located in Grand Cayman. This false claim alleges that McDonald's lost the case, and in addition, was banned from ever opening a McDonald's location on Grand Cayman. While it is true that no McDonald's locations exist on the island, the reason is not due to any lawsuit against MacDonald's Family Restaurant. =McAllan (Denmark)= In 1996, McDonald's lost a legal battle at the Danish Supreme Court to force Allan Pedersen, a hotdog vendor, to drop his shop name McAllan. Pedersen had previously visited Scotland on whisky tasting tours. He named his business after his favorite brand of whisky, MacAllan's, after contacting the distillery to see if they would object. They did not, but McDonald's did. However, the court ruled customers could tell the difference between a one-man vendor and a multi-national chain and ordered McDonald's to pay 40,000 kroner ($6,900) in court costs. The verdict cannot be appealed. =McCurry (Malaysia)= In 2001, McDonald's sued a small restaurant named McCurry, a popular eatery serving Indian food in Jalan Ipoh, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. McDonald's claimed that the use of the \\"Mc\\" prefix infringed its trademark, while the defendant claimed that McCurry stood for Malaysian Chicken Curry. In 2006, McDonald's won an initial judgment in the High Court. The judge ruled that the prefix Mc and the use of colours distinctive of the McDonald's brand could confuse and deceive customers. In April 2009, however, a three-member Appeal Court panel overturned the verdict, saying that there was no evidence to show that McCurry was passing off its own product as that of McDonald's. The Appeals Court also said that McDonald's cannot claim an exclusive right to the \\"Mc\\" prefix in the country. McDonald's appealed the decision to the Federal Court, the highest court in Malaysia. In September 2009, the Federal Court upheld the Appeal Court's decision. McDonald's appeal was dismissed with costs, and the company was ordered to pay RM10,000 to McCurry. =South African trademark law= Apartheid politics had prevented earlier expansion into South Africa, but as the apartheid regime came to an end in the early 1990s, McDonald's decided to expand there. The company had already recognized South Africa as a potentially significant market and had registered its name as a trademark there in 1968. Under South African law, trademarks cease to be the property of a company if they are not used for a certain amount of time. McDonald's had renewed the 1968 registration several times, but missed a renewal deadline. The registration expired and McDonald's discovered two fast food restaurants in South Africa were trading under the name MacDonalds. Moreover, a businessman had applied to register the McDonald's name. Multiple lawsuits were filed. The fast food chain was stunned when the court ruled it had lost the rights to its world-famous name in South Africa. However, the company eventually won on appeal. =The real Ronald McDonald (US)= The company waged an unsuccessful 26-year (as of 2001) legal action against McDonald's Family Restaurant, which opened in 1956 in Fairbury, Illinois and is run by a man whose real name is Ronald McDonald. McDonald ultimately continued to use his name on his restaurant despite the company's objections. =The McBrat case (Australia)= In 2005, McDonald's tried to stop a Queensland lawyer, Malcolm McBratney, from using the name 'McBrat' on the shorts of the Brisbane Irish Rugby team. McDonald's claimed the McBrat name should not be registered because it was too similar to its McKids trade mark, since the word 'brat' is another term for 'kid'. McBratney argued that his family name had been used in Ireland since the 1600s, and that he had a right to use an abbreviation of that name. In 2006, the Delegate of the Register of Trade Marks held that McBratney could register 'McBrat' as a trademark and that McDonald's had no intellectual property rights over 'Mc' and 'Mac' prefixed words. McBratney, a solicitor specialising in trademarks and intellectual property, then brought a suit against McDonald's for its registration, in Australia in 1987, of 'McKids'. This trademark had never been used in Australia and can therefore be removed for non-use. =Cases brought against McDonald's= H.R. Pufnstuf / McDonaldland In 1973, Sid and Marty Krofft, the creators of H.R. Pufnstuf, successfully sued McDonald's in Sid & Marty Krofft Television Productions Inc. v. McDonald's Corp., arguing that the entire McDonaldland premise was essentially a ripoff of their television show. In specific, the Kroffts claimed that the character Mayor McCheese was a direct copy of their character, \\"H.R. Pufnstuf\\" (being a mayor himself). McDonald's initially was ordered to pay $50,000. The case was later remanded as to damages, and McDonald's was ordered to pay the Kroffts more than $1 million. McDonaldland itself, as it was depicted in the commercials, was a magical place where plants, foods, and inanimate objects were living, speaking characters. In addition to being the home to Ronald and the other core characters, McDonaldland boasted \\"Thick shake volcanoes\\", anthropomorphized \\"Apple pie trees\\", \\"The Hamburger Patch\\" (where McDonald's hamburgers grew out of the ground like plants), \\"Filet-O-Fish Lake\\", and many other fanciful features based around various McDonald's menu items. In the commercials, the various beings are played by puppets or costumed performers, very similar to the popular H.R. Pufnstuf program. McDonald's had originally hoped the Kroffts would agree to license its characters for commercial promotions. When they declined, McDonaldland was created, purposely based on the H.R. Pufnstuf show in an attempt to duplicate the appeal. After the lawsuit, the concept of the \\"magical place\\" was all but phased out of the commercials, as were many of the original characters. Those that remained would be Ronald, Grimace, The Hamburglar, and the Fry Kids. McSleep (Quality Inns International) In 1988, Quality Inns (now Choice Hotels) was planning to open a new chain of economy hotels under the name \\"McSleep.\\" After McDonald's demanded that Quality Inns not use the name because it infringed, the hotel company filed a suit in federal court seeking a declaratory judgment that \\"McSleep\\" did not infringe. McDonald's counterclaimed, alleging trademark infringement and unfair competition. Linguist Roger Shuy testified for Quality Inn, that \\"the Mc prefix had become part of everyday English\\"; David Lightfoot argued for McDonald's that in all those cases these meanings \\"were characteristics of McDonald's and its reputation\\". Eventually, McDonald's prevailed. The court's opinion noted that the prefix \\"Mc\\" added to a generic word has acquired secondary meaning, so that in the eyes of the public it means McDonald's, and therefore the name \\"McSleep\\" would infringe on McDonald's trademarks. Viz top tips (UK) In 1996, British adult comic Viz accused McDonald's of plagiarizing the name and format of its longstanding Top Tips feature, in which readers offer sarcastic tips. McDonald's had created an advertising campaign of the same name, which showcased the Top Tips (and then suggested the money-saving alternative - going to McDonald's). Some of the similarities were almost word-for-word: :\\"Save a fortune on laundry bills. Give your dirty shirts to Oxfam. They will wash and iron them, and then you can buy them back for 50p.\\" ‚Äì Viz Top Tip, published May 1989. :\\"Save a fortune on laundry bills. Give your dirty shirts to a second-hand shop. They will wash and iron them, and then you can buy them back for 50p.\\" ‚Äì McDonald's advert, 1996 The case was settled out of court for an undisclosed sum, which was donated to the charity appeal Comic Relief. However, many Viz readers believed that the comic had given permission for their use, leading to Top Tips submissions such as: \\"Geordie magazine editors. Continue paying your mortgage and buying expensive train sets ... by simply licensing the Top Tips concept to a multinational burger corporation.\\" Labor =Coalition of Immokalee workers (US)= In March 2001, the Coalition of Immokalee Workers, a group of South Florida farmworkers, began a campaign demanding better wages for the people who pick the tomatoes used by McDonald's and other fast food companies. McDonald's was the second target after the group succeeded against Taco Bell. =Strip search Suit (US)= Advertisements =Happy Meals and Toys (Quebec, Canada)= On November 14, 2018, the Superior Court of Quebec certified a class action on behalf of all consumers worldwide who purchased Happy Meals and Toys in the Province of Quebec (Bramante v. McDonald Restaurants, 2018 QCCS 4852). The Plaintiffs alleged - and the Court agreed at certification - that McDonald's violated section 248 of the Consumer Protection Act (Quebec) by unlawfully advertising Happy Meals using displays with toys (often related to the newest cinematic release) at children's eye- level inside McDonald's restaurants. Section 248 provides that: \\"Subject to what is provided in the regulations, no person may make use of commercial advertising directed at persons under thirteen years of age\\". The Court certified the case on behalf of the following class: \\"Every consumer pursuant to the Qu√©bec Consumer Protection Act who, since November 15, 2013 purchased in Qu√©bec for a child under 13 years of age then present inside a McDonald‚Äôs restaurant, a toy or Happy Meal, during an advertising campaign directed at children taking place inside the restaurant\\". The Class Action seeks injunctive relief ordering McDonald's to cease marketing to children under 13 years old with its Happy Meal displays, reimbursement of Happy Meal and individual toy sales, as well as punitive damages in amounts to be determined. The case was initially filed on November 15, 2013, by Quebec class action attorney Joey Zukran of LPC Avocat Inc. =Fries advertisement (UK)= In 2003, a ruling by the UK Advertising Standards Authority determined that the corporation had acted in breach of the codes of practice in describing how its French fries were prepared. A McDonald's print ad stated that \\"after selecting certain potatoes\\", \\"we peel them, slice them, fry them and that's it.\\" It showed a picture of a potato in a McDonald's fries box. In fact, the product was sliced, pre-fried, sometimes had dextrose added, was then frozen, shipped, and re-fried and then had salt added. = Beef content in fries = Lawsuits were brought against the McDonald's Corporation in the early 1990s for including beef in its French fries despite claims that the fries were vegetarian. In fact, beef flavoring is added to the fries during the production phase.(Block vs. McDonald's Corp., Sharma vs. McDonald's Corp., Bansal v. McDonald's Corp., Zimmerman v. McDonald's Corp.) PDF The case revolved around a 1990 McDonald's press release stating that the company's French fries would be cooked in 100% vegetable oil and a 1993 letter to a customer that claimed their French fries are vegetarian. McDonald's denied this. The lawsuits ended in 2002 when McDonald's announced it would issue another apology and pay $10M to vegetarians and religious groups.https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mcdonalds-settles-beef-over-fries/ Subsequent oversight by the courts was required to ensure that the money that was paid by McDonald's: \\"to use the funds for programs serving the interests of people following vegetarian dietary practices in the broadest sense.\\" There was some controversy in this ruling, as it benefited non-vegetarian groups such as research institutions that research vegetarian diets but do not benefit vegetarians. In 2005, the appeal filed by vegetarians against the list of recipients, in this case, was denied, and the recipients of the $10M chosen by McDonald's was upheld. Further ingredient-related lawsuits have been brought against McDonald's since 2006. McDonald's had included its French fries on its website in a list of gluten-free products; these lawsuits claim children suffered severe intestinal damage as a result of unpublicized changes to McDonald's French fry recipe. McDonald's has provided a more complete ingredient list for its French fries more recently. Over 20 lawsuits have been brought against McDonald's regarding this issue, which the McDonald's Corporation has attempted to consolidate. =\\"McMatch and Win Monopoly\\" promotion (Australia)= In 2001, 34 claimants (representing some 7,000 claimants) filed a class action lawsuit against McDonald's for false and misleading conduct arising from the \\"McMatch & Win Monopoly\\" promotion before Justice John Dowsett of the Federal Court of Australia.. The claimants had attempted to claim prizes from the 1999 promotion using game tokens from the 1998 promotion, arguing unsuccessfully that the remaining 1998 tokens may have been distributed accidentally by McDonald's in 1999. =Halal food lawsuit (Dearborn, Michigan)= In 2013, McDonald's stopped serving halal food, which is consistent with Islamic dietary laws, at the only two locations in the US that served halal food, both located in Dearborn, MI after a $700,000 lawsuit filed in 2001 where a customer alleged the menu items were not consistently halal. The case was brought to court by Michael Jaafar, a Detroit lawyer of Fairmax Law who filed a consumer protection class action lawsuit against McDonald's for advertising halal foods. Health and safety = United States of America = Also known as the \\"McDonald's coffee case\\", Liebeck v. McDonald's is a well-known product liability lawsuit that became a flash point in the debate in the U.S. over tort reform after a jury awarded $2.9 million to Stella Liebeck, a 79-year-old woman from Albuquerque, New Mexico, who sued McDonald's after she suffered third-degree burns from hot coffee that was spilled on her at one of the company's drive-thrus in 1992.Liebeck v. McDonald's Restaurants, P.T.S., Inc., No. D-202 CV-93-02419, 1995 WL 360309 (Bernalillo County, N.M. Dist. Ct. Aug. 18, 1994) details from nmcourts.com The trial judge reduced the total award to $640,000, and the parties settled for a confidential amount before an appeal was decided. The case entered popular understanding as an example of frivolous litigation;Mark B. Greenlee, \\"Kramer v. Java World: Images, Issues, and Idols in the Debate Over Tort Reform,\\" 26 Cap. U.L. Rev. 701 ABC News calls the case \\"the poster child of excessive lawsuits.\\" Trial-lawyer groups such as the Association of Trial Lawyers of America and other opponents of tort reform sometimes argue that the suit was justified because of the extent of Liebeck's injuries, as the coffee in question was at a temperature too hot for human consumption which McDonald's failed to provide proper warning. Warning consumers of possible dangers of their products is strictly enforced by the FDA. Furthermore, McDonald's should not be serving substances that are potentially harmful to their consumers.See Gerlin. See also Ralph Nader & Wesley J. Smith, No Contest: Corporate Lawyers and the Perversion of Justice in America (1996) , 268 = China = In July 2014, a reporter was able to secretly capture film from inside the Shanghai Husi Food factory (a subsidiary of the American OSI group) which showed factory workers violating various safety policies. These included: handling meat with bare hands, picking meat up off the floor and returning it to the processing machine, processing expired meats, and repeatedly reprocessing products that failed inspection until the said products passed inspection. After the video surfaced, Yum Brands (operator of KFC and Pizza Hut in China) discontinued its operations with Husi Foods (and thus OSI Group). However, McDonalds merely switched factories, preferring to continue their association with OSI Group as they believe the quality of meat is higher and this was an isolated incident.  Discrimination  Magee v. McDonald's is a United States federal class action lawsuit begun in May 2016 in the Illinois Northern District Court, case number 1:16-cv-05652, in which Scott McGee of Metairie, Louisiana is pursuing action against McDonald's due to the company being unwilling to serve people who are visually impaired when only the drive thru lane is open. Because the drive thru lane is sometimes the only method of ordering food once the dining room is closed, this creates a situation in which people who are legally blind, and unable to operate a motor vehicle can not order food from the restaurant while other people are able to do so. McGee's has limited vision, because of macular degeneration, which started at age 16, and has become progressively worse. He can walk without a cane, but his central vision is insufficient for driving. McDonald's attempted to get the case dismissed, but in February 2017, a federal court ruled that Magee's lawsuit could proceed. On May 8, 2018, the class was certified. In August 2018, McDonald's argued that the restaurant was operated by a franchisee, and that the McDonald's corporation did not control the locking of doors. In October 2018, McDonald's argued that the restaurant was accessible, because a blind person could obtain food \\"through the same UberEats delivery service that everyone else uses,\\" even though it would cost $5.00 extra. On October 31, 2018, McDonald's filed a document with the court, arguing that because the restaurants forbid any pedestrian access to their drive-up window, they are not discriminating against the blind. McDonald's says a blind person has \\"the same access as the 13 million adults who are not visually impaired and do not have a car, and that therefore the ADA does not apply.\\" In March 2019, arguments in court papers continued about the definition of \\"meaningful access.\\" there have been no court filings for over six months. Meanwhile, on May 24, 2018, a law came into effect in Portland Oregon requiring multi-modal access to drive-throughs. The McDonald's case was mentioned in a June 2019 article about a similar problem with Wendy's evening service. On 1 September 2020, McDonald's was sued by 50 black owners for racial discrimination. According to the lawsuit, McDonald's steered black franchisees to stores which had lower revenue and higher security expenses than stores in more affluent areas.

National Economic Council, Inc. was an American conservative political organization, headed for much of its history by Merwin K. Hart. The organization was established in 1931 as the New York State Economic Council, with the aims of reducing U.S. government expenditures and taxes. In 1943, it changed its name to the National Economic Council. Positions of the New York State Economic Council and the National Economic Council, Inc., included opposition to U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt and support for Francisco Franco's fascist leadership in Spain. Several newsletters of the National Economic Council expressed antisemitic views, stating that American Jews were \\"alien-minded\\" and were undermining American government through \\"deceit\\", \\"trickery\\", and \\"intimidation\\". In 1947, the organization sent letters to many trustees of American universities and colleges that attacked Keynesian economics as a form of Marxism and denounced the textbook Elements of Economics, by Lorie Tarshis, for endorsing Keynesianism. Notable writers affiliated with the National Economic Council included Rose Wilder Lane, daughter of Laura Ingalls Wilder. One of the seminal influencers of the mid-20th Century Libertarian political movement, Lane served as an editor and book reviewer from 1945-1952. The organization was included on President Richard Nixon's \\"enemies list\\". See also * Merwin K. Hart * Rose Wilder Lane Notes References *James T. Harris (1951).

The 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act would go on to ban immigration by Chinese men as well. The law was named after its sponsor, Representative Horace F. Page, a Republican who introduced it to \\"end the danger of cheap Chinese labor and immoral Chinese women\\". The law technically barred immigrants considered \\"undesirable,\\" defining this as a person from East Asia who was coming to the United States to be a forced laborer, any East Asian woman who would engage in prostitution, and all people considered to be convicts in their own country. The Page Act was supposed to strengthen the ban against \\"coolie\\" laborers, by imposing a fine of up to $2,000 and maximum jail sentence of one year upon anyone who tried to bring a person from China, Japan, or any East Asian country to the United States \\"without their free and voluntary consent, for the purpose of holding them to a term of service\\".An Act Supplementary to the Acts in Relation to Immigration (Page Law) sect. 141, 18 Stat. 477 (1873-March 1875). Only the ban on female East Asian immigrants was effectively and heavily enforced and proved to be a barrier for all East Asian women trying to immigrate, especially Chinese women. Moreover, the Page Act created the policing of immigrants around sexuality which \\"gradually became extended to every immigrant who sought to enter America,\\" and today remains a central feature of immigration restriction, according to some scholars. In 1875, President Ulysses Grant delivered a Seventh Annual Message to the United States Senate and House of Representatives. President Grant reaffirmed the United States bearing regarding the immigration of women originating from the Far East.  Factors that influenced the creation of the Page Act  The first Chinese immigrants to the United States were mostly males, the majority of whom began arriving in 1848 as a part of the California Gold Rush. The California State Legislature assumed that Chinese men were forced to work under long-term service contracts, when in reality immigrants to America were not coolies, but borrowed money from brokers for their trip and paid the money back plus interest through work at their first job. Without enough money to send for their wives, a prostitution industry developed in the male Chinese immigrant community and became a serious issue to Americans living in San Francisco. Laws specifically directed at Chinese female immigrants were created even though prostitution was fairly common in the American West among many nationalities. Both Chinese male \\"coolies\\" and Chinese female prostitutes were linked to slavery, which added to the American animosity toward them since slavery and involuntary servitude was abolished in 1865. Male laborers were central to the anti-Chinese movement, so one might expect legislators to focus on excluding men from immigration, but instead they concentrated on women in order to protect the American system of monogamy. Therefore, the number of immigrants (majority male) entering the U.S. from China during the Page Act's enforcement \\"exceeded the total for any other seven year period, before passage of the Exclusion Act in 1882, by at least thirteen thousand,\\" but the female population dropped from 6.4% in 1870 to 4.6% in 1880. Furthermore, the American Medical Association believed that Chinese immigrants \\"carried distinct germs to which they were immune, but from which whites would die if exposed\\". This fear became concentrated on Chinese women, because some white Americans believed that germs and disease could most easily be transmitted to white men through labor of Chinese prostitutes. Additionally, during difficult times in China, women and girls were sold into \\"domestic service, concubinage, or prostitution\\". Some Chinese men had a wife as well as a concubine, usually a lower class woman obtained through purchase and recognized as a legal member of the family. A woman's status depended on her relationship with Chinese men; \\"first wives enjoyed the highest status, followed by second wives and concubines, followed in turn by several classes of prostitutes\\". An additional concern was that the children of Chinese couples would become U.S. citizens under the Fourteenth Amendment and their cultural practices would become a part of American democracy. As a result, the Page Law responded to \\"what were believed to be serious threats to white values, lives, and futures\\". California state laws could not exclude women for being Chinese, so they were crafted as regulations of public morals, yet the laws were still struck down as \\"impermissible encroachment on federal immigration power\\". However, the Page Law sailed through Congress without any expressed concerns of having a federal law that racially restricted immigration or violated the Burlingame Treaty of 1868 (which allowed free migration and emigration of Chinese people) because Americans were focused on protecting the social ideals of marriage and morality.  Implementation  The American consul in Hong Kong from 1875‚Äì1877, David H. Bailey, was put in charge of regulating which Chinese women were actual wives of laborers, allowed to travel to the United States, as opposed to prostitutes. Bailey set up the process with the Hong Kong authorities and the Tung Wah Hospital Committee, an \\"association of the most prominent Chinese businessmen in Hong Kong\\". Before a Chinese woman could immigrate to the United States she had to submit \\"an official declaration of purpose in emigration and personal morality statement, accompanied by an application for clearance and a fee to the American Consul\\". The declaration was then sent to the Tung Wah Hospital Committee who would do a careful examination and then report back to Bailey about the character of each woman. Also, a list of the potential emigrants was sent to the government in Hong Kong for investigation. In addition, the day before a ship sailed to America, Chinese women reported to the American consul for a series of questioning which included the following questions: > Have you entered into contract or agreement with any person or persons > whomsoever, for a term of service, within the United States for lewd and > immoral purposes? Do you wish of your own free and voluntary will to go to > the United States? Do you go to the United States for the purposes of > prostitution? Are you married or single? What are you going to the United > States for? What is to be your occupation there? Have you lived in a house > of prostitution in Hong Kong, Macao, or China? Have you engaged in > prostitution in either of the above places? Are you a virtuous woman? Do you > intend to live a virtuous life in the United States? Do you know that you > are at liberty now to go to the United States, or remain in your own > country, and that you cannot be forced to go away from your home? The Chinese women who \\"passed\\" these questions according to the American consul were then sent to be questioned by the harbor master on duty. He would ask the women the same questions in an effort to catch liars, but if the women were approved they were then allowed to board the steamer to America. Once on board the ship, the women were questioned again. The first year that Bailey was assigned to differentiate wives from prostitutes he did not yet have the assistance of the Tung Wah Hospital Committee, and 173 women were allowed to sail to California, he was disappointed with that figure and granted only 77 women passage in 1877. In 1878, under the authority of American consul Sheldon Loring, 354 women arrived in the U.S. which was a substantial amount compared to John S. Mosby‚Äôs grant of less than 200 women to be sent to the U.S. from 1879-1882. Upon their arrival in San Francisco, Colonel Bee, the American consul for the Chinese would observe the documents with photographs of each woman included and ask her the same questions she had heard in Hong Kong. If women changed their answers to the questions, did not match their pictures, or had incomplete paperwork, they could be detained, and sent back to Hong Kong. As a result, from 1875-1882 at least one hundred and possibly several hundred women were returned to China. The entire process was \\"shaped by the larger, explicit assumption\\" that Chinese women, like Chinese men were dishonest. Photographs were used as a means to identify the Chinese women through each stage of the examination process in order to ensure that unqualified women would not be substituted for a woman who was properly questioned at any point in time. Chinese women were subject to this method of identification prior to any other immigrant group because of the \\"threat of their sexuality to the United States.\\" In addition to all the questioning that took place in regard to a woman's character, there were also detailed questions about Chinese women's fathers and husbands. Therefore, these women were subject to this because officials \\"accepted that male intentions and actions were more likely to determine a woman's sexual future than her own actions and intentions\\". Chinese women had to demonstrate that they grew up in respectable families and that their husbands could afford to support them in the United States. Also, \\"the appearance of the body and clothing supposedly offered a range of possible clues about inner character, on which some officials drew when trying to differentiate prostitutes from real wives.\\" Bodily clues used to examine Chinese women included bound feet, \\"prettiness, youth, demeanor,\\" and how they walked. However, the task of differentiating \\"real\\" wives from prostitutes was virtually impossible. Men, on the other hand, faced more lenient restriction practices and were not required to \\"carry photographs, nor to match photographs that had been sent in advance to San Francisco Port authorities.\\"  Effects on Chinese families and future immigrants to the U.S.  Most Chinese women who immigrated to the U.S. in the 1860s and the 1870s were \\"second wives, concubines in polygamous marriages, or prostitutes,\\" but not all Chinese women worked as prostitutes. Enforcement of the Page Act resulted not only in fewer prostitutes but also the \\"virtually complete exclusion of Chinese women from the United States\\". In 1882 alone, during the few months before the enactment of the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 and the beginning of its enforcement, 39,579 Chinese entered the U.S., only 136 of them women. Therefore, Chinese immigrants were unable to create families with each other within the U.S. The Page Act was so successful in preventing Chinese women from immigrating and consequently keeping the ratio of females to males low that the law \\"paradoxically encouraged the very vice it purported to be fighting: prostitution\\". Not until after World War II was an appropriate sex balance established, because between 1946 and 1952 almost 90% of all Chinese immigrants were women. The sojourner mentality of the Chinese limited the number of wives who chose to immigrate as did the financial cost of the trip; however, documents relating to the enforcement of the Page Act suggest that some women were able to overcome these barriers and join their husbands, but without this law, the numbers would have been far higher. According to historian George Peffer, \\"all the evidence suggests that the women who survived this ordeal were most likely the wives of Chinese laborers\\" because they would have possessed the determination needed to endure the questioning, while importers of prostitutes \\"might have been reluctant to risk prosecution\\". Yet, this is difficult to conclusively prove, especially since Peffer himself noted that the cost of immigration as well as possible bribes paid to American consuls would have created a greater hardship for the \\"wives of immigrants who possessed limited resources, than for the wealthy tongs\\" who sent prostitutes to the U.S. Therefore, although the Chinese Exclusion Act was extremely important in transforming the Chinese into a \\"declining immigrant group, it was the Page Law that exacerbated the problem of life without families in America's Chinatowns\\".

The Sri Lankan Tamil dialects or Ceylon Tamil dialects form a group of Tamil dialects used in the modern country of Sri Lanka by Sri Lankan Tamils and Moors that is distinct from the dialects of modern Tamil spoken in Tamil Nadu . Tamil dialects are differentiated by the phonological changes and sound shifts in their evolution from classical or Old Tamil (300 BC - 700 CE). It is broadly categorized into four sub groups: Jaffna Tamil, Batticaloa Tamil, up country Indian origin Tamils and Negombo Tamil dialects. These dialects are also used by ethnic groups other than Tamils such as Sinhalese people, Sri Lankan Moors and Veddas, who consider them to be distinct. Characteristics As Tamil is a diglossic language the differences between the standard written languages across the globe is minimal but the spoken varieties differ considerably. The spoken varieties in Sri Lanka although different from those of Tamil Nadu share some common features between the southern dialects of Tamil Nadu and the northern Sri Lankan Tamil dialect, the language of Jaffna. Sri Lankan Tamil dialects retain many words and grammatical forms that are not in everyday use in India, and use many other words slightly differently. The Sri Lankan Tamil dialects are less influenced by Sanskrit and the western languages, although there are western and Sanskrit loan words in day to day usage. In general Sri Lankan Tamil dialects are considered to be more conservative than the continental Tamil dialects.Indrapala, K The Evolution of an ethnic identity: The Tamils of Sri Lanka, p.46 Dialects =Negombo Tamil= The Negombo Tamil dialect, used in the Negombo area by bilingual fishers who otherwise identify themselves as Sinhalese, has undergone considerable morphosyntactic convergence with spoken or colloquial Sinhala as a consequence of contact with it. It has also developed a number of other grammatical traits under the probable influence of Sinhala, including a postposed indefinite article, an indefinitizing postclitic ‚Äìsari (apparently modeled on Sinhala ‚Äìhari), and case assignments for defective verbs that follow the Sinhala, rather than Tamil, patterns of agreement. =Batticaloa Tamil= Batticaloa Tamil dialect is shared between Tamils, Moors, Veddhas and Portuguese Burghers in the eastern province. The Tamil dialect used by residents of the Trincomalee district has many similarities with the Jaffna Tamil dialect. According to Kamil Zvelebil a linguist, the Batticaloa Tamil dialect is the most literary like of all spoken dialects of Tamil, and it has preserved several very antique features, and has remained more true to the literary norm than any other form of Tamil while developing a few striking innovations. Although Batticaloa Tamil has some very specific features of vocabulary, it is classified with other Sri Lankan Tamil dialects as it is related to them by characteristic traits of its phonology. It also maintains some words that are unique to present day .Subramaniam, Folk traditionas and Songs..., p.9-10 =Jaffna Tamil= The dialect used in Jaffna is the oldest and most archaic of Tamil dialects in Sri Lanka and India. It is also very refined and considered to preserve many antique features of Old Tamil that predate TolkƒÅppiyam, the grammatical treatise of Tamil. The Jaffna Tamil dialect retained many forms of words which were used in Sangam literature such as Tirukku·πõa·∏∑ and Ku·πüuntokai. Also a large portion of settlers in Jaffna who came from South India in the past centuries were Vellalar (Mudaliar and Pillai) and this would have helped retain pure Tamil words and linguistics since Vellalars speak a classic dialect of Tamil. Jaffna Tamil dialect is not mutually intelligible with Indian Tamil dialects, though both share a diglossic \`H' variety in literary Tamil. It is frequently mistaken for Malayalam by native Indian Tamil speakers.Indrapala, K The Evolution of an ethnic identity: The Tamils of Sri Lanka, p.45 There are a number of Prakrit loans words that are unique to the Jaffna Tamil.Indrapala, K The Evolution of an ethnic identity: The Tamils of Sri Lanka, p.389 A subdialect retained by the Paraiyar people of Kayts still retains a number of archaic words and Prakrit loans not found in any other dialects of Tamil. These drummers had historically played an important role as ritual players of drums at funerals and folk temples and as heralds and traditional weavers. They also maintained the family records of their feudal lords and even practiced medicine and astrology in folk traditions Ragupathy, Tamil Social Formation in Sri Lanka: A Historical Outline, p.1 =Estate Tamil= Estate Tamil (ET) is a dialect spoken by the descendants of indentured South Indian labourers who were brought to Sri Lanka during British colonization and South Indians who migrated to Sri Lanka for better prospects. ET is often misunderstood as Indian Tamil as the people who speak this dialect can trace their ancestry back to South India but much research has not been done regarding this dialect due to the misunderstanding that there is absolutely no difference between ET and Indian Tamil.Kadurugamuwe, N. (1994). Estate Tamil: A morphosyntactic study(Unpublished doctoral dissertation). However research shows that ET is a dialect that heavily differs from Indian Tamil for multiple reasons. The ancestors of ET speakers migrated from different parts of South India and they spoke different dialects of Tamil. For example, grandmother for Pallar community was ‚Äúattay‚Äù while for Kudiyar it was ‚Äúammayi‚Äù.Wijeratne, W. M. (2009). Estate Tamil: A new variety of Tamil. 43-58. In the last century these different dialects of Indian Tamil co-existed in close proximity in the hill country and it evolved into what is currently known as Estate Tamil. Moreover there are dialectal differences within ET due to different types of language contact. Language contact between the different dialects of Indian Tamil and Sinhala after Sinhala labourers also started working in tea and rubber plantations had a considerable impact in the development of ET as a separate dialect from Indian Tamil. The geographical distance between the two dialects of Tamil, ET and Indian Tamil has also impacted the evolution of ET as a separate dialect. ET has been in Sri Lanka for over a century and as mentioned above has come into contact with a different language Sinhala. Moreover, ET has been exposed to different dialects of Tamil within Sri Lanka such as Jaffna Tamil which has also caused changes in ET. This shows that ET is indeed different from Indian Tamil. There are phonological differences between the two dialects. Out of the consonants /b/d /D/ /j /g/ are voiced stops in Indian Tamil while in ET they occasionally occur as voiceless stops in loan words. For example, ‚Äòbayam‚Äô (fear) in Indian Tamil is ‚Äúpayam‚Äù in ET. Studies have identified that there are three distinctive nasals in Indian Tamil but the phonemic differences of these nasals are slowly fading away in ET. For example ma…≥am (smell) in Indian Tamil is manam in ET. ‚Äò…≥‚Äô in ET occurs only in loan words or preceding /c/ and /…≥/ in Indian Tamil is realized as /n/ in ET. For example ‚Äòko…≥jam‚Äô (a little) in Indian Tamil is ‚Äòko…≥cam‚Äô in ET. Morphological differences can be found between Indian Tamil and ET as well. In Indian Tamil, /ooDa/ /uDaya/ and /kka/ are genitive case markers but in ET these case markers have slights variations such as /ooDa/ is /ooTa/ in ET, /uDaya/ is /uTaya/, /uTTu/ and /atu/ in ET. Thus, it is clear that ET is a different dialect from Indian Tamil as the different dialects of Indian Tamil that evolved into ET due to close proximity with each other and language and dialectal contact between ET, Sinhala and other dialects of Sri Lankan Tamil.

History EPM was first discovered in the 1960s by the American biologist Dr. Jim Rooney. The disease is considered rare, though recently, an increasing number of cases have been reported. Previous research identified the \\"barn cat\\" as the definitive host of the disease. However, since that time it has been learned that the definitive host is the opossum, while any of a number of mammals can serve as intermediate hosts in the disease's two-host life-cycle. Those with horses should not panic and kill opossums or wildlife rather keep feed covered and stalls clean. The term EPM refers to the clinical neurologic symptoms caused by the parasite, not infection itself. The majority of horses infected with S. neurona do not exhibit neurologic symptoms consistent with EPM. There are six subspecies of S. neurona which can be identified by surface antigens (SAG). Equine EPM is caused by the parasites that exhibit SAG1, SAG5, and SAG6. SAG1 and SAG5 are responsible for the majority of EPM cases in horses. Horses produce antibodies to these surface antigens. Serum antibody testing is available that measures levels of these antibodies in the blood of horses, which is helpful in diagnosing EPM in an ataxic horse. Serial blood levels are helpful in guiding treatment. In experimentally infected horses it takes 14 days from infection to positive antibody tests. 80% of horses with EPM have positive antibody tests. A negative antibody test in the presence of EPM results if testing is done before 17 days or if the horse has been treated with antiprotozoal drugs which delays antibody production. Causes Life cycle of S. neurona EPM is caused by the parasite Sarcocystis neurona. The life cycle of S. neurona is well described. In order to complete its life cycle this parasite needs two hosts, a definitive and an intermediate. In the laboratory, raccoons, cats, armadillos, skunks, and sea otters have been shown to be intermediate hosts. The opossum is the definitive host of the disease, passing the parasite through feces. Horses contract EPM from contaminated feed or water. Horses cannot pass the disease among themselves; that is, one horse cannot contract the disease from another infected horse. The horse is a dead- end, or aberrant, host of the parasite. Symptoms The most common symptoms of EPM are ataxia, general weakness with muscle spasticity. However this is not specific to EPM and is common to many other neurological disorders. Clinical signs among horses with EPM include a wide array of symptoms that may result from primary or secondary problems. Some of the signs are difficult to distinguish from other problems, such as lameness, which can be attributed to many different causes. Apparent lameness, particularly atypical lameness or slight gait asymmetry of the rear limbs are commonly caused by EPM. Focal muscle atrophy, or even generalized muscle atrophy or loss of condition may result. Secondary signs also occur with neurologic disease. Airway abnormalities, such as laryngeal hemiplegia, snoring, or airway noise of undetermined origin may result from damage to the nerves which control the throat, although this is quite uncommon. In experimentally infected horses, very early signs included loss of appetite, decreased tongue tone, facial paresis, altered mental status, generalized weakness, and lameness. It is thought that Sarcocystis neurona does not need to enter the CNS to cause disease, in some cases S. neurona has been found in the CNS but usually not. In cases where S. neurona is found in the CNS, white blood cells probably play a role in the parasite's penetration of the blood brain barrier. Treatment and prevention EPM is treatable, but irreversible damage to the nervous system is possible. It is important to identify the disease as early as possible and begin treatment with antiprotozoal drugs. There are currently three FDA approved treatments available in the US: ReBalance (sulfadiazine and pyrimethamine), Marquis (ponazuril), and Protazil (diclazuril). These drugs minimize the infection but do not kill the parasite. The use of anti- inflammatory agents such as Banamine, corticosteroids, or phenylbutazone are often used to help reduce inflammation and limit further damage to the CNS. Antioxidants, such as vitamin E may help promote the restoration of nervous tissue. Response to treatment is often variable, and treatment may be expensive. Recently, antiprotozoal treatments that kill the parasite and clear the infection have shown promise. The inflammatory component is thought responsible for the symptoms of EPM; anti inflammatory drugs that target the IL-6 pathway have been particularly effective at reversing symptoms. Control of this disease includes proper storage of hay and feed, the control of \\"barn cats\\" on the property, and prompt disposal of animal carcasses. No vaccine is available.

It is also noted for extending the naturalization process to \\"aliens of African nativity and to persons of African descent\\" while also revoking the citizenship of naturalized Chinese Americans. Wong Kim Ark case By virtue of the Fourteenth Amendment and despite the 1870 Act, the Supreme Court in United States v. Wong Kim Ark (1898) recognised U.S. birthright citizenship of an American-born child of Chinese parents who had a permanent domicile and residence in the United States, and who were there carrying on business, and were not employed in any diplomatic or official capacity under the Emperor of China. United States v. Wong Kim Ark, 169 U.S. 649 (1898). U.S. citizenship of persons born in the United States since Wong Kim Ark have been recognised, although the Supreme Court has never directly made a ruling in relation to children born to parents who are not legal residents in the United States. Legislative history The Naturalization bill was introduced by Republican Representative Noah Davis from New York in the House of Representatives as bill H.R. 2201 and Republican Senator Roscoe Conkling from New York co-sponsored the bill in the Senate. The 1870 act was passed by the 41st United States Congress and signed into law by President Ulysses S. Grant on July 14, 1870. Although the act was enacted in the United States Congress during the Reconstruction Era, it is often not noted among the group of major legislative bills passed and enacted during that time period.

Most of its thirteen songs concern or tell tragic stories of deception and death. For example, \\"Medication,\\" the album's opener, is a first-person tale: the narrator, under the strain of having an adulterous affair with a police officer's wife as well as caring for his mentally unbalanced brother, prays for his brother's death. \\"December\\" laments a man who froze to death in his car. \\"Paxil,\\" as its title suggests (referring to an anti-depressant drug), mentions medicating \\"a heart that doesn't work.\\" The title track came from a dream Jurado had that his friend David Bazan had died, and the words he would have said to comfort his widow.

It is served by the M train on weekdays, the R train at all times except nights, and the E train at night.  History  The Queens Boulevard Line was one of the first lines built by the city-owned Independent Subway System (IND), and stretches between the IND Eighth Avenue Line in Manhattan and 179th Street and Hillside Avenue in Jamaica, Queens. The Queens Boulevard Line was in part financed by a Public Works Administration (PWA) loan and grant of $25 million. One of the proposed stations would have been located at 65th Street. The first section of the line, west from Roosevelt Avenue to 50th Street, opened on August 19, 1933. trains ran local to Hudson Terminal (today's World Trade Center) in Manhattan, while the (predecessor to current G service) ran as a shuttle service between Queens Plaza and Nassau Avenue on the IND Crosstown Line.  Station layout  Southeast street stair This underground station has two side platforms and four tracks. The two center express tracks are used by the E train during daytime hours and the F train at all times. Signs to the northbound platform are on the wall instead of hanging over the staircase. The reason for this was because the original 1933 IND tile sign read \\"Jamaica and Rockaway\\", anticipating construction of a never-built system expansion. These signs remained uncovered as late as 2001.Subway Signs to Nowhere (Forgotten New York) The 1933 Manhattan-bound tile signs remain intact. The station's tile bands are Puce with a black border. Some violet replacement tiles have been placed. West of this station, the express tracks become depressed and break from the local tracks. The express tracks run underneath Northern Boulevard, while the local tracks continue under Broadway and then turn to Steinway Street before meeting up with the express trains underneath Northern and Steinway. The line was built in this fashion because Broadway and Steinway Street are too narrow to align four tracks side by side underneath them. =Exits= The full-time mezzanine is at the eastern end has three staircases to each platform and two staircases to the street, one to either eastern corner of Broadway and 65th Street. Both sides had fare controls and former booths at platform levels at the far western end, at the opposite end of the current mezzanine. They have since been sealed. Signs at the northeast exit as well as the Manhattan-bound platforms are for Rowan Street, the former name of 65th Street.

It was released on DVD on June 20, 2006 by THINKFilm, the distributor behind the documentary The Aristocrats. Synopsis Produced by Chad Sahley, the film portrays the smart yet gritty comedy of Boston, a veritable melting pot of people of very different backgrounds: the multi-ethnic working class and the hip, learned college crowd. In an interview for the film, Solomita commented that \\"Those two things right next to each other created an odd vibe - really smart people who also understand a dollar earned. The comedy just sort of percolated.\\" Along with its joyful 'insider' look at comedy (Solomita performed at the Ding Ho for 2 years in his youth), the film also explores the darker side of the scene. Cocaine, the glamor drug of choice of the 1980s, was a problem in the circles of performers and club owners. Equally bad was the cut-throat competition between the clubs themselves. One of the film's most gripping sequences is the story of Steven Wright's appearance on The Tonight Show on 6 August 1982. Apparently, Carson was so impressed with Wright that he invited him to sit down on the couch, an occurrence almost unheard of for first time guests. The event is presented as a boiling point; when the brash, rowdy, innovative Boston scene of the early 80s finally broke into the national spotlight. Features The film features original footage from two of the Boston area's most renowned comedy clubs: The Comedy Connection in Quincy Market, and the club which operated at The Ding Ho in Inman Square in Cambridge. Some of this footage was obtained via one of the film's producers, Doug Miller, who worked for Channel 5 and frequented the comedy clubs with his camera. Still other footage from the era came courtesy of DJ Hazard. Also notable are the interviews with many comics who got their start in Boston, including Kevin Meaney, Denis Leary, Steven Wright, Janeane Garofalo, Bobcat Goldthwait, Paula Poundstone, Don Gavin, Kenny Rogerson, Jimmy Tingle, Barry Crimmins, and Lenny Clarke at locations which include The Comedy Studio and The Comedy Connection.

Because the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act was repealed by the Magnuson Act in 1943, Chinese were the Asian group that benefited most from the 1945 law.

The United States Supreme Court, in Lutwak v.

It has 1,385 students in grades 9-12. The principal is Joe Williams. It is part of the Champaign Unit 4 School District school system. Its sports teams are the Central Maroons.  History  Champaign High School, now Champaign Central High School, began serving the public in 1870. The present school site, 610 W. University Avenue, was donated by J.P. White to the public schools of Champaign in 1868 and has housed Central High School since 1956. During the 1963-64 school year, due to over-crowding approximately 300 students were assigned on a half-day basis to Jefferson Middle School. These students attended three academic classes at Jefferson plus three classes at the senior high school. During the 1965-66 school year, approximately 550 sophomores attended classes in the first phase of the Senior High School Annex. They attended classes on the same schedule as those at Champaign High School. The 1966-67 school year found an equal distribution of sophomore and junior students at both Champaign Senior High School and the Annex. So in 1968-69, the Champaign Board of Education officially established two district high schools, Central and Centennial. On April 1, 1997, the taxpayers of Champaign approved a bond issue that included an addition and extensive remodeling to Central High School. The main features of the new addition and remodeling were a large modern media center, a child development/day care center, foods laboratory, an expanded student services area, and three large state of the art biological science laboratories.

It was the one and only season in which English cricket adopted the eight-ball over. It was the last season before the Second World War and it was not until 1946 that first-class cricket could resume in England on a normal basis. The West Indies were on tour and England won the Test series 1‚Äì0. The West Indian team departed early, with several matches cancelled, because of the growing international crisis. In the 1940 edition of Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, author R. C. Robertson-Glasgow reviewed the 1939 season and remarked that it was \\"like peeping through the wrong end of a telescope at a very small but happy world\\".

Three later matches versus Kent, an England XI and H. D. G. Leveson-Gower's XI were also cancelled. County Championship The 1939 County Championship was determined on an average points basis because the county teams did not all play the same number of matches, the range varying from 24 to 32. Yorkshire won the title for the third successive season, playing 30 matches with 20 wins and 2 defeats to produce a points average of 9.286. Middlesex was the runner-up with 8.182 from 26 matches with 13 wins and 3 defeats. Yorkshire were captained by Brian Sellers, whose efforts earned him a place in Wisdens \\"Five Cricketers of the Year\\". The team had five batsmen who all scored more than 1000 championship runs: Len Hutton (2167), Wilf Barber (1388), Herbert Sutcliffe (1230), Maurice Leyland (1191) and Arthur Mitchell (1087). The bowling depended on Hedley Verity (165 wickets), Ellis Robinson (102), Bill Bowes (96) and Frank Smailes (49). The wicket-keeper was Arthur Wood who completed 39 catches and 27 stumpings. Other players included Cyril Turner and future England captain Norman Yardley. Runners-up Middlesex were well served by Test batsmen Bill Edrich (1948 runs), Denis Compton (1853) and Jack Robertson (1562). Wicket-keeper Fred Price had an outstanding season with 53 catches and 20 stumpings. Middlesex relied heavily on its two main bowlers Jim Sims (142 wickets) and Jim Smith (84). Edrich and Price were recognised by Wisden as two of its \\"Five Cricketers of the Year\\". Gloucestershire finished third under England captain Wally Hammond who scored 2121 championship runs. Other good performers for Gloucestershire were batsmen Charlie Barnett, Jack Crapp and George Emmett; seam bowler Colin Scott and the outstanding spin bowler Tom Goddard who took 181 championship wickets. Noted batsmen at other counties were John Langridge (Sussex) with 2106 championship runs; Les Ames (Kent), Joe Hardstaff junior (Nottinghamshire), Arthur Fagg (Kent), Eddie Paynter (Lancashire), Harold Gimblett (Somerset) and Laurie Fishlock (Surrey) who all made more than 1700 runs. Walter Keeton of Nottinghamshire was recognised by Wisden as one of its \\"Five Cricketers of the Year\\" after he scored 312* against Middlesex, which was the highest individual score of the 1939 season and remains the highest ever made for Nottinghamshire. Noted bowlers elsewhere were Reg Perks (Worcestershire) and Doug Wright (Kent), the only others to take more than 130 championship wickets. Leading batsmen ‚Äì all first-class matches George Headley had the highest average of batsmen who played in more than a couple of matches. He scored 1745 runs @ 72.60 (HS 234*).

Those whose first-class careers ended in 1939 include Ken Farnes and Hedley Verity who were both killed in action during the war. Immediate impact of the war The season was almost over when war was declared on Sunday, 3 September and only ten first-class matches were cancelled. Four were due to begin on Saturday, 2 September but all were delayed due to the emergency and then cancelled after the declaration of war. Two earlier games involving the West Indian tourists had already been cancelled. Four remaining games, including Gentlemen v Players, were due to begin on different days during the following week and all were cancelled. The final matches played before the war were six County Championship games that began on Wednesday, 30 August and were completed on or before Friday, 1 September, the day the Wehrmacht invaded Poland. Three of these games were completed with a result on the second day. Two more were ended as draws by agreement on the Friday morning after news of the invasion was reported. The last match to be completed was Sussex v Yorkshire at Hove. From an overnight position of 330‚Äì3 in the first innings, chasing a Sussex score of 387, Yorkshire continued on the Friday morning and totalled 392 all out. Sussex collapsed in their second innings and were all out for only 33, whereupon Yorkshire made 30‚Äì1 to win by nine wickets.CricketArchive ‚Äì match scorecard. Retrieved on 4 October 2009. That ended the 1939 season and also marked the end of first-class cricket in England until the first of the Victory Tests began on 19 May 1945. The few remaining county matches were cancelled immediately and Birley comments that there was \\"none of the unfortunate disposition to linger over it as in 1914\\".Birley, p.261. Cricket in 1939 accepted the inevitable, summarised in the September 1939 issue of The Cricketer by Sir Home Gordon who found a suitable metaphor: \\"England has now begun the grim Test match against Germany\\". The Third Test was the last match played at The Oval in 1939. Soon after war was declared, the ground was requisitioned and modified for use as a prisoner-of-war camp, but no prisoners were ever held there. Lord's was prepared for a similar fate but the authorities decided against it and Lord's was able to stage many games throughout the war to raise money for charity.Birley, p.263. H. S. Altham wrote in 1940 about a visit to Lord's in December 1939 as \\"a sobering experience; there were sandbags everywhere and the Long Room was stripped bare with its treasures safely stored below ground\\". Having painted a bleak picture thus far, Altham ended on a note of defiance: \\"but the turf was a wondrous green, Old Father Time on the Grand Stand roof was gazing serenely at the nearest (barrage) balloon and one felt that somehow it would take more than totalitarian war to put an end to cricket\\".Wright, p.152.

Arp 220 is the closest Ultraluminous Infrared Galaxy (ULIRG) to Earth, at 250 million light years away. Its energy output was discovered by IRAS to be dominated by the far- infrared part of the spectrum.IRAS exposes a remarkable infrared galaxy , Physics Today, 37, part no 8, 18‚Äì20 (1984) It is often regarded as the prototypical ULIRG and has been the subject of much study as a result. Most of its energy output is thought to be the result of a massive burst of star formation, or starburst, probably triggered by the merging of two smaller galaxies. Recent (2002 and 1997) HST observations of Arp 220, taken in visible light with the ACS, and in infrared light with NICMOS, revealed more than 200 huge star clusters in the central part of the galaxy. The most massive of these clusters contains enough material to equal about 10 million suns. X-ray observations by the Chandra and XMM-Newton satellites have shown that Arp 220 probably includes an active galactic nucleus (AGN) at its core, which raises interesting questions about the link between galaxy mergers and AGN, since it is believed that galactic mergers often trigger starbursts, and may also give rise to the supermassive black holes that appear to power AGN. Luminous far- infrared objects like Arp 220 have been found in surprisingly large numbers by sky surveys of submillimetre wavelengths using instruments such as the Submillimetre Common-User Bolometer Array (SCUBA) at the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT). Arp 220 and other relatively local ULIRGs are being studied as equivalents of this kind of object. Astronomers from the Arecibo Observatory have detected organic molecules in the galaxy. Arp 220 contains at least two bright maser sources, an OH megamaser, and a water maser. In October 2011, astronomers spotted a record-breaking seven supernova all found at the same time in Arp 220. The merging of the two galaxies started around 700 million years ago.

It is a service of the University of Missouri-Kansas City, and broadcasts at 89.3 MHz with an ERP of 100,000 watts and covers a 90-mile radius in Northwestern Missouri and Northeastern Kansas. History In the spring of 1956, C.J. Stevens, then Director of Radio and TV at the University of Kansas City (forerunner of UMKC), submitted a budget request for the establishment and operation of an educational FM radio station. This request was turned down. Stevens and Sam Scott then decided to raise money outside the university and, with the approval of then President McGrath, a modest fundraising campaign was undertaken and a separate FM fund was established. KCUR-FM began broadcasting on October 21, 1957 from the third floor of Scofield Hall with a signal range of four miles, two full-time employees and a budget of $15,000 from the University. Wiring and setup of the station was done by student volunteers, including some from Rockhurst (Richard J. Allen and Gary Labowitz, who was an announcer/engineer the first two years). KCUR was the first university- licensed educational FM station in Missouri and the second FM station in Kansas City. The call letters came from the university's short name, \\"KCU.\\" In 1961, the University of Kansas City Board of Trustees decided to drop operation of KCUR from the 1962 budget along with the elimination of the intercollegiate athletic program. This was a time of financial problems for KCU, leading to its merger into the University of Missouri system a few years later. An Editorial in the Kansas City Times suggested several reasons why the university should reconsider its decision including, \\"In the community, it (KCUR) is a source of education, culture and pleasure.\\" The decision to eliminate funding for KCUR was reversed at the next meeting. In 1965 ‚Äî two years after UKC became the University of Missouri-Kansas City ‚Äî the station moved to 524 Pierce Street. The MU board approved purchase of $24,000 worth of transmitter equipment that more than doubled the station's coverage area, boosting its broadcasting power to 40,000 watts. In 1970, KCUR was awarded a grant of $7,500 from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting for Community Service. A year later, it became a charter member of NPR. In 1976, KCUR-FM moved to 5327 Holmes and the signal was expanded to 100,000 watts. In 1985, KCUR moved to its current location in the Student Services Building at 4825 Troost. Over the next few years, the public radio programming was streamlined and most of the volunteers were either eliminated from on-air responsibilities or became employees of KCUR. The station began broadcasting 24 hours a day with the BBC World Service being heard in the overnight hours. In 1992, national and local news programming was added to the broadcast schedule, eliminating classical music during the day. These changes along with more sophisticated fundraising success enabled the station to increase its listening audience and local news staff. On August 16, 2019, KCUR announced it had agreed to purchase KWJC (91.9 FM) from William Jewell College in suburban Liberty, Missouri for $2 million.https://www.kcur.org/post/kcur-plans- launch-24-hour-classical-music-station-kansas-city On July 1, 2020, KCUR completed its purchase of KWJC and signed the station on with a Classical music format.https://transition.fcc.gov/fcc-bin/fmq?call=KWJC See also * 12th Street Jump References External links * Category:NPR member stations Category:University of Missouri‚ÄìKansas City CUR Category:1957 establishments in Missouri ","title":"KCUR-FM"},{"id":"5671959","title":"I'm So Excited"},{"id":"5671974","text":"Klaus Junge (1 January 1924 at Concepci√≥n, Chile ‚Äì 17 April 1945, at Welle, Germany) was one of the youngest German chess masters. In several tournaments during the 1940s he held his own among the world's leading players. An officer in the Wehrmacht, he died during the Battle of Welle shortly before the end of World War II.  Biography  Junge was born into a German Chilean family. His father Otto was a strong chess player who won the Chilean Chess Championship in 1922. In 1928 his parents and their five sons returned to Germany. On 11‚Äì20 August 1939, he, along with Wolfgang Unzicker (14 years old), Edith Keller (17), Rudolf Kunath (15) and Karl Krbavic (17), played in F√ºrstenwalde (Jugendschachwoche) near Berlin.ChessBase.com - Chess News - Wolfgang Unzicker turns eighty In 1941, at the age of 17, Klaus Junge was considered one of the strongest players in Germany. In 1941, he won the championship of Hamburg. In May 1941, he won at Bad Elster (qualifying German championship). In August 1941, he tied for first with Paul Felix Schmidt at Bad Oeynhausen (the eighth German Championship), although he lost a playoff match against Schmidt for the title at Bromberg (+0 ‚Äì3 =1).

In 1942, he took second place, behind Walter Niephaus, at Leipzig. In April 1942, he was second, behind Carl Carls, at Rostock. In June 1942, he tied for third‚Äìfourth with Schmidt, behind Alekhine and Paul Keres, at the Salzburg 1942 chess tournament. In September, he took seventh place at the Munich (the first European Championship), won by Alekhine. In October 1942, he took second place, behind Alekhine, at Warsaw/Lublin/Krak√≥w (the third General Government championship). In December 1942, he tied for first with Alekhine at Prague (Duras Jubile√©, 60-j√§hrigen Jubil√§um).1942 In 1942‚Äì43, he played in three correspondence tournaments, beating among others Rudolf Teschner and Emil Joseph Diemer.

Mentioned as Lempira in documents written during the Spanish conquest, he is regarded by the people as a warrior hero. Etymology Jorge Lard√© y Lar√≠n argues that the name Lempira comes from the word lempira, derived from words of the Lenca language: lempa, meaning \\"lord\\" as a title of hierarchy, i meaning \\"of\\", and era, meaning \\"hill or mountain\\". Thus, Lempira, means \\"lord of the mountain\\" or \\"lord of the grass\\". When the Spaniards arrived in Cerquin, Lempira was fighting against neighboring chiefs. Because of the Spanish threat, he allied with another Lenca subgroup, the Cares, and united the different Lenca tribes. Based at Cerquin hill, he organized resistance against the Spanish troops in 1537, managing to gather an army of almost 30,000 soldiers, from 200 villages. As a result, other groups in the valleys of Comayagua and Olancho also took up arms. Spanish attempts to stop him, led by Francisco de Montejo and Alonso de C√°ceres, were unsuccessful until later in 1537. History Historical accounts of Lempira differ. Antonio de Herrera y Tordesillas, whose account was published in Historia general de los hechos de los castellanos ... (1626), in Sevilla, Spain, identifies Lempira as a war captain appointed by Entipica, leader of the Cares, a subgroup of the Lenca. Herrera reports that Lempira, whose name means something like \\"Lord of the Mountains\\" in Lenca, commanded over 30,000 soldiers from over 200 different Lenca towns. In 1537, there were widespread indigenous uprisings in Honduras, and the Cares were one group that revolted against Spanish rule. The Spaniards, on instruction from their Governor, Francisco de Montejo, attacked Lempira at the Pe√±ol de Cerqu√≠n, in what is now Lempira Department. According to Herrera, Lempira retreated to a fortified hilltop where he resisted the Spaniards for many months. Finally, the Spaniards lured him out to talk, and a concealed Spanish soldier with an arquebus shot and killed him. On seeing this, Herrera reports, the Lenca surrendered. This is essentially the official version that is taught to Honduran children in school. In the 1980s, the Honduran historian Mario Felipe Mart√≠nez Castillo discovered a very different account of Lempira in a document entitled M√©ritos y Servicios: Rodrigo Ruiz, Nueva Espa√±a, written in 1558 in Mexico City. The manuscript is located in the Archivo General de Indias in Sevilla, Spain. That document, Patronato 69 R.5, tells the story of Rodrigo Ruiz and his service in the conquest of Honduras under Francisco Montejo. It includes his account of killing Lempira. The document is in the form of a series of questions, answered by witnesses to the conquest which Rodrigo Ruiz gave to the Spanish king. It is his effort to gain a pension as payment for his services. Ruiz wrote the questions, one of which is translated in part as follows: Rodrigo Ruiz described his other service to the Spanish Crown. Witnesses to this 100-page document attested that Ruiz recounted his service accurately and told the truth. Ruiz asked for a pension of 1000 pesos for his service. The modern Honduran Lenca preserved in their oral history Lempira elements that match the Ruiz story, such as Lempira's belief that wearing Spanish clothing made him impervious to Spanish bullets, and that the chief died in combat, not through ambush. Legacy and honors In 1931, Honduras renamed its currency in honor of Lempira. In 1943, Honduras renamed the Gracias Department as the Lempira Department. Representation in other media In 1957 the Honduran writer Ram√≥n Amaya Amador wrote a novel featuring Lempira, entitled El se√±or de la sierra (The Lord of the Mountains).

It is found throughout West African and Brazilian cuisines. The dish is traditionally encountered in Brazil's northeastern state of Bahia, especially in the city of Salvador. Acaraj√© serves as both a religious offering to the gods in the Candombl√© religion and as street food. The dish was brought by enslaved peoples from West Africa, and can still be found in various forms in Nigeria, Ghana, Togo, Benin, Mali, Gambia and Sierra Leone. Acaraj√© is made from cooked and mashed cowpeas that are seasoned with salt and chopped onions molded into the shape of a large scone and deep-fried in dend√™ with a wok-like pan in front of the customers. It is served split in half and stuffed with vatap√° and caruru ‚Äì spicy pastes made from shrimp, ground cashews, palm oil and other ingredients. A vegetarian version is typically served with hot peppers and green tomatoes. Acaraj√© can also come in a second form called abara, where the ingredients are boiled instead of deep-fried. Etymology √Äk√†r√† is a generic word meaning \\"bread\\" or \\"pastry\\", or the dish itself. The Brazilian term \\"acaraj√©\\" derives from either the Yoruba word combinations \\"√†k√†r√†\\" (bread) and \\"onje\\" (food), or \\"√†kar√°\\" (a round pastry) and \\"je\\" (to eat). M√°rcio de Jagun states that the word drives from the Yoruba √†k√†r√† n'j·∫π, or \\"come and eat √†k√†r√†\\"; the phrase was used to call out to customers by women selling acaraj√© on the street.  History  Acaraj√© Akara plays a significant role in the Yoruba culture, as it was specially prepared when a person who has come of Age (70 and Above) dies. It was usually fried in large quantity and distributed across every household close to the deceased. Akara also used to be prepared in large as a sign of victory, when warriors came back victorious from war. The women, especially the wives of the Warriors were to fry Akara and distribute it to the villagers. Akara (as it is known in southwest and southeast Nigeria) a recipe taken to Brazil by the enslaved peoples from the West African coast. It is called \\"akara\\" by the Yoruba people of south-western Nigeria and by the citizens of Sierra Leone, \\"kosai\\" by the Hausa people of Nigeria or \\"koose\\" in Ghana and is a popular breakfast dish, eaten with millet or corn pudding. In Nigeria, Akara is commonly eaten with bread, ogi (or eko), a type of cornmeal made with fine corn flour. In Sierra Leone, akara is composed of rice flour, mashed banana, baking powder, and sugar. After mixed together, it is dropped in oil by hand, and fried, similar to Puff-puff. It is then formed into a ball. Akara is usually prepared for events like Pulnado (event held due to the birth of a child), a wedding, funeral, or party. No matter how big the occasion, this item is a classic in the Sierra Leonean community. =In Brazil= Baiana selling acaraj√© on the streets of Salvador, Brazil. Acaraj√© sold on the street in Brazil are variously made with fried beef, mutton, dried shrimp, pigweed, fufu osun sauce, and coconut. Today in Bahia, Brazil, most street vendors who serve acaraj√© are women, easily recognizable by their all-white cotton dresses and headscarves and caps. They first appeared in Bahia selling acaraj√© in the 19th century. Earnings from the sale of acaraj√© were used both to buy the freedom of enslaved family members until the abolition of slavery in Brazil in 1888; its sale additionally served as a source of family income. The city now has more than 500 acaraj√© vendors. The image of these women, often simply called baianas, frequently appears in artwork from the region of Bahia. Acaraj√©, however, is available outside of the state of Bahia as well, including the streets of its neighborboring state of Sergipe, and the markets of Rio de Janeiro. In Candombl√© Acaraj√© is an essential ritual food used in Afro- Brazilian religious traditions such as Candombl√©. The first acaraj√© in a Candombl√© ritual is offered to the orix√° Exu. They vary in size based on their offering to a specific deity: large, round acaraj√© are offered to Xang√¥; ones smaller in form are offered to Ians√£. Small, fritter-size acaraj√© are offered to Er√™s, or child spirits. Acaraj√© is used in Candombl√© rituals in the states of Bahia, Rio de Janeiro, Pernambuco, Alagoas, Sergipe, and Maranh√£o. It is closely related to aca√ß√°, a similar ritual food made of steamed corn mush. =Acaraj√© de azeite-doce= Acaraj√© de azeite-doce is a variety of acaraj√© fried in an oil other than palm oil; olive oil or other vegetable oils are generally used. Acaraj√© de azeite-doce is used in Candombl√© offerings to orix√°s with a ritual prohibition of the use of palm oil. This variety is found in the states of Bahia and states of Bahia and Rio de Janeiro. =Acaraj√© de Xang√¥ (Sango)= Acaraj√© de Xang√¥ (√Äk√†r√† t√≠ ·π¢ang√≥) is a variety of acaraj√© offered to the orix√° Xang√¥, known as the √≤ri·π£√† ·π¢ang√≥ in the Yoruba culture. It is made of the same ingredients as the common form but greatly elongated. This variety is found on the ritual platter of amal√° offered to Xang√¥. This variety is found in the states of Bahia and states of Bahia and Rio de Janeiro. Protected status Acaraj√© was listed as a federal immaterial asset (patrim√¥nio nacional imaterial), by the National Institute of Historic and Artistic Heritage in 2004; the role of baianas in the preparation and sale of acaraj√© was recognized in the same act. In popular culture Akara (Acaraj√©) was featured on the Netflix TV series, Street Food volume 2, which focused on Latin American Street Foods.

Barnsdall.org: Barnsdall Art ParkCity of Los Angeles Department of Recreation and Parks: Barnsdall Art Park Parking and arts buildings access is from Hollywood Boulevard on the park's north side.Barnsdall Art Park.com: Directions The park is a Los Angeles Historic- Cultural Monument, and a facility of the City of Los Angeles Department of Cultural Affairs.City of Los Angeles Department of Cultural Affairs Aline Barnsdall donated Barnsdall Park to the City of Los Angeles for arts and recreational purposes, including the preservation of the historic architecture and landscape features. Located at the crest of Olive Hill, Barnsdall Art Park overlooks the city of Los Angeles, and the Hollywood Hills, including Griffith Park. The park is centered on Barnsdall's Hollyhock House designed by architect Frank Lloyd Wright, a National Historic Landmark, Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument, UNESCO World Heritage Site, and on the National Register of Historic Places in Los Angeles. History Aline Barnsdall, a native of Bradford, Pennsylvania and heiress to an oil fortune, was led by her interest in the future of the American stage to Chicago, Illinois, where she co-directed an experimental theatre company. While in Chicago, she met the equally unconventional Frank Lloyd Wright, whose recently completed Midway Gardens she admired. A trip to California turned Barnsdall's attention to Los Angeles. In 1915 she commissioned Wright to help her develop an innovative theatrical community on the nation's western cultural frontier. Selecting a thirty-six acre site in East Hollywood known as Olive Hill, Barnsdall and Wright worked together to develop a plan that included a home for Barnsdall and her young daughter, two secondary residences, a theater, a director's house, a dormitory for actors, studios for artists, shops, and a motion picture theater. The site plan was based on the gridded spacing of the existing olive grove‚Äôs 1225 trees. In subsequent decades, the park has become popular among residents from the nearby districts. The park has a wide variety of park visitors, as it sits at the intersection of a number of Los Angeles demographic groups. =Hollyhock House= The Aline Barnsdall Residence, known as Hollyhock House, was the first Los Angeles project of Frank Lloyd Wright. Built between 1919 and 1921, it represents his earliest efforts to develop a regionally appropriate style of architecture for Southern California.Library of Congress: HABS-Historic American Buildings Survey of Barnsdall Park Taking advantage of the area's mild climate, Hollyhock House is a combination of house and gardens. It is a remarkable example of Wright's love of nature and the way he incorporated it into his designs. The house takes its name from the hollyhock blossom, the favorite flower of Aline Barnsdall. Wright's abstracted hollyhock patterns were incorporated into the decoration motif on and in the residence. Wright was often absent during the actual construction of Hollyhock House, due to the demands of a major commission, the Imperial Hotel in Tokyo, Japan. Therefore, he gave supervision of the Barnsdall project to two young Taliesin studio associates: his son Lloyd Wright, and Rudolph Schindler. They both became independently renowned architects. =Art Park= Because of financial and artistic differences, only the two secondary residences and the Barnsdall home, Hollyhock House, were finally built. In 1926, Aline Barnsdall gave Hollyhock House and eleven surrounding acres to the City of Los Angeles for use as a public park in memory of her father, Theodore Barnsdall.The Cultural Landscape Foundation: History of Barnsdall Art Park The City agreed to take the Hollywood estate, but initially did not do anything with it, likely because of Barnsdall's restrictions on how the land could be used, as well as her controversial ideals. Part of the ensuing negotiations between the City and Barnsdall included a provision that the California Art Club would be granted a fifteen- year lease (1927‚Äì1942) on Hollyhock House to use as their clubhouse. In the 1950s and 1960s additional art center buildings, including a modern theatre, an art gallery, and studios, were built on Olive Hill in the park. In the 1990s the Olive Hill restoration master plan and work was completed, including restoring the original olive groves.  Los Angeles Municipal Art Gallery The Los Angeles Municipal Art Gallery‚Äôs mission is to be responsive to the human experience. Established in 1954, the Los Angeles Municipal Art Gallery is the longest running institution in Los Angeles devoted solely to exhibiting art. The gallery focuses on artists from Los Angeles ‚Äì in particular underrepresented artists whose work may not otherwise have found a platform. Offering free admission and programs, the Los Angeles Municipal Art Gallery serves as a welcoming space for everyone, regardless of their of race, religion, national origin, ancestry, sex, sexual orientation, age, disability, domestic partner status, marital status or medical condition. = Exhibitions, Educational and Public Programs = The Gallery‚Äôs exhibitions, educational and public programs aim to inspire conversation about the contemporary issues and ideas that resonate most with the people of Los Angeles. Many local artists who have exhibited at the gallery have gone on to become fixtures of the national and international art world, including Carlos Almaraz, Eleanor Antin, John Baldessari, Mark Bradford, Vija Celmins, Harry Gamboa Jr., David Hammons, Barbara Kruger, Kerry James Marshall, Senga Nengudi, Catherine Opie, Sandy Rodriguez, Ed Ruscha, and Bruce and Norman Yonemoto. Today, the gallery continues to build on this rich legacy, operating as a site of discovery for outstanding work by the city‚Äôs most exciting artists, from recent graduates to practitioners with years of experience. The programs at the Los Angeles Municipal Art Gallery (LAMAG) act as a gateway for learning. The gallery‚Äôs goal is to inspire new ways for our visitors to see, experience and connect with one another and with the broader world. As a site of engagement for Los Angeles‚Äô diverse communities, LAMAG serves as a resource to examine and unpack the nuances of the city through contemporary art. LAMAG offers our communities a space for more intimate conversations through a wide range of education programs that include: LAMAGLearn LAMAGLearn encompasses public programs such as artist talks, events, performances and symposiums that bring communities together to listen, learn and discuss issues of importance in our city.

The union merged with the Teamsters in 1973. Early history The union was founded in 1886 as the National Union of United Brewery Workmen. The union's members were almost entirely Germans, and from 1886 to 1903 the union's convention and publications were in German. The union affiliated with the American Federation of Labor (AFL) in 1887. The Brewery Workers were given a very wide jurisdictional charter by the AFL, making it one of the first industrial unions in the U.S. In 1903, the union changed its name to the International Union of United Brewery Workmen of America. In 1917, the union changed its name to the International Union of United Brewery and Soft Drink Workers of America. Three years later it changed its name yet again, this time to the International Union of United Brewery, Flour, Cereal and Soft Drink Workers of America. Union jurisdiction The Brewery Workers had a tumultuous relationship with the AFL. The union engaged in numerous jurisdictional disputes with unions representing firemen (boiler operators), teamsters and engineers from 1896 to 1907. In 1907, the AFL revoked the Brewery Workers' union charter. But a firestorm of protest from local unions around the country led the AFL to reinstate the charter in 1909, albeit with a number of limitations on the union's ability to organize workers outside of its newly narrowed jurisdiction. Prohibition in the United States significantly weakened the union beginning in 1920. The union recovered some after the repeal of Prohibition in 1933, but jurisdictional disputes with the Teamsters dramatically hindered new member organizing and drained the union's finances. In 1939, the Brewery Workers filed a charge with the AFL which alleged that the Teamsters were infringing on the use of the term \\"Brewery Workers.\\" AFL president William Green sided with the Teamsters, however. In 1941, Green revoked the Brewery Workers' union charter again. The Brewery Workers and Teamsters continued to fight over potential members as well as raiding one another. The Brewery Workers affiliated with the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) in 1946. The same year, the union changed its name to the International Union of United Brewery, Flour, Cereal, Soft Drink, and Distillery Workers of America. The union fought a violent series of jurisdictional battles with the Teamsters in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, known as the \\"Pittsburgh beer war\\". The series of strikes, pickets, street battles and lawsuits ended on April 2, 1947, but was so violent and protracted that it led to a congressional investigation. The Brewery Workers joined the new AFL- CIO when the AFL and CIO merged in 1955. The Brewery Workers continued to lose members in the 1950s and 1960s. Its battles with the Teamsters continued, costing it members and resources. But many local breweries also began closing, as large national brewers such as Anheuser-Busch expanded rapidly and either pushed them out of business or acquired them. Teamster merger In 1973, the Brewery Workers voted to merge with the Teamsters, and on October 19 were expelled from the AFL-CIO (to which the Teamsters did not at that time belong, having been expelled for corruption).Milwaukee's Local 9, the largest in the union, objected to the merger and voted 2,447 to 27 to leave the Brewery Workers and affiliate directly with the AFL-CIO,\\"Brewery Local Quits Parent Body\\" Milwaukee Journal October 22, 1973; Local News p. 1, col. 5\\"Brewery Local Switches Unions\\" Milwaukee Sentinel October 22, 1973; p. 5, col. 5 as did 26 other locals totaling about one-quarter of the union.\\"Teamsters Lose Bid at Breweries\\" Milwaukee Journal January 4, 1974; Accent section p. 3, col. 4 The Milwaukee local eventually affiliated with the United Auto Workers.Christopulos, Mike. \\"Pabst stands firm, sees no room for negotiations.\\" Milwaukee Sentinel June 5, 1984; p. 5, col. 1 The remainder of the union became the Brewery and Soft Drink Workers Conference of the Teamsters union.

The law imposed sanctions against South Africa and stated five preconditions for lifting the sanctions that would essentially end the system of apartheid, which the latter was under at the time. Most of the sanctions were repealed in July 1991, after South Africa took steps towards meeting the preconditions of the act, with the final vestiges of the act being repealed in November 1993. Legislative history =Initial introduction in 1972= Sponsored by Senator William Roth, the CAAA was the first United States anti-apartheid legislation. The act was initiated by Congressman Ronald V. Dellums in reaction to the plight of blacks in South Africa and demanded the end of apartheid. The legislation aimed to ban all new U.S. trade and investment in South Africa and would be a catalyst for similar sanctions in Europe and Japan. Direct air links were also banned, including South African Airways flights to U.S. airports. The act also required various U.S. departments and agencies to suppress funds and assistance to the then pro- apartheid government. =Initial attempt at passage in 1985= Democrats in the Senate initially tried to pass the Anti-Apartheid Act in September 1985, but could not overcome a Republican filibuster. President Ronald Reagan viewed the act as an intrusion on his authority to conduct foreign policy and issued his own set of sanctions, but Democrats considered them to be \\"watered down and ineffective.\\" =Passage in the House and Senate in 1986= The bill was re-introduced in 1986 and brought up for a vote despite Republican efforts to block it to give Reagan's sanctions time to work. It initially passed unexpectedly in the House in June 1986 after Republicans agreed to a voice vote in the hope that the bill would die later on in the process, thus ending any possibility of sanctions. Reagan publicly opposed the bill In August 1986, the Senate passed a version of the Anti-Apartheid Act with weaker sanctions by a margin of 84‚Äì14. Democratic leaders in the House agreed to accept the weaker Senate version of the bill for it to have sufficient bipartisan support to avert a possible veto. =Veto by President Reagan= Reagan vetoed the compromised bill on September 26, calling it \\"economic warfare\\" and alleging that it would mostly hurt the impoverished black majority and lead to more civil strife. He again offered to impose sanctions via executive order, while also working with Senate Republicans on concessions to avoid them overriding his veto. Reagan's veto was attacked harshly by anti-Apartheid leaders like Desmond Tutu who said Reagan would be \\"judged harshly by history\\". In the week leading up to the subsequent vote, President Reagan enlisted South African foreign minister Pik Botha to call Republicans on the fence, though this was seen to backfire. =Veto override= Republican Senator Richard Lugar (R-IN), then chair of the Foreign Relations Committee, led the charge to override the veto, turning against a president that he had typically supported. Despite denunciations from his fellow Republicans, Lugar declared on the Senate floor, \\"We are against tyranny, and tyranny is in South Africa!\\" Reagan's veto was eventually overridden by Congress (by the Senate 78 to 21, the House by 313 to 83) on October 2. In the House vote, taken on September 29, 1986, 232 Democrats and 81 Republicans voted to override the President's veto while 4 Democrats and 79 Republicans voted to sustain the President's veto. In the Senate vote, all 47 Democrats were joined by 31 Republicans to override the President's veto while 21 Republicans voted to sustain the President's veto. This override marked the first time in the twentieth century that a president had a foreign policy veto overridden. Apartheid opponents in the United States and South Africa applauded the vote, while critics argued that it would be either ineffectual or lead to more violence. President Reagan made the following statement after the override: The override was seen as a major defeat for Reagan, coming at the hands of his fellow Republicans in Congress. It was subsequently revealed that there was significant debate within the White House between Reagan's political advisors advocating more compromise and those like Pat Buchanan and Donald Regan who supported Reagan's hard line against sanctions. Impact After two years of sanctions under President Reagan, the head of South Africa's central bank argued that the nation had adjusted to financial sanctions. In 1989, the General Accounting Office said in a report that the sanctions against South Africa had been only partially enforced by the Reagan administration. In 1989, the newly elected President George Bush committed to \\"full enforcement\\" of the Anti-Apartheid Act, a departure from the Reagan administration's policy. In 1990 and 1991, South African President F. W. de Klerk made steps towards meeting the preconditions of the Anti-Apartheid Act. In 1991, following de Klerk's repeal of Apartheid laws and the release of Nelson Mandela and other (though not all) political prisoners, President Bush issued an executive order lifting virtually all bans against doing business with South Africa. The degree to which the sanctions were responsible for ending apartheid was a matter of debate as those opposed to the sanctions argue that the South African economy was already struggling before the sanctions were enforced and that it was the political process on the ground that led to the changes. Despite the repeal of most of the sanctions imposed by this act, many companies were still restricted by laws within individual states and cities in the United States that imposed sanctions. In September 1993, Nelson Mandela called for these sanctions to be removed as well and for investment to return to a still-struggling South Africa. The last of the sanctions stemming from this act was repealed in November 1993. Declaration of the Act The Anti-Apartheid Act of 1986 was drafted as six titles establishing United States policy towards the government of South Africa with emphasis on the economic, political, and social jurisdictions in South Africa. The Act of Congress is codified in Title 22 within Chapter 60 entitled Anti-Apartheid Program sections five thousand and one through five thousand one hundred and seventeen. The anti-apartheid legislation was repealed by the United States Congress during November 23, 1993 and October 1, 1995. =Title I ‚Äì Policy of the United States With Respect To Ending Apartheid= :Sec. 101.

Background Bliley was born on January 28, 1932, in Chesterfield County, Virginia. He attended private Catholic schools and graduated in 1948 at the age of 16 from Benedictine High School (Richmond, Virginia). In 1952, Bliley earned a B.A. in Political Science from Georgetown University in Washington, D.C.. He subsequently served as a lieutenant in the U.S. Navy from 1952 to 1955. He worked as a funeral director for Joseph W. Bliley Co. Funeral Home, a family business, eventually serving as President. Bliley, a practicing Roman Catholic, is married to the former Mary Virginia Kelley and is the father of two. He has five grandchildren, 2 granddaughters, 2 grandsons and 1 step- grandson, two great-grandsons and one great-granddaughter. Political career In 1968, Bliley was elected vice-mayor of Richmond. He held that post until 1970, when he successfully ran for mayor, a position he held until 1977. Bliley grew up as a conservative Southern Democrat, but became a Republican after his term as mayor. In 1980, Bliley won the Republican nomination for Congress representing Virginia's 3rd congressional district after 12-year incumbent David Satterfield announced his retirement. He won with 52 percent of the vote, becoming the first Republican to win an undisputed victory in the district since Reconstruction. (In 1890, the House awarded Republican Edmund Waddill the seat after a disputed election.) The 3rd, however, had been trending Republican for some time at the national level. It had been one of the first areas of Virginia where the old Byrd Democrats started splitting their tickets and voting Republican in presidential elections. As a result, it had not supported a Democrat for president since 1948, and had actually come close to electing a Republican twice in the 1960s, with the Democrats only surviving by less than 1,000 votes. Bliley would never face another contest anywhere near as close as his first one. He was reelected five times from the 3rd with little difficulty, only facing an independent in 1984 and running completely unopposed in 1988. After the 1990 census, the Democratic-controlled Virginia General Assembly began the process of redistricting the state. It was faced with a Justice Department order to create a majority-black district in order to comply with the Voting Rights Act. The legislature responded by shifting most of Richmond, which by this time had a black majority, into a new, majority-black 3rd district. Bliley's district was renumbered the 7th, and retained most of the whiter and wealthier sections of Richmond, along with several suburbs. Bliley now represented the most Republican district in Virginia, and he was handily reelected to four more terms, retiring in January 2001.

This book was part of an ongoing series of novels and novellas by Charteris featuring the adventures of his Robin Hood-inspired crimefighter, Simon Templar, alias The Saint. Wanted for Murder holds an unusual place in the Charteris canon as this book featured the first American publication of the stories contained within the books Featuring the Saint and Alias the Saint, which were published in the United Kingdom earlier in 1931 by Hodder and Stoughton. In most cases, The Crime Club, an imprint of Doubleday, simply published American editions of the Saint books (occasionally retitled), but this was the first -- and only -- occasion on which The Crime Club chose not to publish two of Charteris' books, instead deciding to combine them into an American-only omnibus release. The book was later republished by Sun Dial Press in 1943 and retitled The Saint - Wanted for Murder; Avon Books also published a pulp paperback edition. In the 1950s, an American edition of Alias the Saint appeared in paperback, however this book (subtitled \\"excerpts from Wanted for Murder\\") contained only two stories‚Äîone from Alias the Saint and one from Featuring the Saint. Complete US editions of the two books did not appear until the early 1960s; once again, these books were promoted as featuring \\"excerpts from Wanted for Murder\\".

The Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) was founded in 1968, by Fathi Arafat, Yasser Arafat's brother. It is a humanitarian organization that is part of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement. It provides hospitals, emergency medicine and ambulance services, and primary health care centers in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Its headquarters is in Ramallah, near Jerusalem. Ambulance services The PRCS provides the majority of ambulance services in the territories, such as providing emergency medical and relief services to Palestinians as mandated in 1996 by then PLO leader Yasser Arafat. Ambulance services are provided by 41 stations and substations, 22 mobile field posts, 122 ambulances, 346 Emergency Medical Technicians (EMTs) and over 500 volunteers. 1996 also saw the foundation of the Emergency Medical Institute, which trains staff and EMTs in accordance with international standards. Furthermore, the PRCS has been instrumental in the establishment of the national emergency number (101). Special problems Palestinian Red Crescent ambulance at Israeli checkpoint Conflict between Israelis and Palestinians has created some special issues for service delivery. Israeli authorities have required Palestinian ambulances to undergo a through search when passing through checkpoints, delaying patient care with significant negative outcomes. For example, between the years 2000 and 2007, it was estimated that 16% of pregnant women had to wait at checkpoints for periods exceeding 2 hours, resulting in 68 women giving birth at checkpoints, 35 instances of miscarriage, and 5 maternal deaths in a 7 year period.UNFPA - Checkpoints Compound the Risks of Childbirth for Palestinian Women 15 May 2007 According to Israeli sources, this policy is the result of Palestinian organizations using ambulances to transport terrorists and armament during the second intifada, making it necessary to inspect Palestinian ambulances regardless of the seriousness of the patient's condition.WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION FIFTY-SIXTH WORLD HEALTH ASSEMBLY A56/INF.DOC./6 Provisional agenda item 19 16 May 2003 14. According to the Israeli Ministry of Health, \\"There have been several proven cases of misuse of Palestinian ambulances to transport ammunition or explosive belts or to transfer terrorists.\\"WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION FIFTY-SIXTH WORLD HEALTH ASSEMBLY A56/INF.DOC./6 Provisional agenda item 19 16 May 2003 #35. According to the Israeli Ministry of Health, \\"The Red Crescent closely cooperated with the MDA until April 2002. At that time, the IDF found that Red Crescent ambulances were being used to carry terrorists. The Red Crescent personnel involved in this violation were interrogated..\\". Israel made similar claims during the 2008‚Äì2009 Gaza War; however, Amnesty International denies that Hamas had systematically used medical facilities, vehicles and uniforms as a cover, stating that no evidence had been provided proving such actions. Further, Magen David Adom's submission to the UN Mission investigating the war stated that, \\"there was no use of PRCS ambulances for the transport of weapons or ammunition ... [and] there was no misuse of the emblem by PRCS.\\"Report of the United Nations Fact Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict, 2009, p. 144. According to the PRCS, Israeli Defense Force personnel on the ground and in aircraft have deliberately targeted Palestinian ambulances, and prevented or impeded them from carrying out their duties, in violation of international humanitarian law. In 2003, for example, the PRCS reported that seven staff members were injured and 12 ambulances were damaged in attacks by Israeli settlers and the IDF, and PRCS ambulances were denied or delayed access to areas on 584 different occasions.

Early life and education Hodgson was the fourth and youngest child of Henry Bernard Hodgson, the first Bishop of Saint Edmundsbury and Ipswich. He was born at Thornbury, near Bristol, but the family soon moved to Berwick-upon-Tweed. He entered into The School House of Durham School in September 1905 on a King's Scholarship. He steered in the second crew in 1907; was in the XI, 1910, 1911; and in the XV, 1910. He won the Steeplechase in 1909 and 1911.

Pay-walled. First World War Known as \\"Smiler\\" to his friends, he volunteered for the British Army on the outbreak of the First World War in 1914 and served in the 9th Battalion of the Devonshire Regiment. For the first year of the War he was training in England, before landing at Le Havre on 28 July 1915 and being sent to trenches near Festubert. His first major offensive came on 25 September during the Battle of Loos. He was mentioned in despatches and awarded the Military Cross for holding a captured trench for 36 hours without reinforcements or supplies during the battle and he was subsequently promoted to lieutenant. Having returned to England after the Battle of Loos, he was positioned with his Battalion in the front line trenches at Fricourt in February 1916, before moving a kilometre or so to the trenches opposite the town of Mametz in April. The trench was named Mansell Copse, as it was in a group of trees. He was killed on the first day of the Battle of the Somme when attacking German trenches near Mametz. He was bombing officer for his battalion during the attack, and was killed by a machine gun positioned at a shrine whilst taking grenades to the men in the newly captured trenches. The bullet went through his neck, killing him instantly. His servant was found next to him after the offensive had ended. He is buried in Grave 3, Row 'A' at Devonshire Cemetery in Mansell Copse.ODNB entry.CWGC: W.N.Hodgson Writings Although he had been writing poetry since at least 1913, he started publishing stories and poems in periodicals at the beginning of 1916, under the pen name Edward Melbourne. Hodgson's posthumous volume Verse and Prose in Peace and War, published in London by Murray in 1917, ran into three editions. He is probably best remembered today for his poem 'Before Action', which was published two days before he died. It is a commonly held belief that the poem was written with the premonition of his death, from his knowledge of the German machine gun positions; the last line is \\"Help me to die, O Lord\\". =\\"Before Action\\"= By all the glories of the day And the cool evening's benison By that last sunset touch that lay Upon the hills when day was done, By beauty lavishly outpoured And blessings carelessly received, By all the days that I have lived Make me a soldier, Lord.

It is the family seat of the Okeover family, who have been in residence since the reign of William Rufus. The house lies close to the border between Staffordshire and Derbyshire, which lies on the far side of the small River Dove. The Hall is not open to the public. The house and manor church (14th century, restored by Sir George Gilbert Scott) were pillaged by the Jacobite forces as they marched south to Swarkstone Bridge in 1745. In 1745‚Äì47, Leak Okeover had the old hall enlarged to Palladian designs by a London carpenter and joiner, Joseph Sanderson, a cousin of John Sanderson, the architect. The house is a testament to the high level of education and competence that might be elicited from a well-trained Georgian craftsman. The Georgian east wing is the oldest part of the house dating from 1745‚Äì46. A north wing was demolished in the early 19th century. The south and west wings were rebuilt 1953‚Äì60 to a sensitive Neo-Georgian design by Marshall Sisson. Stables at right angles to the house form a separate nine-bay range with a central pediment on Doric pilasters over three rusticated arches and are separately listed as Grade II. Heritage Gateway; architectural description of listed building, Okeover Hall Stables A feature of the house is the Grade II* wrought iron inner gateway (1756) with armorial overthrow, by master smith Benjamin Yates, a pupil of Robert Bakewell, and the outer gates, also Grade II*, by Bakewell himself. In 1887, the Hon. Maud Okeover married Sir Andrew Barclay Walker, a successful brewer of Gateacre, Liverpool (see Walker-Okeover baronets), who in 1884 had purchased Osmaston Manor in nearby Derbyshire. His son, Sir Peter Walker, the 2nd Baronet, married Ethel Okeover in 1899. Sir Ian Walker, the 3rd Baronet, inherited Okeover in 1956 and assumed the name of Walker-Okeover, demolished Osmaston Manor in 1964, and moved the family seat back to Okeover. The estate is currently owned by Sir Andrew Walker-Okeover, 5th Baronet. Several members of the family have served as High Sheriff of Staffordshire and of Derbyshire.

It is also known by its nickname, \\"Queen Bee\\". Development The PLA began to search for a successor for the Type 78 in the 1990s. The older, 1950s-era equipment began to show its age. The Type 98 was revealed with a garrison unit in Macao in 1999, while some elite units began to receive the weapon after 2000. The design makes the accurate delivery of a 120 mm multi-purpose high-explosive or high-explosive anti-tank projectile with negligible recoil possible. The weapon can be tripod- or shoulder-fired. Launcher The reusable tube launcher is fibreglass-wrapped and weighs under 10 kg. Two variants are available; both are equipped with night vision. The reaction time (from acquiring the target to firing) is about 10 seconds. Starting from 1999, the PLA deployed PF98 to both Company and Battalion units for direct and indirect infantry fire support. The fire-control of the battalion version Type 98 consists of an optical sight with night vision channel (500 m range), a fire-control computer, a laser range-finder and an LED display. The system can automatically find the distance and make the ballistic calculations which are then displayed on the LED screen for the gunner. This reduces the reaction time and makes for increased accuracy. The company version Type 98 is fitted with an x4 telescopic optical sight with a night vision channel (300 m range). A computer calculates the lead of moving targets and put a light spot in the gunner‚Äôs optical sight to assist in aiming the device. The tripod of the battalion version allows an elevation of +30¬∞ to ‚àí6¬∞ around 360¬∞. The weapon is manually operated by 1‚Äì2 soldiers. The company version has a small fixed tripod to support the launcher when it is used in lower firing position. In late 2018, the lightweight PF-98A was deployed for infantry use on a squad level. The launcher's firing tube, tripod and carrying handle are modified to reduce weight significantly. Projectiles The HEAT (High Explosive Anti Tank) projectile is armed with a double (tandem) warhead and an electronically timed fuse. The round can pierce the reactive armor of a main battle tank, and has an armour-piercing depth of about 800 mm RHA (under 90 degrees) at a maximum range of 800 m. The multipurpose high explosive round has a warhead with 120 steel balls and incendiary material. This round is capable of piercing 400 mm armor (under 55 degrees). Due to the fragmented nature, it kills the crew inside, or produces fragments to kill other personnel within 25 m of the point of impact. The maximum range is 1,800‚Äì2,000 m.

It is a typical food of Salvador, Bahia and it is also common to the North and Northeast regions of Brazil. In the northeastern state of Bahia it is commonly eaten with acaraj√©, and as a ritual offering in Candombl√©, with aca√ß√° or acaraj√©. Vatap√° is often eaten with white rice in other regions of Brazil. The shrimp can be replaced with ground tuna, chicken or cod among other options. Etymology \\"Vatap√°\\" is probably derived from the term Yoruba vata'pa.CUNHA, A. G. Dicion√°rio etimol√≥gico Nova Fronteira da l√≠ngua portuguesa. Rio de Janeiro. Nova Fronteira. p. 812. In Hausa, as well as Yoruba, the collocantion wa ta ba can be found, which means in both languages for her. Origin Vatap√° is of African origin, and arrived in Brazil through the Yoruba people with the name of ehba-t√°pa. It is a typical dish of the northeastern cuisine and very traditional in the state of Bahia, where palm oil is an ingredient and the dish is frequently served with caruru. It is also popular in Amazonas, in Amap√° and Par√°, where the recipe suffers variations such as the absence of peanuts and other common ingredients in the traditional version. Vatap√° shows the influence of African cuisine brought by the Africans enslaved in slave ships starting in the 16th century. With the ingredients found in this new land and the need to supplement their food diet, they developed other dishes, which became typical of Brazilian cuisine.

It was formed in 1931 and has a membership of 61,000. The NSWNMA is affiliated with UnionsNSW and ACTU, and in 1988 signed a \\"harmonisation\\" agreement with the Australian Nursing Federation (ANF) which recognizes eligible members of the NSWNMA as members of the New South Wales Branch of the ANF.

The teleplay was credited to Jackson Gillis from a story by Rod Serling. The film was originally developed by Irwin Allen as a remake of the 1960s series The Time Tunnel which ran only one season. Due to litigation the pilot did not sell and was repackaged as an ABC Movie of the Week. Charles Willard Byrd claimed that the story was based heavily on his unpublished 1959 book A Time To Live. Byrd and the producers reached a settlement that included modest monetary compensation and allowed Byrd to claim the original story as his work, although the title sequence was not reshot to reflect this. Plot During a Mardi Gras parade in New Orleans, a girl becomes the latest victim of the deadly virus \\"XB\\". Dr. Clinton Earnshaw (Sam Groom) has been following the outbreak but only is able to diagnose it. The federal government assigns him Jeff Adams (Tom Hallick), who has no medical or scientific training. Though Earnshaw is initially bemused by the assignment, Adams' value emerges when he remembers the 19th century discovery of a virus with similar characteristics. Known at the time as \\"Wood's Fever\\", it was discovered by Dr. Joshua P. Henderson (Richard Basehart). Both men know that Henderson's notes were destroyed in the 1871 Great Chicago Fire, his only remaining artifact a gold pocket watch. Adams introduces Earnshaw to a former NASA physicist and Nobel laureate, Dr. Amos Cummings (Booth Colman), and his colleague Dr. Helen Sanders (Francine York). The physicists have been experimenting with time travel and reveal their plan to send Earnshaw and Adams back in time to find Henderson's cure for Wood's Fever. After being outfitted with period gear, clothing, a small microscope and portable centrifuge, Earnshaw and Adams are briefed on the dangers of time travel. They step through a vault-like door into a room with a view of endless cloud-filled sky, and the process begins. On arrival, they discover that the machine has placed them a day and a half later than expected in the center of Chicago, instead of near Henderson's home outside the city with three days to achieve their goal. Posing as doctors sent from Washington, DC, they find Henderson at his hospital and ask him about his success with the virus. Henderson confesses that he does not know why his patients are surviving. His treatment involves palliative drugs washed down with homemade elderberry wine. Adams and Earnshaw perform their own tests on Henderson's patients, but are equally baffled by their recovery. While trying to obtain a blood sample from one of the survivors, Adams initially thinks he's killed the man but discovers that he had not been cured and would have died anyway. Their mission is further complicated when Earnshaw and Henderson's niece, Jane (Trish Stewart), fall in love. Earnshaw contracts the virus while working with Henderson's patients. When the Great Fire breaks out, the travelers are no closer to the cure. Adams decides to take all of Henderson's paperwork and return to the future, but he is interrupted when a suspicious assistant enters the room. The assistant holds a telegram from Washington, responding to Henderson's cable of thanks with the information that Adams and Earnshaw were not sent by the government. Earnshaw realizes a substance in Henderson's homemade wine is the cure; the only patients who succumbed were those who refused to take alcohol. The race is on to recover the last bottle of wine. They show Henderson the futuristic microscope and centrifuge and recite the inscription inside his pocket watch, convincing him that they are from the future. Despite knowing their fate, the Hendersons remain at the hospital with a trapped patient and perish in an explosion. The travelers return to the departure point with the wine just in time. In 1976, Henderson's wine saves Earnshaw and also the girl stricken during Mardi Gras. After the success of their mission, Adams and Earnshaw visit the graves of Henderson and his niece in Chicago. They place a letter of thanks from the President on Henderson's grave. Earnshaw admits that in loving Jane he \\"fell in love with history\\".

Born the youngest of 23 children in Archibald Patch, Lackawanna County, Pennsylvania, he nonetheless matriculated at the University of Chicago. He became a St. Louis union leader of Warehousemen, when St. Louis was America's fifth largest entrepot because of its situation on the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers, and a major rail hub. The Warehousemen and Department Store Worker merged into United Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Employees of America, and that local union merged into Teamsters Local 688 in St. Louis. The International Brotherhood of Teamsters was the third of three international trade union vice presidencies he held. He was also a vice president of the teachers' union and the AF of L. He was a delegate to Democratic National Convention from Missouri in 1952. He was vice-president of the Alliance for Labor Action to promote social concerns and to organize the unorganized. He was a member of the American Civil Liberties Union and NAACP. The St. Louis union was considered to be one of the most progressive in the United States. It initiated health care centers for members, vacation centers at Lake of the Ozarks, and militated for good pension plans for its members.R.

Accessed 2013-05-19. For a time, Gibbons was widely considered to be the heir apparent to Jimmy Hoffa. But Gibbons' work and political stances landed him on the master list of Nixon political opponents. Nixon's Chief Counsel, Charles Colson, directed White House Counsel John Dean to initiate tax audits on Gibbons, but Dean did not follow through.The Senate Watergate Report, 1974, p.218 Gibbons' opposition to the Vietnam War led to Hoffa moving to marginalize him. Hoffa supported the war, while Gibbons had been a founder of Labor for Peace, and had visited Hanoi.Rhodri Jeffreys-Jones, Peace Now: American Society and the ending of the Vietnam War, 1999, Yale University Press, p.215 Another source of friction was Bobby Kennedy, who had hounded Hoffa, and whom Gibbons had befriended. While Gibbons remained head of the Teamsters in St. Louis, he was maneuvered out of posts in which he could influence policy. Gibbons died, from complications of a ruptured aortic aneurysm, in Los Angeles, California, November, 17. 1982. Interment was at Memorial Park Cemetery, St. Louis, Missouri. The site of the original Sportsman's Park baseball stadium in St. Louis, now a neighborhood playground, was named \\"Harold J. Gibbons Field\\" for him. Gibbons' papers are in the archives of Southern Illinois University-Edwardsville which he was instrumental in founding, because Illinois union members who wished to pursue higher education had to make exhausting commutes to attend university in Carbondale.

The reservoir was formed in 1969 by the construction of a dam to provide a cooling pond for a series of power plants, called the Calaveras Power Station, to supply additional electricity to the city of San Antonio. The dam and lake are managed by CPS Energy of San Antonio. Together with the smaller Victor Braunig Lake, Calaveras Lake was one of the first projects in the nation to use treated wastewater for power plant cooling. The reservoir is partly filled with wastewater that has undergone both primary and secondary treatment at a San Antonio Water System treatment plant. Calaveras Lake also serves as a venue for recreation, including fishing and boating. Sailboats are prohibited on the lake. The Calaveras Power Station is a prominent feature on the shore of Calaveras Lake. Fish and plant life Calaveras Lake has been stocked with many species of fish for recreational fishing. Fish present in Calaveras Lake include red drum, hybrid striped bass, catfish, largemouth bass. Recreational uses Thousand Trails Management Services operates the 147 acre (57 ha) public facility under contract with CPS Energy at the lake. The lake features facilities for camping, picknicking, fishing, boating, and hiking. In popular culture Calaveras Lake is the setting of one of the culminating scenes in the 1996 film Courage Under Fire, during which Matt Damon's character reveals his knowledge of the truth regarding the death of the character of Captain Karen Walden, the investigation of which constitutes the subject of the film up to that point.

This colourless liquid is an important reagent in organic chemistry. It is available commercially as a solution in hexanes, heptane, or toluene, or as a pure liquid. Synthesis Edward Frankland first reported the compound in 1848 from zinc and ethyl iodide, the first organozinc compound discovered. He improved the synthesis by using diethyl mercury as starting material. The contemporary synthesis consists of the reaction of a 1:1 mixture of ethyl iodide and ethyl bromide with a zinc-copper couple, a source of reactive zinc. Structure The compound crystallizes in a tetragonal body-centered unit cell of space group symmetry I41md. In the solid-state diethylzinc shows nearly linear Zn centres. The Zn-C bonds measure 194.8(5) pm, while the C-Zn-C angle is slightly bent with 176.2(4)¬∞. The structure of the gas-phase shows a very similar Zn-C distance (195.0(2) pm). Uses Despite its highly pyrophoric nature, diethylzinc is an important chemical reagent. It is used in organic synthesis as a source of the ethyl carbanion in addition reactions to carbonyl groups. For example, the asymmetric addition of an ethyl group to benzaldehyde and imines. Additionally, it is commonly used in combination with diiodomethane as a Simmons-Smith reagent to convert alkenes into cyclopropyl groups. It is less nucleophilic than related alkyllithium and Grignard reagents, so it may be used when a \\"softer\\" nucleophile is needed. It is also used extensively in materials science chemistry as a zinc source in the synthesis of nanoparticles. Particularly in the formation of the zinc sulfide shell for core/shell-type quantum dots. While in polymer chemistry, it can be used as part of the catalyst for a chain shuttling polymerization reaction, whereby it participates in living polymerization. Diethylzinc is not limited to only being used in chemistry. Because of its high reactivity toward air, it was used in small quantities as a hypergolic or \\"self igniting\\" liquid rocket fuel‚Äîit ignites on contact with oxidizer, so the rocket motor need only contain a pump, without a spark source for ignition. Diethylzinc was also investigated by the United States Library of Congress as a potential means of mass deacidification of books printed on wood pulp paper. Diethylzinc vapour would, in theory, neutralize acid residues in the paper, leaving slightly alkaline zinc oxide residues. Although initial results were promising, the project was abandoned. A variety of adverse results prevented the method's adoption. Most infamously, the final prototype suffered damage in a series of explosions from contact between trace amounts of diethylzinc and water vapor in the chamber. This led the authors of the study to humorously comment: In microelectronics, diethylzinc is used as a doping agent. For corrosion protection in nuclear reactors of the Light Water Reactor design, depleted zinc oxide is produced by first passing diethylzinc through an enrichment centrifuge. The pyrophoricity of diethylzinc can be used to test the inert atmosphere inside a glovebox. An oxygen concentration of only a few parts per million will cause a bottle of diethylzinc to fume when opened. Safety Diethylzinc reacts violently with water and easily ignites upon contact with air. It should therefore be handled using inert atmosphere techniques.

Kitson (September 11, 1869 ‚Äì April 14, 1930) was an American baseball pitcher. A native of Michigan, Kitson played 10 seasons in Major League Baseball with the Baltimore Orioles (1898‚Äì1899), Brooklyn Superbas (1900‚Äì1902), Detroit Tigers (1903‚Äì1905), Washington Senators (1906‚Äì1907), and New York Highlanders (1907). Kitson helped lead the 1900 Brooklyn Superbas to the National League pennant. He had 22 wins in 1899 and won at least 15 games five consecutive years from 1899 to 1903. He compiled a career record of 128‚Äì117 with a 3.18 earned run average (ERA) and 729 strikeouts. He appeared in 304 games and threw complete games in 211. Early years Kitson was born in 1869 at Hopkins, Michigan. Professional baseball player =Minor leagues= The first record of Kitson's professional baseball career is in 1895 when he played for the Grand Rapids Gold Bugs in the Western League. He played in the Virginia League in 1896 and then in 1897 for the Burlington Colts of the Western Association. He compiled a 14‚Äì17 record for Burlington. =Baltimore and Brooklyn= In August 1897, the Baltimore Orioles purchased Kitson from Burlington. Ned Hanlon, manager of the Orioles, later recalled that he arranged the purchase of Kitson without having seen him. Interviewed in 1900, Hanlon recalled: \\"I'll never take another man without first seeing him work. It took over a year to teach Kitson to earn the $500 that we gave for him, but it cost me enough worry to last a lifetime. He is now one of the best pitchers in the league, but when I got him he couldn't pitch a little bit, and as for fielding his position, that was out of the question.\\" Kitson's major league career got off to a roller coaster start in Baltimore. In his first start on May 19, 1898, he shut out the Pittsburgh Pirates. Six days later, the Cubs scored 20 runs off him; the game was called after seven innings with the Cubs ahead 20‚Äì4. In his second season in Baltimore, Kitson appeared in 40 games and compiled a 22-16 record in 326-2/3 innings pitched. He ranked among the National League leaders with a 2.77 ERA (sixth), 22 wins (10th), and 34 complete games (10th). Kitson also contributed with a .314 batting average, three triples, and 16 RBIs. The Orioles folded after the 1899 season, and a number of players, including Kitson, were transferred the Brooklyn Superbas. He was a key player for the 1900 Brooklyn team that compiled an 82-54 to win the National League pennant. He appeared in 40 games in 1900, compiling a 15-13 record with a 4.19 ERA in 253 innings pitched. He also helped his cause with a .294 batting average. He improved in 1901, compiling a 19-11 record with a 2.98 ERA in 38 games pitched. He also led the National League with four saves. On July 25, he pitched a one-hitter against Christy Mathewson and the New York Giants, and The Brookly Daily Eagle reported that Kitson's \\"speed, curves and command was perfect and the Giants were helpless in his hands.\\" In 1902, Kitson again won 19 games for Brooklyn, compiling a 19-13 record with a 2.85 ERA in 32 games pitched. He ranked among the National League's leaders with 19 wins (eighth), 109 strikeouts (ninth), and 29 complete games (10th). =Detroit Tigers= On October 25, 1902, he left Brooklyn to sign with the Detroit Tigers in the American League. In his first season in Detroit, he compiled a 15-16 record with a career-best 2.58 ERA. He remained with the Tigers for two more seasons, compiling a 9-13 record, 3.07 ERA in 1904, and a 12-14 record, 3.47 ERA in 1905. =Washington and New York= On December 5, 1905, the Tigers traded Kitson to the Washington Senators in exchange for Happy Townsend. He compiled a 6-14 record and 3.65 for the Senators in 1906. He began the 1907 with the Senators and lost his first three decisions with a 3.94 ERA. On May 30, 1907, the Senators sold Kitson to the New York Highlanders. He compiled a 4-0 record for the Highlanders with a 3.00 ERA. He pitched his final major league game on July 22, 1907. In 249 major league games, Kitson posted a 128‚Äì117 record with a 3.18 ERA. He also compiled a respectable .240 batting average Later years Kitson died in April 1930 at his farm located two-and-a-half miles north of Allegan, Michigan. He had been suffering from a heart ailment for several years before his death. He was interred in Hudson Corners Cemetery.

It is unknown if he named the place for Mount Zion, a summit located about a mile to the southeast. Because the name \\"Zion\\" for a local post office would have caused confusion, as there had already been two post offices so-named in Oregon, a resident suggested the name \\"Sylvan\\", from the Roman deity of the woods Silvanus. The office was established in 1890 and it closed in 1906. Nathan B. Jones, who was considered an eccentric hermit, had wanted Zion Town to become the new capitol of Oregon.

When the family is reunited for a funeral nearly fifty years later, it brings home to them how much the war acted as a catalyst for their emotional liberation. The title refers to a fragrant camomile lawn stretching down to the cliffs in the garden of their aunt's house. Background Mary Wesley began writing The Camomile Lawn after the death of her second husband left her destitute. She finished writing the book in 1983 and was persuaded to publish it by her editor James Hale. Parts of the book were based on Mary Wesley's early life; the house in Cornwall was based on Boskenna, the seat of the Paynter family, where Wesley spent much time as a young woman. After a coast guard fell to his death near Boskenna, Wesley suspected foul play and created a fictional version for her novel. Like Polly, Wesley worked for military intelligence during the war. The character of Oliver was based on her former boyfriend Lewis Clive while Max was based on Paul Ziegler (brother of Heinz Otto Ziegler), one of her friends whose parents died in the Holocaust. Mary Wesley's sister quarrelled with her over the depiction of Helena and Richard Cuthbertson in the book, as she believed that they were based on their parents. Story In August 1939, Oliver, Calypso, Polly and Walter are visiting their Aunt Helena, Uncle Richard Cuthbertson and their 10-year-old cousin Sophy who has been taken in by Helena and Uncle Richard. They are often visited by the twin sons of the local rector and by Max and Monika, a Jewish refugee couple from Austria, whose only son, Pauli, is in a concentration camp and who have been taken in by the rector. Young Sophy is delighted with the arrival of her cousins, especially Oliver. She is determined to run 'The Terror Run', a cliff path that the cousins race along at full moon, along with the grown ups. During a daylight practice run, the local coastguard exposes himself to her. Returning from fighting in the Spanish Civil War, a depressed and disenchanted Oliver has a changed outlook on life. He retains his crush on Calypso, who, knowing that she is not what Oliver is truly seeking, is determined to make the most of her beauty and marry a rich man. Sensible, intelligent, practical Polly is observant and eventually joins the War Office. It is implied that she is working for Military intelligence. Her brother Walter joins the Navy. Television adaptation In 1992 the novel was adapted for television, independently produced by Glenn Wilhide and Sophie Belhetchet at ZED Ltd for Channel 4 and directed by Peter Hall. It was adapted by Ken Taylor and had a notable cast, including Felicity Kendal as Aunt Helena, Paul Eddington as Uncle Richard, Jennifer Ehle as young Calypso, Rosemary Harris as Calypso in old age; Tara Fitzgerald and Virginia McKenna played the younger and older Polly.

They include genera that are internal parasites or commensals of animals (Entamoeba and Endolimax). A few species are human pathogens, causing diseases such as amoebic dysentery. The other genera of archamoebae live in freshwater habitats and are unusual among amoebae in possessing flagella. Most have a single nucleus and flagellum, but the giant amoeba Pelomyxa has many of each. Description Archamoebae are a diverse group of amoebae. Many have flagella for motility, while others do not. They grow in the absence of oxygen, though some can tolerate small amounts. Most described species of Archamoebae either lack mitochondria or are described to have reduced mitosomes. Classification =History= The group Archamoebae was proposed by Thomas Cavalier-Smith in 1998 as part of the Archezoa, a newly-proposed group to include eukaryotes that had diverged before acquisition of mitochondria and other common eukaryotic cell features. Early molecular trees based on rRNA supported this position, placing several Archamoebae genera as separate groups that diverged from other eukaryotes very early on, suggesting that the absence of mitochondria was a primitive condition. However, soon thereafter genetic remnants of mitochondria were found in various Archamoebae, suggesting that these organisms had diverged after the evolution of mitochondria, but had lost their mitochondria over time, and are more closely related to various amoebae and slime molds. =Taxonomy= Infraphylum Archamoebae Cavalier-Smith 1993 stat. nov. 1998 * Class Archamoebea Cavalier-Smith 1983 stat. nov. 2004 ** Family Tricholimacidae Cavalier-Smith 2013 *** Genus Tricholimax Frenzel 1892 ** Family Endamoebidae alkins 1926 *** Genus Endamoeba Leidy 1879 ** Order Entamoebida Cavalier-Smith 1993 *** Family Entamoebidae Chatton 1925 em.

Its mission is to facilitate international coordination and collaboration necessary for enabling global and integrated access to data gathered by astronomical observatories. An information system allowing such an access is called a Virtual Observatory. The main task of the organisation so far has focused on defining standards to ensure interoperability of the different virtual observatory projects already existing or in development. The IVOA now comprises 19 VO projects from Argentina, Armenia, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, France, Germany, Hungary, India, Italy, Japan, Korea, Russia, Spain, Ukraine, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Membership is open to other national and international projects according to the IVOA Guidelines for Participation. Senior representatives from each national VObs project form the IVOA Executive Committee. A chair is chosen from among the representatives and serves a 1.5 year term, preceded by a 1.5 year term as deputy chair. The Executive Committee meets 3-4 times a year to discuss goals, priorities, and strategies. Members IVOA currently brings together nineteen member organisations, both national and international : #Argentina Virtual Observatory #Armenian Virtual Observatory #AstroGridVirtual Observatory UK #Australian Virtual Observatory #Brazilian Virtual Observatory #Chinese Virtual Observatory #Chilean Virtual Observatory #Canadian Virtual Observatory - ChiVO #European Space Agency #European Virtual Observatory - Euro-VO #German Astrophysical Virtual Observatory #Hungarian Virtual Observatory #Japanese Virtual Observatory #National Virtual Observatory USA - USA's VO #Observatoire Virtuel France #Russian Virtual Observatory #Spanish Virtual Observatory #Ukrainian Virtual Observatory #Italian Virtual Observatory #Virtual Observatory India  Working Groups The tasks of the IVOA are distributed over different working groups: =Applications= The IVOA Applications Working Group is concerned primarily with the software tools that Astronomers use to access VO data and services for doing Astronomy. The role of the Applications Working Group is to: *Provide a forum for announcement and discussion of VO Applications *Provide feedback to IVOA on the implementation of interoperability standards in VO applications *Identify missing or desirable technical capabilities for VO applications *Identify missing or desirable components in terms of scientific usability *Propose and develop standards specific to VO Astronomy-user- Applications =Data Access Layer= The task of the Data Access Layer (DAL) working group is to define and formulate VO standards for remote data access. Client data analysis software will use these services to access data via the VO framework; data providers will implement these services to publish data to the VO. The DAL working groups has defined various standards for accessing data sets, in particular images (Simple Image Access Protocol, SIAP6), spectra (Simple Spectra Access Protocol, SSAP7) and source catalogues (Simple Cone Search, SCS8). =Data Modelling= The role of the Data Modelling Working Group is to provide a framework for the description of metadata attached to observed or simulated data. The activity of the Data Model WG activity focuses on logical relationships between these metadata, examines how an astronomer wants to retrieve, process and interpret astronomical data, and provides an architecture to handle them. What is defined in this WG can then be re-used in the protocols defined by the DAL WG or in VO aware applications. =Grid and Web Services= The aim of the Grid and Web Services(GWS) Working Group is to define the use of Grid technologies and web services within the VO context and to investigate, specify, and implement required standards in this area. This group was formed from a merger of the Web Services group and the Grid group, ordered at the IVOA Executive meeting held during the IAU General Assembly in 2003. =Resource Registry= The Resource Registry Working Group defines the structure and interface to an IVOA Registry. Such a registry ‚Äú ‚Ä¶ will allow an astronomer to be able to locate, get details of, and make use of, any resource located anywhere in the IVO space, i.e. in any Virtual Observatory. The IVOA will define the protocols and standards whereby different registry services are able to interoperate and thereby realise this goal.‚Äù =Semantics= The Semantics Working Group will explore technology in the area of semantics with the aim of producing new standards that aid the interoperability of VO systems. The Semantics Working Group is concerned with the meaning or the interpretation of words, sentences, or other language forms in the context of astronomy. This includes standard descriptions of astrophysical objects, data types, concepts, events, or of any other phenomena in astronomy. The WG covers the study of relationships between words, symbols and concepts, as well as the meaning of such representations (ontology). The WG covers use of natural language in astronomy, including queries, translations, and internationalization of interfaces. =VO Query Language= The VO Query Language (VOQL) Working Group will be in charge of defining a universal Query Language to be used by applications accessing distributed data within the Virtual Observatory framework. =VOTable= The VOTable Working Group is in charge of the VOTable format, which is an XML standard for the interchange of data represented as a set of tables.Francois Ochsenbein & Roy Williams, IVOA VOTable Format Definition, \\"IVOA\\", 30/11/2009 In this context, a table is an unordered set of rows, each of a uniform format, as specified in the table metadata. Each row in a table is a sequence of table cells, and each of these contains either a primitive data type, or an array of such primitives. VOTable is derived from the Astrores format, itself modelled on the FITS Table format; VOTable was designed to be closer to the FITS Binary Table format. =Theory Interest Group= During the IVOA executive meeting of January 2004 in Garching, Germany, the IVOA Theory Interest Group (TIG) was formed with the goal of ensuring that theoretical data and services are taken into account in the IVOA standards process. By its charter, the IVOA Theory Interest Group intends to: *Provide a forum for discussing theory specific issues in a VO context. *Contribute to other IVOA working groups to ensure that theory specific requirements are included. *Incorporate standard approaches defined in these groups when designing and implementing services on theoretical archives. *Define standard services relevant for theoretical archives. *Promote development of services for comparing theoretical results to observations and vice versa. *Define relevant milestones and assign specific tasks to interested parties.

UTTR is currently the largest contiguous block of over-land supersonic- authorized restricted airspace in the contiguous United States. The range, which has a footprint of of ground space and over of air space, is divided into North and South ranges. Interstate 80 divides the two sections of the range. The site is administered and maintained by the US Air Force's HQ UTTR, formerly known as the 388th Range Squadron (388RANS) stationed at Hill Air Force Base, Utah.388th Fighter Wing - Utah Test and Training Range History The Wendover Army Air Field was created in 1942 for research and training, with testing of Republic-Ford JB-2 (U.S. copy of the V-1 flying bomb) in 1945-1946, the Matador in the 1950s, and Minuteman motor testing and development in the 1960s. Wendover property was split and transferred to the nearby city, but land for the test range was kept, becoming the Utah Test and Training Range in 1979 under the Air Force Systems Command. Activities =Military= The Utah Test and Training Range (UTTR) is host to a variety of training and testing missions for the United States Air Force, United States Army, and United States Marine Corps. The site is frequently used for the disposal of explosive ordnance, testing of experimental military equipment, as well as ground and air military training exercises. The Utah Test and Training Range works in close conjunction with Dugway Proving Ground (DPG) for military training exercises. =Space= The site has also been used as a landing site for sample return in NASA's planetary science missions, including comet material in the Stardust mission and the upcoming OSIRIS-REx mission to return material from an asteroid. UTTR was also used as the landing site for the Genesis sample return mission. Although the sample return capsule's parachute failed to open and the capsule made a hard landing in the soft sandy soil, most of the collected scientific materials were salvaged. The solar wind particle collectors were made of wafers of aluminum, sapphire, silicon, germanium, gold and diamond-like amorphous carbon. When the capsule hit the desert floor, these wafers shattered into over 10,000 pieces of material. The Genesis team, along with the efforts of the Air Force's Photographic and Engineering Technician team, set up a clean room at Dugway Proving Ground. NASA scientists spent months filtering through bent metal and shards of razor sharp material, each of the salvageable pieces of material going into its own small container where they were stored for a short time. Some weeks later, one of the lead scientists and the supervisor of the engineering technicians came upon what turned out to be the solar wind concentrator. Protected by a couple of aluminum braces and brackets, the concentrator had survived almost completely intact with only one small crack in one of its quadrants. UTTR will also be used as the landing site for the OSIRIS-REx asteroid sample return mission.

The species was first described by Hippolyte Lucas in 1833. It is common to the contiguous United States, Hawaii, southern Canada, Mexico, and Central America. It has distinctive yellow and black markings on the abdomen and a mostly white cephalothorax. Its scientific Latin name translates to \\"gilded silver-face\\" (the genus name Argiope meaning \\"silver-face\\", while the specific epithet aurantia means \\"gilded\\"). Males range from ; females range from . These spiders may bite if disturbed or harassed, but the venom is harmless to non-allergic humans, roughly equivalent to a bumblebee sting in intensity. Habitat Yellow garden spiders often build webs in areas adjacent to open sunny fields where they stay concealed and protected from the wind. The spider can also be found along the eaves of houses and outbuildings or in any tall vegetation where they can securely stretch a web. Female Argiope aurantia spiders tend to be somewhat local, often staying in one place throughout much of their lifetime. The web of the yellow garden spider is distinctive: a circular shape up to 2 feet (60 cm) in diameter, with a dense zigzag of silk, known as a stabilimentum, in the center. The purpose of the stabilimentum is disputed. It is possible that it acts as camouflage for the spider lurking in the web's center, but it may also attract insect prey, or even warn birds of the presence of the otherwise difficult-to-see web. Only those spiders that are active during the day construct stabilimenta in their webs. To construct the web, several radial lines are stretched among four or five anchor points that can be more than three feet apart. The radial lines meet at a central point. The spider makes a frame with several more radial lines and then fills the center with a spiral of silk, leaving a gap between the spiral rings, starting with the innermost ring and moving outward in a clockwise motion. To ensure that the web is taut, the spider bends the radial lines slightly together while applying the silk spiral. The female builds a substantially larger web than the male's small zigzag web, often found nearby. The spider occupies the center of the web, usually facing straight down, waiting for prey to become ensnared in it. If disturbed by a possible predator, she may drop from the web and hide on the ground nearby. The web normally remains in one location for the entire summer, but spiders can change locations usually early in the season, perhaps to find better protection or better hunting. The yellow garden spider can oscillate her web vigorously while she remains firmly attached in the center.Garden Spider Oscillating Web - Video This action might prevent predators like wasps and birds from drawing a good bead, and also to fully entangle an insect before it cuts itself loose. However, in a case observed in Georgia, Davis witnessed a Vespa crabro fly into the spider's web and get tangled up. Upon looking closer it was found that V. crabro was actually cutting free prey that had been caught in the A. aurantia web. In this case, A. aurantia did not interfere or fight with the European hornet, probably because it dropped from the web and hid nearby. The yellow garden spider does not live in very dense location clusters like other orb spiders such as the golden orb web spider. The yellow garden spider keeps a clean orderly web in comparison to the cluttered series of webs built and abandoned by groups of golden orb spiders. Distribution This spider is found from Canada to Costa Rica, but less so in the basin and mountain areas of the Rockies. Venom Argiope spiders are not aggressive. They might bite if grabbed, but other than for defense they do not attack large animals. Their venom often contains a library of polyamine toxins with potential as therapeutic medicinal agents. Notable among these is the argiotoxin ArgTX-636. A bite by Argiope aurantia is comparable to a bee sting with redness and swelling. For a healthy adult, a bite is not considered an issue. Though they are not aggressive spiders, the very young, elderly, and those with compromised immune systems should exercise caution, just as they would around a beehive or a hornet nest. Reproduction Yellow garden spiders breed twice a year. The males roam in search of a female, building a small web near or actually in the female's web, then court the females by plucking strands on her web. Often, when the male approaches the female, he has a safety drop line ready, in case she attacks him. The male uses the palpal bulbs on his pedipalps to transfer sperm to the female. After inserting the second palpal bulb, the male dies, and is sometimes then eaten by the female. The female lays her eggs at night on a sheet of silky material, then covers them with another layer of silk, then a protective brownish silk. She then uses her legs to form the sheet into a ball with an upturned neck. Egg sacs range from 5/8\\" to 1\\" in diameter. She often suspends the egg sac right on her web, near the center where she spends most of her time. Each spider produces from one to four sacs with perhaps over a thousand eggs inside each. She guards the eggs against predation as long as she is able. However, as the weather cools, she becomes more frail, and dies around the time of the first hard frost. In the spring, the young spiders exit the sac. They are so tiny that they look like dust gathered inside the silk mesh. Some of the spiderlings remain nearby, but others exude a strand of silk that gets caught by the breeze, carrying the spiderling to a more distant area. Eating habits Females of the species are the most commonly seen in gardens. Their webs are usually characterized by a zigzag shaped stabilimentum (an extra thick line of silk) in the middle extending vertically. The spiders spend most of their time in their webs, waiting for prey to become ensnared. When prey becomes caught in the web, the spider may undulate the web back and forth to further trap the insect. When the prey is secure, the spider kills it by injecting its venom and then wraps the prey in a cocoon of silk for later consumption (typically 1‚Äì4 hours later). Prey includes small vertebrates, such as geckos and green anoles, as well as insects.

Delgado and starring Cantinflas and Sonia Infante. The film is set in a parody universe where \\"Red\\" and \\"Green\\" countries are the political equivalents of the socialist and capitalist countries of the Cold War, which the film satirizes. Cantinflas portrays Lupitos, a chancellor stationed in his country's (Republica de Los Cocos) embassy in the communist country of Pepeslavia who later ascends to the role of ambassador and has to decide the pivotal vote of joining the \\"Reds\\" or the \\"Greens\\", therefore deciding the fate of one hundred nations. Su Excelencia, the fourth Cantinflas film distributed by Columbia Pictures, boasted box-office success and is among Cantinflas' most successful films. with its New York premiere scoring a box office victory over Charlie Chaplin's last film, A Countess from Hong Kong, which opened the same week. Plot In a world where countries are divided into 3 subgroups (green, the capitalist countries, red, the communist countries and sweet, the remaining countries), Lopez (known affectionately as \\"Lopitos\\") is a bureaucrat from the sweet Latin American \\"Republica de Los Cocos\\" (a play on the term \\"banana republic\\") who is stationed in the embassy of the Communist bloc country \\"Pepeslavia\\" (a play on words of Joseph Stalin, the nickname for Joseph in Spanish (Jos√©) is \\"Pepe\\", and the inflection \\"-slavia\\" of Slavic peoples under the rule of the USSR). Lopitos, who is horribly inefficient but quick-witted, is invited (because of the current ambassador's superstition about 13 sitting down to a meal) to a banquet attended by the ambassadors of both superpowers. After the news of a series of coups d'√©tat in Los Cocos arrives throughout the meal, Lopitos quickly rises to the position of ambassador. At a summit of world leaders, the representatives of the two world superpowers, \\"Dolaronia\\" (a play on words of the dollar, the currency of United States) and \\"Pepeslavia\\", court the allegiances of third-world diplomats to tilt the balance of global power in their favor. The last diplomat to remain unaligned, Lopitos instead harangues the superpowers for infringing on the rights of developing countries to self determination, talking to them with his point of view as a citizen not as ambassador because he arranged his demise as ambassador one day before his speech.

In Cantinflas and the Chaos of Mexican Modernity, Professor Jeffrey M. Pilcher argued that despite how Cantinflas's character \\"refused in the end to cast his vote for either side and spent a full fifteen minutes haranguing the rival powers in the name of world peace; nevertheless, he lost the moral high ground of nonaligment through his blatant anticomunism\\", in reference to the film's storyline about the machinations of Pepeslavia (a clear Soviet Union analogue) to get the character's vote. Pilcher also found the subplot about Pepeslavia assigning a beautiful secret agent to seduce Cantinflas's character \\"an odd plot twist\\", noting that the film was made less than a year after the death of Cantinflas's Russian wife.Pilcher, p. 198 In his Concise Encyclopedia of Mexico, Michael Werner listed the film among those in Cantinflas's later filmography (from El analfabeto onwards) that were \\"preachy, tedious, and humorless\\", saying that in the final speech he \\"offers the Christian doctrine as a solution for the world's problems in an international scenario meant to represent the United Nations\\".Werner, p. 490 In Looking for Mexico: Modern Visual Culture and National Identity, John Mraz was more critical; sharing similar conclusions to Werner's, but also adding that the final speech showed that \\"[Cantinflas's] arrogance was unbounded\\", and that he was \\"taking himself very seriously\\".Mraz, p. 128 References Bibliography *Pilcher, Jeffrey M.

Basketball career Gherardini started his basketball career as a player playing on his hometown team of Libertas Pallacanestro Forl√¨ from 1971 to 1975. From there he went on to become an assistant coach for Forl√¨ and was also a director of youth teams for the club.

He spent most of his professional career in Portugal (more than 15 years), most notably with Beira-Mar and Boavista. At one point he ranked in the country's Primeira Liga scoring list's Top 5, eventually amassing competition totals of 222 matches and 68 goals over ten seasons. Club career Born in Dakar, Fary began his career with ASC Diaraf in his native country, then started his Portuguese adventure in 1996, signing with lowly Grupo Uni√£o Sport Montemor alongside compatriot and teammate Khadim Faye and remaining with the third division club for two seasons, before moving to S.C. Beira-Mar. From 1998 to 2003, Fary was an ever-present fixture in the top scorer's list in Portugal, hitting an average of one goal every three games in the Primeira Liga. In the 2002‚Äì03 campaign he netted 18 times for the Aveiro team, which finished 13th. Fary signed for Boavista F.C. in the summer of 2003, but his role gradually diminished compared to his previous spell. In 2006‚Äì07 he went scoreless in 23 appearances, although only three of those were as a starter. In July 2008, upon Boavista's relegation to the second level, Fary returned to his first Portuguese professional club Beira-Mar, also in that tier.

X-Day fell on July 5, 1998, the scheduled \\"end of the world\\", and has been celebrated on July 5 each year since then. From its inception in 1980, the Church had prophesied that an army of alien invaders (known as the \\"X-ists\\" or \\"Men From Planet X\\") would land on the planet Earth and destroy the world of \\"normals\\", \\"pinks\\", and \\"glorps,\\" while the members of the Church of the SubGenius would be rescued by the aliens and taken away into space. Chapters 10 and 11 of Revelation X: The \\"Bob\\" Apocryphon supplies additional details as to the precise kinds of fates which supposedly await the \\"pinks\\" and \\"normals\\" (as well as SubGenii who have not paid their membership fees) left behind when X-Day comes, saying, among other things, that those who are not immediately killed by the aliens will be enslaved by a society of evil clowns known as the \\"Bozo Cult\\" until eventually their souls are devoured by the Elder Gods. The book also tells readers that if they want more information, they should send one million dollars to Ivan Stang so that he can remake his 1973 film Let's Visit the World of the Future. First event When July 5, 1998 arrived and no alien fleet appeared in the sky, members of the Church began citing a large number of conspiracy theories to explain why the predicted end of the world did not take place. The manual page of the ddate program claims that the Church \\"declared that it had got the year upside down\\" and that X-Day will actually take place in 8661. The most popular explanation for the failure of the prophecy in the Church is usually summarized with the statement, \\"the calendar is wrong and July 5th, 1998 has not really arrived yet.\\" Because of this, the Church has held annual gatherings around July 5 of each year since 1998 to celebrate X-Day and greet the arrival of the anticipated alien \\"Sex Goddesses.\\" No flying saucer rendezvous has been confirmed , but members of the Church have been undaunted. A more recent theory suggests that the X-ists did indeed come to Earth on July 5, 1998 as foretold by \\"Bob,\\" but through one of the most pervasive Conspiracy coverups, Earth and Mars were switched, and the \\"Earth\\" we know is actually Mars. And thus, as there was nobody on the True Earth at the time of their arrival, there was nobody there to witness the Rupture. The X-Day celebration has become well known in underground culture circles, especially in pagan communities. Of the various X-Day celebrations taking place, the largest and most popular each year was held at the Brushwood Folklore Center in Sherman, New York, but as of 2011 it has been scheduled for Wisteria Event Campground in Pomeroy, Ohio.http://www.subgenius.com/newdevivals.html Many underground rock bands have performed at X-Day, and the event has evolved into a festival similar to Burning Man, lasting for three to five days, with rock concerts, artistic events, bonfires, and parties taking place day and night.  Event activities Regular events at X-Day include a symbolic effigy burning of J.R. \\"Bob\\" Dobbs (the founder of the Church of the SubGenius); a baptism (\\"Bob\\"tism) where participants have their sins \\"washed away\\", \\"and receive new ones in return\\"; concerts and performances by underground rock bands and performance artists, such as The Amino Acids, Bonobos Convergence, Little Fyodor; theme camps; and an auction where participants are encouraged to donate strange, unusual, and offensive items of all sorts (including themselves). \\"Burners\\" familiar with the Burning Man event have been upset by the fact that X-Day is not a commerce-free event in the fashion of Burning Man ‚Äì the bands and participants at X-Day are, in fact, encouraged to sell their own items, music CDs and albums, and other paraphernalia. The Church of the SubGenius has responded to these complaints with the statement that it is not a non-profit church: \\"We're for-profit, we want profit, and we want to cast out false prophets.\\" However, the Church's status as an independent corporation with no corporate affiliations has ensured that large, mainstream companies have avoided the X-Day celebration, allowing independent artists and underground performers to flourish. The Church claims to be the only religious organization that is \\"proud to pay its taxes\\". History In 2007, the celebration notably coincided with Roswell, New Mexico's 60th anniversary celebration of a purported 'UFO incident'.

The act may be carried out by physical force, or where the person is under threat or manipulation, or with a person who is incapable of valid consent. It is the name of a statutory crime in jurisdictions such as England and Wales, Northern Ireland, Scotland, California, and New York, and is a legal term of art used in the definition of the offence of sexual violation in New Zealand. Definitions of rape vary, and though rape is usually dependent upon whether or not consent was present during the act, the term \\"consent\\" varies as well. Minors, for example, are often considered too young to consent to sexual relations with older persons (see statutory rape and age of consent). Consent is also considered invalid if obtained under duress, or from a person who does not have the ability to understand the nature of the act, due to factors such as young age, mental disability, or substance intoxication. Many jurisdictions, such as Canada and several US and Australian states, have abandoned the term \\"rape\\" in favor of other terms such as \\"sexual assault\\", \\"sexual intercourse without consent\\", or \\"criminal sexual conduct\\".http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/85f0033m/85f0033m2008019-eng.pdf Terminology and definitions =Classification= Depending on the jurisdiction, rape may be characterized as a sexual offenceFor example, by the Sexual Offences Act 1956 and the Sexual Offences Act 2003 or an offence against the person.For example, by the Offences against the Person Act 1828, the Offences against the Person Act 1861 and the Visiting Forces Act 1952 Rape may also be characterized as a form of aggravated assault or battery, or both, indecent assaultFor example, in England and Wales before the enactment of the Sexual Offences Act 2003: R v Hodgson [1973] QB 565 (indecent assault on a woman held to be an alternative verdict to rape in a case where the accused was acquitted of rape on grounds of the consent of the victim, who was aged under 16, which was not, by virtue of section 14(2) of the Sexual Offences Act 1956, a defence to indecent assault) or sexual assaultFor example, in England and Wales after the enactment of the Sexual Offences Act 2003 or battery, or both. =Actus reus= To sustain a conviction, rape might require proof that the defendant had sexual penetration with another person. Depending on the jurisdiction, the actus reus of rape may consist of \\"having carnal knowledge of\\" a woman,For example, under the common law of England, and at common law in Scotland or \\"having sexual intercourse with\\" a woman (including a girl) specifically,For example, under the Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 1976 as read with section 46 of the Sexual Offences Act 1956 or either a woman or a man (including a girl or a boy) generally,For example, under section 1 of the Sexual Offences Act 1956, as substituted by section 142 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, and read with section 46 of the former mentioned Act or engaging in sexual intercourse with a person (which term includes an intersex person who might arguably be neither a woman nor a man)For example, under section 261 of the California Penal Code, or having \\"sexual connection\\" with a person affected by penile penetration of that person's genitalia,For example, under section 128(2) of the Crimes Act 1961 or penile penetration of the vagina, anus or mouth (these terms construed as including surgically constructed organs) of a person.For example, under section 1 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003 In Prosecutor v. Anto Furund≈æija, the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia included fellatio in the definition of rape, because [para 183]: \\"The Trial Chamber holds that the forced penetration of the mouth by the male sexual organ constitutes a most humiliating and degrading attack upon human dignity. The essence of the whole corpus of international humanitarian law as well as human rights law lies in the protection of the human dignity of every person, whatever his or her gender\\".http://www.icty.org/x/cases/furundzija/tjug/en/fur-tj981210e.pdf =Mens rea= Countries around the world differ in how they deal with the mens rea element in the law regarding rape, (i.e. the belief of the accused that the victim is not consenting or might not be consenting), and in how they place the onus of proof with regard to belief of consent. For example, under the Sexual Offences Act 2003, the belief must be \\"reasonable\\" and \\"Whether a belief is reasonable is to be determined having regard to all the circumstances, including any steps A has taken to ascertain whether B consents\\". In some jurisdictions the mens rea is quite complex, such as in New South Wales, where the law reads:http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s61ha.html The Explanatory Report of the Istanbul Convention, states at para 189: \\"The interpretation of the word \\"intentionally\\" is left to domestic law, but the requirement for intentional conduct relates to all the elements of the offence\\". [in regard to Article 36 of the convention ‚Äì Sexual violence, including rape]. =Attendant circumstances= Rape has been defined so as to require proof that the sexual act in question was done without the victim's consent,For example, by section 1 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003 or so as to require proof that it was done either without their consent or, alternatively, against their will.For example, by section 261 of the California Penal Code There is not always a requirement that the victim did not consent. In the England and Wales, section 5 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003 creates the offence of \\"rape of a child under 13\\" and contains no reference to consent. After describing the sexual act the offence prohibits, the explanatory notes to the Act say \\"whether or not the child consented to this act is irrelevant\\".Sexual Offences Act 2003: Explanatory Notes, paragraph 14 In M.C. v. Bulgaria,http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng/pages/search.aspx#{%22dmdocnumber%22:[%22699398%22],%22itemid%22:[%22001-61521%22]} the European Court of Human Rights ruled that the victim does not necessarily have to resist physically for the crime of rape to be committed [para 166]: :\\"[T]he Court is persuaded that any rigid approach to the prosecution of sexual offences, such as requiring proof of physical resistance in all circumstances, risks leaving certain types of rape unpunished and thus jeopardising the effective protection of the individual's sexual autonomy. In accordance with contemporary standards and trends in that area, the member States' positive obligations under Articles 3 and 8 of the Convention [Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms] must be seen as requiring the penalisation and effective prosecution of any non- consensual sexual act, including in the absence of physical resistance by the victim.\\" Some circumstances, such as where the victim is kidnapped or in detention, or under conditions of war or genocide, may be viewed as so coercive, that they presume non-consent altogether; for example in ICTY, The Prosecutor v. Kunarac, Kovac and Vukovic, it was ruled, in regard to the rape during the Bosnian War, where women were kept in detention centers, under extremely harsh conditions, and were selected for sex by soldiers and policemen, that [para 132]: \\"Such detentions amount to circumstances that were so coercive as to negate any possibility of consent\\".https://www.icrc.org/casebook/doc/case-study/icty-kunarac-kovac- vukovic-case-study.htm The issue arises in law as who can legally consent, for example with regard to persons who suffer from mental or physical disability. Although laws differ by jurisdiction, emerging international standards suggest that a person's mental or physical disability, should not, in and of itself, render the sexual interaction illegal, but rather the exploitation or abuse of such disability by the perpetrator should do so: in the European Union, the Directive 2011/93/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 December 2011 reads (with regard to the determination of legal consent of a child who is above the age of consent): \\"(10) Disability, by itself, does not automatically constitute an impossibility to consent to sexual relations. However, the abuse of the existence of such a disability in order to engage in sexual activities with a child should be criminalised\\".http://eur- lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2011:335:0001:0014:EN:PDF = Redefinitions and statute =  General  From the second part of the 20th century onwards, the crime of rape has undergone major changes in definition in many countries, especially in Western countries. It has evolved from its narrow traditional definition of forced penetration of a vagina by a penis, outside of marriage, to a broader definition, which includes forced sex in marriage (marital rape), and may also include other sexual acts (such as anal or oral sexual penetration); the latter were traditionally dealt with under sodomy laws. This redefinition of rape had the effect of defining male rape. There have also been changes in the legal definition of consent/coercion. Two different changes have been made in recent decades in many jurisdictions in regard to the criminal offense of rape as it relates to marital status: *the criminalization of rape between spouses ('marital rape') *the removal of the stipulation that, if after the act of rape the victim and the perpetrator marry each other, the prosecution ends ('marry-your-rapist law')  Marital rape  Throughout much of the history, rape in marriage was not a crime. Most cultures subscribed to the idea of the existence of 'conjugal rights' to sexual intercourse with one's spouse, and, until well into the 20th century, most legal systems generally accepted, overtly or tacitly, that such 'rights' could be taken by force, against the will of the wife. Traditional understanding and views of marriage, rape, sexuality, gender roles and self determination have started to be challenged in most Western countries during the 1960s and 1970s, which has led to the subsequent criminalization of marital rape during the following decades. With a few notable exceptions, it was during the past 30 years when most laws against marital rape have been enacted. Several countries in Eastern Europe and Scandinavia made spousal rape illegal before 1970, but other countries in Western Europe and the English-speaking Western World outlawed it much later, mostly in the 1980s and 1990s. Marital rape is included in the 1993 Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women as a form of violence against women, which reads: :\\"Violence against women shall be understood to encompass, but not be limited to, the following: (a) Physical, sexual and psychological violence occurring in the family, including battering, sexual abuse of female children in the household, dowry-related violence, marital rape, female genital mutilation and other traditional practices harmful to women, non-spousal violence and violence related to exploitation [...]\\"; It is also included in the Council of Europe Recommendation Rec(2002)5 of the Committee of Ministers to member states on the protection of women against violence, which reads: :\\"This [violence against women] includes, but is not limited to, the following: a. violence occurring in the family or domestic unit, including, inter alia, physical and mental aggression, emotional and psychological abuse, rape and sexual abuse, incest, rape between spouses, regular or occasional partners and cohabitants, crimes committed in the name of honour, female genital and sexual mutilation and other traditional practices harmful to women, such as forced marriages [...]\\". In addition, the World Health Organization, defines sexual violence as: \\"any sexual act, attempt to obtain a sexual act, unwanted sexual comments or advances, or acts to traffic, or otherwise directed, against a person‚Äôs sexuality using coercion, by any person regardless of their relationship to the victim, in any setting, including but not limited to home and work\\".https://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/violence/global_campaign/en/chap6.pdf The countries which choose to ratify the Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence, the first legally binding instrument in Europe in the field of violence against women,https://www.oas.org/es/mesecvi/docs/CSW-SideEvent2014-Flyer-EN.pdf are bound by its provisions to ensure that non-consensual sexual acts committed against a spouse or partner are illegal.See Article 36 ‚Äì Sexual violence, including rape para 3; and Article 43 ‚Äì Application of criminal offences. Also see the Explanatory Report, para 194, para 219 and para 220. The convention came into force in August 2014.  Marry-your-rapist laws  A marry-your- rapist law or rape-marriage law states that a rapist will not be prosecuted if they marry their victim. Although the terms for this phenomenon were only coined in the 2010s, the practice has been supported by the rape laws in many legal systems throughout history. In the late 20th and early 21st century, the remaining laws of this type were increasingly challenged and repealed in a series of countries.  As a crime of abduction  Originally, in Ancient Rome, 'rape' was a crime-defining primarily the act of a male abducting a female without the consent of the man under whose authority she was (typically father or husband); sexual intercourse was not necessary.Diana C. Moses, \\"Livy's Lucretia and the Validity of Coerced Consent in Roman Law,\\" in Consent and Coercion to Sex and Marriage in Ancient and Medieval Societies (Dunbarton Oaks, 1993), p. 50; Gillian Clark, Women in Late Antiquity: Pagan and Christian Life-styles (Oxford University Press, 1993), p. 36. Furthermore, in many legal systems (such as 17th century France) the consent of the woman to sexual intercourse was not a defense - the act was still a crime if done without the consent of her father.Catherine Orenstein, Little Red Riding Hood Uncloaked p 36 ISBN While the laws on rape differed by historical period and culture, some elements were common to most jurisdictions until the second part of the 20th century (when rape laws underwent major changes): 'rape' was a crime that could be committed only between parties who were not married to each other, and only by a male against a female. Punishment =Punishment of assailants= Punishment for rape in most countries today is imprisonment. Castration is sometimes a punishment for rape and, controversially, some U.S. jurisdictions allow shorter sentences for sex criminals who agree to voluntary chemical castration. In the past, rape was often punished with death, and it is punishable by death in at least 9 countries today: China, Afghanistan, United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, and North Korea. In some of these instances, special circumstances apply. For example, rape is only punishable by death in India if the victim dies or is put in a persistent vegetative state, and/or if the rapist is a repeat offender, and in Iran, a death sentence for rape can be substituted with compensation, with or without imprisonment and flogging, if the victim so chooses. In 1977, in Coker v. Georgia the Supreme Court of the United States held that the death penalty for the crime of rape of an adult woman was cruel and unusual punishment, and thus banned it as a violation of the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution, and in 2008 in Kennedy v. Louisiana it ruled the same in regard to rape of a child. Prison sentences for rape are not uniform. A study made by the U.S. Department of Justice of prison releases in 1992, involving about 80 percent of the prison population, found that the average sentence for convicted rapists was 9.8 years, while the actual time served was 5.4 years. This follows the typical pattern of violent crimes in the US, where those convicted typically serve no more than half of their sentence.http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/content/pub/pdf/PSATSFV.PDF Between 2002 and 2003, more than one in ten convicted rapists in Victoria, Australia, served a wholly suspended sentence, and the average total effective sentence for rape was seven years. In the Republic of Ireland, the average sentence given for rape is 5 ‚Äì 7 years. =Punishment of victims= While the practice is condemned as barbaric by many present-day societies, some societies punish the victims of rape as well as the perpetrators. According to such cultures, being raped dishonors the victim and, in many cases, the victim's family. In some countries (e.g. Libya, Afghanistan) rape victims are sometimes killed to restore honor to the family's name. In the Shakespeare drama Titus Andronicus, the title character kills his raped, maimed daughter in what he believes to be a mercy killing. Certain cultures have historically promoted a system of honor, dishonor, and shame, which was applied with particular strictness to females. A victim of rape would be considered to have lost her honorable reputation and place in society, a loss of honor which entailed shame on the woman's family group as well. In early ancient Rome, ancient China, and other cultures, a pressure has existed which has led women to commit suicide after becoming victims of rape. The iconic Roman instance is that of Lucretia. Likewise, the suicide of female rape victims for reasons of shame is also historically documented in Chinese and Japanese culture. In countries which outlaw fornication or adultery, rape victims may become subject to these laws (if they cannot prove the rape case and/or if it is revealed they were not virgins at the time of the assault - in the case of unmarried victims). International guidelines, recommendations, and obligations In recent years, there have been various guidelines and recommendations from international human rights organizations in regard to rape and sexual violence. One view that is advanced is that the offense of 'rape' should be replaced with a broader offense of 'sexual assault'. For instance, the Handbook for Legislation on Violence against Women from the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs Division for the Advancement of Women gives these suggestions about legislation on sexual violence:https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/vaw/handbook/Handbook%20for%20legislation%20on%20violence%20against%20women.pdf The Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence, also known as the Istanbul Convention, which creates legally binding obligations for countries which choose to ratify it, reads:  Laws by country  = Common law countries = Rape was an offense under the common law of England. That offense became an offense under the law of other countries, including Australia and the United States, as a result of colonization or conquest, or the following cession (see British Empire). It is discussed at Rape in English law#History. Under this law, rape traditionally describes the act of a male forcing a female to have sexual intercourse (sexual penetration of the vagina by the penis) with him. Common law rape required the utmost physical resistance by the victim, as well as substantial force by the defendant. The common law crime of rape was collectively adopted by the American colonies in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Until the late twentieth century, spousal rape was not considered a true rape case because both spouses were deemed to have consented to a lifelong sexual relationship through the wedding vows. However, with changes to the marital rape exemption, as well as with the significant development of women's rights, the belief of a marital right to force sexual intercourse has become less widely held. Rape was also an offense at common law in Scotland. This offense was not derived from the English offense as Scotland retained its own system of criminal law under the terms of the Acts of Union 1707. = Bhutan = Chapter 14 (Sexual Offenses) of the 2004 Penal Code of Bhutan outlaws rape and other sexual offenses.https://www.unodc.org/tldb/pdf/Bhutan_Penal_Code_2004_Eng.pdf Under the criminal code, there are several categories of rape, which are punished differently, depending on factors such as the age of the victim, the relationship between the victim and the perpetrator, the number of participants (gang rape), whether the victim was pregnant, whether injury occurred. Marital Rape is also recognized as an offense under the 2004 laws, being classified as a petty misdemeanour. The most serious form of rape is Gang rape of a child under twelve years of age, classified as a felony of the first degree. The most serious sexual offense is gang rape of a child under 12. Marital rape is illegal: = Canada = The Criminal Code does not contain an offence of \\"rape\\", which historically required proof of penetration for a conviction. Instead, the law criminalizes \\"sexual assault\\", which is defined as sexual contact with another person without that other person's consent. Consent is defined in section 273.1(1) as \\"the voluntary agreement of the complainant to engage in the sexual activity in question\\". = France = Any act of sexual penetration, whatever its nature, committed against another person or on the perpetrator, by violence, constraint, threat or surprise, is rape. Rape is punished by a maximum of fifteen years' criminal imprisonment. Rape is punished by a maximum of twenty years' criminal imprisonment in certain aggravating factors (including victim under age of 15). Rape is punished by a maximum of thirty years' criminal imprisonment where it caused the death of the victim. Rape is punished by a maximum of imprisonment for life when it is preceded, accompanied or followed by torture or acts of barbarity. = Ireland = In Republic of Ireland law, there are two separate offences of rape:DJELR 1998 p.123 * \\"rape [at common law]\\", restricted to vaginal penetration by penis * \\"rape under section 4 [of the Criminal Law (Rape) (Amendment) Act 1990 as amended]\\", for anal or oral penetration by penis, or vaginal penetration by inanimate object The offences have the same penalty, of life imprisonment, and the same provisions regarding conduct of trials,Criminal Law (Rape) (Amendment) Act 1990 ¬ß¬ß11‚Äì20 except that rape under section 4 is an alternative verdict in a rape trial, but not conversely. The common-law offence was codified by the Offences against the Person Act 1861 and the Criminal Law (Rape) Act 1981. A statutory definition was introduced by section 2(1) of the 1981 act;DJELR 1998 ¬ß3.3.1 as amended it states: The act also restricted reference to the alleged victim's past sexual history, and provided anonymity for both parties. Originally, the act referred to \\"unlawful sexual intercourse\\"; the word unlawful, intended to preserve the exemption for marital rape, was deleted by the 1990 act.DJELR 1998 ¬ß3.3.2 Section 4 of the 1990 act defines \\"rape under section 4\\" as follows: By section 2 of the 1990 act, \\"sexual assault\\" is defined in terms of \\"indecent assault\\", which is not otherwise defined. The 1988 Law Reform Commission (LRC) report on \\"rape and allied offences\\", on which the 1990 act was based, recommended expanding the common-law definition rather than creating a new offence, and the inclusion of penetration of the anus in the scope of section 4(b). The 1990 act mandated that trials for both rape offences be at the Central Criminal Court, removed the rule that males under 14 were considered incapable of sexual offences, and relaxed the obligation to warn the jury about an alleged victim's uncorroborated testimony. It also specifies that failure to offer resistance is not evidence of consent. = Greece = Penal Code, Art. 336 par. 1 creates the offence of rape.Fitrakis Eft., in: Paraskevopoulos Nikos ‚Äì Fitrakis Eftichis, Sexual offences (Axiopines sexoualikes praxis), ed. Sakkoulas, Athens ‚Äì Thessaloniki 2011, p. 93. It reads: > 1\\\\. Whoever with physical violence or with threat of grave and direct danger > forces another to intercourse or to tolerance or action of an indecent act, > is punished with incarceration. In Greece, marital rape was made illegal in 2006. = Guatemala = The 2009 Law against Sexual Violence, Exploitation, and Trafficking in Persons defines rape as follows: :Rape :Whoever, by physical or psychological violence, has vaginal, anal, or oral sexual intercourse with another person, or inserts any body part or object by these methods, or compels another to do so, shall be punished with imprisonment from eight to twelve years. Also, the offense is committed when a victim is a person younger than fourteen years, or a person with a volitional or cognitive impairment, even in the absence of physical or psychological violence. The penalty shall be imposed without prejudice to the penalties that may apply for the commission of other offenses. = India = In 2019, the Indian Supreme Court ruled that sex on a false promise of marriage constitutes rape.BBC News, 19 April 2019, Why India sees sex on false promise of marriage as rape = Iran = In Iran, the sentence for a rape case is a death penalty by hanging in public squares or prisons. = Israel = In Israel, the definition of the criminal offence of rape is as follows:http://www.oecd.org/investment/anti-bribery/anti- briberyconvention/43289694.pdf Rape 345.(a) If a person had intercourse with a woman then he committed rape and is liable to sixteen years imprisonment. = New Zealand = Rape is part of the statutory offence of sexual violation. Sexual violation is created by section 128 of the Crimes Act 1961. ;Definition of sexual violation (and rape) Sexual violation is defined as follows:  Consent  The mere fact that a person allows sexual connection to be performed on them, does not automatically mean that they are legally consenting. If that person allows sexual connection due to coercion (e.g., under force, threats or fear of force; when he/she is asleep or very intoxicated; if he/she is affected by an intellectual, mental, or physical condition or impairment of a certain nature and degree; when he/she is mistaken about the partner's identity), then he/she is not legally consenting. 128A Allowing sexual activity does not amount to consent in some circumstances (1) A person does not consent to sexual activity just because he or she does not protest or offer physical resistance to the activity. (2) A person does not consent to sexual activity if he or she allows the activity because of‚Äî :(a) force applied to him or her or some other person; or :(b) the threat (express or implied) of the application of force to him or her or some other person; or :(c) the fear of the application of force to him or her or some other person. (3) A person does not consent to sexual activity if the activity occurs while he or she is asleep or unconscious. (4) A person does not consent to sexual activity if the activity occurs while he or she is so affected by alcohol or some other drug that he or she cannot consent or refuse to consent to the activity. (5) A person does not consent to sexual activity if the activity occurs while he or she is affected by an intellectual, mental, or physical condition or impairment of such a nature and degree that he or she cannot consent or refuse to consent to the activity. (6) One person does not consent to sexual activity with another person if he or she allows the sexual activity because he or she is mistaken about who the other person is. (7) A person does not consent to an act of sexual activity if he or she allows the act because he or she is mistaken about its nature and quality. (8) This section does not limit the circumstances in which a person does not consent to sexual activity. (9) For the purposes of this section,‚Äî :allows includes acquiesces in, submits to, participates in, and undertakes sexual activity, in relation to a person, means‚Äî :(a) sexual connection with the person; or :(b) the doing on the person of an indecent act that, without the person's consent, would be an indecent assault of the person. Attempted sexual violation and assault with intent to commit sexual violation are also punished (Article 129). Article 129A is entitled Sexual conduct with consent induced by certain threats and makes it illegal for a person to have sexual connection with another person or to do an indecent act on another person when the accused knows that the other person has been induced to consent to the connection/act by threat. However, a person is guilty of this crime \\"if (and only if) he or she knows that the other person has been induced to consent\\" to the sexual connection/indecent act \\"by an express or implied threat\\". Subsection (5), (a), (b), (c) of this article defines \\"threat\\" for the purpose of this article. Article 135 outlaws Indecent assault. Article 138 outlaws Sexual exploitation of a person with a significant impairment. = Norway = In Norway, rape is defined under the Norwegian Penal Code ¬ß 192 as either: * 1. engaging in sexual activity by means of violence or threatening behaviour, * 2. engaging in sexual activity with somebody who is unconscious or for any other reason incapable of resisting the act, or * 3. by means of violence or threatening behaviour compelling any person to engage in sexual activity with another person, or to carry out similar actions with him- or herself. When any of these circumstances occur, a person guilty of rape is punishable by up to 10 years imprisonment. However, if a person is guilty of rape through gross negligence he or she is liable to imprisonment for a period not exceeding five years. If the activity in question was sexual intercourse or the offender has rendered a person unconscious or unable to resist the sexual activity, the penalty imposed shall be no less than three years imprisonment. Further, the same section defines aggravated rape as a rape committed * a. by multiple persons in cooperation (gang rape) * b. in a particularly painful or offensive manner * c. by a person previously convicted of rape under ¬ß 192 or of sexual activity with a child under the age of 14 (as per ¬ß 195 of the penal code) * d. in such a way that the victim either dies or receives grievous bodily harm. The section recognizes sexually transmitted diseases (defined in the Infection Protection Act) as grievous bodily harm. = Philippines = Article 266-A of the Revised Penal Code (Title Eight of Act No. 3815) provides that: Chapter 3 of this Code, which relates to rape, was inserted by the Anti-Rape Law of 1997. By section 2 of that Act, the crime of rape is classified as a crime against persons under that Code. = Russia = According to the Article 131 of the Criminal Code of Russia, rape is defined as heterosexual vaginal intercourse using violence or threat of violence or if the victim is in a helpless state. The other forms of a violent sexual intercourse (male-male, female-male, female-female and non-vaginal male-female) are called \\"coercive sexual actions\\" and are punishable by the Article 132. These two crimes, however, are punishable identically. Besides, such crimes as sexual relations with a person under the age of consent (16 years as of 2013, article 134) and depraved actions (Article 135), if committed against a person under 12 years since 2012 are considered rape or coercive sexual actions (depending on sex of the offender and the victim and the type of intercourse) and punished according to the articles 131 or 132, because such victim is deemed to be in a helpless state due to his/her age. However, the Article 134 punishes sexual activity between same-sex pairings harsher than sexual activity between opposite-sex pairings when one of the persons is under 16 years old. Rape or coercive sexual actions without any aggravating circumstances are punishable with 3 to 6 years of imprisonment. If the crime: * was committed repeatedly (against 1 or more than 1 victim) * was committed by a group of criminals * was committed with a threat of murder or grievous harm to the health * was committed with particular cruelty (e.g. the criminal used violence that caused severe physical pain or the crime was committed in presence of relatives of the victim) * caused an STD infection then it is punishable with 4 to 10 years of imprisonment with possible subsequent restraint of liberty for up to 2 years (i.e. the criminal may not change or leave residence without permission and must register himself at local penal inspectorate 1 to 4 times a month; court may also impose additional restrictions such as the criminal may not leave home in certain hours, visit certain locations, change work without permission). If the crime * Was committed against a person between 14 and 18 years * Caused the grievous harm to the health, HIV infection or other grievous consequences (e.g. suicide of the victim) then it is punishable with 8 to 15 years of imprisonment with the subsequent mandatory restraint of liberty for up to 2 years and a possible ban on certain occupations or employment positions for up to 20 years. If the crime * Caused the death of the victim by inadvertency * Was committed against a person under 14 years then it is punishable with 12 to 20 years of imprisonment with the subsequent mandatory restraint of liberty for up to 2 years and a possible ban on certain occupations or employment positions for up to 20 years. = South Africa = In South Africa, rape is defined by the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences and Related Matters) Amendment Act, 2007 (Act No. 32 of 2007).http://www.justice.gov.za/legislation/acts/2007-032.pdf This act has repealed the common law offence of rape and replaced it with a new expanded statutory offence of rape, applicable to all forms of sexual penetration without consent, irrespective of gender.

Definition of rape Rape is defined as follows:The Sexual Offences Act 2003, section 1  Northern Ireland  Rape is a statutory offence. It is created by article 5 of the Sexual Offences (Northern Ireland) Order 2008 (S.I. 1769/2008 (N.I. 2)). The common law offence of rape was abolished by article 5(6) of that Order. ;Definition of rape: Rape is defined as follows:The Sexual Offences (Northern Ireland) Order 2008, article 5 ;Interpretation: Any reference to rape in a statutory provision must be construed in accordance with article 5(1) of the said Order.The Sexual Offences (Northern Ireland) Order 2008 (S.I. 1769/2008 (N.I. 2)), article 5(5) ;Rape of a child under 13: This is a statutory offence created by article 12 of the said Order. ;Civil liability: ;Loss of service: No person is liable in tort under the law of Northern Ireland on the ground only of having deprived another of the services of his female servant by raping her.The Administration of Justice Act 1982, section 2(c)(ii)  Scotland  Rape is a statutory offence. It is created by section 1 of the Sexual Offences (Scotland) Act 2009. ;Definition of rape: Rape is defined as follows:The Sexual Offences (Scotland) Act 2009, section 1 ;Rape of a young child: This offence is created by section 18 of the Sexual Offences (Scotland) Act 2009. ;History: Prior to Sexual Offences (Scotland) Act 2009, rape in Scots Law differed from the definition of rape in other legal systems. In Scotland, rape was defined as \\"a crime at common law which consisted of the carnal knowledge of a female by a male person without her consent\\". Under Scots law, rape could only be carried out by a male who penetrated a female's vagina. If a man's anus was penetrated by another man's penis, this was called sodomy and was tried under indecent assault, a form of aggravated assault. Likewise, if a male penetrated a female's anus by his penis without her consent, he would also be charged with indecent assault. In Scotland, rape can only be prosecuted in the High Court of JusticiaryThe Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995, section 3 and if convicted, the maximum penalty available to the court is life imprisonment. Evidence of distress can be used as corroborating evidence. Evidence of distress would be recognised by the first person or friend that the victim sees after the event. This should not be confused with hearsay evidence, which is not normally allowed to be led. One of the key elements to prosecute a male for rape is to prove that the male had sexual intercourse without the female's consent. For sexual intercourse not to be rape, the active consent of the female is needed. This means it is not enough for a woman to be 'passive', she must actively consent and was established by Lord Advocate's Reference (No. 1 of 2001).Link to reference at Scottish Court Service. Therefore, a male could still be convicted of rape, even though the female did not say anything or show any resistance. This is a change in the law, as previously men who had sexual intercourse with sleeping women (as in the case of Charles Sweenie) or women who were unconscious due to voluntarily taking drugs or alcohol (see HMA v Logan) were charged with the lesser crime of indecent assault, rather than rape, as they had not used force to achieve penetration. Lord Advocate's Reference (No 1 of 2001), by requiring \\"active consent\\", had opened up the law to decide whether a voluntarily drunk or intoxicated woman can consent to sexual intercourse. This was clarified under the new laws of 2009 which state that sexual intercourse is non-consensual, and therefore considered rape if it occurs :(...) where the conduct occurs at a time when B is incapable because of the effect of alcohol or any other substance of consenting to it. Penetration is sufficient for a sexual intercourse to be deemed rape: there needs not to be any excretion of semen and the female's hymen does not have to be ruptured. In Scotland, rape continued to be a gender-specific crime until the Sexual Offences (Scotland) Act 2009.MSPs pass major sex crime reforms BBC News 10 June 2009 This Act came into force on 1 December 2010.http://www.oqps.gov.uk/legislation/ssi/ssi2010/pdf/ssi_20100357_en.pdf The Act expanded the definition of rape to include male rape. = United States =  State laws  There is no federal rape law in the United States, due to the United States v. Morrison ruling that parts of the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 were unconstitutional. Each state has its own laws concerning sexual aggression. Nor is there any national standard in the US for defining and reporting male-male or female-perpetrated rapes. State laws vary considerably, and in most states, the term \\"rape\\" is no longer used, and the offense has been replaced by crimes such as \\"sexual assault\\", \\"criminal sexual conduct\\", \\"sexual abuse\\", \\"sexual battery\\" etc. The US laws on sexual violence are complex, with states having numerous sex offenses, dealing with different situations. The laws on sex crimes have been changed and modernized significantly during the last decades and they continue to change.  Uniform Code of Military Justice  Uniform Code of Military Justice [USC Title 10, Subtitle A, Chapter 47X, Section 920, Article 120] defines rape as: Marital rape is banned; the law states: \\"Marriage is not a defense for any conduct in issue in any prosecution under this section.\\"  Rape reporting  According to the USA Today reporter Kevin Johnson, \\"no other major category of crime ‚Äì not murder, assault or robbery ‚Äì has generated a more serious challenge to the credibility of national crime statistics\\" as has the crime of rape. He says: > \\"There are good reasons to be cautious in drawing conclusions from reports > on rape. The two most accepted studies available ‚Äì the FBI's annual Uniform > Crime Report and the Justice Department's annual National Crime > Victimization Survey ‚Äì each have widely acknowledged weaknesses.\\" The FBI's report fails to report rapes with male victims, both adults and children, fails to report non-forcible rapes of either gender by either gender, and reflects only the number of rapes reported to police. The Justice Department's survey solicits information from people 12 and older, excluding the youngest victims of rape (and incest). However, by using a random national telephone survey of households, the National Crime Victimization Survey could pick up rapes unreported to the police. In addition, since both official reports collect rape data from states with widely divergent standards and definitions on what constitutes rape, uniform reporting is impossible. A recent attempt to improve the tracking of rape, the National Violence Against Women survey was first published in 1998 by the National Institute of Justice and the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Its authors have acknowledged that they used different methodologies with \\"relatively high\\" margins of error. The 2000 report notes that \\"because annual rape victimization estimates (nationwide) are based on responses from only 24 women and 8 men (emphasis added) who reported being raped, they should be viewed with caution.\\" The report goes on to note that it fails to report rapes perpetrated against children and adolescents, was well as those who were homeless, or living in institutions, group facilities, or in households without telephones. The 2006 report of the National Violence Against Women survey was based on the much larger sample size of 8,000 men and 8,000 women. It estimated that \\"17.7 million women and 2.8 million men in the United States were forcibly raped at some time in their lives, with 302,091 women and 92,748 men forcibly raped in the year preceding the survey.\\" The report defines \\"rape\\" to include completed and attempted rapes. However, the vast majority of rapes were completed: \\"Among all respondents, 14.8 percent of the women and 2.1 percent of the men said they were victims of a completed rape at some time in their life, whereas 2.8 percent of the women and 0.9 percent of the men said they were victims of an attempted rape only.\\" In addition, many states define sexual crimes other than male-on-female penetration as sexual assault rather than rape. There are no national standards for defining and reporting male-on-male, female-on-female or female-on-male offenses, so such crimes are generally not included in rape statistics unless these statistics are compiled using information from states which count them as rape.  Rape statistics  Rape crisis statistics can be found from the FBI and the Bureau of Justice as well as the CDC and RAINN (which uses the other resources as its source).

These categories are referred to as types of rape. The types of rape described below are not mutually exclusive: a given rape can fit into multiple categories, by for example by being both a prison rape and a gang rape, or both a custodial rape and the rape of a child.  Date rape  The term \\"date rape\\" is used to refer to several types of rape, broadly acquaintance rape, which is a non- domestic rape committed by someone who knows the victim,Humphreys, Terence Patrick (1993). Gender differences in the perception of rape: The role of ambiguity (M.A. thesis) Wilfrid Laurier University and drug facilitated sexual assault (DFSA), where the rapist intentionally drugs the victim with a date rape drug so that they are incapacitated. Acquaintance rape constitutes the vast majority of reported rapes, while DFSA is infrequent. A frequently overlapping category is incapacitated rape, where the victim is incapacitated and unable to give consent ‚Äì this is often the result of intoxication, but can also simply be because the victim is asleep or has a medical condition. DFSA is when the rapist intentionally incapacitates the victim via drugs, while acquaintance rape can occur when the victim is not incapacitated. Acquaintance rape can occur between two people who know one another usually in social situations, between people who are dating as a couple and have had consensual sex in the past, between two people who are starting to date, between people who are just friends, and between acquaintances. They include rapes of co- workers, schoolmates, family, friends, teachers and other acquaintances, providing they are dating; it is sometimes referred to as \\"hidden rape\\" and has been identified as a growing problem in western society. A college survey conducted by the United States' National Victim Center reported that one in four college women have been raped or experienced attempted rape. This report indicates that young women are at considerable risk of becoming a victim of date rape while in college. In addition, there have been reported incidents of colleges questioning accounts of alleged victims, further complicating documentation and policing of student assaults, despite such preventative legislation as the Clery Act.  Gang rape  Gang rape occurs when a group of people participate in the rape of a single victim. Rape involving two or more violators (usually at least threeNeumann, Stephani. Gang Rape: Examining Peer Support and Alcohol in Fraternities. Sex Crimes and Paraphilia. Hickey, Eric W., 397-407) is widely reported to occur in many parts of the world. Systematic information on the extent of the problem, however, is scant. One study showed that offenders and victims in gang rape incidents were younger with a higher possibility of being unemployed. Gang rapes involved more alcohol and other drug use, night attacks and severe sexual assault outcomes and less victim resistance and fewer weapons than individual rapes. Another study found that group sexual assaults were more violent and had greater resistance from the victim than individual sexual assaults and that victims of group sexual assaults were more likely to seek crisis and police services, contemplate suicide, and seek therapy than those involved in individual assaults. The two groups were about the same in the amount of drinking and other drug use during the assault.  Spousal rape  Spousal rape also known as marital rape, wife rape, husband rape, partner rape or intimate partner sexual assault (IPSA), is rape between a married or de facto couple without one spouse's consent. Spousal rape is considered a form of domestic violence and sexual abuse. Research reveals that there are no significant difference in post-psychiatric disorders (depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, social phobia, and sexual dysfunction) when comparing victims of marital/partner, date, and stranger rape. A following study comparing marital and stranger rape victims also discovered that both types of victims experienced related types and levels of post-trauma distress. Historically, research has shown that often women do not believe that non-consensual sexual acts within a marriage constitutes as rape. From 1994 to 2010, in the United States, there was an overall decline of intimate partner violence of 63% in female victims and a decline of 64% in male victims.Catalano, S. M. (2012). Intimate partner violence, 1993-2010. Washington, DC: US Department of Justice, Office of Justice Programs, Bureau of Justice Statistics. Retrieved from: https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/ipv9310.pdf  Rape of children  Rape of a child is a form of child sexual abuse. When committed by another child (usually older or stronger) or adolescent, it is called child-on-child sexual abuse. When committed by a parent or other close relatives such as grandparents, aunts and uncles, it is also incest and can result in serious and long-term psychological trauma. When a child is raped by an adult who is not a family member but is a caregiver or in a position of authority over the child, such as school teachers, religious authorities, sports trainers (coaches) or therapists, to name a few, on whom the child is dependent, the effects can be similar to incestual rape.  Statutory rape  National and regional governments, citing an interest in protecting \\"young people\\" (variously defined but sometimes synonymous with minors) from sexual exploitation, treat any sexual contact with such a person as an offense (not always categorized as \\"rape\\"), even if he or she agrees to or initiates the sexual activity. The offense is often based on the fact that people under a certain age do not have the capacity to give consent. The age at which individuals are considered competent to give consent, called the age of consent, varies in different countries and regions; in the US, the age ranges from 16 to 18. Sexual activity that violates age-of-consent law, but is neither violent nor physically coerced, is sometimes described as \\"statutory rape\\", a legally-recognized category in the United States. Most states, however, allow persons younger than the age of consent to engage in sexual activity if the age difference between the partners is small; these are called close-in-age exemptions or a Romeo and Juliet exemption and even in countries where there is no official legal exemption prosecutions are infrequent.  Prison rape  Rates of prison rape have been reported as affecting between 3% and 12% of prison inmates in the US. Although prison rapes are more commonly same-sex crimes (since prisons are usually separated by sex), the attacker usually does not identify as homosexual.No Escape: Male Rape in U.S. Prisons - IV. Predators and Victims hrw.org This phenomenon is much less common elsewhere in the western world. This is partly because of the differences in the structure of the prison system in the US as compared to the prison systems in Canada, Australia and Europe. Statistically, there is a higher prevalence of mentally-ill individuals who are in prisons, instead of psychiatric facilities. These individuals are part of a high-risk group for sexual assault, as according to the NPREC, 12-13% of rape instances involves an individual who is mentally ill; 8 times more than the non-mentally ill prison population rape instances. The attacker is most commonly another inmate.Beck, Allen J. & Harrison, Paige M., July 2006, \\"Sexual Violence Reported by Correctional Authorities, 2005\\", Bureau of Justice Statistics, Special Report  Serial rape  Serial rape is rape committed by a person over a relatively long period of time and committed on a number of victims. Most times this type of rapist is unknown to the victim and follows a specific and predictable pattern of targeting and assaulting victims. A nationwide sample of serial rape cases that were reported to the FBI (Federal Bureau of Investigation) were analyzed and it was found that serial rapists showed a \\"high degree of criminal sophistication\\" and used less force against the victim. The more criminally sophisticated the rapist was the more sexual acts were performed. A perpetuator that has criminal sophistication means that the perpetuator is more likely to remove any evidence that might assist enforcement in their investigation. For example, fingerprints, semen, and weapons.  Payback rape  \\"Payback rape\\", also called \\"punishment rape\\" or \\"revenge rape\\", is a form of rape specific to certain cultures, particularly the Pacific Islands. It consists of the rape of a female, usually by a group of several males, as revenge for acts committed by members of her family, such as her father or brothers. The rape is meant to humiliate and bring shame upon the father or brothers, as punishment for their prior behavior towards the perpetrators. Payback rape is sometimes connected to tribal fighting.  War rape  Brennus and His Share of the Spoils, by Paul Jamin, 1893 War rapes are rapes committed by soldiers, other combatants or civilians during armed conflict or war, or during military occupation. It also covers the situation where girls and women are forced into prostitution or sexual slavery by an occupying power. During war, rape is often used as a means of psychological warfare in order to humiliate the enemy and undermine their morale. Rapes in war are often systematic and thorough, and military leaders may actually encourage their soldiers to rape civilians. Likewise, systematic rapes are often employed as a form of ethnic cleansing. War rape has been considered a war crime only since 1949. Article 27 of the Fourth Geneva Convention explicitly prohibits wartime rape and enforced prostitution. These prohibitions were reinforced by the 1977 Additional Protocols to the 1949 Geneva Conventions.Askin, Kelly Dawn (1997). War Crimes Against Women: Prosecution in International War Crimes Tribunals. Martinus Nijhoff Publishers. p. 17 .. Therefore, during the post-war Nuremberg Trials and Tokyo Trials, mass war rape was not prosecuted as a war crime. In 1998, the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda established by the United Nations made landmark decisions that rape is a crime of genocide under international law. In one judgement, Navanethem Pillay said: \\"From time immemorial, rape has been regarded as spoils of war. Now it will be considered a war crime. We want to send out a strong message that rape is no longer a trophy of war.\\"Quoted in citation for honorary doctorate, Rhodes University, April 2005 accessed at The word rape only began to be used to refer to sexual assault in the early 15th century, and its dominant usage remained to refer to abduction and robbery without any connotation of sexual assault until the modern period. Many classical references to rape during war do not refer explicitly to instances of sexual assault, but rather to the practice of abducting the women or property of the enemy during warfare.Oxford Etymological Dictionary, \\"Rape\\".  Rape by deception  Rape by deception occurs when the perpetrator gains the victim's agreement through fraud. In one case, a man pretended to be an official for a government who had power to cause negative impacts on a woman to pressure a woman into sexual activities. The courts held that he had falsely represented himself and thus used deception against the woman.  Corrective rape  Corrective rape is targeted rape against non-heterosexuals as a punishment for violating gender roles. It is a form of hate crime against LGBT individuals, mainly lesbians, in which the rapist justifies the act as an acceptable response to the victim's perceived sexual or gender orientation and a form of punishment for being gay. Often, the stated argument of the corrective rapist is that the rape will turn the person straight, \\"correcting\\" their sex or gender, i.e. make them conform to societal norms. The term was first coined in South Africa after well-known cases of corrective rape, such as that of sports star Eudy Simelane, became public.  Custodial rape  Custodial rape is rape perpetrated by a person employed by the state in a supervisory or custodial position, such as a police officer, public servant or jail or hospital employee. It includes the rape of children in institutional care such as orphanages. Custodial rape has been reported in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Malaysia, Sri Lanka, Iran, Cambodia, Nigeria, Kenya, Zambia and the United States. In India custodial rape has been a major focus of women's rights organizations, and has been an official category of rape defined under law since 1983. Indian law says this type of rape takes advantage of the rapist's position of authority and is therefore subject to extra penalty. The term custodial rape is sometimes used broadly to include rape by anyone in a position of authority such as an employer, money-lender, contractor or landlord, but under Indian law it refers only to government employees. Victims of custodial rape are frequently minorities, people who are poor, or low- status for example because of their caste. Researchers say custodial rape is part of a broader pattern of custodial abuse, which can also include torture and murder.  Perpetrator types  Nicholas Groth has described three types of rape, based on the goal of the rapist. This includes the anger rapist, power rapist and sadistic rapist. According to Howard Barbaree, a psychologist at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario, most rapes are impulsive and opportunistic, and committed by people who may commit other impulsive acts, including impulsive crimes. These rapists tend to show no anger except in response to their victim's resistance, and use little unnecessary force.  Further classification  As mentioned above, when differing acts of rape are defined and typified, whether by popular convention, research of the subject, or otherwise, the results are often neither exclusive nor exhaustive in scope. Some instances may fit two or more definitions, while others may remain as yet undefined. One example of this are the following sub-classifications created by American researcher Patricia Rozee: * exchange rape - rape occurring as the result of bargaining * punitive rape - rape used to punish or discipline * theft rape - rape that happens when a woman or man is abducted, in most cases to be used as a slave or a prostitute * ceremonial rape - rape involving defloration rituals * status rape - rape resulting from differences in hierarchy or social class Where they are not already typed above, many of these otherwise distinct forms could equally apply to other classifications (e.g. prison rape that is also punitive rape, war rape that is also theft rape, etc.)  See also  * Causes of sexual violence * Rape by gender * Rape statistics * Gray rape  References  Category:Crimes against women Category:Rape Category:Violence against men Category:Violence against women ","title":"Types of rape"},{"id":"5672700","text":"The Colonia (or La Colonia) is a neighborhood (Spanish: barrio) located in the central portion of the city of Oxnard, California, USA. The neighborhood was laid out by the Colonia Land Improvement Company in close proximity of the sugar factory and beet fields to house workers just east of the city's downtown business district. Long a Latino barrio, it is home to lower-income families, C√©sar Ch√°vez memorials and the La Colonia Youth Boxing Club, which has produced notable fighters such as Fernando Vargas, Roberto Garcia, Miguel Angel Garcia, Victor Ort√≠z, Brandon Rios and Mia St. John. The north to south boundaries are Camino del Sol to 3rd Street and the west to east boundaries are Oxnard Boulevard (formerly state route 1) to Rose Avenue. The neighborhood contains one private and two public elementary schools. There is a small branch of the Oxnard Public Library. History =Early history= The area was part of the Chumash region, which extended from Point Conception to Santa Monica and back into the foothills as far as the Coast Range. On May 22, 1837, the Rancho El Rio de Santa Clara o la Colonia was granted to former Santa Barbara Presidio soldiers Valentin Cota, Leandro Gonzales, Rafael Gonzales, Salvador Valenzuela, Vicente Pico, Rafael Valdez and Vincent Feliz. The rancho, which was commonly spoken of, or was in the rancho days, as the Colonia, extended from the Santa Clara River south to the present day Point Mugu Naval Air Station, or to the boundary of Rancho Guadalasca, and east from the Pacific Ocean to the present day 101 Freeway, or to the boundary of Rancho Santa Clara del Norte. California became a U.S. state in 1850 and, in the 1860s, most of the Colonia's lands were sold off to businessmen from the East Coast who were primarily interested in prospecting for oil. In 1873, Ventura County was formed from the southeastern section of Santa Barbara County. Hueneme was founded in 1874 by Thomas R. Bard. The Colonia Oil Company sold a lot of land to the newly formed Colonia Land Improvement Company, in 1897, for a townsite around a factory being built, two miles northeast of Hueneme, to produce sugar from sugar beets. In 1898, Oxnard was founded around what was originally named the Colonia Beet-Sugar Factory and began to grow. =1898 through 1960s= La Colonia is one of Oxnard's oldest neighborhoods. It was laid out by the Colonia Land Improvement Company just east of the city's downtown business district and in close proximity of the sugar factory and beet fields to house workers. Early in the 20th century, white farmers began selling parcels of land to Latino families. The area, once known as Colonia Gardens, boasted half the agricultural city's farm labor force and grew to a population of 8,000 people by 1948. It had its own newspaper, La Voz del La Colonia, which sponsored fiestas and parades. In 2019, author Margo Porras published \\"Growing Up in La Colonia: Boomer Memories from Oxnard's Barrio. The book focuses exclusively on Colonia and its rich history in Oxnard. The betabeleros Robert F. Kennedy in Cristo Rey Church The suspicious death of two Mexican immigrants in 1900 in an Oxnard jail that mysteriously caught fire brought tensions to a high between the labor force and the authorities. In this climate in 1903, Mexican immigrant workers joined with Japanese immigrant workers to form the Japanese Mexican Labor Association (JMLA) in response to the (Oxnard-based) American Beet Sugar Company slashing wages in half in what is called the Oxnard Strike of 1903. Subsequent strikes and marches were met with police brutality and escalated on March 23, 1903, when strike-breakers escorted by police were blocked in the streets by armed JMLA members. Five people were left wounded after shooting began between both sides; the event was subsequently blamed on the JMLA. After a few years of police brutality and several demonstrations, the JMLA won concessions from the American Beet Sugar Company growers of Oxnard and fell apart afterwards. In 1933, the Latino beet picking labor force decided to join the Cannery and Agricultural Workers Industrial Union (CAWIU) to gain a 50% increase in wages (35 cents an hour), eliminate the use of labor contractors, and gain free transportation to work, weekly paydays, and eight-hour work days. When the American Beet Sugar Company rejected their demands, the local Latino community marched with the beet pickers (\\"betabeleros\\") in a strike. The ACLU and International Defense Council soon joined the effort. The $42 million annual industry, economically crippled, responded by utilizing local law enforcement against the strikers and the community. The Oxnard City Government fought back as well. By founding the Homeowners Organization, they hoped to entice workers into ending the strike by guaranteeing them status as true Oxnard citizens. In August 1933, the betabeleros led a multi-cultural parade from La Colonia through Oxnard to the police headquarters where leaders met privately with police leaders on their recent actions against striking workers. After this meeting failed to bring peace, leaders of the strike held a public discussion of the police force as a tool of the ranchers and politicians. Subsequently ten betabeleros leaders were held in county jail without charges. This sparked ACLU members who had taken an interest in the situation to file petitions with the Department of Labor for rapid intervention. The ten men's immediate trial and acquittal allowed for relative peace since the strike had thus far gained laborers an increase in wages (one of their many demands). To this day, the strike represents a bitter obstacle in the community's relationship with the police. The zoot suit arrests This conflict with the Oxnard Police Department and the \\"upper tier\\" of society continued in the 1940s as the zoot suit culture emerged. Officers frequently detained, stripped, shaved and confiscated offending clothing from young men and women. In 1942, a group of men and women listening to outdoor music were tear gassed and brutally arrested, leading to greater apprehension within the community to deal with the authorities. =Crime rising (1970s through 1990s)= During the 1970s and 1980s, owners began renting their properties. Crime began skyrocketing as drugs, and then resulting gangs, created a mentality in the community against the police, who had historically never patrolled within the neighborhood and only entered on occasional emergency calls. Policemen that did enter the barrio in this time period did so in pairs and in vehicles often pelted with rocks and bottles. The 1990s saw Oxnard Police making a great effort to lower the crime rate and better their relationship with the community. However, the 1997 aggressive shooting of Oliverio Martinez by police and their later obstruction of emergency room procedures to interrogate him led to issues in the community. Nevertheless, after a 1993 police department storefront opened despite attempted arson, members of the community felt driven to return order to their neighborhood. Soon federal grants brought computer and job training programs, improvements to the parks, demolition of known locations of drug sales, and incentives to improve properties. =Rejuvenation period (2000 to present)= Starting roughly after 2000, La Colonia began a renovation project to improve its image in respect to the city. New construction on once empty lots or ramshackle homes began in much of the southern areas. The housing boom spurred development and re-investment. $59 million went into renovating 260 housing units at The Courts and Cesar Chavez School. The Our Lady of Guadalupe Parish plans to begin construction on a new church building within a year. The re-establishment of Ramona School was another example of this renovation. The elementary school established in 1940 was a keystone into the educational advancement that many residents of Colonia. Sadly the school fell into disrepair and was left unused by the mid 1990s. In 2000 the school district cleared the original school site and re-built a new school. A rededication of the school along with many invited Alumni from years past occurred in August 2000.JAMES E. FOWLER \\"Hundreds Say Last Goodbys to Ramona School\\" Los Angeles Times LAT Home: Collections July 21, 1991NANCY FORREST \\"Principal Eager for School's Reopening\\" Los Angeles Times Ventura County Roundup: Oxnard section November 08, 1999 Gang injunction In June 2004, the Oxnard Police Department and the Ventura County Sheriff imposed a gang injunction in over a area of the city in order to restrict gang activity. Some political activists lobbied against the injunction arguing that it amounted to racial discrimination, that it unconstitutionally banned assembly and expression through wearing Dallas Cowboys affiliated clothing, and that it was being used as a tool for the slow gentrification of La Colonia (this includes speculation that the gang injunction was instituted simply to allow for the economic viability of the downtown area). Anti-injunction proponents cited the Oxnard Police Department in their argument that since 1992, crime had dropped to half of what it once was and that of the 39 homicides charged against the Chiques since 1993 they had only actually committed four. Elements in the community fearing the injunction would increasingly marginalize the Hispanic youth of the city wrote letters into the local newspapers and tried to introduce an alternative plan to increase spending on gang prevention/pro-youth programs. The city council refused to contemplate such programs. However, other residents, long upset over criminal gang activity in their neighborhoods, supported the gang injunction. The injunction proved to be an effective tool against Oxnard's biggest and most dangerous gangs as the number of murders in the area fell from 22 in 2003 to 18 in 2004. It survived a court challenge to be upheld in the Ventura County Superior Court; the law was made permanent in 2005 and was soon implemented on another section of the city. Continued efforts by members of a local branch of LULAC and the grass roots movement committee on Raza Rights included more editorial letters in local newspapers and public discussions held over the efficacy of the injunction and the real aims of the City Council.

This scope includes both rape and sexual assault more generally. Most research indicates that rape affects women disproportionately, with the majority of people convicted being men; however, since the broadening of the definition of rape in 2012 by the FBI, more attention is being given to male rape, including females raping males. Since only a small percentage of acts of sexual violence are brought to the attention of the authorities, it is difficult to compile accurate rape statistics. Conviction rates differ by the gender of both the perpetrator and victim. Various studies argue that male- male and female-female prison rape are quite common and may be the least reported form of rape.Human Rights WatchNo Escape: Male Rape In U.S. Prisons. Part VII. Anomaly or Epidemic: The Incidence of Prisoner-on-Prisoner Rape.; estimates that 100,000‚Äì140,000 violent male-male rapes occur in U.S. prisons annually.Robert W. Dumond, \\"Ignominious Victims: Effective Treatment of Male Sexual Assault in Prison,\\" August 15, 1995, p. 2; states that \\"evidence suggests that [male-male sexual assault in prison] may a staggering problem\\"). Quoted in ; reports that \\"Greater percentages of men (70%) than women (29%) reported that their incident resulted in oral, vaginal, or anal sex. More men (54%) than women (28%) reported an incident that was classified as rape.\\" Furthermore, many rape cases take place when the victims are below the age of consent, bringing in the issue of child sexual abuse or statutory rape.  Gender differences  In the 2001 national Youth Risk Behavior Survey, 10.2% of girls and 5.1% of boys reported \\"[having] ever been physically forced to have sexual intercourse when [they] did not want to\\". In a 2010 study of heterosexual couples where sexual coercion existed, 45% reported female victimization, 30% reported male victimization and 20% reported reciprocal victimization. In 2011, a study supported by a research grant from the Department of Education and Science of Spain found based on a \\"convenience sample of 13,877 students in 32 nations\\" that 2.4% of males and 1.8% of females admitted to having physically forced someone into having sex in the last year.Manuel G√°mez-Guadix and Murray A. Straus. CHILDHOOD AND ADOLESCENT VICTIMIZATION AND SEXUAL COERCION AND ASSAULT BY MALE AND FEMALE UNIVERSITY STUDENTS, 2011. Access date June 2, 2016. In a 2014 study of 18,030 high school students, there was no statistically significant difference between males and females for the reported rate of having been physically forced to have sex.  Rape of females  In a 2000 research article from the Home Office, in England and Wales, around 1 in 20 women (5%) said that they had been raped at some point in their life from the age of 16 beyond.Rape and sexual assault of women: findings from the British Crime Survey. (PDF) . Retrieved on 2011-10-01. In 2011, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) found that \\"nearly 20% of all women\\" in the United States suffered attempted rape or rape sometime in their life. More than a third of the victims were raped before the age of 18. According to a 2013 report by the CDC, 28% of victimized heterosexual women and a full 48% of bisexual women experienced their first rape between the ages of 11 and 17. =Rape of females by males= Many rapes by males against females are unreported because of \\"fear of reprisal from the assailant\\" and because of \\"shame...and deep-seated cultural notions that the woman is somehow to blame\\". Researchers from the University of Surrey estimate that approximately 1 in 7 rapes by males against females are reported. Pregnancy may result from rape. The rate varies between settings and depends particularly on the extent to which non-barrier contraceptives are being used. A study of adolescents in Ethiopia found that among those who reported being raped, 17% became pregnant after the rape, a figure which is similar to the 15‚Äì18% reported by rape crisis centres in Mexico.Evaluacio¬¥n de proyecto para educacio¬¥n, capacitacio¬¥n y atencio¬¥n a mujeres y menores de edad en materia de violencia sexual, enero a diciembre 1990.

[Basic information file for mutually supportive feminist care for women rape victims.] Mexico City, Centro de Apoyo a Mujeres Violadas, 1985. A longitudinal study in the United States of over 4000 women followed for 3 years found that the national rape related pregnancy rate was 5.0% per rape among victims aged 12‚Äì45 years, producing over 32,000 pregnancies nationally among women from rape each year. Experience of coerced sex at an early age reduces a woman‚Äôs ability to see her sexuality as something over which she has control. The rape of women by men has been documented as a weapon of terror in warfare (see Wartime sexual violence). =Rape of females by females= Assault/rape by forcible stimulation of female genitalia by a female perpetrator is possible by digital manipulation, oral sex, strap-ons, other dildos or other foreign objects, or tribadism.Renzetti, Claire M. Violent Betrayal: Partner Abuse in Lesbian Relationships. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications, 1992, .Ristock, Janice. No More Secrets: Violence in Lesbian Relationships. New York: Routledge, 2002, .Girshick, Lori B. Woman-to-Woman Sexual Violence: Does She Call It Rape? (The Northeastern Series on Gender, Crime, and the Law). Boston: Northeastern University Press, 2000, . A telephone survey conducted in 2010 for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that 43.8% of lesbians reported having been raped, physically abused or stalked at some point by an intimate partner; of these, 67.4% reported the perpetrator or perpetrators as being exclusively female. In the same survey, approximately 1 in 8 lesbians (13.1%) reported having been raped in their lifetime, but the sex of their rapists was not reported. A 2005 survey by the California Coalition Against Sexual Assault (CALCASA) concluded that one in three lesbian-identified participants had been sexually assaulted by a woman. Fear of coming out, distrust of and/or indifference and hostility by the police, unwillingness to turn in members of the LGBT community, and a sense that female on female rape is not taken as seriously as rape by men causes some victims to be reluctant to report rapes by other women. In one publicized case involving students at Smith College in 2005, two women were charged with the rape of another, but the victim ultimately refused to testify, and charges were dropped.  Rape of males  A CDC study found that, in the US, 1 in 71 men had been raped or suffered an attempt within their lifetime. The same study found that approximately 1 in 21 or 4.8% men in a survey had been made to penetrate someone else, usually an intimate partner or acquaintance.Black, M.C., Basile, K.C., Breiding, M.J., Smith, S.G., Walters, M.L., Merrick, M.T., Chen, J., & Stevens, M.R. (2011). The National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey (NISVS): 2010 Summary Report. Atlanta, GA: National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, pp.1-2. A NVAW Survey found that 0.1 percent of men surveyed had been raped in the previous 12 months, compared to 0.3 percent of women. Using these statistics it was estimated that, in the US, 92,748 men had been raped in the previous year.P., Tjaden, & N., Thoennes (2000). Full Report of the Prevalence, Incidence, and Consequence of Violence Against Women. US Department of Justice, pp. 26. In another study by the School of Public Health at Boston University, 30 percent of gay and bisexual men reported having experienced at least one form of sexual assault during their lifetimes. The rape of men has been documented as an underreported weapon of war. There are some cases when men will speak up about being a victim of rape, such as in the documentary The Hunting Ground, which is about the prevalence of sexual assault on college campuses in the US and the failure of college administration to adequately deal with it. =Rape of males by males= Rape by males against males has been heavily stigmatized. According to psychologist Dr. Sarah Crome, fewer than 1 in 10 male-male rapes are reported. As a group, male rape victims reported a lack of services and support, and legal systems are often ill-equipped to deal with this type of crime. Several studies argue that male-male prisoner rape, as well as female-female prisoner rape, are common types of rape which go unreported even more frequently than rape in the general population.Human Rights Watch No Escape: Male Rape In U.S. Prisons. Part VII. Anomaly or Epidemic: The Incidence of Prisoner-on-Prisoner Rape.; estimates that 100,000‚Äì140,000 violent male-male rapes occur in U.S. prisons annually; compare with FBI statistics that estimated 90,000 violent male- female rapes occur annually. The rape of men by men has been documented as a weapon of terror in warfare (see Wartime sexual violence). Studies have documented incidents of male sexual violence as a weapon of wartime or political aggression in Uganda, Chile, Greece, Croatia, Iran, Kuwait, the former Soviet Union and the former Yugoslavia. Seventy-six percent of male political prisoners in El Salvador surveyed in the 1980s described at least one incidence of sexual torture, and a study of 6,000 concentration-camp inmates in Sarajevo found that 80% of men reported having been raped. In the case of the Syrian Civil War (2011‚Äìpresent), the male detainees experienced sexual abuse like being forced to sit on a broken glass bottle, having their genitals tied to a heavy bag of water, or being forced to watch the rape of another detainee by the officials.Amnesty International. 2012. 'I Wanted to Die': Syria's torture survivors speak out . London: Amnesty International Publications. =Rape of males by females= Male victims of sexual abuse by females often face social, political, and legal double standards. Some cases in the United States have received increased attention and sparked awareness within the population. Sometimes referred to as \\"made to penetrate\\" cases (by the CDC and the NISVS), male rape victims are forced to engage in penetration of the female without proper consent. In many cases, the male victims are under the influence of drugs or being held in life-threatening positions. The case of Cierra Ross'Cierra Ross, Chicago Mom, Charged With Raping Man At Gunpoint, Huffington Post, September 6, 2013. sexual assault of a man in Chicago gained national headlines and Ross was convicted of aggravated criminal sexual abuse and armed robbery with a bail set at $75,000. A similar case includes James Landrith, who was made to penetrate a female acquaintance in a hotel room while incapacitated from drinking, along with his rapist citing the fact that she was pregnant to advise him not to struggle, as this might hurt the baby. In the UK, the 1970s Mormon sex in chains case brought increased awareness of the possibility of female-on-male rape. A young Mormon missionary named Kirk Anderson went missing in 1977, in Ewell, Surrey, after being abducted from the steps of a church meetinghouse. A few days later, Anderson made a report to the police that he had been abducted and imprisoned against his will. He said that while he was chained to a bed, Joyce Bernann McKinney attempted to seduce him, and then raped him. News coverage was extensive, in part because the case was considered so anomalous, having involved the rape of a man by a woman. McKinney fled to the US, extradition was not pursued by Britain, and the English court sentenced McKinney in absentia to a year in jail. Under the then-Sexual Offences Act 1956, due to the victim's gender, technically no crime of rape was committed, though indecent assault of a man applied. Some male victims, including underage children, have been forced to pay child-support to their attacker when their statutory rapist conceives a baby as a result of the attack. Several widely publicized cases of female-on-male statutory rape in the United States involved school teachers engaging in sexual intercourse with their underage students. Each of the 50 states has laws regarding the age of consent, but all have it set at 16, 17 or 18. These laws make any sexual encounters between adults and minors under the age of consent sexual assault (see Mary Kay Letourneau and Debra Lafave).

Long term reactions may involve the development of coping mechanisms that will either benefit the victim, such as social support, or inhibit their recovery. Seeking support and professional resources may assist the victim in numerous ways. Physical impact =Gynecological= Common effects experienced by rape victims include: *Vaginal or anal bleeding or infection *Hypoactive sexual desire disorder *Vaginitis or vaginal inflammation *Dyspareunia ‚Äì painful sexual intercourse *Vaginismus ‚Äì a condition affecting a woman's ability to engage in any form of vaginal penetration *Chronic pelvic pain *Urinary tract infections *Pregnancy *HIV/AIDS =Pregnancy= * Pregnancy may result from rape. The rate varies between settings and depends particularly on the extent to which non-barrier contraceptives are being used. * In 1982, Fertility and Sterility, the journal of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, reported that the risk of pregnancy from a rape is the same as the risk of pregnancy from a consensual sexual encounter, 2‚Äì4%. * A 1996 longitudinal study in the United States of over 4000 women followed for three years found that the national rape related pregnancy rate was 5.0% per rape among victims aged 12‚Äì45 years, producing over 32,000 pregnancies nationally among women from rape each year. * In 1991, a study in a maternity hospital in Lima found that 90% of new mothers aged 12‚Äì16 had become pregnant from being raped, the majority by their father, stepfather or other close relative. An organization for teenage mothers in Costa Rica reported that 95% of its clients under the age of 15 had been victims of incest. * A study of adolescents in Ethiopia found that among those who reported being raped, 17% became pregnant after the rape, a figure which is similar to the 15‚Äì18% reported by rape crisis centers in Mexico.Evaluacio¬¥n de proyecto para educacio¬¥n, capacitacio¬¥n y atencio¬¥n a mujeres y menores de edad en materia de violencia sexual, enero a diciembre 1990.

As a result, it is less likely that an adolescent girl who has been forced into sex will use condoms or other forms of contraception, decreasing the likelihood of her not becoming pregnant. * A study of factors associated with teenage pregnancy in Cape Town, South Africa, found that forced sexual initiation was the third most strongly related factor, after frequency of intercourse and use of modern contraceptives. Forced sex can also result in unintended pregnancy among adult women. In India, a study of married men revealed that men who admitted forcing sex on their wives were 2.6 times more likely to have caused an unintended pregnancy than those who did not admit to such behavior. * Any pregnancy resulting from an encounter with a stranger carries a higher risk of pre- eclampsia, the condition in which hypertension arises in pregnancy in association with significant amounts of protein in the urine.Preeclampsia: Risk Factors. Mayo Clinic. Retrieved on 2012-08-22. Conversely, repeated exposure to the same partner's semen reduces the risk, through induction of paternal tolerance. =Sexually transmitted diseases= Research on women in shelters has shown that women who experience both sexual and physical abuse from intimate partners are significantly more likely to have had sexually transmitted diseases. Psychological impact Most rape survivors experience a stronger psychological impact in the initial period after their assault; however, many survivors may experience long-lasting psychological harm. = Immediate effects = Survivors of rape may often have anxiety and fear directly following their attack. According to a study on the reactions after rape by the American Journal of Orthopsychiatry, 96 percent of women said they were scared, shaking, or trembling a few hours after their attack. After even more time passed, the previous symptoms decreased while the levels of depression, exhaustion, and restlessness increased. = Anxiety = After an attack, rape survivors experience heightened anxiety and fear. According to Dean G. Kilpatrick, a distinguished psychologist, survivors of rape have high levels of anxiety and phobia-related anxiety. This includes and is not limited to the following: * Feelings of dread * Feeling nervous * Feeling tense or uneasy * Having panic attacks * Having an irrational response to certain stimuli * Having avoidance and/or escape response. = Post-traumatic stress disorder = Many survivors of rape have post-traumatic stress disorder. The National Victim Center and the Crime Victim's Research and Treatment Center released a report that found 31% of women who were raped develop PTSD at some point in their lives following their attack. The same study estimated 3.8 million American women would have rape-related PTSD, and 1.3 million women have rape-induced PTSD. = Depression = A study found that women who were raped were more depressed than women who were not. The study measured the level of depression using the Beck Depression Inventory test, and concluded that forty-five percent of the women assessed in the study were moderately or severely depressed. = Self-blame = Self-blame is among the most common of both short- and long-term effects and functions as an avoidance coping skill that inhibits the healing process and can often be remedied by a cognitive therapy technique known as cognitive restructuring. There are two main types of self-blame: behavioral self-blame (undeserved blame based on actions) and characterological self-blame (undeserved blame based on character). Survivors who experience behavioral self-blame feel that they should have done something differently, and therefore feel at fault. Survivors who experience characterological self-blame feel there is something inherently wrong with them which has caused them to deserve to be assaulted. A leading researcher on the psychological causes and effects of shame, June Tangney, lists five ways shame can be destructive: *lack of motivation to seek care; *lack of empathy; *isolation; *anger; *aggression. Tangney notes the link of shame and anger. \\"In day-to-day life, when people are shamed and angry they tend to be motivated to get back at a person and get revenge.\\" In addition, shame is connected to psychological problems ‚Äì such as eating disorders, substance abuse, anxiety, depression, and other mental disorders as well as problematic moral behavior. In one study over several years, shame-prone children were also prone to substance abuse, earlier sexual activity, less safe sexual activity, and involvement with the criminal justice system.Tangney, June Price and Dearing, Ronda L., Shame and Guilt, The Guilford Press, 2002 Behavioral self-blame is associated with feelings of guilt within the survivor. While the belief that one had control during the assault (past control) is associated with greater psychological distress, the belief that one has more control during the recovery process (present control) is associated with less distress, less withdrawal, and more cognitive reprocessing. This need for control stems from the just-world belief, which implies that people get what they deserve and the world has a certain order of things that individuals are able to control. This control reassures them that this event will not happen again. Counseling responses found helpful in reducing self-blame are supportive responses, psychoeducational responses (learning about rape trauma syndrome) and those responses addressing the issue of blame.Matsushita-Arao, Yoshiko. (1997). Self-blame and depression among forcible rape survivors. Dissertation Abstracts International: Section B: The Sciences and Engineering. 57(9-B). pp. 5925. A helpful type of therapy for self-blame is cognitive restructuring or cognitive-behavioral therapy. Cognitive reprocessing is the process of taking the facts and forming a logical conclusion from them that is less influenced by shame or guilt. Most rape survivors cannot be reassured enough that what happened to them is \\"not their fault.\\" This helps them fight through shame and feel safe, secure, and grieve in a healthy way. In most cases, a length of time, and often therapy, is necessary to allow the survivor and people close to the survivor to process and heal. = Psychological impact on men = In a study about the impacts of male rape, distinguished scholars Jayne Walker, John Archer, and Michelle Davies found that after their attack, male survivors had long-term depression, anxiety, anger, confusion about their masculinity, confusion about their sexuality, and grief. Ninety-seven percent of men reported being depressed after their attack. As well as this, approximately ninety-three percent of men report feelings of anxiety. Along with depression, the most commonly reported reaction is anger. Ninety-five percent of male survivors reported having fantasies of revenge or retaliation. Male survivors reported buying weapons to kill their assailants. Men also reported experiencing long-term crises with their sexual orientation and their masculinity. The male victims of rape felt powerless because they believed they lost their male pride and dignity. Many men reported grieving the loss of self-respect and self-worth. Ninety percent of male survivors lost respect for themselves because of their assault. =Suicide= Survivors of rape are more likely to attempt or commit suicide. The association remains, even after controlling for sex, age, education, symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder and the presence of psychiatric disorders. The experience of being raped can lead to suicidal behavior as early as adolescence. In Ethiopia, 6% of raped schoolgirls reported having attempted suicide. They also feel embarrassed to talk about what had happened to them. A study of adolescents in Brazil found prior sexual abuse to be a leading factor predicting several health risk behaviours, including suicidal thoughts and attempts. Sociological impact and mistreatment of victims After a sexual assault, victims are subjected to investigations and, in some cases, mistreatment. Victims undergo medical examinations and are interviewed by police. During the criminal trial, victims suffer a loss of privacy and their credibility may be challenged. Sexual assault victims may also experience secondary victimization and victim blaming including, slut-shaming and cyberbullying. During criminal proceedings, publication bans and rape shield laws operate to protect victims from excessive public scrutiny. =Secondary victimization= Rape is especially stigmatizing in cultures with strong customs and taboos regarding sex and sexuality. For example, a rape victim (especially one who was previously a virgin) may be viewed by society as being \\"damaged.\\" Victims in these cultures may suffer isolation, be disowned by friends and family, be prohibited from marrying, be divorced if already married, or even killed. This phenomenon is known as secondary victimization. Secondary victimization is a product of the pressure women feel in some cultures to be married at a young age, and save themselves for marriage. This Isolation suggests that a woman's whole life should be aimed at marriage, and if they are not married, that they have failed as a woman. While society targets secondary victimization mainly towards women, male victims can also feel shameful, or experience a loss of purity. Secondary victimization is the re-traumatization of the sexual assault, abuse, or rape victim through the responses of individuals and institutions. Types of secondary victimization include victim blaming and inappropriate post-assault behavior or language by medical personnel or other organizations with which the victim has contact. Secondary victimization is especially common in cases of drug-facilitated, acquaintance, and statutory rape. =Victim blaming= The term victim blaming refers to holding the victim of a crime to be responsible for that crime, either in whole or in part. In the context of rape, it refers to the attitude that certain victim behaviors (such as flirting or wearing sexually provocative clothing) may have encouraged the assault. This can cause the victim to believe the crime was indeed their fault. Rapists are known to use victim blaming as their primary psychological disconnect from their crime(s) and in some cases it has led to their conviction. Female rape victims receive more blame when they exhibit behavior which breaks the gender roles of society. Society uses this behavior as a justification for the rape. Similarly, blame placed on female rape victims often depends on the victim's attractiveness and respectability. While such behavior has no justified correlation to an attack, it can be used in victim blaming. A \\"rape supportive\\" society refers to when perpetrators are perceived as justified for raping. Male victims are more often blamed by society for their rape due to weakness or emasculation. The lack of support and community for male rape victims is furthered by the lack of attention given to sexual assaults of males by society. It has been proposed that one cause of victim blaming is the just world hypothesis. People who believe that the world is intrinsically fair may find it difficult or impossible to accept a situation in which a person is badly hurt for no reason. This leads to a sense that victims must have done something to deserve their fate. Another theory entails the psychological need to protect one's own sense of invulnerability, which can inspire people to believe that rape only happens to those who provoke the assault. Believers use this as a way to feel safer: If one avoids the behaviours of the past victims, one will be less vulnerable. A global survey of attitudes toward sexual violence by the Global Forum for Health Research shows that victim-blaming concepts are at least partially accepted in many countries. Victim blame can also be a result of popular media's use of sexual objectification. Sexual objectification is reducing an individual's existence to that of a sexual object. This involves dehumanization. A study conducted in Britain found that women who are objectified based on the clothes that they wear and what the media says about them, the more likely they would be to experience victim-blame after a sexual assault. Another study that investigated a large group of college students to see medias contribution to sexual objectification and its effects on victim- blaming, found that the more a person is exposed to media content that sexualizes women's bodies the more likely they are to participate in rape blame. It has also been proposed by Roxane Agnew-Davies, a clinical psychologist and an expert on the effects of sexual violence, that victim- blaming correlates with fear. \\"It is not surprising when so many rape victims blame themselves. Female jurors can look at the woman in the witness stand and decide she has done something 'wrong' such as flirting or having a drink with the defendant. She can therefore reassure herself that rape won't happen to her as long as she does nothing similar.\\" According to a multitude of studies, heterosexual men are the most likely to participate in victim-blaming. Men tend to blame other men for their own sexual assaults. They also tend to blame individuals who do not adhere to gender norms, such as crossdressers, transgender men, and homosexual men. Many of the countries in which victim blaming is more common are those in which there is a significant social divide between the freedoms and status afforded to men and women. Reporting a rape Some individuals have found that reporting their assault assisted them in their recovery process. Contacting their local police department, visiting a medical center, and/or calling the National Sexual Assault Hotline are several options that survivors may consider while seeking justice. Even so, only a small percentage of survivors decide to report their rape. Rape victims are less likely to report their sexual assault than simple assault victims. Between 2006 and 2010, it is estimated that 211,200 rapes or sexual assaults were unreported to police each year. Factors that may influence a rape reporting decision include gender, age, minority status, perceived outcomes, and social expectations. Furthermore, a rape in which the survivor knows the perpetrator is less likely to be reported than one committed by a stranger. The absence of physical injuries and involvement of drugs and/or alcohol also contributes to the decrease in reports. Specifically, female rape victims are more likely to report their cases when they feel more victimized due to serious bodily injuries. Female rape victims are less likely to report cases in which the perpetrator is a relative or acquaintance. Male rape victims may be hesitant to report rapes due to the stigma surrounding male rape, which can cause humiliation or fear of emasculation. Survivors who do not decide to report their rape to law enforcement are still eligible to receive a sexual assault forensic exam, also known as a rape kit. They are also still encouraged to seek support from their loved ones and/or a professional psychologist.  Recovering from a rape  The process of recovering from a rape differentiates among survivors for their own individual reasons. The nature of the attack, how survivors choose to cope with their trauma, and social influences are a few of the many variables that impact the healing process. Even so, recovery generally consists of three main themes: reaching out, reframing the rape, and redefining the self. Professional treatment may be needed to help assist with properly accomplishing these three factors. Cognitive Processing Therapy has been found to result in a decrease or remission of post trauma symptoms in survivors and to help them regain a sense of control. Due to its complexity, advancing through the healing process requires patience and persistence. In addition, meditation, yoga, exercise, rhythmic movement, and socialization may also provide elements of relief for survivors. Furthermore, support groups provide individuals with an opportunity to connect with other survivors and serve as a constant reminder that they are not alone.

Translations of this ancient dictionary's title include: 'regional words', 'regional expressions', 'dictionary of local expressions', and 'regional spoken words'. Yang Xiong's Fangyan is considered the \\"most significant lexicographic work\\" of the Western Han. His dictionary's preface explains how he spent 27 years amassing and collating the dictionary. Yang collected regionalisms from many sources, particularly the y√≥uxuƒÅn ( 'light carriage') surveys, which were a Zhou and Qin dynasty tradition of annually sending imperial emissaries into the countryside to gather folk songs and popular sayings, which recorded localisms from all over China and as far north as Korea. The Fangyan's full title is Y√≥uxuƒÅn sh«êzhƒï ju√©d√†i y«î sh√¨ bi√©gu√≥ fƒÅngy√°n (, 'Local expressions of other countries in times immemorial explained by the Light-Carriage Messenger').  Contents  Major Han-period dialect groups inferred from the Fangyan Fangyan originally contained some 9,000 characters in 15 chapters (Âç∑), but two chapters were subsequently lost. Definitions typically list regional synonyms. For instance, chapter 8, which catalogs animal names, gives regional words for hu (Ëôé 'tiger') in Han times. > > \\"Tiger: in the regions of Chen-Wei Song-Chu [Central China], some call it > lifu; in the regions of Jiang-Huai Nan-Chu [Southern China], they call it > li'er, and some call it wutu. From the Pass, east- and west-ward [Eastern > and Western China], some call it also bodu.\\" Comparative linguists have used dialect data from the Fangyan in reconstructing the pronunciation of Eastern Han Chinese (1st century CE), which is an important diachronic stage between Old Chinese and Middle Chinese. In the above example, Paul Serruys reconstructs \\"tiger\\" as Old Chinese *blx√¢g. Serruys also applied the techniques of modern dialectology to the distribution of regional words, identifying dialect areas and their relationships.  Terminology  Victor Mair proposed that fƒÅngy√°n be translated as topolect, while dialect should be translated into Chinese as ÈÄöË®Ä t≈çngy√°n. Based on this, \\"topolect\\" has been used to characterize other speech varieties where an identification as either \\"language\\" or \\"dialect\\" would be controversial. Examples include Scots and the various regional varieties of Arabic and Romani. In all of these situations, an identification of distinct languages by the straightforward criterion of mutual intelligibility may not be politically or socially acceptable to a significant number of scholars. For example, several varieties of Southwestern Mandarin are not mutually intelligible, and they would be classified as distinct languages within the Mandarin branch of the Chinese (or Sinitic) language family, if it weren't for the dominant social, historical, and political concept of Chinese as a unitary language. Mandarin, Southwestern Mandarin, the mutually unintelligible varieties of Southwestern Mandarin, and indeed the mutually intelligible dialects within those varieties are all termed \\"topolects\\".

CNA advances the practice and profession of nursing to improve health outcomes and strengthen Canada's publicly funded, not-for-profit health system. CNA represents Canadian nursing to other organizations and to governments nationally and internationally. It gives nurses a strong national association through which they can support each other and speak with a powerful, unified voice. It provides nurses with a core staff of nursing and health policy consultants and experts in other areas such as communications and specialty certification. CNA's active role in legislative policy influences the health care decisions that affect nursing professionals every day. It has published a large number of documents, including the Code of Ethics for Registered Nurses.  History  In 1907, representatives of 16 organized nursing bodies met in Ottawa to form the Canadian National Association of Trained Nurses (CNATN). By 1911, CNATN comprised 28 affiliated member societies, including alumni associations of hospital schools of nursing as well as local and regional groups of nurses. By 1924, each of the nine provinces had a provincial nurse's organization with membership in CNATN, and in that year, the national group changed its name to the Canadian Nurses Association (CNA).

Laura Gardin studied under Fraser at the Art Students League of New York from 1910 to 1912. Alone or with her husband she designed a number of U.S. coins, notably the 1921 Alabama Centennial half dollar, the 1922 Grant Memorial half dollar, the 1925 Fort Vancouver Centennial half dollar, and the 1926 Oregon Trail Memorial half dollar. In 1931 she was the winner of the competition to design a new quarter with George Washington on the obverse. Her winning design was ignored by the then-Treasury Secretary, Andrew Mellon, who selected a design by John Flanagan. Fraser's design was coined as a commemorative five-dollar gold piece in 1999. In 1924, she was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate member, and became a full Academician in 1931.

Ottawa Hills is one of five high schools of the Grand Rapids Public Schools. The school colors are orange and black, and the athletic teams are referred to as the Bengals. They were previously referred to as the Indians.  History  On April 30, 1923 the Grand Rapids Board of Education voted to purchase two city blocks, about of land, between Alexander Road and Iroquois and Cadillac Drives in Grand Rapids for $28,000. The original location for Ottawa Hills High School was to be built on this land, which was in the center of the new Ottawa Hills neighborhood being built on the former site of a golf course; the name was stipulated in the deed to the property. The original address of the school was 1900 Iroquois Drive, S.E., Grand Rapids. The building was started in 1924 and was finished the next spring. To carry out the Indian theme suggested by the name of the school, designs taken from Indian pottery, blankets, and rugs were used in a border about the main entrance, and directly above the door was an Indian head, which was later adopted as the symbol of the school. In September 1925, the doors of Ottawa Hills High School opened to about 650 students and thirty teachers under the direction of the first principal, Henry D. MacNaughton. Many of the teachers came from Strong Junior High School, where they had taught with Mr. MacNaughton. The Students came primarily from Central and South High Schools. Grades 7-1 to 10-2 were included. In 1931 the elementary wing was added to the building, two floors being used by the elementary grades, and a third floor by the high school. In 1939‚Äì40 the high school enrollment had reached 1,801, and the crowding increased as the elementary grades took over some of the rooms on the third floor. The congestion continued until 1953, when Mulick Park Elementary School opened, and the Ottawa Hills High School regained some of the much needed space. In 1972 Ottawa Hills High School moved to its current location at 2055 Rosewood Avenue, S.E., site of the former Ridgeview Junior High School. Circa 2013 the school had about forty teachers. GRPS was required to remove half of its teachers from their positions, and in the aftermath there was a shortage of permanent teachers. In 2014 the school had thirteen substitute teachers.  Athletics  Ottawa Hills was a member of the Grand Rapids City League. They competed in this league along with three other public high schools and three private schools. In 2008, the league disbanded and the City League schools joined the Ottawa-Kent Conference. Ottawa Hills now competes in the OK Gold. When Creston and Grand Rapids Central High School were merged in 2013, and City High-Middle School relocated to the former Creston campus at the same time, many Creston student-athletes were invited to join their new Central classmates, as well as all City student-athletes residing east of the Grand River, on Ottawa Hills' athletic teams.

Miskolc Plaza was built by Dutch-based Plaza Centers, as the 9th of its sixteen malls in Hungary. The shopping center was opened on June 13, 2000. Its full area is 35,351 m¬≤. The area rentable for businesses is 14,964 m¬≤ it hosts 103 businesses. The mall complex consists of three buildings connected by bridges. Building A is a two-storey building, hosting most of the shops around a large central hall. Building B hosts the cinema and some smaller shops, its ground storey is occupied by a car park and five smaller shops opening to the street. Building C is a three-storey car park. The car park accommodates 500 cars. The mall had 8 million visitors in the first year after its opening.

Classical antiquity  =General= From the classical antiquity of Greece and Rome into the Colonial period, rape along with arson, treason and murder was a capital offense. \\"Those committing rape were subject to a wide range of capital punishments that were seemingly brutal, frequently bloody, and at times spectacular.\\" In the 12th century, kinsmen of the victim were given the option of executing the punishment themselves. \\"In England in the early fourteenth century, a victim of rape might be expected to gouge out the eyes and/or sever the offender's testicles herself.\\"\\"The Medieval Blood Sanction and the Divine Beneficene of Pain: 1100‚Äì1450\\", Trisha Olson, Journal of Law and Religion, 22 JLREL 63 (2006) Despite the harshness of these laws, actual punishments were usually far less severe: in late Medieval Europe, cases concerning rapes of marriageable women, wives, widows, or members of the lower class were rarely brought forward, and usually ended with only a small monetary fine or a marriage between the victim and the rapist. In Medieval Europe, a woman's parents could forcibly marry her to a stranger without her consent, and, once she was married, she could no longer refuse to consent to sex: the medieval concept of rape did not allow for the possibility of being raped by one's husband. Medieval theologian Thomas Aquinas argued that rape, though sinful, was less sinful than masturbation or coitus interruptus, because it fulfilled the procreative function of sex, while the other acts violated the purpose of sex.Alan Soble, Sexual Investigations, NYU Press, 1998, p.10-11.Vern L. Bullough, Bonnie Bullough, Human Sexuality: An EncyclopediaDaphne Hampson, After ChristianityThomas Aquinas, Summa Theologica, question 154. \\"...it follows that in this matter [the sin of unnatural vice] is gravest of all. After it comes incest... With regard to the other species of lust, they imply a transgression merely of that which is determined by right reason, on the presupposition, however, of natural principles.\\" Here, unnatural vice includes, in decreasing order of sinfulness, bestiality, homosexual intercourse, any unconventional form of heterosexual intercourse, and 'uncleanness' (masturbation). 'Other species of lust' include intercourse with a consecrated virgin or a nun, rape, adultery, the seduction of a virgin, and 'simple fornication' (consensual intercourse between unmarried people.) = Greek mythology = The rape of women or youths is a common theme in Greek mythology. Among the rapes or abductions committed by Zeus, the supreme deity of the Greek pantheon, are Europa, Ganymede, and Leda the Nymph. The rape of Chrysippus by Laius was known as \\"the crime of Laius\\", a term which came to be applied to all male rape. It was seen as an example of hubris in the original sense of the word, i.e., violent outrage, and its punishment was so severe that it destroyed not only Laius himself, but also his son, Oedipus, his wife Jocasta, his grandchildren (including Antigone), and members of his extended family. = Ancient Rome = In Roman law, raptus (or raptio) meant primarily kidnapping or abduction;Diana C. Moses, \\"Livy's Lucretia and the Validity of Coerced Consent in Roman Law,\\" in Consent and Coercion to Sex and Marriage in Ancient and Medieval Societies (Dunbarton Oaks, 1993), p. 50; Gillian Clark, Women in Late Antiquity: Pagan and Christian Lifestyles (Oxford University Press, 1993), p. 36. sexual violation was a secondary issue. The \\"abduction\\" of an unmarried girl from her father's household in some circumstances was a matter of the couple eloping without her father's permission to marry. Rape in the English sense of \\"forced sex\\" was more often expressed as stuprum, a sex crime committed through violence or coercion (cum vi or per vim). Raptus ad stuprum, \\"abduction for the purpose of committing a sex crime,\\" emerged as a legal distinction in the late Roman Republic.Moses, \\"Livy's Lucretia,\\" pp. 50‚Äì51. The Lex Julia de vi publica,Digest 48.6.3.4 and 48.6.5.2. recorded in the early 3rd century CE but dating probably from the dictatorship of Julius Caesar, defined rape as forced sex against \\"boy, woman, or anyone\\".Amy Richlin, \\"Not before Homosexuality: The Materiality of the cinaedus and the Roman Law against Love between Men,\\" Journal of the History of Sexuality 3.4 (1993), pp. 562‚Äì563. See also Digest 48.5.35 [34] on legal definitions of rape that included boys. Although Roman law in the historical period recognized rape as a crime, the rape of women is a pervasive theme in the myths and legends of early Rome. The Augustan historian Livy seemed \\"embarrassed\\" by the rape motif and emphasizes the redeeming political dimension of traditional stories. The \\"rape\\" of the Sabine women was interpreted as showing that Rome was constituted as a \\"blended\\" population in which people resolved violence and coexisted by consent and treaty. The rape of the exemplary woman Lucretia by the king's son led to the overthrow of the monarchy and the establishment of the Republic.Mary Beard, J.A. North, and S.R.F. Price, Religions of Rome: A History (Cambridge University Press, 1998), vol. 1, pp. 1‚Äì10, as cited and elaborated also by Phyllis Culham, \\"Women in the Roman Republic,\\" in The Cambridge Companion to the Roman Republic (Cambridge University Press, 2004), p. 158. In the 50s BCE, the Epicurean poet Lucretius condemned rape as a primitive behavior outside the bounds of an advanced civilization,Pamela Gordon, \\"Some Unseen Monster: Rereading Lucretius on Sex,\\" in The Roman Gaze: Vision, Power, and the Body (Johns Hopkins University Press, 2002), p. 105. describing it as \\"a man's use of violent force and imposition of sexual impulse.\\"Lucretius, De rerum natura 5.964: Violenta viri vis atque impensa libido. Intercourse by force or compulsion, even if it took place under circumstances that were otherwise unlawful or immoral,See further discussion at Marriage in ancient Rome#Adultery and Sexuality in ancient Rome#Fidelity and adultery). left the victim legally without blame.Ariadne Staples, From Good Goddess to Vestal Virgins: Sex and Category in Roman Religion (Routledge, 1998), pp. 81‚Äì82; Jane F. Gardner, Women in Roman Law and Society (Indiana University Press, 1991), p.118ff. The official position under the emperor Diocletian (reigned 284‚Äì305 AD) held that:Gardner, Women in Roman Law and Society, p. 120. > The laws punish the foul wickedness of those who prostitute their modesty to > the lusts of others, but they do not attach blame to those who are compelled > to stuprum by force, since it has, moreover, been quite properly decided > that their reputations are unharmed and that they are not prohibited from > marriage to others.Digest 9.9.20. Although the law recognized the victim's innocence, rhetoric used by the defense indicates that jurors might harbor attitudes of blame.Richlin, \\"Not before Homosexuality,\\" p. 564. As a matter of law, rape could be committed only against a citizen in good standing. The rape of a slave could be prosecuted only as damage to the owner's property.Under the Lex Aquilia: Thomas A.J. McGinn, Prostitution, Sexuality and the Law in Ancient Rome (Oxford University Press, 1998), p. 314; Gardner, Women in Roman Law and Society, p. 119. People who worked as prostitutes or entertainers, even if they were technically free, suffered infamia, the loss of legal and social standing. A person who made his or her body available for public use or pleasure had in effect surrendered the right to be protected from sexual abuse or physical violence.Gardner, Women in Roman Law and Society, p. 119; McGinn, Prostitution, Sexuality, and the Law, p. 326. Men who had been raped \\"by the force of robbers or the enemy in wartime (vi praedonum vel hostium)\\" were exempt by law from infamia.Richlin, \\"Not before Homosexuality,\\" pp. 558‚Äì559, citing the jurist Pomponius, \\"whatever man has been raped by the force of robbers or the enemy in wartime (vi praedonum vel hostium)\\" ought to bear no stigma (Digest 3.1.1.6). There was no statute of limitations for rape; by contrast adultery, which was criminalized under Augustus, had to be prosecuted within five years.Gardner, Women in Roman Law and Society, p. 118. The rape of a freeborn male (ingenuus) or a female virgin is among the worst crimes that could be committed in Rome, along with parricide and robbing a temple.Quintilian, Institutio oratoria 4.2.69‚Äì71; Richlin, \\"Not before Homosexuality,\\" p. 565. Rape was a capital crime, and the rapist was subject to execution, a rare penalty in Roman law.Gardner, Women in Roman Law and Society, p. 118; Richlin, \\"Not before Homosexuality,\\" pp. 562‚Äì563. The victim's consent was usually not a factor in Roman rape cases, since raptus could refer to a successful seduction as well as abduction or forced sex. What had been violated was primarily the right of the head of household (paterfamilias) to give or withhold his consent. The consequences of an abduction or an elopement were considered a private matter to be determined by the couple and their families, who might choose to recognize the marriage.Gardner, Women in Roman Law and Society, pp. 120‚Äì121; James A. Brundage, Law, Sex, and Christian Society in Medieval Europe (University of Chicago Press, 1987, 1990), p. 107.  Christian Empire  Attitudes toward rape changed when the Roman Empire became Christianized. St. Augustine believed Lucretia's suicide was likely prompted by her shame at being violated and her fear over possible accusations of complicity.Augustine, ‚ÄúThe City of God,‚Äù (Hendrickson, 2004), p. 14-15. He also suggests that it might have been an attempt to expiate her guilt over involuntary signs of sexual pleasure which had encouraged Sextus in his abuse.Staples, From Good Goddess to Vestal Virgins, p. 164, citing Norman Bryson, \\"Two Narratives of Rape in the Visual Arts: Lucretia and the Sabine Women,\\" in Rape (Blackwell, 1986), p. 199. Augustine's interpretation of the rape of Lucretia (in The City of God Against the Pagans 1.19) has generated a substantial body of criticism, starting with a satire by Machiavelli. Historian of early Christianity Peter Brown characterized this section of Augustine's work as his most vituperative attack on Roman ideals of virtue. Augustine redefines sexual integrity (pudicitia) as a purely spiritual quality that physical defilement cannot taint; the Romans had viewed rape and other forms of stuprum (\\"sex crime\\") within a political context as crimes against the citizen's body and liberty.Peter Brown, Augustine of Hippo: A Biography (Faber, 1967); see also Carol J. Adams and Marie M. Fortune, Violence against Women and Children: A Christian Theological Sourcebook (Continuum, 1995), p. 219ff.; Melissa M. Matthes, The Rape of Lucretia and the Founding of Republics (Pennsylvania State University Press, 2000), p. 68ff.

Sanchez, Erotic Subjects: The Sexuality of Politics in Early Modern English Literature (Oxford University Press, 2011), p. 93ff. The first Christian emperor Constantine redefined rape as a public offense rather than as a private wrong.Brundage, Law, Sex, and Christian Society in Medieval Europe, p. 107. Since under Roman law raptus could also mean cases of abduction or elopement without the head of household's permission, Constantine ordered that if the female had consented, she should be punished along with the male \\"abductor\\" by being burnt alive. If she had not consented, she was still considered an accomplice, \\"on the grounds that she could have saved herself by screaming for help.\\"Gardner, Women in Roman Law and Society, 120. As a participant to the rape, she was punished under law by being disinherited, regardless of the wishes of her family.Charles Matson Odahl, Constantine and the Christian Empire (Routledge, 2004), p. 179; Timothy David Barnes, Constantine and Eusebius (Harvard University Press, 1981), p. 220; Gillian Clark, Women in Late Antiquity: Pagan and Christian Lifestyles (Oxford University Press, 1993), pp. 36‚Äì37, characterizing Constantine's law as \\"unusually dramatic even for him.\\" Even if she and her family consented to a marriage as the result of an elopement, the marriage was legally void.Theodosian Code 9.24.1.2‚Äì3; Cod. 9.13.1; Brundage, Law, Sex, and Christian Society, p. 107. Under the Emperor Justinian I, new penalties were enacted for the abduction (raptus) of nuns. Even attempting the abduction of nuns for marriage or sexual purposes was to be punished by death. Constantine's law against sexual abduction was changed to shift blame to the man, on the assumption that the participation of the woman, even if voluntary, was caused by male seduction. The law for other kinds of sexual violence continued to be handled by means of the older Roman legal principles governing cases of 'stuprum.'Nghiem Nguyen, \\"Roman Rape: an Overview of Roman Rape Laws from the Republican Period to Justinian's Reign\\" Michigan Journal of Gender and Law 13, no. 1 (2006): 110-111.  Type of crime  In some cultures, rape was seen less as a crime against a particular girl or woman than as a crime against the head of the household or against chastity. As a consequence, the rape of a virgin was often a more serious crime than of a non-virgin, even a wife or widow, and the rape of a prostitute or other unchaste woman was, in some laws, not a crime because her chastity could not be harmed. Furthermore, the woman's consent was under many legal systems not a defense. In seventeenth-century France, even marriage without parental consent was classified as rape.Catherine Orenstein, Little Red Riding Hood Uncloaked p 36 ISBN The penalty for rape was often a fine, payable to the father or the husband, as they were in charge of household economy.Sedney, M., \\"rape (crime)\\". Grolier Multimedia Encyclopedia. Scholastic Library Publishing, 2006 In some laws, the woman might marry the rapist instead of his receiving the legal penalty. This was especially prevalent in laws where the crime of rape did not include, as a necessary part, that it be against the woman's will, thus dividing the crime in the current meaning of rape, and a means for a couple to force their families to permit marriage. Modern doctrines today have different views on the type of crime that rape is; it may be seen as:Great Debates in Criminal Law, by Jonathan Herring, pp.92- 98 *rape as violence (principal wrong is the application of physical violence to the body, it is a physical harm - focuses on the body, on physical pain, injury) *rape as violation of autonomy (infringes on the right to decide with whom/when to have sexual relations, focuses on the mind; rape of men is seen as serious as rape of women; adopts broad definitions including rape by deception) *rape as invasion of integrity (a combination of the above views - focuses moderately on both body and mind) *rape as moral injury (an attack on the dignity of the woman victim, and by extension on the dignity of women as a class, a gendered crime) *radical feminist explanations of rape (sexual intercourse must be understood in the context of patriarchal society where women face systematic coercion and subordination; under these conditions genuine consent is difficult to be given; Robin Morgan argues: \\"Rape exists any time sexual intercourse occurs when it has not been initiated by the woman, out of her own genuine affection and desire\\"). Michelle Madden Dempsey and Jonathan Herring argue in Why Sexual Penetration Requires Justification, that sexual penetration of a woman by a man is a prima facie wrong, meaning that it requires justification in order to validate it, because of \\"the use of physical force required to achieve sexual penetration, the occurrence and risk of harm posed by sexual penetration, and the negative social meaning of sexual penetration in patriarchal societies.\\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/31473687_Why_Sexual_Penetration_Requires_Justification  Jewish conception   Islamic conception  According to a Sunni hadith, the punishment for committing rape is death, there is no sin on the victim, nor is there any worldly punishment ascribed to her.Sunan Abu Dawud . Most scholars treat rape as hirabah (disorder in the land).See, e.g., http://www.thenews.com.pk/top_story_detail.asp?Id=1369 and Asifa Quraishi. \\"Her Honor: An Islamic Critique of the Rape Laws of Pakistan from a Woman- Sensitive Perspective ,\\" in Windows of Faith: Muslim Women Scholar-Activists in North America, Gisela Webb (Ed.), Syracuse University Press (June 2000). Mentioned in verses Rape is defined as 'zina biljabr', fornication/adultery with the use of coercion or compulsion. Note that it has to be extra-marital, i.e. fornication/adultery; the rape charge cannot be brought against the husband by the wife, i.e. it cannot be within marriage. The Islamic law approach to rape provides a range of possible charges, and thus penalties, which the qadi may posit, hirabah being but one, yet the most severe of them. Thus the charge of zina may bring about a penalty of 100 lashes upon the perpetrator and the element of the use of force and or compulsion may be quantified, and thus punished serially or consecutively, that is a year's banishment, a prison sentence, a corporal sentence etc. It is to be noted that Hirabah is a Hadd penalty (i.e. one predicating a fixed choice, which in the case of Hirabah has three options at the discretion of the qadi). If the offence is deemed to not be a Hirabah offence then the penalties available to the qadi would be those of ta'zeer and will not be permitted to reach the level of either severe retributive physical harm (i.e. more than ten lashes of a whip) let alone execution. The interpretation and application of these laws is very controversial, not least due to modern ill-fated legislation, such as Pakistan's Hudood Ordinance, under General Zia ul-Haq, which arguably criminalizes the victim who fails to produce four witnesses, thus perverting the aim behind the law, to protect the victim of rape and grant her justice. In Islamic military jurisprudence, classical jurists laid down severe penalties for rebels who use \\"stealth attacks\\" and \\"spread terror\\". In this category, Muslim jurists included abductions, poisoning of water wells, arson, attacks against wayfarers and travellers (highway robbery), assaults under the cover of night, and rape. The punishment for such crimes were severe, including death, regardless of the political convictions and religion of the perpetrator.  War rape  Rape, in the course of warfare, also dates back to antiquity, ancient enough to have been mentioned in the Bible. According to the Roman ius gentium (\\"law of nations\\" or international law), inhabitants of a conquered town were spared personal violence if the war or siege ended through diplomatic negotiations. But if the army victoriously entered the town by force, the conquering men could and would rape women (and sometimes adolescent boys) of the defeated peoples as one of the spoils of war.On ancient Rome, see Sara Elise Phang, Roman Military Service: Ideologies of Discipline in the Late Republic and Early Principate (Cambridge University Press, 2008), pp. 244, 253‚Äì254, 267‚Äì268 et passim. See also Sex in the Roman military. Some portion or all of the population of a town taken by force might also become slaves, who lacked legal protections against rape and who might be exploited as prostitutes or non-consensual sexual companions. Rape, as an adjunct to warfare, was prohibited by the military codices of Richard II and Henry V (1385 and 1419 respectively). These laws formed the basis for convicting and executing rapists during the Hundred Years' War (1337‚Äì1453). Napoleon Bonaparte found rape committed by soldiers particularly distasteful. During his Egyptian Expedition, he declared that ‚Äúeverywhere, the rapist is a monster‚Äù and ordered that ‚Äúanyone guilty of rape would be shot.‚ÄùNapoleon Bonaparte, ‚ÄúAddress to the Army of Egypt,‚Äù Napoleon: Symbol for an Age, A Brief History with Documents, ed. Rafe Blaufarb (New York: Bedford/St. Martin‚Äôs, 2008), 44; J. David Markham, Napoleon for Dummies: A Guide for the Rest of Us!, (Hoboken: Wiley Publishing, Inc., 2005), 106. War rape as well as abduction of women was common both on behalf and Spanish and Mapuches in the Arauco War in Chile.  Bride kidnapping  Bride kidnapping may feature rape, but this is not necessarily so. The practice of bride capture has become elaborate and ritualised in some cultures, with suggested links to the origin of the honeymoon. Bride capture is common in the cultures of Central Asia, and is also found in Southern Europe and is additionally practised traditionally by the Hmong. Modern reevaluation  In 1563, the Council of Trent expressly declared that legal Catholic marriages had to be done with consent of both parties, but did not require parental consent, essentially declaring forced marriages invalid. This was not universally accepted: for example, in France, women were not granted the right to marry without parental consent until 1793. The criminal justice system of many countries was widely regarded as unfair to sexual assault victims. Both sexist stereotypes and common law combined to make rape a \\"criminal proceeding on which the victim and her behavior were tried rather than the defendant\\". Adult women were often extremely reluctant to bring up charges of rape: public admission of having been raped was severely damaging to one's social standing, courts tended to be skeptical of the charges, conviction rates were low, and, in the event that the accusation could not be proved, the victim could then be accused of committing adultery with the rapist (traditionally a serious offense that could have been punished by mutilation or even death). Certain classes of women, such as prostitutes, were banned from raising accusations of rape altogether. Since the 1970s, many changes have occurred in the perception of sexual assault due in large part to the feminist movement and its public characterization of rape as a crime of power and control rather than purely of sex. In some countries the women's liberation movement of the 1970s created the first rape crisis centers. This movement was led by the National Organization for Women (NOW). One of the first two rape crisis centers, the D.C. Rape Crisis Center (), opened in 1972. It was created to promote sensitivity and understanding of rape and its effects on the victim. Marital rape first became a crime in the United States in the state of South Dakota in 1975. In 1993, North Carolina became the last state to outlaw marital rape. The marital rape exemption was abolished in England and Wales in 1991 by the House of Lords, in its judicial capacity, in the case of R v R [1991] 1 AC 599 (more details). In the 1980s, date or acquaintance rape first gained acknowledgment. Rape crisis centers were created to serve survivors of all forms of sexual violence during any phase of their healing process. Rape crisis centers and other community-based service providers continue to grow and serve their communities by providing direct services and prevention programming. On September 2, 1998, the United Nations International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda delivered a precedent-setting verdict that made sexual violence a war crime.Fourth Annual Report of ICTR to the General Assembly (1999), accessed at August 13, 2014 This was followed in November 1998 by the decision of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia that acts of rape may constitute torture under international humanitarian law.Sixth Annual Report of ICTY to the General Assembly (1999) accessed at March 23, 2007 Current topics being debated are the marginalized victims of rape -- domestic violence and rape victims, marital rape victims, male rape victims of both male and female rapists, female-female rape victims, parental-rape incest victims, and child sexual abuse victims. Other emerging issues are the concept of victim blaming and its causes, male rape survivors, male-male rape, female sexual aggression, new theories of rape and gender, date rape drugs and their effects as well as the psychological effects of rape trauma syndrome. The ius primae noctis (\\"law of the first night\\") is a term now popularly used to describe a fictional legal right allowing the lord of an estate to take the virginity of his serfs' maiden daughters since little or no historical evidence has been unearthed from the Middle Ages to support the idea that such a right ever actually existed.The jus primae noctis as a male power display: A review of historic sources with evolutionary interpretation .

The newly independent company named James Sims as CEO and Robert Gett as head of Technology and Consulting. Six months later, Safeguard bought out John J. Donovan. CTP pioneered fixed time and price consulting services and Rapid application development (RAD), helping clients transform from mainframe-centric solutions to client-server architecture and packaged solutions. In May 1993, CTP under the stock symbol CATP went public at $5 a share. In 1999, it achieved peak revenues of $628 million, a market cap of ~$5 billion, and a global workforce of ~4000. In 2001, Cambridge Technology Partners was acquired by Novell and became their e-services division. Novell felt that the ability to offer solutions (a combination of software and services) was key to satisfying customer demand. The merger was apparently against the firm's software development culture, and the finance personnel at the firm also recommended against it. The CEO of CTP, Jack Messman, engineered the merger using his position as a board member of Novell since its inception and soon became CEO of Novell as well. He then hired back Chris Stone as vice chairman and CEO to set the course for Novell's strategy into open source and enterprise Linux.

The second group was denominated dysmyelinating diseases by Poser Therefore, since Poser demyelinating diseases normally refers to the myelinoclastic part. Demyelinating diseases of the CNS can be classified according to their pathogenesis into five non-exclusing categories: demyelination due to inflammatory processes, viral demyelination, demyelination caused by acquired metabolic derangements, hypoxic‚Äìischaemic forms of demyelination and demyelination caused by focal compression. Non inflammatory demyelination The four non-inflammatory possibilities are: * viral demyelination, * metabolic demyelination (Leukodystrophy and its sub-conditions, Adrenoleukodystrophy and Adrenomyeloneuropathy ), * hypoxic‚Äìischaemic forms of demyelination (Susac's syndrome, leukoaraiosis) and, * demyelination caused by focal compression. All these four types of demyelination are non-inflammatory and different to MSJohn R. Hesselink, MD, FACR. DEMYELINATING DISEASES OF THE BRAIN even if some leukoencephalopathies can produce similar lesions Lesions produced by CNS Inflammatory Demyelinating diseases (IDS) Typical lesions are similar to those of MS, but there are four kinds of atypical inflammatory demyelinating lesions: Ring-like (antibody-mediated), megacystic (tumefactive), Balo-like, and diffusely-infiltrating lesions. The list of the diseases that produce CNS demyelinating lesions is not complete, but it includes: * Standard multiple sclerosis, the most known and extended variant. *Devic's disease and neuromyelitis optica (NMO) (sometimes previously called optic-spinal MS) * Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis or ADEM, a closely related disorder in which a known virus or vaccine triggers autoimmunity against myelin. * Acute hemorrhagic leukoencephalitis, possibly a variant of Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis * Balo concentric sclerosis, an unusual presentation of plaques forming concentrenic circles, which can sometimes get better spontaneously. * Schilder disease or diffuse myelinoclastic sclerosis: is a rare disease that presents clinically as a pseudotumoural demyelinating lesion; and is more common in children. * Marburg multiple sclerosis, an aggressive form, also known as malignant, fulminant or acute MS. * Tumefactive Multiple sclerosis: lesions whose size is more than 2 cm, with mass effect, oedema and/or ring enhancement *AntiMOG associated encephalomyelitis: Lesions similar to ADEM sometimes and to NMO some others. It is not normal, but can also appear like MS even with biopsy. These cases resemble MS pattern-II lesions. The demyelinating lesion presents T-cells and macrophages around blood vessels, with preservation of oligodendrocytes and signs of complement system activation. =Confluent vs. perivenous demyelination= A special characteristic that makes a difference between MS and the several kinds of ADEM is the structure of the lesions, being strictly perivenous in ADEM and showing a confluence around veins in MS. Given that ADEM can be multiphase sometimes and MS can appear in children, this characteristic is often considered as the line that separates both conditions. The most typical of perivenous demyelination is ADEM ADEM demyelination ADEM can present plaque-like lesions which are indistinguishable from MS Nevertheless, ADEM White Matter appears intact under Magnetization Transfer MRI, while MS shows problems (See NAWM).Book, Clinical Neuroimmunology: Multiple Sclerosis and Related Disorders, Syed A. Rizvi, Patricia K. Coyle, Springer Science & Business Media, 3 sept. 2011 - 404 pages Besides ADEM does not present \\"black holes\\" under MRI (zones with axonal damage) and lesions develop strictly around veins instead of the more relaxed rule for MS NMO demyelination As with MS, several patterns have been described inside NMO, but they are heterogeneous inside the same individual, reflecting stages in the lesion evolution: * The first reflects complement deposition at the surface of astrocytes, associated with granulocyte infiltration and astrocyte necrosis * demyelination, global tissue destruction and the formation of cystic, necrotic lesions (lesion type 2). * Wallerian degeneration in lesion-related tracts (lesion type 3). * Around active NMO lesions AQP4 may selectively be lost in the absence of aquaporin 1 (AQP1) loss or other structural damage (lesion type 4). * Another pattern is characterized by clasmatodendrosis of astrocytes, defined by cytoplasmic swelling and vacuolation, beading and dissolution of their processes and nuclear alterations resembling apoptosis, which was associated with internalization of AQP4 and AQP1 and astrocyte apoptosis in the absence of complement activation. Such lesions give rise to extensive astrocyte loss, which may occur in part in the absence of any other tissue injury, such as demyelination or axonal degeneration (lesion type 5). *Finally, lesions with a variable degree of astrocyte clasmatodendrosis are found, which show plaque-like primary demyelination that is associated with oligodendrocyte apoptosis, but with preservation of axons (lesion type 6). Early active demyelinating NMO lesions may show complement within macrophages and oligodendrocyte apoptosis associated with a selective loss of minor myelin proteins, in addition to typical NMO features in a subset of active demyelinating NMO lesions =Confluent demyelination= Illustration of the four different types of glial cells found in the central nervous system: ependymal cells, astrocytes, microglial cells, and oligodendrocytes The demyelination around a vein is normally called \\"plaque\\". In MS plaques are reported to appear by coalescence of several confluent smaller demyelinations. MS lesions Normally MS lesions are small ovoid lesions, less than 2 cm. long, oriented perpendicular to the long axis of the brain's ventricles Often they are disposed surrounding a vein Demyelinization by MS. The Kl√ºver- Barrera colored tissue show a clear decoloration in the area of the lesion (Original scale 1:100) Active and pre-active lesions appear as hyperintense areas under T2-weighted MRI. Pre-active lesion here refers to lesions localized in the normal appearing white matter, without apparent loss of myelin but nevertheless showing a variable degree of oedema, small clusters of microglial cells with enhanced major histocompatibility complex class II antigen, CD45 and CD68 antigen expression and a variable number of perivascular lymphocytes around small blood vessels Using high field MRI system, with several variants several areas show lesions, and can be spacially classified in infratentorial, callosal, juxtacortical, periventricular, and other white matter areas. Other authors simplify this in three regions: intracortical, mixed gray-white matter, and juxtacortical. Others classify them as hippocampal, cortical, and WM lesions, and finally, others give seven areas: intracortical, mixed white matter-gray matter, juxtacortical, deep gray matter, periventricular white matter, deep white matter, and infratentorial lesions. The distribution of the lesions could be linked to the clinical evolution Post-mortem authopsy reveal that gray matter demyelination occurs in the motor cortex, cingulate gyrus, cerebellum, thalamus and spinal cord. Cortical lesions have been observed specially in people with SPMS but they also appear in RRMS and clinically isolated syndrome. They are more frequent in men than in women and they can partly explain cognitive deficits. It is known that two parameters of the cortical lesions, fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD), are higher in patients than in controls. They are larger in SPMS than in RRMS and most of them remain unchanged for short follow-up periods. They do not spread into the subcortical white matter and never show gadolinium enhancement. Over a one-year period, CLs can increase their number and size in a relevant proportion of MS patients, without spreading into the subcortical white matter or showing inflammatory features similar to those of white matter lesions. The first plausible explanation of their distribution was published by Dr. Schelling. He said: :The specific brain plaques of multiple sclerosis can only be caused by energetic venous back-jets set in motion by intermittent rises in the pressure in the large collecting veins of the neck, but especially of the chest.. But no problems with chest veins was ever found. This morphologic appearance was named Dawson's fingers by Charles Lumsden, after the Scottish pathologist James Walker Dawson, who first defined the condition in 1916. =Dawson's fingers= \\"Dawson's fingers\\" is the name for the lesions around the ventricle-based brain veinsPeter Reimer, Paul M. Parizel, Falko-Alexander Stichnoth. Clinical MR imaging: a practical approach.Dawson fingers, at Radiopedia of patients with multiple sclerosis and antiMOG associated encephalomyelitisWhich Brain Lesion Locations Differentiate Multiple Sclerosis (MS) from Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorders (NMOSD) and MOG Antibody Disorder (MOGAD)? (2399) Jasmin Patel, Antonio Pires, Anna Derman, Erik Charlson, Girish Fatterpekar, Ilya Kister, Neurology Apr 2020, 94 (15 Supplement) 2399; Though once thought to be specific of MS, it is known not to be the case. The condition is thought to be the result of inflammation or mechanical damage by blood pressureSchelling F. MS: The image and its message around long axis of medular veins. Dawson's fingers spread along, and from, large periventricular collecting veins, and are attributed to perivenular inflammation.Suzanne Palmer, William G. Bradley, Dar-Yeong Chen, Sangita Patel, Subcallosal Striations: Early Findings of Multiple Sclerosis on Sagittal, Thin-Section, Fast FLAIR MR Images Lesions far away from these veins are known as Steiner's splashes. Sometimes experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis has been triggered in humans by accident or medical mistake. The damage in these cases fulfils all the pathological diagnostic criteria of MS and can therefore be classified as MS in its own right. The lesions were classified as pattern II in the Lucchinetti system. This case of human EAE also showed Dawson fingers. =Tumefactive demyelinating lesions= Demyelinating lesions whose size is larger than 2 cm. They normally appear together with normal MS lesions, situation described as tumefactive multiple sclerosis. When they appear alone, they are usually named \\"Solitary sclerosis\\", being more difficult to diagnose. They look like intracranial neoplasms, and sometimes they get biopsied as suspected tumors. Proton MR spectroscopy can help in their diagnosis. =Demyelination process in MS= Demyelinization by MS. The CD68 colored tissue shows several Macrophages in the area of the lesion. Original scale 1:100 The hallmark of MS is the lesion, which appears mainly in the white matter and shows macrophage mediated demyelination, BBB breakdown, inflammation and axon transection. NAWM development Demyelinating lesions begin with the appearance of some areas named NAWM (normal appearing white matter) which despite its name, is abnormal in several parameters. These areas show axonal transections and stressed oligodendrocytes (the cells responsible for maintaining the myelin), and randomly, they show clusters of activated microglia named pre-active lesions. These pre-lesions normally resolve themselves, though sometimes they spread towards a capilar vein. BBB breakdown This is followed by the blood‚Äìbrain barrier (BBB) breakdown. BBB is a tight vascular barrier between the blood and brain that should prevent the passage of antibodies through it, but in MS patients it does not work. For unknown reasons special areas appear in the brain and spine, followed by leaks in the blood‚Äìbrain barrier where immune cells infiltrate. This leads to the entrance of macrophages into the CNS, triggering the beginning of an immune-mediated attack against myelin. Gadolinium cannot cross a normal BBB and, therefore, Gadolinium-enhanced MRI is used to show BBB breakdowns. Immune mediated attack After the BBB breakdown, the immune-mediated attack against myelin happens. T cells, are a kind of lymphocyte that plays an important role in the body's defenses. The T cells recognize myelin as foreign and attack it, explaining why these cells are also called \\"autoreactive lymphocytes\\". Demyelination, further inflammation and axonal transection are the result. The attack of myelin starts inflammatory processes, which triggers other immune cells and the release of soluble factors like cytokines and antibodies. Further breakdown of the blood‚Äìbrain barrier, in turn cause a number of other damaging effects such as swelling, activation of macrophages, and more activation of cytokines and other destructive proteins. Astrocytes can heal partially the lesion leaving a scar. These scars (sclerae) are the known plaques or lesions usually reported in MS. A repair process, called remyelination, takes place in early phases of the disease, but the oligodendrocytes are unable to completely rebuild the cell's myelin sheath. Repeated attacks lead to successively less effective remyelinations, until a scar-like plaque is built up around the damaged axons. According to the view of most researchers, a special subset of lymphocytes, called T helper cells, specifically Th1 and Th17, play a key role in the development of the lesion. Under normal circumstances, these lymphocytes can distinguish between self and non-self. However, in a person with MS, these cells recognize healthy parts of the central nervous system as foreign and attack them as if they were an invading virus, triggering inflammatory processes and stimulating other immune cells and soluble factors like cytokines and antibodies. Many of the myelin-recognizing T cells belong to a terminally differentiated subset called co-stimulation-independent effector- memory T cells. Recently other type of immune cells, B Cells, have been also implicated in the pathogenesis of MS and in the degeneration of the axons.Cause of nerve fiber damage in multiple sclerosis identified The axons themselves can also be damaged by the attacks. Often, the brain is able to compensate for some of this damage, due to an ability called neuroplasticity. MS symptoms develop as the cumulative result of multiple lesions in the brain and spinal cord. This is why symptoms can vary greatly between different individuals, depending on where their lesions occur. Lesion recovery Under laboratory conditions, stem cells are quite capable of proliferating and differentiating into remyelinating oligodendrocytes; it is therefore suspected that inflammatory conditions or axonal damage somehow inhibit stem cell proliferation and differentiation in affected areas It is possible to predict how much and when lesion will recoverJordan D. Dworkina el al. PREVAIL: Predicting Recovery through Estimation and Visualization of Active and Incident Lesions. NeuroImage: Clinical, 2 August 2016 Related to this, it was found in 2016 that neural cells of primary progressive patients (PPMS) do have some kind of problem to protect neuroprotection against demyelination or oligodendrocytes, compared to healthy subjects. Some genetics seem to underlie the problem as this was shown using Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) as neural progenitor cells (NPC) =Demyelination patterns in standard MS= Four different damage patterns, known as Lassmann patterns, have been identified by her team in the scars of the brain tissue in multiple sclerosis, and they are used sometimes as a basis for describing lesions in other demyelinating diseases. ; Pattern I : The scar presents T-cells and macrophages around blood vessels, with preservation of oligodendrocytes, but no signs of complement system activation. ; Pattern II : The scar presents T-cells and macrophages around blood vessels, with preservation of oligodendrocytes, as before, but also signs of complement system activation can be found. Though this pattern could be considered similar to damage seen in NMO, some authors report no AQP4 damage in pattern II lesions ; Pattern III : The scars are diffuse with inflammation, distal oligodendrogliopathy and microglial activation. There is also loss of myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG). The scars do not surround the blood vessels, and in fact, a rim of preserved myelin appears around the vessels. There is evidence of partial remyelinization and oligodendrocyte apoptosis. For some researchers this pattern is an early stage of the evolution of the others. ; Pattern IV : The scar presents sharp borders and oligodendrocyte degeneration, with a rim of normal appearing white matter. There is a lack of oligodendrocytes in the center of the scar. There is no complement activation or MAG loss. The meaning of this fact is controversial. For some investigation teams it means that MS is a heterogeneous disease. Others maintain that the shape of the scars can change with time from one type to other and this could be a marker of the disease evolution. Anyway, the heterogeneity could be true only for the early stage of the disease. Some lesions present mitochondrial defects that could distinguish types of lesions. Currently antibodies to lipids and peptides in sera, detected by microarrays, can be used as markers of the pathological subtype given by brain biopsy. After some debate among research groups, currently the heterogeneity hypothesis looks like accepted See also *Pathophysiology of multiple sclerosis *Internal cerebral veins *Great cerebral vein *Circle of Willis External links *Dawson Fingers in Multiple Sclerosis  Sources  Category:Multiple sclerosis ","title":"Lesional demyelinations of the central nervous system"},{"id":"5672889","title":"Northeast League Aces"},{"id":"5672891","text":"The Grand Rapids City League (GRCL) was a high school athletic league in Grand Rapids, Michigan. The GRCL originated in the spring of 1928 when seven Grand Rapids high schools competed in the first City Track Meet on May 18-19. The meet doubled as the Michigan High School Athletic Association (MHSAA) Class A Regional Meet. Catholic Central, Central, Creston, Davis Tech, Ottawa Hills, South and Union competed in the meet under the direction of newly appointed City League athletic director Henry Lightner. The league's final membership consisted of the four public high schools of the Grand Rapids Public Schools (Central, Creston, Ottawa Hills and Union) plus Catholic Central, West Catholic and Christian. The last league secretary was Melvin Atkins, the Grand Rapids Public Schools' Executive Director of Athletics and Activities. This made the GRCL among the few athletic conferences administered by a public school district that has a significant non-public school membership. Due to a lack of parity and competitiveness within the league because of changing enrollment figures and demographic shifts, the Grand Rapids City League had attempted in 2004 to disband and join the larger Ottawa-Kent Conference, which the majority of schools in metropolitan Grand Rapids are members of. The Ottawa-Kent Conference rejected the Grand Rapids Public Schools while extending an invitation to the three private schools. The member schools decided to keep the league intact and reapplied for Ottawa-Kent Conference membership in 2006. On February 8, 2007 the Ottawa-Kent Conference voted to invite the City League schools for membership. The 2007-2008 school year was the last year of competition for the City League as all schools accepted the invitation to join the Ottawa-Kent Conference. Members The following high schools, all within the City of Grand Rapids, were the final members of the Grand Rapids City League: * Grand Rapids Catholic Central High School * Grand Rapids Central High School (earlier called Grand Rapids High School) * Grand Rapids Christian High School * Grand Rapids Creston High School * Grand Rapids Ottawa Hills High School * Grand Rapids Union High School * Grand Rapids West Catholic High School Membership History Davis Technical High School was a member of the Grand Rapids City League from the 1920s until 1943, when its building was turned over to Grand Rapids Junior College. Grand Rapids South High School, alma mater of former U.S. President Gerald R. Ford, was a league member until the school was closed in 1967. Grand Rapids West Catholic High School was established in 1961, began varsity boys basketball a year later in 1962-1963 as an independent, and then joined the City League for the 1963-1964 school year. However, West Catholic's varsity football team did not have its first season until 1963-1964 and played as an independent for two years before entering league competition in 1965-1966. Also, from 1964-1965 through 1971-1972, Grand Rapids Christian High School was divided into Central Christian and East Christian high schools. Central Christian joined the league in 1964-1965 and East Christian became a member in 1965-1966. The Central and East Christian football teams played as independents from their first years in 1967-1968 through their last seasons in 1971-1972. The reunited Grand Rapids Christian High began participation in the City League in 1972-1973, with the football team starting league play in 1973-1974. The Grand Rapids City League's last competitions were held in the 2007-2008 school year. The league's member schools joined the Ottawa-Kent Conference prior to the 2008-2009 school year. =Membership timeline= DateFormat = yyyy ImageSize = width:1000 height:auto barincrement:20 Period = from:1928 till:2008 TimeAxis = orientation:horizontal PlotArea = right:30 left:0 bottom:50 top:5 Colors = id:barcolor value:rgb(0.99,0.7,0.7) id:line value:black id:bg value:white PlotData= width:15 textcolor:black shift:(5,-5) anchor:from fontsize:s bar:1 color:powderblue from:1928 till:end text: Grand Rapids Catholic Central (1928-2008) bar:2 color:powderblue from:1928 till:end text: Grand Rapids Central (1928-2008) bar:3 color:powderblue from:1928 till:end text: Grand Rapids Creston (1928-2008) bar:4 color:powderblue from:1928 till:1943 text: Grand Rapids Davis Technical (1928-1943) bar:5 color:powderblue from:1928 till:end text: Grand Rapids Ottawa Hills (1928-2008) bar:6 color:powderblue from:1928 till:1968 text: Grand Rapids South (1928-1968) bar:7 color:powderblue from:1928 till:end text: Grand Rapids Union (1928-2008) bar:8 color:powderblue from:1963 till:end text: Grand Rapids West Catholic (1963-2008) bar:9 color:powderblue from:1964 till:1972 text: Grand Rapids Central Christian (1964-1972) bar:10 color:powderblue from:1965 till:1972 text: Grand Rapids East Christian (1965-1972) bar:11 color:powderblue from:1972 till:end text: Grand Rapids Christian (1972-2008) ScaleMajor = gridcolor:line unit:year increment:10 start:1928 TextData = fontsize:L textcolor:black pos:(280,30) #

She first appeared in Wonder Woman, vol. 1, #231. Fictional character biography =Pre-Crisis history= Osira was first introduced as an alien who crash- landed on Earth centuries ago. She and her husband Hefnakhti were worshipped as gods by the ancient Egyptians for their advanced technology and knowledge of irrigation. Egyptian pyramids were erected in their honor. They brought peace to Egypt but an old high priest called Anankh spoke against the couple as their sense of peace meant taking away the people's free will. Anankh trapped Osira and Hefnakhti in a pyramid, where they remained until 1942. Two opposing tanks accidentally blasted the pyramid open and Osira was released. Osira discovered that Hefnakhti had expended too much of his alien energy trying to escape the pyramid and thus he didn't have enough energy to sleep throughout the centuries and died. Determined to bring about peace to the world once more, Osira took away the free will of the world's leaders and forced them into peace negotiations. Seeing the truth behind Osira's actions, Wonder Woman attempted to stop Osira and bring about free will to the world again. Osira's alien powers were too much for Wonder Woman though and Wonder Woman became a prisoner of Osira's. Osira then noted that Steve Trevor looked exactly like her now dead husband and proceeded to hypnotize him into thinking that he truly was Hefnakhti. Realizing this, Wonder Woman escaped her prison and battled Osira again. The spirit of Hefnakhti appeared to Osira during the battle and convinced her to stop the battle, leaving with him in peace. Thus the two disappeared, leaving Wonder Woman and Steve Trevor in a world at war again. =\\"One Year Later\\"= In conjunction with DC's \\"One Year Later\\" event, Osira appeared for the first time in Post-Crisis history. She was shown battling Donna Troy (who had taken over the title of Wonder Woman) and Cassie Sandsmark, the current Wonder Girl. As before, she was shown in an energy pyramid and emitted energy bolts from her hands. Powers and abilities Osira is able to shoot powerful force blasts from her hands and create a force shield around her body. Her power needs recharging and can be depleted.

The game was ported in 1986 to the Family Computer. It was Data East's very first home release for the platform, followed by Side Pocket (1987). Gameplay The game consists of 45 levels (30 in the Famicom version), and no background story or plot is given. The player controls a robotic aircraft called the FX-1, and collects weapon power-up parts (called a \\"wing\\") to progress through the levels and ultimately destroy a series of enemy bosses known as the GOBUNASU at every end of the level. The game consists of two different top-view screen levels, where the player can press the second button to descend to the ground whenever they do not have a power- up. The player is unaffected by attacks from airborne units while they are playing on the ground level, but the ship is automatically brought back into the air after a certain period of time. The player can still be hit by attacks from ground units while they are on the ground level, and can also lose their ship by crashing into obstacles. The 8-way joystick controls the player's movements, and one button is used for shooting, and the other is used for descending to the ground (or un-equipping wings). The background image continues infinitely when the player scrolls in the horizontal directions. Arcade screenshot The game was remade to the Famicom in 1986, but many changes were made to power-ups, sound effects, enemy attack patterns, and enemy appearances, making the gameplay considerably different from the arcade version. New additional background music was also included, and it also became possible to rapid-fire shots. Several warps and hidden items were also added, along with an ending screen. The bosses are also more resilient and requires multiple hits to destroy them. =Weapons= Weapons can be equipped onto the player's ship by collecting power-ups that corresponds to certain weapons. Weapons come in the form of \\"wings\\" that attaches to the ship's sides and each has different abilities. The weapon can be ejected by pressing the secondary button before equipping a new one, and may also be damaged by enemy attack. Damaged weapons will disintegrate and eject automatically. When the player has no weapon, the ship will simply shoot two small projectiles at the front. *Cannon: Fires 3 projectiles in rapid succession, providing a machine gun effect. *Wide: Fires 5 projectiles that spread wider as they travel across the screen. If one shot hits an enemy, all other shots automatically disappear and are fired again. *Multi: Fires 3 projectiles that changes direction between 4 different angles. *Van: Fires 6 projectiles that travels for an extremely short distance, forming a defensive barrier. *Side: Fires 7 projectiles, 3 each to the left and right and 1 forward. It is required to destroy certain types of bosses and obstacles *ANTI: Fires 4 projectiles, 2 forwards and 2 backwards, allowing it to attack enemies coming from behind. *Ground: Fires 2 projectiles to the ground platform to attack enemies lower than the ship.

Nomenclature SMAD1 belongs to the SMAD, a family of proteins similar to the gene products of the Drosophila gene 'mothers against decapentaplegic' (Mad) and the C. elegans gene Sma. The name is a combination of the two; and based on a tradition of such unusual naming within the gene research community.\\"Sonic Hedgehog, DICER, and the Problem With Naming Genes\\", Sep 26, 2014, Michael White. psmag.com It was found that a mutation in the 'Drosophila' gene, MAD, in the mother, repressed the gene, decapentaplegic, in the embryo. Mad mutations can be placed in an allelic series based on the relative severity of the maternal effect enhancement of weak dpp alleles, thus explaining the name Mothers against dpp.  Function  SMAD proteins are signal transducers and transcriptional modulators that mediate multiple signaling pathways. This protein mediates the signals of the bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), which are involved in a range of biological activities including cell growth, apoptosis, morphogenesis, development and immune responses. In response to BMP ligands, this protein can be phosphorylated and activated by the BMP receptor kinase. The phosphorylated form of this protein forms a complex with SMAD4, which is important for its function in the transcription regulation. This protein is a target for SMAD- specific E3 ubiquitin ligases, such as SMURF1 and SMURF2, and undergoes ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding the same protein have been observed. SMAD1 is a receptor regulated SMAD (R-SMAD) and is activated by bone morphogenetic protein type 1 receptor kinase.

Three-months regiment With the outbreak of the Civil War in the spring of 1861, President Abraham Lincoln called for volunteers from each Northern state. In April, recruiters quickly filled the quota for a number of regiments in the state of Ohio, with two regiments enlisting for 3-months, including the 1st Ohio Infantry Regiment and the 2nd Ohio Infantry Regiment. Mustering in at Columbus, Ohio, on April 18, 1861, the 1,000-man regiment was under the command of Colonel Lewis Wilson. It soon embarked on trains for Washington, D.C., where it served in the fortifications surrounding the capital until July. It was then attached to Schenck's Brigade, Tyler's Division, McDowell's Army of Northeastern Virginia. On July 16, the regiment marched to Manassas, Virginia, then the next day occupied Fairfax Courthouse. It participated in the fighting at the First Battle of Bull Run on July 21. It retreated to Washington following General McDowell's stunning defeat. When the 3-month term of enlistment expired, the regiment mustered out July 31, 1861. Three-years regiment After the term of service was over in August, a number of the men re-enlisted for 3-years in the reconstituted 2nd Ohio Infantry, under the command of Colonel Leonard A. Harris in the brigade of William \\"Bull\\" Nelson. The new 2nd Ohio was organized at Camp Dennison in Columbus from July 17 to September 20, 1861. The regiment left Ohio for service in Kentucky on September 4, operating near Olympian Springs, Kentucky, until November. It first \\"saw the elephant\\" (initial combat experience) in a skirmish at West Liberty, Kentucky, on October 23. The regiment was attached to 9th Brigade, Army of the Ohio from October until December. It served in a number of posts in Kentucky, including Louisville, through February 1862, when it was part of the army's advance on Confederate-held Bowling Green and Nashville. After briefly occupying Nashville, the regiment advanced to Murfreesboro, Tennessee, in March under Ormsby Mitchel. Five men from the regiment participated in the Great Locomotive Chase, with three being executed as spies. The regiment played a role in assaulting Confederates near Huntsville and Bridgeport in Alabama in April. After guarding the Memphis and Charleston Railroad much of the summer, the 2nd Ohio marched back to Louisville in August and September in pursuit of the Confederate army of Braxton Bragg, eventually fighting at the Battle of Perryville on October 8 before returning to Nashville for most of the rest of the year. The regiment, reassigned to the 1st Brigade, 1st Division, XIV Corps, Army of the Cumberland, saw more hard action at the Battle of Stones River in late December and early January. There, the regiment captured the flag of the 30th Arkansas Infantry, but lost Colonel John Kell and nine other men. Anson G. McCook (of the famed \\"Fighting McCooks\\") replaced Kell and led the regiment for the remainder of the war.McCook photo and bio The regiment remained in Murfreesboro until June when it participated in the Tullahoma Campaign, fighting at the Battle of Hoover's Gap. In the early autumn, it participated in the Chickamauga Campaign and the subsequent Battle of Chattanooga. Chickamauga in particular was hard on the regiment, with 183 soldiers killed, wounded, or captured, and 36 men who were taken as prisoners of war later died in the infamous Andersonville prison camp.State of Ohio Roll of Honor, 1886 As Ulysses S. Grant's army pursued the retiring Confederates into Georgia in late November through May 1864, the regiment saw action at a number of small battles, including Ringgold, Dalton, Tunnel Hill, Buzzard's Roost Gap and Rocky Faced Ridge. It served in the successful Atlanta Campaign in May, including more hard fighting at the Battle of Resaca and the fighting at Pickett's Mills, Kennesaw Mountain, and Peachtree Creek. It remained in the siege lines around Atlanta until August 1, when the much depleted regiment was ordered to the rear at Chattanooga as the term of enlistment neared expiration. The 2nd Ohio mustered out of the Union army in Columbus on October 10, 1864. Only 350 men were still on the active roster, although less than 150 were actually in the ranks when the regiment left Georgia. A number of the healthy men re-enlisted and were transferred to 18th Ohio Infantry. Colonel McCook stayed in the army as a brigade commander, ending the war with the rank of brigadier general. Casualties The regiment lost a total of 243 men during service; 9 officers and 96 enlisted men killed or mortally wounded, 138 enlisted men died of disease. Notable members Four men from the regiment received the Medal of Honor for their actions during the Civil War: * Corporal William Pittenger, Company G - (Andrews Raid) * Sergeant Major Marion A. Ross - (Andrews Raid) * Private James (Ovid Wellford) Smith, Company I - (Andrews Raid) * Private William Surles, Company G - (Battle of Perryville: \\"In the hottest part of the fire he stepped in front of his colonel to shield him from the enemy's fire.\\") See also * List of Ohio Civil War units * Ohio in the Civil War Notes References  * External links * Ohio in the Civil War: 2nd OVI by Larry Stevens * National flag of the 2nd Ohio Infantry, probably early war * National flag of the 2nd Ohio Infantry, probably later issue * Regimental flag of the 2nd Ohio Infantry *Civil War Index: 2nd Ohio Infantry - 3 Months Service in the American Civil War *Civil War Index: 2nd Ohio Infantry - 3 Years Service in the American Civil War Category:Military units and formations established in 1861 Category:Ohio Civil War regiments Category:1861 establishments in Ohio Category:Military units and formations disestablished in 1864 Category:1864 disestablishments in Ohio ","title":"2nd Ohio Infantry Regiment"},{"id":"5672958","text":"{ cellpadding=\\"2\\" style=\\"float: right; width: 307px; background: #e3e3e3; margin-left: 1em; border-spacing: 1px;\\" ! align=\\"center\\" colspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"background: #e3e3e3;\\"  Villama√±√°n ---- bgcolor=\\"#FFFFFF\\"  Province  Le√≥n ---- bgcolor=\\"#FFFFFF\\"  Autonomous community  Castile and Le√≥n ---- bgcolor=\\"#FFFFFF\\"  Postal code  24234 ---- bgcolor=\\"#FFFFFF\\"  Coordinates  ---- bgcolor=\\"#FFFFFF\\"  Altitude  751 m ---- bgcolor=\\"#FFFFFF\\"  Area  57,8 km¬≤ ---- bgcolor=\\"#FFFFFF\\"  Distances  302 km to Madrid 37 km to Le√≥n 152 km to Valladolid 320 km to A Coru√±a ---- bgcolor=\\"#FFFFFF\\"  Population  1,287 (2005) ---- bgcolor=\\"#FFFFFF\\"  Demonym  Spanish: Sardinero,a ---- bgcolor=\\"#FFFFFF\\"  Anthem  Himno de Villama√±√°n ---- bgcolor=\\"#FFFFFF\\"  Rivers  Esla ---- bgcolor=\\"#FFFFFF\\"  Mayor Jos√© Segundo Tejedor Gancedo (Partido Popular) } Villama√±√°n () is a town located in the south-west of the province of Le√≥n, Spain, in the area known as Esla, in the autonomous community of Castile and Le√≥n in Spain. It was originally known as Villamagna, but the name evolved to its current version, Villama√±√°n.  Demographics  Villama√±√°n has a population of 1,287 as of the INE's (Spanish Census Bureau) 2005 estimate. 633 of the population are males and 654 are females. Its total area is of 57,8 km¬≤.  Villama√±√°n (the town)  Villama√±√°n's Plaza Mayor Villama√±√°n is located in the south-west of the province of Le√≥n, Spain in the autonomous community of Castile and Le√≥n in Spain. It is located within a distance of 37 km of the city of Le√≥n. There are 736 households and its population is of 1,287. Some of the most famous places in town are Plaza Mayor or La Plaza (the town's biggest and main square where the Villama√±√°n's historical church and its tower are located, along with a famous candy and magazine shop), the historical and legendary church of La Zarza (literally means Church of the Blackberry, where the legend says the ghost of Virgin Mary appeared on a blackberry shrub and told the people who saw it to build a church there in her honor, hence the name Church of the Blackberry) and the park known as el Jard√≠n (the Garden). During the summertime every year Villama√±√°n becomes a touristic spot and many visitors from all over Spain and even from other countries worldwide come visit and stay in town, but definitely most of the visitors who come to Villama√±√°n come from the area in Spain called Asturias. There are two swimming pools in Villama√±√°n open to the public which also happen to be social spots for everyone in town, one, located right next to the Villama√±√°n's soccer field, visited every afternoon/evening by huge numbers of people, which is public and belongs to the Villama√±√°n City Hall in which there are three different sized swimming pools, a big grass area to tan and relax on, a tennis court and a coffee shop that sells all kinds of drinks as well and is also a candy shop known as el bar de la piscina (the swimming pool's bar/coffee shop); and the other swimming pool, which happens to be private but open to the public, located outside of town but very close to it, in the Mayorga-Astorga drive which leads to Villama√±√°n's neighbor town Valencia de Don Juan. This swimming pool and its number of visitors are much smaller than the public one's and it belongs to a small resort/hotel originally known as Covadonga but nowadays called Palazuelo. There are many places for fun and partying in Villama√±√°n. There are many coffee shops and bars in town such as Villamagna, Dacha, Casino, El Caf√© de Curro, Casa Miro (this one is a restaurant as well), El Espol√≥n and el bar de la piscina (this one open only during the summertime).

There's a brick factory in operation as well.  Local holidays  = Fiestas de la Zarza (Blackberry Holiday) = This is the biggest and most important holiday in Villama√±√°n. It takes place in early September, usually between the 5th, 6th or 7th and the 11th, 12th or 13th of the month. This holiday is celebrated in honor of Virgen de la Zarza or the Virgin of the Blackberry, who happens to be Virgin Mary, known as Virgin of the Blackberry because of the legend that says she appeared on a blackberry shrub in Villama√±√°n and told the people who saw her to build a church right there in her honor. The holiday is celebrated between those dates because those are the dates the legend says the Virgin of the Blackberry appeared on. Even though the holiday originally comes from something religious, the current way the holiday is celebrated absolutely lacks anything to do with religion, nor are the people who celebrate it religious or interested in religion at all for the most part. One of the most important things of these holidays are the infamous Pe√±as -groups of people from Villama√±√°n or somehow related to it, who usually are friends, that get together and create \\"clubs\\" in different places of the town, under certain requirements, to celebrate these holidays-. Pe√±as are definitely the life of the party and the most important aspect of the celebration of these holidays. It is a very big tradition for people who celebrate the Blackberry Holiday or Fiestas de la Zarza to ir de pe√±as (go from \\"pe√±a\\" to \\"pe√±a\\"), for the most part late at night until well past the down and enjoy everything they have to offer, mostly, but not limited to, alcoholic drinks and music. During Fiestas de la Zarza many events and activities for all ages such as contests, sport games and championships, etc., take place in the afternoons and evenings thanks to the pe√±as and to Villama√±√°n's City Hall. Also, every year art galleries from town show exclusive and private artwork owned and/or created by people from Villama√±√°n for a limited time only, while Fiestas de la Zarza last. View of the Villama√±√°n's soccer field, public swimming pool and tennis court The most famous of all events that take place during these holidays is Concurso de Paellas or the Paella Contest, in which all pe√±as cook paellas and compete for the price of the best paella of them all. People can go and freely eat as much paella as they wish. This event takes place right next to a private swimming pool property of an apartment complex known as El Palacio and it is infamous because every year, it has become a tradition that almost every visitor to the Paella Contest ends up in the swimming pool, by their own will or if not, being thrown in by others. It is also a big tradition that every evening and night during Fiestas de la Zarza different bands from all over Spain play in Plaza Mayor until the morning hours. Two nights during Fiestas de la Zarza there's a fireworks show. The big number of rides and attractions spread all over Plaza Mayor and its surroundings is also very popular during Fiestas de la Zarza, as well as the Fiestas de la Zarza inauguration, which consists on throwing fireworks and bells from the Plaza Mayor historical church's tower ringing so hard that they can be heard from anywhere in the town and a parade that goes through almost every street in Villama√±√°n. = San Antonio (St. Anthony) = Even though its official date is June 13, it is celebrated the prior or next Saturday to the official date. This holiday is celebrated in honor of St. Anthony, and even though the holiday is in honor of a religious figure, nowadays its celebration has nothing to do with religion. Neither are the people who celebrate it religious at all for the most part, which happens with every holiday in Villama√±√°n. It's believed in Villam√±√°n that St. Anthony brings good luck to the single and helps them find a significant other. It's famous for the beautiful bonfire that is made at night right next to the park known as el Jard√≠n's entrance and that various people jump off. Traditions of this night are the band that plays all night in Plaza Mayor and each year comes from different places in Spain, a local contests, celebrated only this night, which consists of selling numbered tickets and then one ticket is chosen and its owner gets several prices and the free cookies and Spanish extremely strong alcoholic drink orujo that are given by volunteers late at night to everyone. Nowadays, when the band finishes their show, people continue partying around town until well past the down in places such as the club Puv Savoy and the park el Jard√≠n. = Santiago (St. Jack) = Event though its official date is July 25, it's celebrated the prior or next Saturday to the official date. St. Jack is a national holiday in Spain but it's celebrated in a very special way in Villama√±√°n. It is a big tradition that this day people get together, usually in el Jard√≠n, in the late afternoon and evening to have different kinds of food and drinks that are given for free by volunteers and paid by Villama√±√°n's City Hall. The biggest food of them all is the famous Spanish food called chorizo and bread. The celebration lasts all night long and there's also a band, each year from different places from all over Spain, playing in Plaza Mayor. = San Marcos (St. Mark) = This holiday takes place on April 25. It is probably the smallest and least-celebrated holiday in Villama√±√°n. This day, people from Villama√±√°n go in the morning and afternoon to la Ermita de San Pedro (the Church of St. Peter) located between the town of Villama√±√°n and its neighbot town Villac√© right in front of a cemetery and eat bread and cheese and have various drinks that are given away free by volunteers and paid by Villama√±√°n's City Hall. Some years there has been a band playing in Villama√±√°n on this holiday as well. =S√°bado de Pi√±ata (Pinhata Saturday)= It is celebrated the next Saturday after Spain's carnival takes place. Along with the holiday of San Marcos, this one has the smallest number of visitors. A costume contest and dance is celebrated late at night, usually in the building known as el Sal√≥n Cultural, which lasts until the morning hours. Everyone in town wears a costume this night and a band also plays in the dance. Originally this dance and contest used to take place at the coffee shop / bar Casino. Spring inside of Villama√±√°n's park el Jard√≠n Monuments, historical buildings and places of interest Some of the most notorious historical buildings in Villama√±√°n are la Ermita de la Zarza (Church of the Blackberry), where the legend says the ghost of Virgin Mary appeared on a blackberry shrub that was right where the church is nowadays and told the people who saw it to build a church there in her honor (hence the name Church of the Blackberry) as well as the historical church located in Plaza Mayor along with its big tower that can be seen from anywhere in the town and even from outside of it and its bells that ring every hour and every half an hour nonstop, being heard from anywhere in town.

Wigbold was one of the most noted Likedeeler, along with G√∂deke Michels and St√∂rtebeker. The nickname Wigbold comes from wig (strife) and bold (courageous, bold). Whether Wigbold was a nickname, or possibly his real name, is unknown. Life Nothing is known about Wigbold's early life. Contemporary chronicles call him a Master of the Seven Arts. According to the historian Ludwig B√ºhnau, he may have attended university at Oxford. His name or variants of it are however not listed in A.B. Emden's Biographical Register of the University of Oxford to A.D.1500. It is possible that he studied under a different name, or that records of his time at Oxford have been lost. Wigbold is first mentioned as one of those pirates who left the Baltic Sea in 1395 for the North Sea. Matthias Puhle calls him a Likedeeler captain of the second generation, no longer members of the Mecklenburg aristocracy. They operated from East Frisia, where the local chieftains supported them. In 1400, the Hanseatic League sent a sizable military force to smash the group. Michels and Wigbold escaped at first, and probably spent a winter in Norway, before returning to East Frisia, where they were finally captured. One year after the death of St√∂rtebeker, they too were executed on the Grasbrook in Hamburg together with eighty other pirates.

Known from one or two subfossil carpometacarpus bones from the Mare aux Songes swamp and a few descriptions, this bird was about the size of a brant. Its appearance is unknown, except that its wings showed the typical color pattern of shelducks. It is sometimes considered conspecific with the Malagasy shelduck; in this case it would become the nominate subspecies (Alopochen mauritianus mauritianus). Sometimes, even in scholarly sources,E.g. here one can find references to a supposed \\"Mauritius swan\\" or \\"Mauritius comb goose\\". These refer to the initial misidentification of the Alopochen mauritianus bones as belonging to the genus Sarkidiornis, but as early as 1897 the true nature of this bird was realized.

Gulati is an alumnus of Cheshire High School in Cheshire, Connecticut. He graduated magna cum laude from Bucknell University and earned his M.A. and M.Phil. in economics at Columbia University. In 1991, he joined the World Bank through its Young Professionals Program and served as country economist for Moldova. Soccer development service Gulati has a longstanding involvement in the administration of the United States Soccer Federation, with former USSF president and Major League Soccer founder Alan Rothenberg calling Gulati \\"the single most important person in the development of soccer in this country\\". Gulati first became involved with the USSF through his employment as a youth coach and administrator in local Connecticut leagues while attending college. Gulati became a prominent volunteer federation staffer and adviser in the 1980s during the presidency of Werner Fricker, and began working in the game full- time upon taking the job of deputy commissioner of Major League Soccer when the league was formed following the 1994 FIFA World Cup hosted by the U.S., which Gulati played a major role in organizing. Gulati was elected USSF President in March 2006, succeeding Robert Contiguglia; Gulati had served as federation vice president for six years and played a key role in major USSF board decisions for many years prior to his election as president. In February 2010, he was re-elected for another four-year term as USSF president. In February 2009, Gulati announced that the USSF would bid for the right to host the World Cup in 2018 or 2022.

He made his first screen appearance on 23 December 1974 and remained a regular until 1983, when Hughes opted to quit. However, he reprised his role in December 1987 to facilitate the departure of Jean Alexander as Hilda Ogden. Despite numerous attempts from producers to persuade Hughes to return, he consistently declined, and Hughes' death in 2012 ruled out a return for the character. Casting Hughes joined the cast of Coronation Street as Eddie in 1974. He departed in 1983, but made a brief return in 1987 as part of Hilda Ogden's (Jean Alexander) departure from the show. Hughes was approached several times about a return to Coronation Street, but he declined all offers. Storylines =1974‚Äì1983= Eddie Yeats was born in Liverpool on 22 August 1941. In adulthood, Eddie had low-paid jobs and made extra cash by helping out disreputable friends with carrying out burglaries and selling stolen goods. In 1973, Eddie was caught by the police and sentenced to 18 months imprisonment. His cellmate at Walton Jail was Jed Stone (Kenneth Cope). When he was released, Eddie visited Jed's former landlady Minnie Caldwell (Margot Bryant) in Coronation Street, hoping she would give him a room before he had to go back to Walton. His friend, Nobby Harris (Donald Webster), asked for his help to rob a supermarket but Eddie chose to stay clean and pursue barmaid Bet Lynch (Julie Goodyear), but during a date, the police arrived to escort him back to prison. Eddie had told Bet he was on leave from the army, and she went off him. After serving the remainder of his sentence, Eddie returned to the street and ingratiated himself with the neighbours, hoping someone would let him stay with them. He tried to fix a date with Bet again but settled for friendship when he stopped her from taking an aspirin overdose when she found out her son, Martin Downes (Louis Selwyn), that had been adopted, was dead. Eddie went into partnership with Stan Ogden (Bernard Youens) in his window cleaning business and lodged with Minnie at Number 5 and later with builder Len Fairclough (Peter Adamson) at Number 9, but in September 1975 he hid a suitcase containing the proceeds of a burglary carried out by his friend Monkey Gibbons (Arthur Kelly) in Minnie's house, where it was found by the police. Eddie turned himself in and he was charged with dishonest handling of stolen goods and sentenced to another year in prison. Eddie returned to Coronation Street again when he was released from Walton in 1976. No one was happy to see him but he found lodgings at Number 13 for a few weeks when he got special wallpaper for Hilda Ogden's (Jean Alexander) mural and helped her decorate. Eddie built a playground at the back of the Community Centre for the local children, helping out Ken Barlow (William Roache). He wasn't trusted by the children's parents because of his criminal history, and forcibly removed from the project, despite Ken defending him. After his brief stay with the Ogdens, Eddie lived at Monkey Gibbons's house. Stan and Hilda began to regard Eddie as the son they never had. In 1977, he started a short-lived curtain- making business with Hilda but this ended when Mike Baldwin (Johnny Briggs) would not let Hilda use his factory. Eddie regularly tried to sell products to his neighbours, insisting nothing was stolen or faulty, but there was always a problem of some sort. He sold Rovers Return landlady Annie Walker (Doris Speed) a carpet with her initials on it. The initials were the same because the carpet came from the Alhambra Weatherfield Bingo Hall. His promise to get a colour television for the Ogdens was similarly unsuccessful as he only managed to get them a colour tinted screen. In 1978, Eddie was suspected by the police of stealing Stan's handcart and filling it with lead stolen from Farraday Street, even though Eddie's friend, Tiny Hargreaves (Jimmy Gardner), was the real culprit. The cart was impounded by the police when Hilda took it back and Eddie and Stan claimed it was stolen. But the police found Eddie's fingerprints on the cart and Stan discredited Eddie's alibi by claiming not to know him. Eddie forgave Stan when he told the police the truth, but to clear themselves, they had to admit who the real culprit was and Eddie hated the thought of shopping his friends to the police. Eddie started working for Len Fairclough in 1979, fixing roofs. In April, he took possession of six hens and made a coop for them in Number 13's garden. He convinced Hilda to keep them by promising they would bring the Ogdens money. However, when the Ogdens were ridiculed for their ownership of the hens, Hilda made Eddie cook them for food. Eddie found himself facing prison again when he entertained his friend Herbie Cook (Joe Black) at Betty Turpin's (Betty Driver) house, where Eddie was insulating Betty's loft. When Herbie stole a clock, Eddie was suspected as he had a key to Betty's house, due to the job he had been given. Herbie would not admit taking the clock but Eddie convinced Betty not to tell the police. In 1980, now nearly 40 years old, Eddie was keen to settle down and marry, firstly dating Lorna Ferguson (Annie Hulley) then Pat Marshall (Barbara Pierson). Eddie began experiencing difficulties and lost his job at the builder's yard when Len took on apprentice Martin Cheveski (Jonathan Caplan) and sacked Eddie because there was not enough work for all of them. Eddie considered starting his own business, but his neighbours ridiculed the idea, so he took a job as a binman. The Ogdens let him live at Number 13 on hearing he was earning a reasonable wage. On one shift, Eddie discovered a half-full can of hair dye in the Rovers' bins, belonging to landlady Annie Walker and returned it to her, believing she had discarded it by accident. Annie was angry and embarrassed and forbade Eddie to touch her bins again, going as far as to ask the council for new bin men. Eddie told Annie that his men were boycotting the Rovers, making him unpopular as the smell permeated the pub. The situation was not resolved until Annie apologized. In 1982 Eddie met Marion Willis (Veronica Doran) after talking to her on CB radio, calling himself \\"Slim Jim\\". To impress Marion, who referred to herself as \\"Stardust Lil\\", Eddie told her that he was a businessman and was not expecting to meet her, so when the situation arose, he borrowed the key to Mike Baldwin's flat from Hilda, then Mike's housekeeper, and told Marion the flat was his. Hilda found out first but Eddie, was unsure how to tell Marion the truth, had copied the keys and started meeting Marion there regularly. Mike found out when he found post and phone messages for Eddie, but he let Eddie meet Marion there one last time to tell her the truth. To Eddie's relief, the truth made Marion even more attracted to him, as she had been having doubts that they were right for each other due to his supposed wealth. When he realised he was in love with her, Eddie told Marion about his time in prison and when she accepted it, he proposed to her. They got engaged but Marion did not want to marry immediately. After a few months, Marion's ex-boyfriend, Phil Moss (Ken Kitson), turned up to try to win her back. Thinking he might not be good enough and feeling jealous, Eddie ended their engagement and Marion left but returned to tell Eddie that she wanted him. After reconciling with Marion, Eddie intended to raise money to buy a house and invested ¬£1000 in Geoff Siddall's (Edward Judd) car business. When Eddie realised that he had been conned, Marion left him and told him to stay away. Eddie did not take this well and disappeared but was eventually found in Liverpool. When Marion followed Eddie there, they reconciled again and their engagement was back on. In 1983, Marion discovered that she was pregnant, and they brought the wedding forward. Eddie took an instant dislike to Marion's mother, Winifred Willis (Joan Scott), as she constantly complained about Eddie and wanted Marion to live in Bury with her. At his stag night, Eddie got a black eye when he tried to stop Fred Gee (Fred Feast) from announcing Marion's pregnancy to the entire pub. Eddie's colleague, Curly Watts (Kevin Kennedy), was the best man and Hilda stood in for his mother as he married Marion at All Saint's church. After the wedding, Winifred decided that she did like Eddie after all. The Yeats' returned from their honeymoon to the news that Winifred had had a stroke and was seriously ill. Eddie was thinking about buying a new house but Marion persuaded him to move to Bury so that she could give her mother full- time care. Eddie got a transfer on the bins and the couple left Weatherfield to start a new life in Bury, with Eddie telling the Ogdens that they had been like parents to him. The following year, Eddie and Marion's daughter, Dawn, was born and Eddie phoned Hilda to ask her to tell everybody at the Rovers. =1987= Between November and December 1987, Eddie returned to Weatherfield to visit Hilda after she had been attacked and injured in a burglary. He leaves again soon after. Reception In 2019, a writer from Soap World included Eddie and Marion's ceremony in their feature profiling soap weddings.

He debuted on-screen during the episode airing on 29 June 1964 and remained for twenty years until his death on 21 November 1984. Stan was introduced by executive producer H. V. Kershaw. He has been portrayed as a well loved layabout and many of his storylines centred on his marriage to Hilda Ogden (Jean Alexander).  The Ogdens  The Ogdens, Stan and his wife Hilda (Jean Alexander), have been hailed as one of Coronation Street's favourite couples. The bickering pair stayed together through mishap and financial difficulty. A working-class couple, they remained a screen double act for 20 years until actor Bernard Youens died on 27 August 1984, forcing the writers of the soap to kill off Stan on-screen. A scene following Stan's screen funeral, showing Hilda weeping at the sight of Stan's signature spectacles, has been described as \\"one of the most moving moments in TV history\\" and \\"instrumental in winning [Jean Alexander] the Royal Television Society's Best Performance Award for 1984‚Äì1985\\". Neil Marland, who worked as Granada Television's stills photographer for 30 years, has described the scene as terribly poignant, adding, \\"Everyone was crying and the camera tracked in ‚Äì she had to undo his handkerchief, and in it were his glasses. She broke down sobbing. And, of course, I had to do a picture of this. So I left her for a minute or so sobbing. Then, as I got nearer, I just went, 'Jean, Jean...' And she sat bolt upright and said, 'What picture do you want Neil? I'm only acting'. It was just amazing because everyone on the floor was in floods of tears.\\" Commenting on the screen partnership, actress Jean Alexander has said, \\"It was a real pleasure working with Bernard Youens, who played my screen husband, Stan. Any success I have had is really down to Bernard because we worked well as a team and each knew how the other would want to play a scene. It was a happy screen partnership but it was strictly professional. We didn't socialise after work.\\" Alexander has stated that the Ogdens were a brilliant set-up: \\"They were the only couple in the street who were married ‚Äì permanently. They were the only ones who owned their own house where everyone else rented, they stayed together and didn't stray or have affairs and, yes, they bickered among themselves but let anyone else criticise either of them and they would be up in arms.\\" Hilda and Stan Ogden were voted Britain's top romantic TV couple in 2002, in a poll of more than 5,000 people carried out by NTL:Home. They beat off competition from Friends' couple Monica Geller and Chandler Bing (Courteney Cox and Matthew Perry) and Dot and Jim Branning from EastEnders (June Brown and John Bardon). In 2005 the couple topped another poll. The Ogdens were voted ITV's favourite TV characters in a survey by Broadcast magazine, which took place to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the network. They beat Minder's Arthur Daley and Prime Suspect's DCI Jane Tennison, who took second and third place respectively. Storylines Hilda and Stan met in 1943, when Hilda fell over an inebriated Stan in the blackout. Six days later, they married. The morning after they were married, Stan was arrested by the Military Police for overstaying his leave. Their bad luck carried on throughout their marriage. Stan Ogden first appeared in the Street in 1964, looking for his eighteen-year-old daughter Freda (Sandra Gough), who had run away from the family. Freda had changed her name to Irma and was working as Florrie Lindley's (Betty Alberge) assistant in the corner shop. Stan worked as a long-distance lorry-driver, and was away from home much of the time, leaving his wife Hilda (Jean Alexander) to look after their four children. When he was home, he was given to drinking bouts and terrible rages, which had caused their two younger children to be taken into council care. Stan managed to convince Irma that he had changed his ways, giving up lorry driving and trying to control his temper. He promised Irma anything if she would return to the family. At the time, No.13 Coronation Street was for sale ‚Äì Jerry (Graham Haberfield) and Myra Booth (Susan Jameson) had been forced out by financial troubles ‚Äì and Irma made it a condition of her return that Stan buy the house to provide the family with a permanent home. Stan surprised her by finding a deposit and buying the house for ¬£565. In June 1964 Stan moved his family; wife Hilda, son Dudley (Jonathan Collins) (who followed his sister's lead and changed his name to Trevor) and Irma, into No13 Coronation Street. Hilda quickly found work as a cleaner in the Rovers, and Irma also worked there for a while as a barmaid. Trevor proved more troublesome, however. He ran away with money stolen from the neighbours when he was fourteen and wrote to his parents telling them to disown him. Stan complied with the letter and Trevor was unmentioned for years. Irma quickly fell for footballer David Barlow (Alan Rothwell), and they were married in late 1965. After that, Stan and Hilda were left on their own. Stan had mended his ways, although he was still quite fond of his beer and quickly became Newton and Ridley's best customer. His reward: a free pint every day for life. However, this came under threat, when a mysterious illness led doctors to suspect he was allergic to alcohol. After a few days of desperation, test results proved otherwise, and Stan memorably burst into the Rover's Return, yelling \\"It's eggs!\\" While Stan remained faithful to his local, for a few years he drifted from job to job. At various times, he was a milkman (early mornings compensated by afternoons in the pub), a coalman, an ice-cream salesman, a chauffeur, a street photographer, a professional wrestler (in his only match he was thrown from the ring into Hilda's lap) and an artist (creating sculptures from scrap metal; this backfired when his masterpiece was taken to the tip by mistake). However, in 1969 Stan bought a window cleaning round, and this would remain his primary means of support for the rest of his life. Through many harsh years of drinking and rages, Hilda stuck by him, believing that he was her man, no matter what. They were uncommunicative to each other, and Stan left Hilda to take all responsibilities for their home, including trying to pay the bills with their limited resources. This proved too much for Hilda, and in 1967 she suffered a nervous breakdown and disappeared. She was found wandering in Liverpool a few days later, and recovered, but the lack of promise in their lives hung over them like a shadow. For Stan and Hilda, life was marginal at best. They were never more than a short step from absolute poverty. To prove himself a dab hand at whatever he turned his hand to, Stan installed a serving hatch between the kitchen/living room and the front room, but goofed and made it big enough for a canteen. Hilda liked the hatch, but pointed out that she had little use for it, as they never used the front room anyway. He also ruined Hilda's precious Alpine \\"muriel\\" that covered one entire living room wall when he fell asleep in the bath and overflowed water seeped through the floor. The seventies brought the Ogdens a long streak of bad luck. Their grandson Darren Barlow was killed along with his father David in a car accident in Australia in 1970, their house had to be fumigated, Stan was suspected of being a Peeping Tom, and a chimney accident caused coal soot to ruin their furniture. Hilda blamed their bad luck on No. 13 and ordered Stan to change the house number to No. 12A. Hilda prepared a roast lamb dinner to celebrate, but when she went outside to see the new numbers inadvertently locked them both out. By the time Stan broke in, their dinner was burned. It seemed that No. 13 wasn't unlucky, Hilda and Stan were. On top of this, the council ordered them to change the number back. On 12 December 1970, Stan heard about Minnie having been taken hostage at No. 5 by Joe Donnelli (Shane Rimmer), and exchanged himself for her, unaware that Joe was armed with a gun. He was forced by Joe to sing Christmas carols to him at gunpoint until the Police arrived and Joe ended it all when he shot himself. In the seventies, as Stan aged, he grew weaker and more tired. He often didn't work, claiming his back wasn't up to the job. Hilda had to assume responsibility not only for all the household chores and looking after Stan, but also scraped to make ends meet on her wages as a charwoman. One day she had had enough, and ordered Stan out. He went, and disappeared for three weeks, much to everyone's shock. Hilda enlisted the aid of Stan's drinking buddy Eddie Yeats (Geoffrey Hughes) to find Stan. Eddie finally tracked him to Hilda's brother's chip shop, where he was helping himself to the chips and his brother-in-law's girlfriend, Edie Blundell (Avis Bunnage). Hilda dragged Stan home, and things went right back to the way they were. Thirteen years after his disappearance, Stan and Hilda tracked Trevor down. He was married and living in a semi-detached house in Chesterfield. Stan and Hilda made a special visit, only to have his wife Polly (Mary Tamm) tell them that Trevor had led her to believe that his parents were dead. One high point of the Ogdens' marriage was in the late seventies, when they won a second honeymoon at the Savoy hotel. A limousine whisked them from Coronation Street to the hotel, where they received free champagne. Hilda decked out in a silk nightdress, only to find that, typically, Stan had fallen fast asleep. Although the night was a quiet one, it was a fond memory for Stan and Hilda as they entered old age. In the early eighties, Eddie Yeats secured a job as a binman, and became Stan and Hilda's lodger. He saw Stan and Hilda as surrogate parents, and they saw him as a son. Stan was in his sixties and slowing down (mirroring the deteriorating health of actor Bernard Youens). Eddie helped him on his window-cleaning round, later buying it and making Stan his employee. However, Stan's deterioration was rapid and Hilda took extra cleaning jobs to make some money, including cleaning Mike Baldwin's (Johnny Briggs) factory and Dr. Lowther's house. In December 1983, Stan and Hilda celebrated their greatest milestone, their Ruby wedding anniversary. Eddie left the same night to move to Bury, and thanked Stan and Hilda for being there for him and acting as surrogate parents. Stan's disappearance was explained as him being in bed, ill, and later admitted to hospital offscreen. He made his last on-screen appearance on 7 March 1984. After that, actor Bernard Youens became too ill to continue working and died on 27 August 1984. Shortly afterwards, the decision was made to kill off the character. On 21 November 1984, Hilda received a phone call telling her that Stan had died in hospital of gangrene. This led to a memorable scene as Hilda returned from the hospital after his funeral with a small package of Stan's belongings. As she silently opened the package, she found a case containing his spectacles. Opening the case, she begins to cry, and the episode ends in silence, without the usual theme tune. Reception In Dorothy Catherine Anger's book \\"Other worlds: society seen through soap opera,\\" she brands Stan as one of the \\"middle aged men\\" who \\"over the years have, stymied their wives' efforts to be accepted as respectable\\". In the January 1985 issue of British current affairs magazine Third Way Magazine, Coronation Street was slated for its attitude to unemployment, stating it seemed not to be a problem because Stan was a \\"well loved layabout\\".

Its history goes back to the Ottoman Empire's foundation period. The village is now included within the border of the Yƒ±ldƒ±rƒ±m district as a neighbourhood. Cumalƒ±kƒ±zƒ±k was founded as a vakƒ±f village. The historical texture of the village has been well protected and the civilian countryside architectural structures of the early Ottoman period are still intact. Because of this, Cumalƒ±kƒ±zƒ±k has become a popular but still unspoiled center for tourists. A group of similar villages which are placed close together between the foot of mount Uludaƒü and the valleys have been called Kƒ±zƒ±k in Turkish. The name stands for one of the twenty-four clans of the Oghuz Turks and the people from the villages also called Kƒ±zƒ±k. Similar villages, less well preserved, are Deƒüirmenlikƒ±zƒ±k, Derekƒ±zƒ±k, and Hamamlƒ±kƒ±zƒ±k (see Kƒ±zƒ±k for other places named Kƒ±zƒ±k in Turkey). Hamamlƒ±kƒ±zƒ±k was the village of the local baths (hamam), and Cumalƒ±kƒ±zƒ±k was named because people gathered there on Friday (Cuma, in Turkish) for worship. The Cumalƒ±kƒ±zƒ±k ethnography museum in the village's square displays historical objects from the village. Every June there is a raspberry festival. The famous Cumalƒ±kƒ±zƒ±k houses are made out of wood, adobe, rubblestones. Most of them are triplex houses. The windows upstairs are generally latticed and with a bay window. The handles and knockers on the main entry doors are made of wrought iron. Cobblestone streets are very narrow with no sidewalks, but a typical medieval gutter in the center for rain and waste water. Video showing the architecture and culture of Cumalƒ±kƒ±zƒ±k. A mosque, the fountain of 'Zekiye Hatun' next to the mosque and a bath with one dome are original from the Ottoman Empire. There is also a ruin of a church built by Byzantines. Cumalƒ±kƒ±zƒ±k holds 270 historical houses. Some of these houses are in process of restoration and maintenance, and 180 of them are still being used as dwellings. In 1969, the remains of a Byzantine church were unearthed southeast of the village in the foothills of Mt. Uludaƒü. Some architectural works are on display in the Archeological Museum of Bursa.

She was one of the first women officially commissioned as a war artist and was recognised as one of the leading women artists of her generation. Early life Airy was born in Greenwich, London, the daughter of an engineer, Wilfrid Airy, and Anna n√©e Listing, and the granddaughter of the Astronomer Royal George Biddell Airy.Biography from Thompson's Galleries, London Airy trained at the Slade School of Fine Art in London from 1899 to 1903, where she studied alongside William Orpen and Augustus John, and under Fred Brown, Henry Tonks and Philip Wilson Steer. Airy won prizes at the Slade School for portrait, figure, and other subjects including the Slade School Scholarship in 1902. She also won the Melville Nettleship Prize in 1900, 1901 and 1902. Work An Aircraft Assembly Shop, Hendon (Art.IWM ART 1931) During World War I, Airy was given commissions in a number of factories and painted her canvases on site in often difficult and, sometimes, dangerous conditions. For example, while working at great speed to paint A Shell Forge at a National Projectile Factory, Hackney Marshes, London in an extremely hot environment, \\"the ground became so hot that her shoes were burnt off her feet\\". This painting was featured in an exhibition at the Imperial War Museum's 2011‚Äì2012 exhibition Women War Artists. In June 1918 the Munitions Committee of the Imperial War Museum, IWM. commissioned her to create four paintings representing typical scenes in four munitions factories: These included, * National Projectile Factory at Hackney; * National Filling Factory at Chilwell, Nottingham, W G Armstrong Whitworth's at Nottingham; * Aircraft Manufacturing Co. at Hendon; * South Metropolitan Gas Co. The Chilwell commission was replaced by a request for a painting of work at the Singer factory in Glasgow. Airy was also commissioned by the Women's Work Section of the IWM during the war. In 1917 she was commissioned by the Canadian War Memorials Fund; and in 1940 by the Ministry of Munitions. Her work was also part of the art competitions at the 1928 Summer Olympics and the 1932 Summer Olympics. Airy was married to the artist Geoffrey Buckingham Pocock and for many years the couple lived at Haverstock Hill in Hampstead before moving to Playford near Ipswich. Exhibitions Airy's work was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1905 and in each subsequent year there until 1956, her first one- woman exhibition having been held at the Carfax Gallery in 1908. Airy also exhibited at exhibitions at the Paris Salon and in Italy, Canada and in the United States. She has been represented in the British Museum; the Victoria and Albert Museum; and the Imperial War Museum. Her work also appeared in the Art Gallery of New South Wales, Sydney as well as in Auckland, New Zealand; Vancouver and Ottawa in Canada; and in the Corporation Art Galleries of Liverpool, Leeds, Huddersfield, Birkenhead, Blackpool, Rochdale, Ipswich, Doncaster, Lincoln, Harrogate, Paisley and Newport. A painting by Airy, The Golden Plum Tree, shown at a 1916 exhibition of works by female artists was acquired by Queen Mary.

It runs for just over from an intersection with NY 3 in the town of Volney (east of Fulton) to an interchange with Interstate 790 (I-790), NY 5, NY 8 and NY 12 in the city of Utica. The route follows a generally northwest‚Äìsoutheast alignment between the two points, passing along the north shore of Oneida Lake and directly serving the city of Rome. As NY 49 heads east, it connects to several highways of regional importance, such as I-81 in the village of Central Square and NY 13 in the town of Vienna. Most of NY 49 is a two-lane surface road; however, the section between Rome and Utica is a freeway known as the Utica‚ÄìRome Expressway. When it was originally assigned in the 1920s, NY 49 began at Central Square and ended at Rome. It was extended to roughly its current length in 1930, replacing NY 76 west of Marcy and utilizing previously unnumbered highways west of Central Square and east of Marcy. The section of NY 49 between Rome and Utica originally followed a surface road alongside the Mohawk River; however, it was rerouted onto the Utica‚ÄìRome Expressway as sections of the road opened to traffic. The first segment of the freeway was finished in 1960; the final piece was completed in 2003. Route description =West of Rome= NY 49 begins at an intersection with NY 3 in Volney. The route heads eastward, intersecting with NY 264 just outside Pennellville. The route crosses some local and county roads before entering Central Square, where it intersects with U.S. Route 11 (US 11) in the village center. It is not long after that Route 49 meets I-81 at exit 32\\\\. Route 49 leaves Central Square and heads southeast toward both Constantia and the Oneida Lake shoreline. NY 49 eastbound in Central Square East of the hamlet of Constantia, the highway begins to parallel the north shore of Oneida Lake. As the lakeside roadway, NY 49 provides access to both Bernhards Bay and Cleveland, two communities situated on the northern edge of the lake, before crossing into Oneida County and intersecting with NY 13 at the northeast corner of Oneida Lake in the town of Vienna. Here, NY 13 joins NY 49, overlapping the route to the hamlet of Vienna. While NY 13 heads north toward Camden, NY 49 continues eastward, loosely paralleling Fish Creek and the Erie Canal as it heads through rural Oneida County. Midway between the hamlet of Vienna and downtown Rome, NY 49 crosses over Fish Creek and enters the westernmost portion of Rome. Unlike eastern Rome, home to the downtown district, western Rome is largely rural and undeveloped, as evidenced by the Rome Sand Plains located along the northern edge of NY 49\\\\. After of rural surroundings, the route passes out of Rome and into Verona upon traversing Wood Creek. The road continues south to the community of New London, where it intersects and joins NY 46 on the north bank of the Erie Canal. Routes 49 and 46 head to the northeast, separating from the canal as it reenters Rome. Northwest of downtown, the routes are joined by NY 69 as they enter downtown on Erie Boulevard. At Black River Boulevard, Route 46 turns off; however, NY 26 turns onto Erie Boulevard, taking the place of NY 46 in the three-route concurrency. Together, Routes 26, 49 and 69 head south to a directional T interchange with NY 365, the first exit on the Utica‚ÄìRome Expressway. While NY 26 leaves to the west, NY 49 and NY 69 head east, embarking on an overlap with NY 365. =Utica‚ÄìRome Expressway= Looking west at the interchange between NY 49 and NY 291 in Marcy At the first interchange east of the directional T junction, the expressway meets NY 233 as NY 69 exits to follow Rome‚ÄìOriskany Road to Utica. NY 49 and NY 365 continue on, turning northward to pass over the Mohawk River, the CSX Transportation Rome yard, and the Erie Canal in quick succession near the eastern edge of downtown Rome. Shortly over passing over the canal, NY 365 exits the expressway as well, leaving only NY 49 on the roadway. As the expressway curves back to the east, it crosses a railroad spur leading to the former Griffiss Air Force Base at-grade, a rare occurrence on limited-access highways. Route 49 then meets NY 825, the vehicular southern entrance to the ex-base, by way of an interchange before leaving the Rome limits. As the expressway continues southeast through the towns of Floyd and Marcy toward Utica, it parallels both the Erie Canal, located due south of the roadway, and the Mohawk River, situated between the canal and the CSX Transportation mainline. In Marcy, NY 49 has an exit for River Street, a connector between the expressway and Oriskany, and another for NY 291 near the hamlet of Marcy. Farther east, the freeway meets Cavanaugh Road by way of a parclo interchange. Just east of Cavanaugh Road, the median of the expressway widens as it heads toward the New York State Thruway (I-90). At the Thruway, the eastbound lanes of NY 49 cross over I-90 while the westbound lanes do not, creating an unusual situation in that its westbound lanes run parallel to the Thruway to the latter's north, with the eastbound lanes to the south. North of downtown Utica, NY 49 encounters Edic Road. The expressway officially enters Utica shortly afterward, where Route 49 terminates at a complex interchange between itself, NY 5, NY 8, NY 12, and I-790. Although NY 49 ends, the expressway continues for an additional to Leland Avenue as NY 5. History NY 46 north and NY 49 and NY 69 east in Rome When NY 49 was assigned in the mid-1920s, it began at NY 2 (now US 11) in Central Square and ended at NY 11 (modern NY 69) in Rome. At the time, the portion of River Road from Rome to Marcy (at what is now NY 291) was part of NY 11, which had been in place since 1924. In 1927, NY 11 was renumbered to NY 76 to eliminate duplication with the new US 11. This edition shows U.S. Routes as they were first officially signed in 1927. In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, NY 76 was broken up and incorporated into several other routes. From Rome to Marcy, the former routing of NY 76 became an extension of NY 49\\\\. The route then continued eastward along River Road to a new terminus at Genesee Street (then- NY 5, NY 8, and NY 12) in Utica.Automobile Legal Association (ALA) Automobile Green Book, 1930‚Äì31 and 1931‚Äì32 editions, (Scarborough Motor Guide Co., Boston, 1930 and 1931). The 1930‚Äì31 edition shows New York state routes prior to the 1930 renumbering On its western end, NY 49 was extended over a previously unnumbered roadway to Volney, where it ended at NY 3C (now NY 3). NY 49 once extended westward into downtown Fulton by way of an overlap with NY 3; however, this overlap was eliminated by 1970. In 1953, there were 32 accidents of varying degrees along the portion of NY 49 between Rome and Utica. The rash of incidents, coupled with a two-car collision that killed five people in December 1953, led the state Department of Public Works to investigate potential safety issues with the road. Although the study attributed virtually all of the accidents to poor driver judgment, it also noted that the corridor's traffic volume had exceeded the road's capacity. One suggested remedy was the construction of a new highway between Rome and Carey's Corners, NY 49's junction with NY 12C (now NY 291). Plans for the road, which ultimately became the Utica‚ÄìRome Expressway, were developed over the next three years and first publicly presented in January 1957. The highway connected to NY 12C and River Road at Carey's Corners by way of a cloverleaf interchange, the first of its kind in the vicinity of Utica. The estimated cost of the new road was $6.962 million (equivalent to $ in ). Diagram of the interchange between I-790, NY 5, NY 8, NY 12 and NY 49 Construction on the road began in the late 1950s, and was completed in 1960 as part of a rerouted NY 49\\\\. At the time, the expressway began at what is now the Griffiss Air Force Base interchange east of Rome. An extension of the freeway southwest to NY 365 south of downtown Rome was opened in 1980, at which time it, as well as another arterial leading southeast from Rome, became part of NY 49. Retrieved March 10, 2008 via www.nationalbridges.com. In 1990, an interchange was constructed between Edic Road and the North-South Arterial (NY 5/8/12 and I-790) as part of a larger reconfiguration of the area surrounding New York State Thruway exit 31\\\\. Two one-way highways along the Thruway between Edic Road and the Arterial were also built as part of the project. On July 3, 1999, ground was broken on the final section of the expressway between NY 291 and Edic Road. The $60 million highway (equivalent to $ in ) was officially opened to traffic on October 23, 2003, as part of NY 49\\\\. East of Edic Road, NY 49 utilized the pre-existing one-way highways paralleling the Thruway. The total cost of the Utica‚ÄìRome Expressway was $175 million (equivalent to $ in ). The former routing of NY 49 along River Road from NY 365 to NY 291 was transferred to Oneida County and is now designated as County Route 88 while the segment of River Road from the Dominick Street interchange to New Floyd Road remains part of NY 365. Ownership and maintenance of the remainder of River Road was transferred to the cities and towns it passed through. Future There are efforts within NYSDOT to renumber NY Routes 49 and 365 (from Utica to Thruway Exit 33 in the Town of Verona) to NY Route 790, with the eventual plan of renumbering it again as an extension of I-790. The cost for the conversion to Interstate standards is estimated to be between $150 million and $200 million. U.S. Representative Michael Arcuri introduced legislation in July 2010 that would redesignate the portion of NY 49 from the North‚ÄìSouth Arterial in Utica to NY 825 in Rome as part of I-790. The conversion is expected to cost between $1.5 and $2 million, which would be used to install new signage along the expressway. By adding the Utica‚ÄìRome Expressway to the Interstate Highway System, the area would receive approximately $10 million in additional federal highway funding over the next five years. According to Arcuri, the proposed redesignation is part of a larger, long-term goal of creating an Interstate Highway-standard freeway that would begin at Thruway exit 33 in Verona and pass through Rome before ending at Thruway exit 31\\\\. The portion of NY 49 east of NY 825 already meets Interstate Highway standards.

The Middle Atlas form the westernmost end of a large plateaued basin extending eastward into Algeria, also bounded by the Tell Atlas to the north and the Saharan Atlas to the south, both lying largely in Algeria. North of the Middle Atlas and separated by the Sebou River, lie the Rif mountains which are an extension of the Baetic System, which includes the Sierra Nevada in the south of Spain. The basin of the Sebou is not only the primary transportation route between Atlantic Morocco and Mediterranean Morocco but is an area, watered by the Middle Atlas range, that constitutes the principal agricultural region of the country. The Barbary macaque is native to the Middle Atlas, and chief populations occur only in restricted range in parts of Morocco and Algeria. Snow persists in the Middle Atlas in the winter and can appear starting at 600 m above sea level. Geography and ecology Map showing the location of the Atlas Mountains across North Africa (topographic and political) The Middle Atlas provinces cover 23,000 km2 in area, and comprise 18% of the total mountainous surface of Morocco. The provinces of Kh√®nifra, Ifrane, Boulmane, Sefrou, Khemisset, El Hajeb as well as parts of the provinces of Taza and of Beni Mellal lie in the Middle Atlas region. B√©ni Mellal on the Oum Er-Rbia River is designated \\"the doorway to the Middle Atlas\\". The Middle Atlas is a solid mountainous mass of 350 km in length in the north-east of Morocco with a unique charm. Its biodiversity, both in fauna and flora, make Middle Atlas a significant tourist destination. The region is noted for occurrence of the endangered primate, Barbary macaque, Macaca sylvanus; this monkey prehistorically had a much wider distribution throughout northern Morocco.C. Michael Hogan. 2008 Wild boar and polecat are also found within the Middle Atlas Range.Marshall Cavendish Corporation. 2006 Its geo- morphologic structure is: * Primarily limestone. * Tabled rock in the west, running to elevations of 800 to 1,000 metres. * Folded rock toward the northeast and running to elevations exceeding 3000 m, with a highest point, the Jbel Bou Naceur at 3340 m. * Interspersed with volcanic plateaus. Over the mountain slopes, extensive forests of cedar spread, intersected by deep valleys. Bordered by the rich Plaine du Sa√Øs and the cities of Fes, Meknes and Beni Mellal, the mountainous reaches of the Middle Atlas are the stronghold of Berber tribes, speaking Tamazight and living at very low population densities. Area of cedars of Kh√©nifra The Middle Atlas is crossed by one of the principal access roads to the south of Morocco, connecting Fes with Tafilalet. Located at the northeast of Atlas. The Middle Atlas ends in the east at Tazekka National Park,Tazekka National Park, created in 1950, covers 137.37 km2 with a landscape replete with narrow canyons and caves. In the south of Sefrou, the forests of cedars, of holm oak and of cork oak alternate with plates volcanic stripped and small full of fish lakes. The jewel of the Middle Atlas is the Ifrane National Park, located between Khenifra and Ifrane. The highest point of the Middle Atlas is Jbel Bou Naceur (3340 m). 15km north west lies second highest mountain massif of Moussa ou Sabel (3172 m) and Jbel Bou Iblane (3081m), which lies close to Immouzer Marmoucha. Climate Because of its elevation, the Middle Atlas experiences snow during the winter months and a cool climate during the summer. The town of Ifrane enjoys sufficient snow during the winter months that it provides accommodations quite rare in Africa: it is a ski resort. Major catchments The Middle Atlas includes four major catchment areas: *The basin of Sebou: of a surface of approximately 40,000 km2, discharging to the Atlantic Ocean. *The basin of Oum Errabiaa: extends on a surface from 35,000 km2, discharging to the Atlantic Ocean. *The basin of Bou Regreg: cover a surface of about 10,000 km2, discharging to the Atlantic Ocean. *The basin of Moulouya: takes its source in the Almssid region and drains both the Middle and the High Atlas, with a watershed of 74,000 km2, discharging to the Mediterranean. The Middle Atlas contributes abundant and the relatively regular flows to these rivers. Reservoirs have been developed for flood control, to improve tourism, and to create water reserves supporting the development of the arboriculture important to the agricultural industry of the region.

Commandant, Dr. F.E.T. Krause. Judge Krause had been put in command of the city and had earlier prevented the dynamiting of the goldmines. The British allowed them a day to evacuate Johannesburg provided they did not set off the mines.Blue plaque illustrated The square is just off Rissik Street and it was a corner of Rissik and Anderson that Mahatma Gandhi once had his legal offices. A statue of Gandhi was erected in the square in October 2003. Before it was named Gandhi Square, Van Der Bijl square was falling apart. It was in the centre of one of Johannesburg's most destitute neighbourhoods. Then, in the early 1990s, Gerald Olitzki, a property developer, approached the government with the project. Although initially denied, the project was eventually undertaken with the support of the government, and was finished in 2002, at a cost of approximately R2 million. The local bus terminal has also been renovated, as there is now 24-hour security, and many of the shops along the square have returned.

She was named for Cincinnati, Ohio, and was the first ship to bear that name in the United States Navy.  Service history  Cincinnati was built in 1861 under a War Department contract by James Eads, St. Louis, Missouri, and commissioned at Mound City, Illinois, January 16, 1862, Lieutenant George M. Bache in command. Assigned to duty with the Army in the Western Gunboat Flotilla under U.S. Navy Flag Officer Andrew H. Foote, Cincinnati participated in the attack and capture of Fort Henry (February 6, 1862); the operations against Island No. 10 (March 12 April 7, 1862); the engagement with the Confederate gunboat fleet at Plum Point Bend and the bombardment of Fort Pillow (May 10, 1862). This important series of operations was aimed at splitting the Confederacy. During the last engagement Cincinnati, the lead vessel, was repeatedly struck by enemy rams and sunk. Raised and returned to service, Cincinnati was transferred to the Navy Department 1 October 1862 with other vessels of the Western Gunboat Flotilla. She participated in the Army-Navy operation against Arkansas Post or Fort Hindman, a Confederate fort on the Arkansas River, and installations on the White River in January 1863, then was ordered to the Yazoo River where she took part in Steele's Bayou Expedition (March 14‚Äì27, 1863). On May 27, 1863, during the Siege of Vicksburg, Mississippi, Cincinnati was ordered to steam down the Mississippi River and destroy two Confederate artillery guns which were impeding the advance of General William Tecumseh Sherman's right flank. Between Cincinnati and the two guns was a Confederate eleven-piece heavy artillery battery which, from its position atop a bluff, had command over that entire stretch of the river. This \\"Upper River Battery\\" was composed of the remnants of Hoagley's Battery, CS and referred to simply as the \\"Arkansas Battery.\\" The Union forces had been aware of the battery, but, shortly before Cincinnati received its orders, the battery had disappeared and was assumed to have been moved elsewhere. Unbeknownst to them, the battery's guns had been removed from view by simply lowering them from their carriages, both to protect them from the fire of ships on the river and to deceive the Union forces. The commander of the battery, Capt. William Pratt Parks, (CS Army) had discovered the Union signal code, and when he intercepted a message describing Cincinnatis mission, he had the guns re-assembled during the night and concealed them in brush. On the morning of May 27, Cincinnati headed downstream and reached its target, the two artillery guns. Just as it fired its first shots, the hidden battery on the bluff also opened fire, completely surprising the Union ship. The first Confederate shell scored a direct hit, passing through Cincinnati's magazine and exiting through the bottom of the ship. Another shell disabled the ship's steering mechanism. Cincinnatis own guns could not be elevated enough to return fire on the high battery. Knowing his ship was doomed, the commander, Lieutenant George M. Bache, headed Cincinnati full-steam back up the river in search of a place on which to beach the ship. A suitable spot being found, Cincinnati was run aground, a hawser tied to a tree, and gangplank laid out. Before the men could evacuate, the hawser came loose and the ship slipped from the bank out into the river, where it began to sink in about of water. Many of the crew, including the commander, could not swim; those who could began to abandon ship. Still under intense fire four sailors, Landsman Thomas E. Corcoran, Boatswain's Mate Henry Dow, Seaman Thomas Jenkins, and Seaman Martin McHugh, swam back and forth, helping their crewmates to shore. They then reboarded Cincinnati, hastily repaired a small boat which had been damaged by the Confederate fire, and loaded it with men who were too badly wounded to be dragged through the water. After Lieutenant Bache also climbed into the boat, they towed it to the safety of a Union flotilla. Six crewman from Cincinnati were awarded the Medal of Honor for their actions during the sinking: Quartermaster Frank Bois, Landsman Thomas E. Corcoran, Boatswain's Mate Henry Dow, Quartermaster Thomas W. Hamilton, Seaman Thomas Jenkins, and Seaman Martin McHugh. Raised again in August 1863, Cincinnati returned to patrol duty on the Mississippi River and its tributaries until February 1865 when she was transferred to the West Gulf Blockading Squadron. She patrolled off Mobile Bay and in the Mississippi Sounds until placed out of commission August 4, 1865 at Algiers, Louisiana. She was sold at New Orleans on March 28, 1866.

The Holy-Trinity College is a Catholic school established by the Josephites of Belgium in the heart of Leuven. The school has a primary school and a secondary school. The basic options available to students are modern sciences, Latin and Latin-Greek. In the second and third grade there is an almost complete range of studies in general secondary education. History The school was founded in 1843 by canon Constant van Crombrugghe, founder of the Congregation of the Josephites. The main entrance to the school is located on the edge of the Old Market, the rear of the school is at the Father Damien Square, where the mortal remains of Blessed Damien of Molokai rest in the crypt of the St. Anthony Church. The Josephites also have in Egenhovenbos in Heverlee a country estate for the monks and students since 1870. This was still used until 2010 for reflections and extracurricular activities by the school when it was sold. The estate was leased in 1870 by the Duke of Arenberg. After World War I the property became nationalized and Josephites could purchase the Jozefietengoed in 1924 from the Belgian state.

It was published in two volumes in Yiddish and also in translation. It was also published in a Hebrew translation, with the same title as the Yiddish. The first volume was published as if it were standalone, with no volume number and no mention of a continuation. The second volume was subtitled \\"Volume II: Masters and Disciples.\\" The second volume, and later books by Grade (for example, Rabbis and Wives) explicitly refer to the first volume as \\"Volume I\\" in their \\"by the same author\\" lists. Main characters The main protagonist is Tsemakh Atlas, who at the beginning of the novel is a junior Novaredker rabbi sent out to open his own yeshiva in a small town. He grapples with his uninspired devotion, atheist-leaning doubts, and frequent disapproval of most everybody's behavior, based on the tenets of the Musar movement. The character of Reb Avraham-Shaye the Kosover is very closely based on Reb Avraham Yeshaya Karelitz from Kosova, commonly known as the Chazon Ish. As is common, the rabbiActually, the Chazon Ish never received an official rabbinical ordination, and never served as a rabbi, hence the honorific \\"Reb\\". Similarly with the fictional character. is known by the title of his most famous work. The title Chazon Ish is Hebrew for Vision of a man,a book about his sister Batya's life: . Although \\"Ish\\" in Hebrew means man, it is an acronym for Avraham Yeshaya,As did Yaakov Emden, two letters represented part of his name. YudShin for Yeshaya. The YudAyyin in Yaavetz was a directive from his father, the Chacham Tzvi, to distinguish from Yosef and Yehuda. The latter is in the Hebrew language She'I'Las Yaavetz. that is, the title is Vision of Avraham Yeshaya. In the novel, the fictional Kosover's most famous work is The Vision of Avraham. commenting on the Yiddish original. The character of Chaikl Vilner is very closely based on Grade himself. The name is one Grade had used as his persona in poetry: Chaikl is the diminutive of Chaim and a Vilner is someone who hails from Vilna.Compare with \\"Chaim Vilner\\" in \\"That is Me\\", linked to below. In the novel, further similarities are that Chaikl is the son of a Hebrew teacher and maskil, as was Grade, Chaikl's father is named Shlomo- Motte, a Yiddish corruption of Grade's father's name Shlomo Mordechai,More explicitly, Grade dedicated Volume II to the memory of his father, \\"Reb Shlomo-Motte Grade\\" and just like Grade learned extensively with the Chazon Ish, so too does Chaikl learn extensively with Reb Avraham-Shaye. Plot summary =Volume one= Tsemakh Atlas is an advanced Talmudic student/teacher in Nareva, committed to the Musar philosophy, which puts him at odds with most of his fellow Jews, observant or not, learned or not. He initially spends his time recruiting children from the Soviet Union, mostly without their parents' permissions, and smuggles them into Lithuania. After the death of Rav Yosef-Yoizl Hurwitz, his rabbi sends Tsemakh to AmdurIndura, Belarus to found a new yeshiva, knowing this mission will not succeed. Tsemakh ends up engaged to the plain, quiet daughter of an Amdur storekeeper, but he is told by townspeople that the man is vicious and cruel, and certainly lying about the dowry. He flees to Lomzhe, his hometown where his aunt and uncle live. Their three sons work for Volodya Stupel, a wealthy flour merchant who fondly remembers Tsemakh from childhood school days, but whose arrogance offends Tsemakh. Tsemakh meets Volodya's sister Slava, a wild and vivacious beauty who is so impressed by Tsemakh that she decides to definitely break up with her married lover and instead to marry Tsemakh. When he doesn't return, after a few days Slava befriends Tsemakh's aunt and pays her own visit, impressing Tsemakh with her displays of ordinary kindness. Tsemakh marries Slava and becomes irreligious. But he can't stop rebuking everyone in the Musar style, including customers of Volodya, to Volodya's financial horror. Tsemakh returns to religion and studying Talmud again, and grows distant from Slava. Volodya's brother takes on a Jewish maid, but his son Lolla gets her pregnant. As plans are made to dump her in some gentile village, Slava pays what turns out to be a curt visit to her ex-lover. Tsemakh learns of the maid's plight, and threatens to expose the whole sordid mess if the Stupels can't find a Jewish home for the maid. They can't, leading to an all-round crisis, just as Slava returns. The maid flees, and Tsemakh leaves Lomzhe to set up his own yeshiva in Valkenik. He tells Slava not to come with him, but to make peace with her family. In Vilna, Tsemakh recruits three boys, Melechke, Chaikl, and Hertzke. In each case, fatherly opposition must be overcome, sometimes with great difficulty. Tsemakh also recruits an old Hebrew teacher to be his partner. In Valkenik, Tsemakh faces several challenges and conflicts, often without any effect. He must resist the attractive Rokhshte (Ronya), the married daughter of the yeshiva's cook, whose husband is home only twice a year. He must rebuke a student whose charming friendliness with Leitshe, the unmarried daughter, has led to better food for him, the reputation the two are engaged, and scandal when he officially gets engaged to a rich man's daughter, and fails badly when the student dismisses it, half thinking he can blackmail Tsemakh for his broken engagement from Amdur. The estranged parents of Hertzke show up, the father (Vova Barbitoler) from Vilna, the mother (Confrada) from Argentina, to take the boy away, creating a public spectacle, ending with Hertzke going with his mother, rejecting his father and Judaism. There is sharp disagreement regarding the successor to the town's rabbi, regarding whom Tsemakh refuses to take sides. And to the surprise of everyone, Slava shows up, impressing the townspeople with her beauty and her kind and wealthy bearing, but finds she and Tsemakh are still too far apart mentally, so she returns to Lomzhe. During the Passover holiday, Tsemakh makes an attempt to convince Ronya's husband to stay on as a third yeshiva teacher, only annoying him. The yeshiva boys return to their families, Chaikl invites his father, Shlomo-Motte to join him in Valkenik for his health. Chaikl and his father end up staying with the Vorobey family, mother Freyda, daughter Kreyndl, son Nokhemka (Nachum), who live in disgrace because the father Bentzye (Ben-Zion) has abandoned his family to live with a gentile woman in a nearby village. (They get by thanks to the American sister of Freyda.) The town's rabbi and his wife retire, leaving for the Holy Land. The new rabbi moves in, and after Lag B'Omer, the first of the many religious summer vacationers (who board out by a cardboard factory out of the way in the deep woods) shows up, the very famous Reb Avraham-Shaye the Kosover, with his sister Hadassah and her children. Reb Avraham-Shaye avoids having anything to do with the town's residents or problems if possible, but he is drawn into a few issues. Most surprisingly, he takes on Chaikl as a roommate and personal student, saving him from a nascent scandal involving Kreyndl, who was attracted to Chaikl. He also rebukes Tsemakh quite strongly, warning him that his Musar talks, by going over the heads of his students, is actually damaging them. =Volume two= Tsemakh takes Reb Avraham-Shaye's criticism to heart and then some, and ceases speaking to the students at all. After Shevuos, the rest of the summer vacationers show up, a disparate group of advanced yeshiva students and rabbis. Into this milieu, Vova returns, now a pitiful beggar, but swearing vengeance on Tsemakh and Chaikl for getting his son to come to Valkenik in the first place. His plan is to simply be a loud-mouthed disruptive boor, endlessly reciting his litany of complaints until the two leave. But when he visits Chaikl in the woods, Reb Avraham-Shaye patiently and respectfully listens to Vova, who ends up reduced to tears of shame when he is told to make complete peace with those he has had trouble with, including Confrada. Vova agrees, and leaves. The younger Valkenik generation, agitating for a more secular life, have pushed for a library in the town, but they want more. The conflict is so serious that a small riot breaks out in the synagogue on the Sabbath. Meanwhile, they have successfully corrupted most of the yeshiva students into reading forbidden books from their library. When the books are discovered, the students are unapologetic, and Tsemakh refuses to take a stand regarding the books. Meanwhile, one of the most respected of the yeshiva students is accused of getting a mentally ill woman pregnant in the neighboring village. He is absolved when the actual father is identified, but it becomes clear that the charges were deliberately pushed by the library faction. Tsemakh authorizes vengeance, and arranges with the town's crook to have the books stolen and burned. This is too much for the secularists, who take to blockading the yeshiva. The leaders of the Valkenik religious community seek out Reb Avraham-Shaye's counsel. He declares the books must be replaced and Tsemakh must leave immediately. Tsemakh leaves for Amdur, and learns his first fianc√©e, whom he had abandoned, had died after six months. Horrified at the consequences of his behavior, he returns to Lomzhe. He asks Slava for a divorce, she refuses. Tsemakh stays with his Uncle Ziml, now a widower, vowing to take off and wander as a beggar. A year later, shortly before Rosh Hashana, Chaikl's father dies. Vova shows up during the overnight vigil, drunk, cursing all his former enemies, proud that he changed his mind about taking Reb Avraham-Shaye's advice. But Vova too dies, a few months later during Hanukkah. At the end of his year of mourning for his father, Chaikl visits the Navaredok yeshiva in Nareva for the months of Elul and Tishrei. A year later, he visits again, arriving just in time for Yom Kippur. There he finds Tsemakh, who has ended his wanderings and returned to Navaredok, a full- time penitent. Chaikl befriends Moshe Chayit the Lohoysker, one of the now grown-up children smuggled out of Russia by Tsemakh. The Lohoysker has become defiant, rude, openly sarcastic in his non-observance and skepticism, but with no skills except rabbinic training, he is dependent on the yeshiva for room and board. When Rav Simkha Feinerman, the rosh yeshiva leaves for a Yeshiva Council funding conference in Vilna, he leaves Yankl Poltaver in charge. During the conference, an appeal to Reb Avraham-Shaye to adjudicate gets rejected, but Reb Avraham-Shaye personally visits Rav Simkha, asking about Chaikl. Upon learning of Tsemakh's return as the penitent, he tells Rav Simkha that by ignoring his wife, he is not a penitent, and wants Rav Simkha to tell Tsemakh to return. In Nareva, in the rabbi's absence, Lohoysker becomes even more insulting, crashing an all-night Musar meeting. Yankl, having learned his Musar from the younger Tsemakh, makes life miserable for the trustee handling the free loans for widows, on the grounds that the trustee is uncaring and stingy. The trustee resigns, but no one else is willing to take on the job, leading the widows to protest and the yeshiva facing eviction from the congregation that houses it. Yankl also makes life miserable for Melechke since he is not into the Musar philosophy, and Melechke ends up running off without warning, abetted by Lohoysker. Rav Simkha returns, and per the congregation's demands, sends Yankl away to found a yeshiva to be run by Reb Duber, he soon announces success in Amdur. Meanwhile, Tsemakh breaks his policy of non-involvement and violently evicts Lohoysker. Rav Simkha has not yet decided whether to pass on Reb Avraham-Shaye's demand. In quick succession, one yeshiva student tries to commit suicide, Reb Duber finds himself in Amdur, with Yankl gone and most of the townspeople hostile, Yankl returns and uses Purim as an excuse to tastelessly and publicly insult the trustee, and one of the most beloved of the yeshiva students dies of his weak heart. Slava shows up, and scandalously receives Lohoysker and Chaikl as guests. Tsemakh is forced to leave with Slava, and takes Lohoysker and Chaikl with him. They leave for Vilna, and Tsemakh meets with Reb Avraham-Shaye, who convinces Tsemakh to stay with his wife and to go into business. Tsemakh becomes a quiet sort, although marital harmony is still elusive for him. Lohoysker discovers that he is trapped in the yeshiva world: not only does he have no other skills, he has no other interests, and so he becomes observant again. Chaikl too finds himself trapped, but not quite as strongly. In the end, Reb Avraham-Shaye and his wife board a train, beginning their relocation to the Holy Land. Tsemakh and Chaikl watch the train leave, deeply aware that their future remains forever tied to the Kosover's influence.

The Andrenidae (commonly known as mining bees) are a large, nearly cosmopolitan family of solitary, ground-nesting bees. Most of the family's diversity is located in temperate or arid areas (warm temperate xeric). It includes some enormous genera (e.g., Andrena with over 1300 species, and Perdita with over 700). One of the subfamilies, Oxaeinae, is so different in appearance that they were typically accorded family status, but careful phylogenetic analysis reveals them to be an offshoot within the Andrenidae, very close to the Andreninae.C. D. Michener (2007) The Bees of the World, 2nd Edition, Johns Hopkins University Press. Description The Andrenidae are typically small to moderate-sized bees, which often have scopae on the basal segments of the leg in addition to the tibia, and are commonly oligolectic (especially within the subfamily Panurginae). They can be separated from other bee families by the presence of two subantennal sutures on the face, a primitive trait shared with the sphecoid wasps. Many groups also have depressions or grooves called \\"foveae\\" on the head near the upper margin of the eyes, another feature seen in sphecoids, and also shared by some Colletidae. Andrenids are among the few bee families that have no cleptoparasites. The family contains a very large number of taxa, especially among the Panurginae, whose sting apparatus is so reduced that they are effectively unable to sting. The subfamily Oxaeinae is rather different in appearance from the other subfamilies, being large, fast-flying bees with large eyes, resembling some of the larger Colletidae. The Andrenidae are known from the Eocene-Oligocene boundary, around 34 Mya, of the Florissant shale.  \\"Nocturnal\\" species  The Andrenidae are one of the four bee families that contain some crepuscular species; these species are active only at dusk or in the early evening, and therefore technically considered \\"vespertine\\". In the Andrenidae, such species occur primarily in the subfamily Panurginae. These bees, as is typical in such cases, have greatly enlarged ocelli, though one crepuscular subgenus of Andrena has normal ocelli. The other families with some crepuscular species are Halictidae, Colletidae, and Apidae.

Infection rates climbed exponentially throughout the 1980s, and in 1990 the World Bank famously predicted 1,200,000 cases by 2000, approximately double the actual number that was later reported by the Brazilian Ministry of Health and most international organizations. South and Southeast have 75% or more of this infection (Rio Grande do Sul, S√£o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro). The Northeast has 33% of the population but only 10% of AIDS. The Brazilian experience is frequently cited as a model for other developing countries facing the AIDS epidemic, including the internationally controversial policies of the Brazilian government such as the universal provision of antiretroviral drugs (ARVs), progressive social policies toward risk groups, and collaboration with non-governmental organizations. History Brazil's first AIDS case was reported in 1982. Brazil‚Äôs AIDS response was crafted in 1985, just after the country had returned from military rule to democracy, at a time when only four AIDS cases had been reported.Teixeira et al., 2004, S6. The Brazilian Ministry of Health laid the groundwork for a National AIDS Control Program (NACP) which was established in 1986, and placed under the aegis of the National AIDS Control Committee, a group composed of scientists and members of civil society organizations, in 1987. The program was reorganized again in 1992 with more emphasis on linkages between government and NGOs.Levi and Vit√≥ria, 2002, p. 2373Levi and Vit√≥ria, 2002, p. 2374. AIDS Project I garnered $90 million in domestic funds and a $160 million loan from the World Bank between 1992 and 1998. AIDS Project II also composed of both domestic funds and a World Bank loan totaled $370 million between 1998 and 2002. In 1990--a year when more than 10,000 new cases were reported--the World Bank estimated that Brazil would have 1,200,000 in infections by 2000. However, by 2002, there were fewer than 600,000 estimated infections, less than half the prediction.Ministry of Health of Brazil, 2003. Government policies =Universal ARV provision= The single most controversial element of the Brazilian HIV/AIDS response remains the free, universal provision of anti- retroviral drugs (ARVs), including protease inhibitors, starting in December 1996 with Law No. 9313/1996. The guidelines for antiretroviral therapy (ART) are formulated annually by a Support Committee which determines the diagnostic guidelines and the contents of the ARV cocktail.Levi and Vit√≥ria, 2002, p. 2378. In 2003, 125,000 Brazilians received free ART treatment, accounting for 100% of the total registered AIDS cases but only 20% of the estimated AIDS cases. ART was traditionally considered too expensive in resource-poor settings in developing countries, which are believed to have a poor capacity for adherence to complicated treatments.Colebunders et al., 2000. However, a 2004 study of 322 outpatient services in Brazil--comprising 87,000 patients-- found the rate of adherence to be 75%.Nemes et al., 2004, S15. Some authors also argue that if the decline in hospital admissions and ambulatory care are taken into account, the policy of universal provision of ART has accumulated a net savings of approximately $200 million.Teixeira et al.,2004, S7. In the context of Brazil, some have challenged the degree to which improvements in public health can be attributed to ART as opposed to other factors. For example, a 2002 World Bank Policy Research Working Paper, states:Novaes et al., 2002, p. 10 :The impact caused by the introduction of therapeutic measures, like the antiretrovirals in their different compositions and associations and/or health promotion and protection measured, though evident, has not been completely explored yet. A 2003 study, using data from diagnoses occurring in Brazil in 1995 and 1996, found that antiretroviral treatment was the single greatest predictor of survival.Marins et al., 2003, p. 1675. The authors demonstrate that variables like year of diagnosis, higher education, sexual exposure category, gender, the presence of specific pathogens all appeared to predict survival in a univariate analysis; however, in a multivariate analysis only antiretroviral treatment, diagnostic criteria, and transmission category remained significant.Marins et al., 2003, p. 1678-1680. The authors conclude that no factor other than ART \\"could reasonably explain the very large increase in survival observed\\" between the 1980s and 1996.Marins et al., 2000, p. 1681. =Social policies= Brazil's response has been characterized by reaching out to groups which account for a high percentage of AIDS transmission, including relationships with non-governmental organizations. For example, in contrast to many parts of the world, condoms were prioritized early and aggressively. Condom use in first sexual intercourse increased from 4% in 1986 to 48% in 1999 and to 55% in 2003, spurred by government programs to increase awareness, decrease the price, and increase the availability of condoms.Levi and Vit√≥ria, 2002, p. 2375. Prostitute groups were involved in the distribution of information materials and condoms.Where Prostitutes Also Fight AIDS, Washington Post, 2 March 2006 Similarly, needle exchange programs were implemented. The prevalence of HIV among injecting drug users (IDUs) fell from 52% in 1999 to 41.5% in 2001. 12 needle exchange programs were implemented between 1994 and 1998; 40 had been implemented by 2000, distributing 1,500,000 syringes in just a year. HIV prevalence among IDU decreased even more dramatically in some cities. In 1988 comprehensive screening tests were implemented nationwide in blood banks, following a similar program in S√£o Paulo in 1986; however, the results of these programs were not realized fully until 2000 as a result of the incubation period of the virus, but new cases from blood transfusion became virtually non-existent at that time and new and more effective nucleic acid testing is being considered.Levi and Vit√≥ria, 2002, p. 2376. Mother-to-child transmission was similarly practically eradicated, falling to a transmission rate of 3%, a level comparable to most developed countries, with the implementation of zidovudine treatment regimes to mother and child and recommendations against breastfeeding.Levi and Vit√≥ria, 2002, p. 2377. International conflict =Drug patents= The average annual cost of ART per patient in 1997 was $4,469‚Äîcompared to over $10,000 in most of the developed world‚Äîtotaling only $242 million per annum.Szwarcwald, 2002. However, in 2001, Brazil manufactured locally 8 of the 12 drugs in the national ARV cocktail; in 2003 and 2005, 8 of the 15.Gilman, 2001; Brazilian National STD/AIDS Programme, 2003Gentile, 2005. If all of the drugs were patented imports, the cost of these ARV programs would increase by 32%. In the period between 1996 and 2000, Brazil reduced treatment costs by 72.5% through import substitution; by contrast, the price of imports dropped by only 9.6%. Brazil has saved over US $1.1 billion in the cost of providing universal access to ART by producing anti-retroviral medications generically. Article 71 of the 1997 Brazilian patent law requires that foreign products be manufactured in Brazil within three years of receiving a patent. If a foreign company does not comply, Brazil may authorize a local company to produce the drug without the consent of the patent holder, a tactic known as \\"compulsory licensing\\" or the \\"bargaining chip and as a last resort.\\"Oxfam GB, 2001, p. 6. In addition, Article 68 authorizes \\"parallel importing\\" from the lowest international generic bidder, effectively destroying the patent holder‚Äôs monopoly as well.Oxfam GB, 2001, p. 10-11. Prodded by domestic pharmaceutical lobbies, the U.S. challenged Article 68 within the framework of the World Trade Organization's Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs) regime for allegedly discriminating against imported products; Article 71--to the chagrin of many companies--was not included in the complaint. In addition, the U.S. placed Brazil on the \\"Special 301\\" watch list, opening the possibility for \\"unilateral sanctions,\\" and companies individually threatened to pull out of the Brazilian market altogether.Oxfam GB, 2001, p. 3. Brazil argued that the law only applied to cases where the patent holder abuses their economic power, a loophole specifically allowed by the TRIPS agreement. Advocates of intellectual property rights (IPR) worldwide condemned the actions of the Brazilian government. For example, Slavi Pachovski, a member of the Institute for Trade, Standards and Sustainable Development, argues:Pachovski, 2005. :If this trend proceeds, it will be a global pandemic of AIDS that will grow uncontrollable because the Brazilian move will destroy the whole legal order that is the basis for developing new drugs and continuing research. The pharmaceutical companies were not just afraid of the immediate loss of the Brazilian market, but with the larger implications of other developing countries following Brazil‚Äôs example. Large developing countries, like India, with large industrial capacities and evolving intellectual property regimes are the true elephant in the room.Oxfam GB, 2001, p. 2. Brazil invoked the Article 71 for the first time on August 22, 2001, when Jos√© Serra, Brazil‚Äôs Minister of Health, authorized Far Manguinhos --a Brazilian pharmaceutical company--to produce Nelfinavir, a drug patented by Pfizer but licensed to Roche in the Brazilian market. This unilateral action prompted a flurry of negotiations where Roche and Merck agreed to reduce the prices of five drugs by 40-65%. An advertisement distributed by the Brazilian government proclaimed: \\"Local manufacturing of many of the drugs used in the anti-AIDS cocktail is not a declaration of war against the drugs industry. It is simply a fight for life.\\"quoted in Wadia, 2001. Brazil carried out such a compulsory licensing threat for the first time in May 2007, on efavirenz, produced by Merck.The Economist. May 12, 2007. \\"Brazil's AIDS programme: A conflict of goals.\\" p. 42. The agreements signed on November 14, 2001 at the WTO conference in Qatar reaffirmed that TRIPs \\"does not and should not prevent Members from taking measures to protect public health\\" including \\"medicines for all.\\" That same year, the United Nations Commission on Human Rights affirmed access to AIDS drugs as a human right unanimously, with the exception of the abstention of the United States. =Prostitution= Two 2003 United States laws--one related to AIDS, the other to sex trafficking-- required all recipients of U.S. assistance to sign a pledge denouncing prostitution, even if U.S. funds are not used for projects directly related to prostitution.Phillips and Moffett, 2005. In 2005, Brazil wrote to the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) declining to condemn prostitution, effectively rejecting the remainder of a grant for $48 million between 2003 and 2006. In 2006, USAID officially declared Brazil ineligible to renew the AIDS prevention grant because Brazil would not condemn prostitution as \\"dehumanizing and degrading.\\"Reel, 2006. Brazil considered its partnerships with prostitutes--in distributing contraceptives, educating the public about the disease, and voluntary testing--critical to its overall AIDS prevention strategy. One Ministry of Health pamphlet depicts a character, \\"Maria Sem Vergonha\\" (Portuguese for \\"Maria that knows No Shame\\", but also a pun on the Brazilian name of the flowering genera \\"Impatiens spp.\\", maria-sem-vergonha), a scantily-clad sex worker who encourages prostitutes to take pride in their work and use condoms. Pedro Chequer, director of Brazil‚Äôs National AIDS Control Programme, was quoted as saying \\"we can‚Äôt control [the disease] with principles that are Manichaean, theological, fundamentalist and Shiite\\" and \\"sex workers are part of implementing our AIDS policy and deciding how to promote it. They are our partners. How could we ask prostitutes to take a position against themselves?\\"Just Say N√£o, The Nation, 12 May 2005 Despite the fact that Brazil has the largest population of Roman Catholics in the world, the Brazilian Roman Catholic Church has not demanded the abstinence-only prevention strategies, voicing only intermittent \\"mild complaints\\" about government programs which refuse to acknowledge moral or religious issues. A \\"Brazilian model\\" Brazil‚Äôs Health Minister, Jos√© Serra, said in 2001, \\"Our example could serve as a model for other countries in Latin America, the Caribbean, even Africa. Everyone in the world has the right to access these therapies.\\"Wadia, 2001. Some scholars, such as Levi and Vit√≥ria, argue that the Brazilian model can only be applied to other countries with similar level of economic development and civil society sectors.Levi and Vit√≥ria, 2002. Galv√£o argues that the unique local conditions in Brazil complicate the application of the Brazilian experience to other regions with their own local problems and structures.Galv√£o, 2002 A Washington Post article stated that the Brazilian anti-AIDS program is considered by the United Nations to be the most successful in the developing world, and The Economist echoed this position: \\"no developing country has had more success in tackling AIDS than Brazil.

It was released on June 6, 2006, to largely negative reviews. Though there was never an official announcement regarding discontinuation of service, the servers have been offline since 2008, ostensibly due to a lawsuit by VWORLD, LLC. Snail Games acquired the rights to Dark and Light in 2008 and developed a \\"fantasy survival sandbox RPG\\", which was released as early access in 2017 with the same name. Gameplay Dark and Light was a third-person Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game (MMORPG), set in a medieval fantasy world called Ganareth. Players could choose from 12 races, 10 of which could be either male or female (the exceptions being Half-Trolls, which were male only, and Fairies, which could only be female). There were 14 playable character classes to choose from, divided into four main archetypes: Fighter, Hunter, Healer, and Mage. Fighters were designed to have good defensive abilities and armour, and also had the ability to bring the focus enemies off of other characters and onto the fighter. They could be Warriors, Paladins, or Shadow Knights. Hunters were a support character, relying more on tactics and offensive support than on damage or defense. They could be Archers, Rangers, Bards, or Thieves. The primary purpose of Healers was to heal, as the name suggests, but they also had decent ranged damage capabilities. Healers could be Clerics, Monks, Druids, or Enchanters. Mages discarded personal safety in favour of large amounts of damage, in addition to buffing other players. Mages could be Illustionists, Necromancers, or Wizards. Progression in Dark and Light experience points gained in three separate systems, or \\"axes\\": Combat, Crafting, and Social. Combat experience was gained through defeating enemies, crafting from creating items, and social from joining guilds and doing guild quests. Characters had 12 different equipment slots (head, shoulders, left and right arms, gloves, chest, shirt, belt, pants, left and right thighs, and boots) in addition to two weapon slots, allowing for one ranged weapon, one or two melee weapons, or a shield. Armour was divided into 6 types: robe, cloth, leather, reinforced leather, chain mail, and plate. Crafting was divided into \\"jobs\\", each specified by the items that that job could produce. Tanners made leather armour, tailors made cloth armour, armourers made chain and plate armour, blacksmiths made weapons, and jewelers made jewels, jewellery, and bracelets. The world was split into Kingdoms. Each kingdom represented one of the Gods of the realm, who in turn were subordinate to Gothar: God of Gods. The expansive game world was one of their larger selling points, offering 39,000 square kilometers (15,000 sq. mi.) of land to explore.Dark And Light Features , Dark and Light Official Website Development Development on Dark and Light started by NPCube in 2002.

On August 14, 2006, the publisher, Farlan Entertainment, stated that the game was released prematurely and has experienced problems due to its early release. Farlan Entertainment signed with SnailGame Entertainment, the distributor in China, to provide additional help with the graphics. All of the current subscribers were given a free 3-month period to play the game. Reception Dark and Light received largely negative reviews. Common complaints were the prevalence of gameplay bugs, low quality graphics, and poor overall implementation. Many reviewers liked the expansiveness and detail of the game world.

Synopsis A knight persuades a shepherd's daughter to give him her virginity. Afterward she chases after him to the royal court, on foot while he is on horseback, and demands marriage. He attempts to bribe her, but she insists he must marry her or be executed. After the marriage it is revealed, either by the woman herself or by Billy Blin, that she is in fact the daughter of royalty or high nobility; it may also be revealed that the man is a noble instead of a mere knight. Motifs Her pursuit of the knight on foot while he is on horseback also appears in Child Ballad 63, \\"Child Waters\\", where it fits a very different plot.Francis James Child, The English and Scottish Popular Ballads, v 2, p 458, Dover Publications, New York 1965 The motif is very similar to that of the loathly lady, particularly the variant found in Geoffrey Chaucer's \\"The Wife of Bath's Tale\\".Francis James Child, The English and Scottish Popular Ballads, v 2, p 458, Dover Publications, New York 1965 Lise et Mainfroi, a 1740 French imitation of this ballad, has an actual shepherdess as the heroine; she announces at the altar that she is satisfied without the wedding, and the king and his court must persuade her to agree.Francis James Child, The English and Scottish Popular Ballads, v 2, p 459, Dover Publications, New York 1965 See also *\\"The Wylie Wife of the Hie Toun Hie\\"  Collected Versions  A version of the tune and lyrics were included by William Chappell in his 1859 book Popular Music of the Olden Time. Sabine Baring-Gould collected a version written in 1785, and notated another version she personally found in Lewdown, Devon in 1887, and Frank Kidson collected a version sung by a Benjamin Holgate of Leeds, West Yorkshire in 1891. The famous composer and folklorist Percy Grainger collected and notated a version in 1906 performed by William Roberts of Burringham, Lincolnshire, and another by Joseph Leaning of Brigg, Lincolnshire in 1908. The song reached North America, where a handful of traditional versions were noted to exist. The folklorist Alan Lomax recorded John Strachan of Fyvie, Aberdeenshire singing a version in 1957, which is publicly available online. Many Scottish versions had previously been recorded by James Madison Carpenter in the 1930s. A later version was performed by Lizzie Higgins of Aberdeenshire in the 1970s, and is now available on the Vaughan Williams Memorial Library website. Desmond and Shelagh Herring recorded Emily Sparkes of Rattlesden, Suffolk singing a version of the song in 1958, and another sung by Charlie Carver of nearby Tostock, both of which can be heard online via the British Library Sound Archive.

She was named for Owasco Lake. Owasco, built by Charles Mallory, was launched at Mystic, Connecticut, 5 October 1861; delivered to the Navy at New York Navy Yard 6 December 1861; and commissioned there 23 January 1862, Lt. John Guest in command. The new \\"ninety-day gunboat\\" departed New York 5 February and reached Key West, Florida, 10 days later where Comdr. David D. Porter's mortar flotilla was assembling. She then headed via Ship Island, Mississippi for Pass a L‚ÄôOutre. En route, on 16 March, she captured schooners Eugenia and President laden with cotton and bound for Havana. The mortar flotilla had been established by the Navy to neutralize forts St. Philip and Jackson which protected New Orleans, Louisiana against attack from the sea. Owasco was one of seven steamers assigned to the flotilla to tow the schooners and help them navigate safely in the tricky currents of the Mississippi River. In mid-April she and her sister steamers moved the schooners into position below the forts. On the 18th, when the mortars opened fire on the Southern positions, the steamers supported the attack with flat trajectory fire until, six days later, David Farragut led his deep draft vessels in a historic dash past the Confederate heavy works. The following day New Orleans fell, depriving the South of its largest city and greatest industrial and commercial center. One of Owasco's sailors, Quartermaster Edward Farrell, was awarded the Medal of Honor for his part in the battle. When Farragut ascended the Mississippi for the second time, Owasco helped to tow the schooners up river to a position just below Vicksburg, Mississippi from which they bombarded the Confederate cliffside batteries 28 June as Farragut raced under the Southern guns to join the Western Gunboat Flotilla above Vicksburg. Owasco participated in the bombardment and capture of Galveston, Texas 3 October; but, on New Year‚Äôs day, was driven out of that port by Confederates in cotton clad steamers. After continuing blockade duty, she participated in the joint Army-Navy capture of Brazos, Texas 3 November 1863. She captured the English schooner Fanny 19 April 1864, carrying cargo for Confederate General Magruder from Havana. She continued to serve along the coast of Texas through the end of the war. She decommissioned at New York Navy Yard 12 July 1865 and was sold at auction at New York 25 October 1865.

Much of it is maintained by the Halifax Regional Municipality. Today the most prominent area is called Leighton Dillman Park, which is named after a voluntary keeper of the garden. Other areas of the common are used by: baseball fields, the former Dartmouth City Hall, the Dartmouth Regional Library then after that the Dartmouth Heritage Museum, the Dartmouth Sportsplex, Dartmouth High School, Bicentennial Jr. High School, an elementary school called \\"Park School\\" (since torn down) and two burial grounds. The baseball fields are named for Arthur H. Merrick who was a co- founder of minor baseball in the City of Dartmouth in 1950. Between the Dartmouth Sportsplex and Dartmouth High School there is the Bridge Transit Terminal, a major hub for Metro Transit. The former Dartmouth Heritage Museum building has since been demolished, and the area it stands on was turned back into park land.

The supporting cast features Joseph Cotten, Edna May Oliver and George Reeves. The picture is a remake of Duvivier's Un carnet de bal (1937), which starred Marie Bell as the leading character.IMDB entry Plot An elderly woman named Lydia Macmillan (Merle Oberon), who is running a children's home, gets an unexpected visit from a long lost acquaintance, Dr. Michael Fitzpatrick (Joseph Cotten). They haven't seen each other for forty years, when they were young and in love. The story of their lives unfold as they remember the past with great fondness. Lydia remembers her three lovers as a young woman. First there was Bob Willard (George Reeves), a football quarterback. Then there was Frank Audry (Hans Jaray), who was a musician. The third, Richard Mason (Alan Marshal), was an adventurous traveler. Lydia and Michael decide to have tea together, but when she arrives at his home, she finds both Bob and Frank there waiting for her. It turns out all of the men have proposed to Lydia at one time in their life, and she has turned them all down. The topic of their conversation now at their reunion is her reason for rejecting them. Lydia tells them that she has only truly loved one man in her life, which is adventurer Richard Mason. Lydia starts telling her story to the men, beginning when she met Michael in Boston in 1897. At the time Lydia was living with her rich grandmother Sarah (Edna May Oliver). Before an upcoming ball, Lydia and her grandmother argue about the dress but are interrupted when the family butler presents his son Michael, who has just graduated from medical school. The grandmother instantly takes a liking to the boy, and he is put on staff as the family physician. Lydia persuades the young man to accompany her to the ball, but he soon discovers that Lydia is in love with a footballer by the name of Bob Willard. However, not long after the ball, grandmother meets Bob and wants Lydia to break up with him, mainly because of his ill and drunken manners. Lydia plans to elope with Bob and tries to involve Michael in her scheme. Instead of helping he sees to it that she cannot go through with marrying Bob in a nearby town. The disappointed couple have to return to Boston, and split up after a quarrel at the hotel where they have their \\"wedding\\" dinner. Elderly Bob interrupts Lydia's story by saying how much he has regretted his actions that night for the last forty years. Lydia goes on to describe how she met Richard Mason. She was accompanying Michael at the docks to say goodbye as he was shipping out to fight in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. She had met Richard once before, on the night of her \\"wedding day\\", but now she met him again at the docks, and recognized the handsome man whom she didn't know the name of. But it was a poor blind boy named Johnny Billy Roy who changed the course of her life that day. He made her focus her efforts to helping the less fortunate and start a school for unfortunate blind children. The school's success attracted the attention of a pianist named Frank Audry, who was in fact blind himself. Frank suggested to Lydia that he could teach music at the school and was hired immediately. Soon, he fell in love with her but she still insisted on not marrying to not become dependent on a man, and continue her work. It was not until she met Richard once again at a ball that she changed her mind about sharing her life with a man. Lydia told her grandmother that she had business in Boston, and went to see Richard in secret. They went to her hometown by the coast and spent two wonderful weeks together. When it was over, Richard departed without notice. He left Lydia a note, explaining that he had to settle the matter of another woman that already had a claim to him. He had enclosed a wedding ring in the note and promised to send her another ring in each letter until they could be together again. Lydia waits for Richard's return and has gives up hope when she receives a ring, sent by mail, and a note where he asks her to meet him at the altar in a Boston church on New Year's Eve. Expectantly, Lydia goes to the church and waits until she realizes he is not coming. She returns to her home and spends months in disappointment. She never tells anyone about what happened. In the meantime, Frank quits his teaching job at the school and leaves. Michael asks Lydia to marry him, despite knowing that she most certainly doesn't love him. Lydia accepts, in need of stability in her life. Unfortunately their union is tainted by the fact that the grandmother dies while toasting for their well-being, and Lydia breaks off the engagement. She travels to her own hometown to get over her love for him but doesn't succeed. She decides to devote her life to helping the blind children and gives up hope of love and marriage. Just as the elderly Lydia finishes her story, a butler calls out that Captain Richard Mason has arrived to the building. To Lydia's disappointment, he doesn't recognize nor remember her at all. Bitterly, Lydia utters that none of the men in her life ever knew her properly. Michael asks her who the real Lydia was, and she replies that there was never only one true Lydia; she was a different person to everyone who met her.http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/82210/Lydia/ Cast * Merle Oberon as Lydia MacMillan * Joseph Cotten as Michael Fitzpatrick * Hans Jaray as Frank Andry * Alan Marshal as Richard Mason * Edna May Oliver as Sarah MacMillan * George Reeves as Bob Willard * John Halliday as Fitzpatrick * Sara Allgood as Mary, Johnny's Mother * Billy Roy as Johnny * Frank Conlan as Old Ned * Harry Cording as Detective (uncredited) * Herbert Rawlinson as Dignitary (uncredited) Reception The film was only a moderate success at the box office. p172 Awards The film was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Score‚ÄîDramatic or Comedy Picture at the 14th Academy Awards.

(2010). Nassarius Dum√©ril, 1806. In: Bouchet, P.; Gofas, S.; Rosenberg, G. (2010) World Marine Mollusca database. Accessed through: World Register of Marine Species at http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id;=138235 on 2010-11-30 They are scavengers. Etymology The name is derived from the Latin word \\"nassa\\", meaning a wickerbasket with a narrow neck, for catching fish. Nassarius would then mean \\"someone who uses such a wickerbasket for catching fish\\". Ecology =Distribution and habitat= Species within this genus are found worldwide. These snails usually live on mud flats or sand flats, intertidally or subtidally. =Life habits= Most Nassarius species are very active scavengers, feeding on crabs and carrion as dead fish, etc. They often burrow into marine substrates and then wait with only their siphon protruding, until they smell nearby food. Shell description The shells of species in this genus have a relatively high cyrtoconoid (approaching a conical shape but with convex sides) spire and a siphonal notch. Anatomy The animal has a long siphon. Human use =Archeology= Several beads made from Nassarius gibbosulus shells are thought to be the earliest known forms of personal adornment, or even jewelry. Two shell beads found in Skhul Cave on the slopes of Mount Carmel, Israel, are thought to be 100,000 years old, whilst another found at Oued Djebbana, Algeria, is believed to be 90,000 years old. A further group of pierced shells, some with red ochre, has been recovered from the Aterian levels at the Taforalt site in Morocco; these Nassarius gibbosulus beads have been securely dated to about 82,000 years ago.Bouzouggar, A., Barton, N., Vanhaeren, M., d'Errico, F., Collcutt, S., Higham, T., Hodge, E., Parfitt, S., Rhodes, E., Schwenninger, J.-L., Stringer, C., Turner, E., Ward, S., Moutmir, A. and Stambouli, A. 2007. \\"82,000-year-old shell beads from North Africa and implications for the origins of modern human behavior\\" Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, June 4, 2007; http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/abstract/0703877104v1 All these examples predate several 75,000-year-old Nassarius kraussianus beads which were found at Blombos Cave, South Africa (including some colored with red ochre). These beads had previously been thought to be the oldest examples of jewelry.Study reveals 'oldest jewellery', BBC News, 22 June 2006 =Modern uses= Nassarius vibex is a species which is often selected for marine aquaria. It is often confused with Nassarius obsoletus, a cooler water snail less suited to tropical marine aquarium temperatures. In aquaria, the Nassarius is considered nearly indispensable for keeping sand beds clean and healthy, as these snails tend to burrow and plow through the upper layer in a conch-like fashion, keeping algae and detritus from building up visibly on the surface. The shells of various species of Nassarius are popular with shell collectors, and are sometimes used in jewelry and other forms of decoration. Taxonomy The genus Nassarius has traditionally been subdivided into several subgenera, based on differences in shell morphology, especially the sculpture: Aciculina, Alectrion, Allanassa, Nassodonta, Niotha, Plicarcularia, Profundinassa, Pygmaeonassa, Telasco, and Zeuxis. However, this division is difficult to define, resulting in much confusion. Even phylogenetic analysis shows that the division into these subgenera appears to be uncertain and unreliable. There seem to be two groups within the genus Nassarius with the closest relationship between the subgenera Zeuxis and Telasco. Even the species within the subgenus Plicarcularia do not belong to a single clade. In the end, the molecular phylogeny did not match the previous morphological phylogeny.Haitao Li (ÊùéÊµ∑Ê∂õ), Duan Lin (ÊûóÁ´Ø), Hongda Fang (ÊñπÂÆèËææ), Aijia Zhu (Êú±ËâæÂòâ) and Yang Gao (È´òÈò≥), Species identification and phylogenetic analysis of genus Nassarius (Nassariidae) based on mitochondrial genes, Chinese Journal of Oceanology and Limnology, Volume 28, Number 3 / May, 2010, pp. 565-572, doi 10.1007/s00343-010-9031-4 Gallery Nassarius sp.JPG File:Nassarius_scaldisianus_01.JPGNassarius scaldisianus File:Nassarius_semistriatus_01.JPGNassarius semistriatus File:Nassarius semistriatus 02.JPGNassarius semistriatus File:Nassarius glans glans 01.JPGNassarius (Alectrion) glans glans File:Nassarius papillosus 01.jpgNassarius (Alectrion) papillosus File:Nassarius_kochianus_01.JPGNassarius (Hima) kochianus File:Nassarius arcularia 01.JPGNassarius (Nassarius) arcularia File:Nassarius_coronatus_01.JPGNassarius (Nassarius) coronatus File:Nassarius crenoliratus 01.JPGNassarius (Nassarius) crenoliratus File:Nassarius graphiterus 01.JPGNassarius (Nassarius) graphiterus File:Nassarius_gregarius_01.JPGNassarius (Nassarius) gregarius File:Nassarius albescens albescens 001.JPGNassarius (Niotha) albescens albescens File:Nassarius conoidalis 01.jpgNassarius (Niotha) conoidalis (fossil) File:Nassarius_conoidalis_conoidalis_01.jpgNassarius (Niotha) conoidalis conoidalis File:Nassarius coronulus 01.JPGNassarius (Niotha) coronulus File:Nassarius distortus 01.JPGNassarius (Niotha) distortus (Smooth form) File:Nassarius gruneri 01.jpgNassarius (Niotha) gruneri File:Nassarius jacksonianus 01.JPGNassarius (Niotha) jacksonianus File:Nassarius_livescens_01.JPGNassarius (Niotha) livescens File:Nassarius nodiferus 01.jpgNassarius (Niotha) nodiferus File:Nassarius quadrasi 01.jpgNassarius (Niotha) quadrasi File:Nassarius stolatus 01.JPGNassarius (Niotha) stolatus File:Nassarius tiarula 01.JPGNassarius (Niotha) tiarula File:Nassarius bellulus 01.JPGNassarius (Plicarcularia) bellulus File:Nassarius bimaculosus 01.JPGNassarius (Plicarcularia) bimaculosus File:Nassarius elegantissimus 01.jpgNassarius (Plicarcularia) elegantissimus File:Nassarius_fissilabris_01.JPGNassarius (Plicarcularia) fissilabris File:Nassarius pullus 01.JPGNassarius (Plicarcularia) pullus File:Nassarius limnaeiformis 01.JPGNassarius (Telasco) limnaeiformis File:Nassarius_multipunctatus_01.JPGNassarius (Telasco) multipunctatus File:Nassarius_reeveanus_forma_zonalis_01.JPGNassarius (Telasco) reeveanus f. zonalis File:Nassarius_reticosus_01.jpgNassarius (Uzita) reticosus File:Nassarius celebensis 01.JPGNassarius (Zeuxis) celebensis File:Nassarius_dorsatus_01.JPGNassarius (Zeuxis) dorsatus File:Nassarius margaritifer 01.JPGNassarius (Zeuxis) margaritifer File:Nassarius_niveus_01.JPGNassarius (Zeuxis) niveus File:Nassarius olivaceus 01.JPGNassarius (Zeuxis) olivaceus File:Nassarius_variciferus_01.JPGNassarius (Zeuxis) variciferus Species In the course of time, more than 800 names have been allocated to species in the genus Nassarius, most of which have become synonyms.

Biography Born in Pittsford, New York, William Freeland Fullam was admitted into the United States Naval Academy, 24 September 1873; graduating No. 1, June 1877- Class of 1877. His commands through his long and distinguished naval career ranged from the sailing ship in 1904 to the battleship in 1909. On 15 April 1888, Lieutenant (j.g.) William Fullam married Ms. Mariana Winder Robinson; they had two daughters. During the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, Navy Lieutenant Fullam served aboard USS New Orleans (CL-22) during the Santiago Campaign- the blockading and bombardment of Santiago and San Juan; earning the Spanish Campaign Medal. Chief among his assignments ashore was as acting aide to Secretary of the Navy Josephus Daniels, February 1913 late January 1914, followed by duties as Superintendent of the United States Naval Academy, which he commanded from 7 February 1914 until spring of 1915. Following this successful assignment at the USNA, Rear Admiral Fullam was ordered to report for sea duty at the San Francisco naval district to become Commander-in-Chief, U.S. Pacific Fleet Reserve Force; effective 5 June 1915. He hoisted his flag aboard USS South Dakota (ACR-9), and later aboard USS Milwaukee (C-21). As Commander-in-Chief he was highly critical of the little interest the West coast citizens held in preparing for involvement of the European war. He stated: \\"It was time they awoke to the necessity for adequate preparedness...In the event of war the United States Navy would need at once 175,000 trained men.\\"Army and Navy Register. September 2, 1916. 306. \\"Rear Admiral Fullam Says Navy Needs 175,000 Men\\"- San Diego, CA. Aug. 27. In April 1917, Rear Admiral Fullam became Commander-in-Chief Patrol Force, U.S. Pacific Fleet, and was senior officer in command of the Pacific Fleet during the absence of the Fleet's Commander-in-Chief in South Atlantic waters. The merit of his service in such responsible positions was recognized with the award of the Navy Cross. In early 1918 Vice Admiral Kantar≈ç Suzuki (who later became the 42nd Prime Minister of Japan from April 7, 1945 to August 17, 1945) brought his two cruisers and to San Francisco and \\"banqueted\\" with Rear Admiral Fullam after receiving harbor entrance by Rear Admiral Fullam. Continuing his duties as Commander-in-Chief, U.S. Pacific Fleet, throughout the World War until 1 August 1919, he coordinated with the Japanese and British forces all ship movements while patrolling the whole Pacific from Alaska to the Panama Canal Zone. This was in order to check all German activities.\\"Naval Investigation: Hearings Before the Subcommittee On Naval Affairs United States Senate. Sixty-Six Congress, Second Session. Vol. 1.\\" Subcommittee of the Committee on Naval Affairs, Washington, D.C. Thursday, April 1, 1920. p. 755. During the summer of 1919, Rear Admiral Fullam, Commander, U.S. Pacific Fleet, was instrumental in arranging with the Navy Department for half of the U.S. Atlantic Fleet battleships to be assigned to the Pacific coast; bringing a total of fifteen battleships to protect our Pacific interests and communication sea lanes. Overall, during his tenure as Commander-in-Chief, Reserve Force, U.S. Pacific Fleet (1915‚Äì1919), Rear Admiral Fullam had a constant struggle with the Navy Department regarding Pacific force policy and shortages in personnel manning the ships. His communicating in personal letters to many of his fellow senior officers were forceful and were written with a freedom of expression- all wishing to prepare their units for the coming World War.\\"Naval Investigation: Hearings Before the Subcommittee On Naval Affairs United States Senate. Sixty-Six Congress, Second Session. Vol. 1.\\". p. 757. Rear Admiral Fullam retired (due to age) on Monday, October 20, 1919. At the time of his retirement, he was regarded by young and old alike as an ideal naval officer. Rear Admiral Fullam was a member of the New York Yacht Club, the Army and Navy Club, Navy League of the United States, and the United States Naval Academy alumni. Rear Admiral Fullam died at Washington, D.C., aged 70. Legacy The destroyer was named for him. Rear Admiral Fullam closely followed the progress and reports coming out of the Washington Naval Conference. He praised the Conference for modernizing naval thought (setting it free from the \\"thralldom of conservatism\\"), and having decreed the scrapping of 66 battleships and a holiday of ten years in battleship building. He strongly supported bringing the battleship into a lesser fleet role, allowing for increased procurement and utilization of submarines, aeroplane carriers and aeroplanes as offensive weapons- what he referred to as our \\"Three-Plane-Navy\\". Thus, a \\"balanced fleet\\" was more critical to the overall naval strength. He coined the term \\"battleshipitis\\".A term expressed by naval planners and congressional leaders given to those in the Navy Department and in the U.S. Senate who advocated concentrating naval power in the buildup of fleets of battleships; most popularly utilized following the \\"1916 Naval Expansion Act\\"; considered a naval malady. An excellent source of information can be found in Robert L. O'Connell, Sacred Vessels: The Cult of the Battleship and the Rise of the U.S. Navy (Boulder: Westview Press, 1991) At the 14th Annual Banquet of the Aero Club of America, Rear Admiral Fullam stated: \\"The world is facing a new era, an era which will bring aeronautics to the front and give it a proper place in peace and war...The aeroplane will be the dominating factor in future wars on land and sea...It is the duty of every naval officer to study and develop the usefulness of the aeroplane as a weapon. In this we must lead the world, we must not follow.\\"The 14th Annual Banquet of the Aero Club of America was conducted Monday evening, 9 January 1922, at the Commodore Hotel (re-opened in 1980 as the Grand Hyatt New York, New York City). To the Marine Corps, then Lieutenant (j.g.) William Fullam was well known to be an enemy to the Corps's institution and organization, due to his announcement that he would see that the Marine Corps is to be destroyed. It was the professional opinion of a number of young naval officers led by Lieutenant Commander Seaton Schroeder who cordially approved and endorsed the views of Lieutenant Fullam that the day for shipboard duties for Marines had passed.The Proceedings of the United States Naval Institute. Vol. XVI No. 1. Whole No. 55: \\"The System of Naval Training and Discipline Required to Promote Efficiency and Attract Americans.\\" Lieutenant W. F. Fullam, U.S.N. 1890. Lieutenant Commander Seaton Schroeder and Lieutenant (j.g.) William Fullam were members of the 1889 \\"Greer Board of Organizations, Tactics and Drills\\" (named for the senior board member Commodore James A. Greer) whose young naval officers believed and recommended to the Secretary of the Navy Benjamin F. Tracy that the use of Marines as ship police inhibited crew morale and recommended removal of the Marines from Navy warships. The idea at the time was for the existence aboard a warship of \\"one uniform, one fraternity, one service, one past, present and future history.\\" Their aim: to obtain higher efficiency in naval warfare through utilization of better training methods for naval personnel. The term Fullamite became a name that has long became registered in many military books denoted someone that refers to non-believers of the Marine Corps philosophy. Awards During his distinguished career, Rear Admiral William F. Fullam, USN, received the following awards: * Recognition for graduating No. 1, USNA Class of 1877 * Spanish Campaign Medal, 1898 * Special Letters of Commendation for work protecting American interests in the West Indies (Cuba) and Central America (Honduras), 1906 * Three Letters of Commendation for efficiency aboard USS Mississippi, 1909‚Äì1911 * World War I Victory Medal (United States), 1917‚Äì1919 * Navy Cross Ancestry * Member of \\"The Empire State Society of the Sons of the American Revolution\\" * Lineage listed in \\"Colonial Families of the United States of America, Volume VI\\" William F. Fullam was a direct descendant of American Revolutionary War veteran Lieutenant Elisha Fullam II of Weston, Massachusetts. William was the son of Nathan Seymour Fullman and Rhoda Ann Stowits. Lieutenant Elisha Fullam II assisted in establishing American Independence while acting as a platoon officer within Captain Jonathan Davis' Company of Colonel Asa Whitcomb's 5th Militia of the Massachusetts Line, 23rd Continental Regiment of Foot. This unit marched on the alarm of 19 April 1775- the Battles of Lexington and Concord. Thus, on 20 October 1920 (at the age of 65 years) William F. Fullam, Rear Admiral, USN (Ret.), became a member of \\"The Empire State Society of the Sons of the American Revolution\\".

It is a ria, which formed at the end of the last ice age, when sea levels flooded the Chehalis River. The bay is long and wide. The Chehalis River flows into its eastern end, where the city of Aberdeen stands at that river's mouth, on its north bank, with the somewhat smaller city of Hoquiam immediately to its northwest, along the bayshore. Besides the Chehalis, many lesser rivers and streams flow into Grays Harbor, such as Hoquiam River and Humptulips River. A pair of low peninsulas separate it from the Pacific Ocean, except for an opening about two miles (3 km) in width. The northern peninsula, which is largely covered by the community of Ocean Shores, ends in Point Brown. Facing that across the bay-mouth is Point Chehalis, at the end of the southern peninsula upon which stands the town of Westport. Grays Harbor is named after Captain Robert Gray who discovered and entered it on May 7, 1792 in the course of his fur-trading voyages along the north Pacific coast of North America. Gray named the bay Bullfinch Harbor, but it was afterward named Gray's Harbor by Captain George Vancouver, whose contemporaneous explorations of the region‚Äîthe ships of the two captains had met at sea, only days earlier‚Äîwere well publicised at the time, while Gray's voyages were not. Gray's Harbor was the name that stuck (the apostrophe was omitted under US Board on Geographic Names guidelines). A few days later, on May 11 Gray found a navigable channel into the estuary of the Columbia River, and sailed into it, the first white man known to have done so. Settlement of the area began in the early 1870s and was largely dependent on the lumber industry. As the forests of the eastern United States depleted, many loggers from the East and the Midwest migrated to the Grays Harbor area, as well as many Scandinavians and Finns from Europe.Gulick 1996, pp. 164-165. Grays Harbor National Wildlife Refuge is located on of intertidal mudflats, salt marsh, and uplands around Hoquiam. The Daily Washingtonian was a daily newspaper in Grays Harbor founded by Otis M. Moore. Islands and sandbars Islands include: *Grass Island (), near Westport *Rennie Island, near Aberdeen, the largest at *Sand Island, almost in the center of Grays Harbor **Goose Island (), near Sand Island Protection Island () is listed by USGS, but is listed by the City of Ocean Shores as an accreted landform called Damon Point, a park attached to Point Brown. Named bars include Whitcomb Flats (), near Westport. A large unnamed bar or island () also stands off of Markham at the mouth of Johns River.USGS 1:24,000 \\"Westport, Washington\\" topographic quadrangle, 1995 ed. Sand Island, Goose Island and Whitcomb Flats are included in Washington Natural Areas Program. Johns River Wildlife Area, managed by Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife, includes the Markham island. Historic events In the early 20th century, Greys Harbor was the largest lumber shipyard in the world. The Industrial Workers of the World led strikes in the area in 1912, 1917, and 1923. Some of these labor actions were militant, such as an armed union ship shooting at the Fearless, a scab ship in 1906. Grays Harbor in 1891 (or earlier?), as depicted in Frances Fuller Victor's Atlantis Arisen. The schooner Annie Larsen was seized at Grays Harbor on 25 June 1915 by US customs officials, later leading to what was at the time the most expensive trial in US legal history. During World War II, harbor defenses including searchlights, 12-inch coast defense mortar, 155 mm howitzers and other guns were emplaced around Grays Harbor by Western Defense Command (see 56th Air Defense Artillery Regiment).

Club career Born in Matar√≥, Barcelona, Catalonia, Rodri was a product of FC Barcelona's youth system. He played only two La Liga games with the first team over the course of two seasons, his first being on 11 December 2004 in a 2‚Äì1 away win against Albacete Balompi√© (three minutes played), and Bar√ßa were eventually crowned back-to-back champions in his second year, although he was mainly registered with the B-side. During the summer of 2006, Rodri was purchased by Galicia's Deportivo de La Coru√±a, making just six competitive appearances for the main squad in two seasons. In January 2007, he was loaned to second division club UD Almer√≠a, playing the entire 2007‚Äì08 campaign with Polideportivo Ejido, also in that tier and in Andalusia. In September 2008, Rodri was again loaned by Depor, joining Portuguese Primeira Liga team C.S. Mar√≠timo. However, not having been used during his brief spell, he returned to A Coru√±a, moving in January 2009 to another Spanish division two side, UD Salamanca. In late July 2009, Rodri was released by Deportivo and stayed in the second tier, signing a 1+1 contract with H√©rcules CF. In his first year he experienced his best season as a professional, scoring four goals in 38 matches as the Alicante club returned to the top flight after a 13-year absence. Rodri appeared in 13 games for H√©rcules in 2010‚Äì11, mainly due to injury or suspension to habitual starters Abraham Paz and No√© Pamarot. In March 2011, he moved to FC Spartak Moscow in Russia for ‚Ç¨400,000, signing a one-year deal. After his contract ended, Rodri left Spartak. On 31 August 2012, he returned to his homeland and joined Rayo Vallecano. After two years in the Belgian First Division B with K.A.S. Eupen, he resumed his career in the Spanish lower leagues.

MAD homolog 2 belongs to the SMAD, a family of proteins similar to the gene products of the Drosophila gene 'mothers against decapentaplegic' (Mad) and the C. elegans gene Sma. SMAD proteins are signal transducers and transcriptional modulators that mediate multiple signaling pathways.  Function  SMAD2 mediates the signal of the transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta, and thus regulates multiple cellular processes, such as cell proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation. This protein is recruited to the TGF-beta receptors through its interaction with the SMAD anchor for receptor activation (SARA) protein. In response to TGF-beta signal, this protein is phosphorylated by the TGF-beta receptors. The phosphorylation induces the dissociation of this protein with SARA and the association with the family member SMAD4. The association with SMAD4 is important for the translocation of this protein into the cell nucleus, where it binds to target promoters and forms a transcription repressor complex with other cofactors. This protein can also be phosphorylated by activin type 1 receptor kinase, and mediates the signal from the activin. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding the same protein have been observed. Like other Smads, Smad2 plays a role in the transmission of extracellular signals from ligands of the Transforming Growth Factor beta (TGFŒ≤) superfamily of growth factors into the cell nucleus. Binding of a subgroup of TGFŒ≤ superfamily ligands to extracellular receptors triggers phosphorylation of Smad2 at a Serine-Serine-Methionine-Serine (SSMS) motif at its extreme C-terminus. Phosphorylated Smad2 is then able to form a complex with Smad4. These complexes accumulate in the cell nucleus, where they are directly participating in the regulation of gene expression. Nomenclature The SMAD proteins are homologs of both the drosophila protein, mothers against decapentaplegic (MAD) and the C. elegans protein SMA. The name is a combination of the two. During Drosophila research, it was found that a mutation in the gene MAD in the mother repressed the gene decapentaplegic in the embryo. The phrase \\"Mothers against\\" was added, since mothers often form organizations opposing various issues, e.g., Mothers Against Drunk Driving, or (MADD). The nomenclature for this protein is based on a tradition of such unusual naming within the gene research community.\\"Sonic Hedgehog, DICER, and the Problem With Naming Genes\\", Sep 26, 2014, Michael White. psmag.com  Interactions  Mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 2 has been shown to interact with: * ANAPC10, * DAB2, * EP300, * FOXH1, * HDAC1, * TGIF1, * Insulin receptor, * LEF1, * Myc, * MEF2A, * PIAS3, * PIN1, * SKI protein, * SKIL, * SMAD3, * SMURF2, * SNW1, * STRAP References Further reading   Category:Developmental genes and proteins Category:MH1 domain Category:MH2 domain Category:R-SMAD Category:Transcription factors Category:Human proteins ","title":"Mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 2"},{"id":"5673668","text":"George Edward Bardeen Sr. (10 Nov 1850 - 26 Jan 1924Florida Death Index, 1877-1998), a long-time resident of Otsego, Michigan, USA, was a businessman and state-level politician.

However, Bowie served as a member of the State constitutional convention in 1851, as member of the judicial committee assisting in framing the State's new constitution, and as presidential elector on the Whig ticket in 1852. In 1854 and 1856, Bowie was elected from the sixth district of Maryland as a Democrat to the Thirty-fourth and Thirty-fifth Congresses, serving from March 4, 1855, to March 3, 1859. He was an unsuccessful candidate for re-nomination in 1858 to the Thirty-sixth Congress. After Congress, he resumed the practice of his profession.  Death  He died in Upper Marlboro and is interred in the Waring family burying ground at Mount Pleasant, near Upper Marlboro.

Soldier of Castile Fernando S√°nchez de Tovar was the Adelantado Mayor of Pedro of Castile at the start of the First Castilian Civil War, but in 1366 he betrayed the King and delivered the city of Calahorra to Pedro's brother and enemy, Henry of Trast√°mara. One year later, Fernando S√°nchez de Tovar fought on Henry's side in the Battle of N√°jera. Admiral Main attacks on England by Tovar and Vienne (1374‚Äì1380). In 1374 he succeeded the Genoese Ambrosio Boccanegra as Major Admiral of Castile. Due to the hostile politics of John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster, the new king, Henry II of Castile joined the French side during the Hundred Years' War and declared war on England. As a result, S√°nchez de Tovar led the Castilian fleet along with the French Jean de Vienne to South England and sacked and burned the Isle of Wight and the English ports of Rye, Rottingdean, Lewes, Folkestone, Plymouth, Portsmouth and Hastings. In 1380 the joint fleet sailed up the Thames and burned Gravesend, over 20 miles east of London. In 1381, S√°nchez de Tovar returned to the Iberian Peninsula to fight against England's ally, Portugal, and defeated a Portuguese squadron at the Battle of the Saltes Island during the Third Ferdinand War. John I of Castile, son and successor of Henry II, created him Lord of Belves. In 1382 he travelled to France and joined the army of Charles VI during the siege of Brugge, ruled by the rebel Philip van Artevelde, but he soon returned to Castile. Ferdinand I of Portugal died in 1383 without heir and John I of Castile claimed the Portuguese throne because he was married to the only daughter of the late king, Beatrice of Portugal. However, the Master of the Order of Aviz, Ferdinand's bastard brother, John of Avis, also claimed the throne and Castile declared war against him, starting the 1383-1385 crisis. In this new campaign, S√°nchez de Tovar led the Castilian fleet against the Portuguese and took part in the siege of Lisbon, where he died in 1384 from the plague.

British nomenclature The British received far more M4 medium tanks, approximately 17,000 (roughly 34% of all M4s produced), than any other Allied nation. The British practice of naming American tanks after American Civil War generals was continued, giving it the name General Sherman after Union General William Tecumseh Sherman, usually shortened to Sherman. The US later adopted the name and the practice of naming tanks after generals. In the British naming system, the major variants were identified by Mark numbers, the M4 being \\"Sherman I\\", the M4A1 \\"Sherman II\\" and so on. Letters after the mark number denoted modifications to the base model: \\"A\\" for the 76 mm L/55 gun instead of the 75mm, \\"B\\" for the 105 mm M4 L/22.5 howitzer, \\"C\\" for the (British) QF 17 pounder (76.2 mm) gun, and \\"Y\\" for the later wider- tracked Horizontal Volute Spring Suspension (HVSS) type suspension. Gun and suspension letters were used in combination, e.g. Sherman IBY. However, no production 75mm Shermans were built with HVSS and no HVSS 17pdr conversions (CY) therefore existed.

In 1945, the 1st Coldstream Guards at the Rhine fitted Sherman turrets with two \\"60 lb\\" RP-3 air-to-ground rockets on rails to create the Sherman Tulip. Canada created a prototype anti-aircraft vehicle with four 20 mm Polsten cannons mounted in a turret on Canadian-made M4A1 hull, which was called Skink. The Soviets reportedly replaced the US 75 mm gun on some M4A2s with the 76.2mm F-34 gun of the T-34 medium tank to create the M4M; they discontinued the practice when assured of US ammunition supply (Zaloga 1984:217). For the D-Day landings, the British developed special and specific deep wading kits for Shermans I/II, III and V. US forces in the Pacific suffered many drowned M4s by not having such kits early in the island landing campaigns, and they were rapidly copied for later landings. =Conversions= Sherman VC with British 17 pdr gun. Compare to 75 mm gun Sherman at the top of this page. A number of Sherman tanks were converted to carry different armament or fill different roles than those for which the tank was originally manufactured. Among these were: *Tank AA, 20 mm Quad, Skink ‚Äì Canadian prototype anti- aircraft vehicle with four 20 mm Polsten cannon mounted in a turret on a Grizzly hull (tank made in Canada, not Lend-Leased). *Sherman Duplex Drive (DD) ‚Äì British-developed swimming gear fitted to British, Canadian, and US Shermans for the Normandy landings. *Sherman 17pdr aka \\"Firefly\\" ‚Äì British Sherman I or V re-armed with QF 17 pounder (76.2 mm) anti-tank gun with C added to designation (as in Sherman IC or VC).

Post-war the \\"Firefly\\" name is commonly used to refer to these vehicles, but it was not an official name and not commonly used during the war. *Sherman Tulip ‚Äì British Sherman with two 3-inch (\\"60lb\\") RP-3 rockets on rails added to the turret. Used by the 1st Coldstream Guards at the Rhine in 1945. * RMASG \\"Control Tank\\" ‚Äì Sherman V tanks allocated to the Royal Marines Armoured Support Group for the D-Day landings were fitted with a dial sight in a protruding square cover on the top right of the turret. This permitted them to be used accurately in the indirect fire role as self-propelled artillery, initially from the decks of landing craft but later also ashore. Direct fire sights were retained. These tanks can be identified in photos by the 360-degree compass bearing markings around the turret. =Combat engineering vehicles= Sherman Crab Mk II.

It was British policy to have ARVs using the same mechanical parts as the gun tanks they supported wherever possible. ARV I was a simple turretless towing vehicle with light jib while ARV II had much more sophisticated recovery and repair equipment, a raised box-like superstructure and heavier jib. It was considered superior to the US M32 ARV, very few of which were used by British units. *Beach Armoured Recovery Vehicle (BARV) ‚Äì British conversion of Sherman III with large boat-shaped superstructure that was capable of deep wading near the shore. A simple push/pull ARV that served until replaced by Centurion BARV in the mid-1960s.

Hunnicutt, Sherman: A History of the American Medium Tank, Presidio Press, Novato, CA, 1994, p. 420-421. Service history =United Kingdom= An early-model British Sherman II (M4A1) with two additional fixed mount machine-guns positioned in the front of the hull and its short M2 75mm tank gun with a supporting counterweight. Most M4A4 Sherman Vs were provided to US allies under Lend-Lease, like this one in the markings of the 5th Canadian Division. The British Empire received 17,184 Sherman tanks from the USA under Lend-Lease, roughly 78% of all American Shermans provided worldwide under this program. This includes Sherman tanks used by all members of the British Empire and those Allies who were equipped by the UK, such as the Free Poles. The first M4A1 Sherman II received by the UK was equipped with two driver-operated fixed mount machine-guns in the hull front and carried the shorter M2 75mm tank gun with a counterweight. The two extra hull machine-guns were a standard feature of very early Shermans, carried over from the previous M3 Medium (Lee/Grant) tank, and were one of the first elements to be discarded from the original plan. Bovington Tank Museum has an example of this build- standard, the very first Sherman tank supplied to the UK under Lend-Lease and christened \\"Michael\\". The British became the primary users of the M4A4 Sherman V, which they found to be far more reliable than did the few US users (mainly for testing within the continental USA). M4 Sherman I, M4A1 Sherman II and M4A2 Sherman III were also used in (roughly) that order of importance. Free Polish and Czechoslovak-in-exile armoured units supported and equipped by the British had M4A1s, M4A2s and some M4A4s. Some Shermans in British service were also converted to specialist-type combat engineering vehicles. The Sherman Crab was the main conversion, which was designed to be used for clearing minefields in northwestern Europe and Italy. The Beach Armoured Recovery Vehicle was a waterproofed armoured recovery vehicle produced in small numbers and used only in support of beach-landings to pull drowned tanks and vehicles from the water and to push off stuck or beached landing-craft. =North Africa= The first Shermans to see battle in World War II were M4A1s (Sherman IIs) with the British Eighth Army at the Second Battle of El Alamein in October 1942. The tanks had been supplied in a hurry from the US, which had removed them from their own army units. They were then hastily modified to meet British military requirements and for desert and hot-weather conditions, such as the addition of sandshields over the tracks.Sandars p6 Over 250 of these US-supplied Shermans, which were divided among 12 regiments, participated in the battle. They formed the so-called \\"heavy squadrons\\" (16 tanks in each) of one brigade in each division of X Corps and some other squadrons of the other units taking part in the battle, with the other heavy squadrons still being equipped with M3 Lee/Grant tanks and light squadrons possessing M3 Stuart 'Honey' light tanks and Crusader cruiser tanks. The British Shermans were able to tackle enemy rearguard units and defending troops by using high-explosive (HE) shells which were fired indirectly at them whilst the German 5 cm Pak 38 anti-tank gun was only effective against the Sherman if it could engage it from the more-vulnerable sides. More of the British armoured units in North Africa were converted to increasingly-larger quantities of Shermans over time from their successful outcome at El Alamein, including the addition of Sherman IIIs (M4A2s) aside from the previous Sherman II, although the infantry tank units retained use of their Churchill tanks. =Italy= The British forces in Italy did not use their standard cruiser tanks (such as the Crusader). Instead, in their place, they used Shermans and turretless Stuart tanks (such Stuarts, as well as regular gun-tank Stuarts, equipped their reconnaissance troops). The other tank of the campaign was the Churchill tank (early models carried a 6-pdr tank gun; later models had a 75mm main-gun), with such equipped tank units being bolstered with Shermans. In general, the Shermans acted in the infantry-support role in difficult (mountainous and hilly) terrain against fixed-type German defences and fortifications. At the end of 1944, 76mm-, 105mm- (howitzer) and 17-pdr-armed Shermans began to be fielded by the British troops as they came up against the German-built and strongly-defended Gothic Line. =Northwest Europe= Normandy, 10 June 1944. Note crashed Horsa glider in background. British and Commonwealth use in Europe was comprehensive. The Sherman replaced the M3 Grant and Lee tanks and the Ram Tank in Canadian service and was in the majority by 1944 ‚Äì the other main late-war tanks being the Churchill and Cromwell. The Cromwell was used largely in the reconnaissance role. The slower, more heavily armoured Churchills were used in the infantry-support Tank Brigades. The Sherman 17pdr variant was converted mostly from the M4 Sherman I and M4A4 Sherman V, with possibly a few Sherman III, and was used both in Sherman and Cromwell-equipped units to add extra anti-tank capability. The VC was necessary as the intended supplement (the 17 pdr development of the Cromwell was produced in insufficient numbers whilst the production of the VC was much greater). A 1944-pattern British armoured squadron (equivalent to a US company) had one 17pdr Sherman per troop (platoon) of four Shermans. The 17pdr Sherman was retained in Cromwell units until the introduction of the Comet, which carried the 77mm HV, a shortened derivative of the OQF 17 pounder firing the 17 pounder shell from the cartridge of the obsolete 3-inch 20cwt AA gun for less recoil but with slightly less armour penetration. By the end of the war, 50% of the Shermans in British service were VCs or ICs. With the end of the war, and with superior tanks entering service, the UK returned its Shermans to reduce its Lend-Lease payments. However, the US did not really want the 17pdr conversions returned and many found their way from British stocks into other armies post-war, where they served until the 1960s in many cases (e.g. Argentine Repotenciado upgrade of IC and VC fitted with French 105mm gun and diesel engine). =India= Indian Armoured Corps in a Sherman III tank in the Middle East, March 1944. In the Indian Army tradition, formations included British regiments alongside Indian Army units.The Army of India consisted of both the Indian Army and the British Army in India between 1903 and 1947. As well as some Indian units receiving Shermans, the 116th Regiment Royal Armoured Corps (converted from the 9th Battalion Gordon Highlanders) part of 255th Brigade was equipped with Shermans. As part of the 255th, they were involved in January and February 1945 in Burma in action near Meiktila and Mandalay. The actions were predominantly in support of infantry with few enemy tanks encountered.Sandars p21 After that, they were part of mobile columns that moved to retake Rangoon. =New Zealand= The 4th New Zealand Armoured Brigade operated approximately 150 M4A2 Sherman tanks from late 1942 until the end of the war. The 4th Brigade formed part of the New Zealand 2nd Division and was converted from an infantry brigade. The 4th Armoured Brigade saw action during the Italian Campaign. =Australia= A M4A2 during Australian Army trials in 1944 Although the Australian Army received 757 M3 Lee/Grants in 1942, it only received three Sherman tanks. These three tanks were supplied by the UK and were only used for trials purposes. When the Australian Cruiser tank program was cancelled in 1943, after US authorities promised M4 Mediums would be available in any quantity required by Australia. A proposal was made to replace the entire order of 775 Australian Cruiser tanks with 310 Sherman tanks; however, this proposal was not acted on. Early in 1944 Australian Army was requested by War Office to undertake trials of Churchill and Sherman tanks in \\"New Guinea conditions\\". Trials were conducted in the jungle terrain of New Guinea using British Churchill Mk IV, Mk V and Mk VII Infantry tanks and American Sherman M4A1 and M4A2 Medium tanks, and included armament tests involving firing 75mm and 95mm main guns on a Japanese style bunker constructed from coconut logs. It was considered by those trials results that the Churchill was preferable to the Sherman for operations in jungle. Australia's first Sherman, an M4A2, arrived in Australia in 1943 with a further two M4s (sometimes mis-labeled as M4A1s) arriving for tropical trials in New Guinea in 1944. The tanks were manned by crews drawn from the Australian 4th Armoured Brigade. The results of these trials showed that the British Churchill tank was better suited to jungle warfare's low-speed infantry support than the Sherman. As a result, the Australian Government ordered 510 Churchills, of which 51 were delivered before the order was cancelled at the end of the war, and did not order any further Shermans. Following the war, the three trials tanks were placed on display at Australian Army bases and one was later destroyed after being used as a tank target.Paul D. Handel Australian Shermans Accessed 30 June 2006. =Canada= The United States officially did not list Canada as a Lend-Lease recipient, but did create the 1941 Joint Defense Production Committee with Canada so that \\"each country should provide the other with the defense articles which it is best able to produce\\" and American Locomotive Company enabled its Canadian subsidiary, the Montreal Locomotive Works, to build M4A1 variants in Canada. Canada received four Shermans under Lend-Lease; the mechanism of this is not fully understood.\\"Lend-Lease Shipments: World War II,\\" Section IIIB, Published by Office, Chief of Finance, War Department, 31 December 1946, p. 8. The MLW built 188 Shermans called the Grizzly I cruiser in Canadian service, which were restricted to training. MLW investment in Sherman production was turned to production of the Sexton self-propelled gun. In European combat, the Canadian Army used American-built Shermans supplied by the UK. These were armed with 75 mm, 105 mm and 17-pounder guns.Guthrie, Steve The Sherman in Canadian Service Service Publications, Ottawa, ON. =China= An estimated number of 812 Shermans were transferred to the Republic of China under Lend-Lease.Hunnicutt p.166 Chinese forces based in British India received 100 M4A4 Shermans and used them to great effect against considerably- inferior Japanese tanks and their infantry in the subsequent offensives, such as in Battle of Northern Burma and Western Yunnan, between 1943 and 1944. After the war, some vehicles remaining in India went to the British, with several others put to use by the Nationalist Chinese (Kuomintang) against Chinese communist (CCP) forces in the Chinese Civil War until the KMT's defeat in 1949. =Soviet Union= Soviet M4A2(76)W Shermans lined up on the side of a street in the Czech city of Brno in April 1945. An abandoned Soviet M4A2 (75mm-gun version) left behind near Smolensk, just before the start of Operation Bagration in 1944. The M4A2s used by the Red Army were considered to be much-less prone to blow up due to ammunition detonation than their T-34/76 but had a higher tendency to overturn in road accidents and collisions or because of rough terrain due to their much-higher center of gravity.–õ–æ–∑–∞ –î–º–∏—Ç—Ä–∏–π –§–µ–¥–æ—Ä–æ–≤–∏—á ‚Äì –Ø –ü–æ–º–Ω—é. –ì–µ—Ä–æ–∏ –í–µ–ª–∏–∫–æ–π –û—Ç–µ—á–µ—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–π –≤–æ–π–Ω—ã. –£—á–∞—Å—Ç–Ω–∏–∫–∏ –í–û–í. in Russian. Under Lend-Lease, 4,102 M4A2 medium tanks were sent to the Soviet Union. Of these, 2,007 were equipped with the original 75 mm main gun, with 2,095 mounting the more-capable 76 mm tank gun. The total number of Sherman tanks sent to the U.S.S.R. under Lend-Lease represented 18.6% of all Lend- Lease Shermans.Lend-Lease Shipments: World War II, Section IIIB, Published by Office, Chief of Finance, War Department, 31 December 1946, p. 8. The first 76mm-armed M4A2 diesel-fuel Shermans started to arrive in Soviet Union in the late summer of 1944. By 1945, some Red Army armoured units were standardized to depend primarily on them and not on their ubiquitous T-34. Such units include the 1st Guards Mechanized Corps, the 3rd Guards Mechanized Corps, 6th Guards Tank Army and the 9th Guards Mechanized Corps, amongst others. The Sherman was largely held in good regard and viewed positively by many Soviet tank-crews which operated it before, with compliments mainly given to its reliability, ease of maintenance, generally good firepower (referring especially to the 76mm-gun version) and decent armour protection, as well as an auxiliary-power unit (APU) to keep the tank's batteries charged without having to run the main engine for the same purpose as the Soviets' own T-34 tank required. =Poland= Poland was not a recipient of Lend-Lease aid directly from the United States, however, Polish forces also used a wide variety of Shermans redirected from Lend-Lease shipments to the British Empire. The Polish 1st Armoured Division entered the Battle of Normandy mostly equipped with Sherman Vs (M4A4s) with 75 mm guns, and VC Shermans. The reconnaissance battalion was equipped with Cromwells, as in British armoured divisions.With the 10th Mounted Rifle Regiment. After heavy losses closing the Falaise Pocket and in the Dutch campaign, the division was re-equipped, largely with Sherman IIA (M4A1 (W) 76 mm) models. The Polish II Corps, fighting in Italy, primarily used M4A2s (Sherman III) that had been used by the British Army in Africa. However, some ICs and Sherman IB (M4(105 mm)) howitzer tanks were also used. Parts of the Polish First Army also briefly used M4A2 (76 mm) borrowed from the Soviet armies after heavy losses in the conquest of Danzig. After receiving replacements, the army was re-equipped with T-34s. =France= M4A1 in French markings with national (Free French) diamond symbol on hull side The first use of Sherman tanks by a French unit appears to have been with 1√®re Compagnie Autonome de Chars de Combat (1√®re CACC), it was merged with the French Army Corps Reconnaissance Group (GRCA), and was known as the \\"Free French Flying Column\\". It was part of the British Eighth Army, and fought from El-Alamein to Tunisia. The tank company was attached to \\"Force L (Leclerc)\\" and later became the 1st Company of the newly organized 501√®me R√©giment de Chars de Combat, 2√®me Division Blind√©e. http://the.shadock.free.fr/sherman_minutia/french_shermans/french_shermans.html Free French Forces were created after invasion of North Africa, and used all major versions of the M4. Report indicates France received 656 Sherman Medium Tanks (new production 274 M4A4s and 362 M4A2s plus 20 remanufactured M4A2s), being the third largest recipient of the Sherman. Tanks were provided by the U.S. under Lend-Lease. French armored divisions were organized and equipped the same as U.S. Army's \\"light\\" armored division table of organization and equipment of 1943. Each division was equipped with 165 Shermans. In 1943, the French decided to create their new army in north Africa, and had an agreement with the Americans to be equipped with modern US weapons. The French 2nd Armored Division () entered the Battle of Normandy fully equipped with M4A2s. The 1st and 5th DB, which entered southern France as part of the First French Army, were equipped with a mixture of M4A2 and M4A4 medium tanks. M4A3(76) and M4A3(75)W tanks were later received as replacements to make up for M4A2 losses in combat. The French were also issued M4A3(105)Shermans, not under Lend Lease but since their units served under US Army command, additional equipment was provided from US Army stocks. The 2√®me DB received a few M4(105)s at the end of July 1944 while still in the UK. The 3rd DB, which served as a training and reserve organization for the three operational armored divisions, was equipped with roughly 200 medium and light tanks. Of these, 120 were later turned in to the U.S. Army's Delta Base Section for reissue. Subsequent combat losses for the 1st, 2nd, and 5th Armored Divisions were replaced with standard issue tanks from U.S. Army stocks including M4, M4A1, and M4A3 models. In the final weeks of the War in Europe, French units received supplies of M4A1(75)s, remanufactured in the US before shipment overseas. (Vigneras, Marcel, \\"Rearming the French,\\" Office of the Chief of Military History, Dept. of the Army, (Washington, DC GPO) 1957, p. 244-246.) =Brazil= Brazil received 53 Sherman tanks under Lend-Lease in 1941, all equipped with the 75 mm gun. These tanks were not used by the Brazilian Expeditionary Force in Italy during the war, but sent directly to defend Brazil itself. In the early 1950s, another group of 30 Sherman tanks was delivered under the Military Assistance Program, bringing the total number of Shermans to 83 tanks. The variants of these tanks consisted of 40 M4, 38 M4 with the Composite Hull, and 2 M4A1. The Brazilian Army used the Shermans until 1979 when they were replaced by M41 tanks.M4 Sherman no Brasil =Czechoslovakia= While the Czechoslovak government-in- exile did not receive Lend-lease equipment from the United States, its 1st Czechoslovak Armoured Brigade was equipped and supplied by the British Army. The Brigade's equipment during the siege of Dunkirk included 36 Sherman ICs in addition to Cromwell tanks, which constituted the primary armoured vehicle operated by the brigade. The 17pdr Shermans were, in May 1945, exchanged for 22 Challengers with which the brigade returned home. In addition, one damaged Sherman I abandoned by an unknown unit was salvaged from the battlefield by the brigade's repair shop and was later used as a recovery vehicle. This vehicle returned with the brigade to Czechoslovakia. =South Africa= South African Shermans were used by the 6th Armoured Division.

Now a subsidiary of Fortune Brands Home & Security, Master Lock Company LLC was formed in 1921 by locksmith-inventor Harry E. Soref and is headquartered in Oak Creek, Wisconsin. In 1970 the company was purchased by American Brands from Soref's heirs. American Brands was later renamed to Fortune Brands, which then split on October 3, 2011, to create the Fortune Brands Home & Security company and the beverages company Beam Inc. (which was then soon purchased by Suntory). Early company history Before co-founding the company in 1921, Harry Soref had been a traveling locksmith in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico,Harry E. Soref, Univ. Wisconsin Milwaukee Sheldon B. Lubar School of Business. had invented a lock for protecting military equipment, and had founded the \\"Master Key\\" company for making master skeleton keys. In 1919, Soref then invented a padlock design that used laminated steel layers to economically produce an exceptionally strong lock body. He tried unsuccessfully to get some large companies interested in using his design, so he and two friends‚ÄîP. E. Yolles and Sam Stahl,Master Lock Company History, Funding Universe,‚Äîworked together to found the Master Lock company in Milwaukee in 1921 to produce the locks themselves, initially with five employees. In 1924, the company was granted the first patent on such a laminated lock design. Stahl led the company to become a major manufacturer of locks and the three co-founders worked closely together until Soref's death in 1957. However, the brand had not yet reached its peak status as a familiar consumer brand at the time of Soref's death. Stahl led the company until selling his shares to Soref's children who took over the company management, later selling the company to the American Brands Corporation in 1970. 2000s In 2002, Master Lock released its Titanium Series of padlocks, the first major redesign in fifty years. The goal was to add design variety and aesthetic value to the utilitarian functionality of their locks. The lock mechanism has titanium reinforced steel, with a stainless steel body. A shroud covers parts of the stainless steel, allowing the locks to come in different colors. Master Lock requested that the designer locks be stocked in departments outside the hardware section of retailers. The design received an Industrial Design Excellence award from Business Week in 2002. In 2003, the company acquired Illinois based American Lock and all their intellectual and material property. In 2010, Master Lock began offering a password manager service called Master Lock Vault that includes a web site and associated software applications for use on various devices. In 2011 Fortune Brands spun off Master Lock as part of Fortune Brands Home & Security. In 2012, Master Lock introduced a line of combination padlocks called the dialSpeed.Master dialSpeed 1500EDBX Padlock Review, Gadget Review, August 23, 2012. The dialSpeed lock is battery-operated, has a lit face, and features multiple user-programmable combinations. It has a master unlocking code that can be accessed through the company web site. The product won a 2011 silver Edison Award. In 2014, Master Lock acquired SentrySafe for $117.5 million. New products in the 2000s moved beyond locks, such as industrial space cover sealing mechanisms. Distribution of Master Lock products occurs through wholesale distributors that supply the locks to individual retailers. Locks are made for a variety of uses, including personal locking, vehicle locking, and others.  Tough Under Fire ad  In 1974, Master Lock ran a Super Bowl ad demonstrating one of their locks withstanding a shot by a sharpshooter, thereby proving its durability and thus their slogan \\"Tough Under Fire\\". Master Lock continued running similar ads during future Super Bowls, spending almost their entire annual marketing budget on the single commercial.Blankenhorn, Dana, Advertising During the Super Bowl: A Mixed Bag, ClickZ Marketing News & Expert Advice, Jan. 23, 2001. Later, Master would incorporate the image into a one second-long blipvert commercial in 1998.Christopher, Alistair, Blink Of An Ad, Time, Aug. 3, 1998.  Offshoring and re-shoring  At its peak in the early 1990s, the company employed about 1,300 workers in the Milwaukee, Wisconsin area. In 1993, the company began moving much of its manufacturing to China, and later also moved some manufacturing to Mexico. Most of the jobs at its Milwaukee plant were eliminated, although the company continued to perform some of its manufacturing at the plant using heavily automated manufacturing processes. In January 2011, it was announced that about 36 jobs were being returned from China to the Milwaukee plant, which would increase the number of positions at the plant to 379.Ahmed, Beenish, Some Jobs Finally Return at Master Lock, United Auto Workers, Jan. 24, 2011. Most of the added jobs were for making combination locks, subassemblies and keys. It was reported that the company would also continue to contract with three Chinese factories and about twenty Chinese suppliers, and operate its maquiladora near the Arizona border, where Mexican workers perform non-automated labor-intensive work such as assembling made-in-Milwaukee components.Schmid, John, Master Lock reassessing China: Milwaukee-based company finds it can compete better from U.S. soil, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Jan. 1, 2011.Ahmed, Beenish, Local 469 workers have right combination for more jobs at Master Lock: \\"Re-sourced\\" work from China returns to Milwaukee plant, United Auto Workers Solidarity, Mar./Apr. 2011.

In 1959 it purchased a house in Ponsonby, central Auckland, and converted it into the first Islamic Centre in the country. In 1960 the NZMA invited Maulana Said Musa Patel from the Gujarat to become New Zealand's first Imam. In 1967 this house was sold and another bought; in 1972 this too was sold and another acquired at 17 Vermont Street, Ponsonby. In 1979 the house on this site was removed and construction work began to build New Zealand's first real mosque. Also in 1979 the NZMA was a founding constituent member of the Federation of Islamic Associations of New Zealand (FIANZ), the national Muslim organisation. Former presidents of the NZMA include Kosovo-born Mazhar Krasniqi (1975 and 1987‚Äì88) and Nazmi Mehmeti from the Republic of Macedonia (1963).

In general there are two types: civil marriage and religious marriage, and typically marriages employ a combination of both (religious marriages must often be licensed and recognized by the state, and conversely civil marriages, while not sanctioned under religious law, are nevertheless respected). Marriages between people of differing religions are called interfaith marriages, while marital conversion, a more controversial concept than interfaith marriage, refers to the religious conversion of one partner to the other's religion for sake of satisfying a religious requirement. Americas and Europe In the Americas and Europe, in the 21st century, legally recognized marriages are formally presumed to be monogamous (although some pockets of society accept polygamy socially, if not legally, and some couples choose to enter into open marriages). In these countries, divorce is relatively simple and socially accepted. In the West, the prevailing view toward marriage today is that it is based on a legal covenant recognizing emotional attachment between the partners and entered into voluntarily. In the West, marriage has evolved from a life-time covenant that can only be broken by fault or death to a contract that can be broken by either party at will. Other shifts in Western marriage since World War I include: * There emerged a preference for maternal custody of children after divorce, as custody was more often settled based on the best interests of the child, rather than strictly awarding custody to the parent of greater financial means. * Both spouses have a formal duty of spousal support in the event of divorce (no longer just the husband) * Out of wedlock children have the same rights of support as legitimate children * In most countries, rape within marriage is illegal and can be punished * Spouses may no longer physically abuse their partners and women retain their legal rights upon marriage. * In some jurisdictions, property acquired since marriage is not owned by the title-holder. This property is considered marital and to be divided among the spouses by community property law or equitable distribution via the courts. * Marriages are more likely to be a product of mutual love, rather than economic necessity or a formal arrangement among families. * Remaining single by choice is increasingly viewed as socially acceptable and there is less pressure on young couples to marry. Marriage is no longer obligatory. * Interracial marriage is no longer forbidden. Asia and Africa Nubian wedding with some international modern touches, near Aswan, Egypt Key facts concerning the marriage law in Africa and Asia: * Marital rape is legal in most parts Africa and Asia alike. * Child marriage is legal in most parts of Africa and very few parts of Asia alike. * Arranged marriage is prevalent in many parts of Africa and Asia alike, especially in rural regions. * Same- sex marriage is illegal in most parts of Africa and Asia alike. * Polygamy is legal in many parts of Africa and Asia, but tends to be illegal in most Communist countries and legal in most Muslim countries * Divorce is legal in all parts in Africa and Asia (except in the Philippines), but wives seeking divorce have fewer legal rights than husbands in Muslim countries than in Communist countries. * Dowries are a traditional aspect of marriage customs in most rural regions of Africa and Asia alike. Some societies permit polygamy, in which a man could have multiple wives; even in such societies however, most men have only one. In such societies, having multiple wives is generally considered a sign of wealth and power. The status of multiple wives has varied from one society to another. In Imperial China, formal marriage was sanctioned only between a man and a woman, although among the upper classes, the primary wife was an arranged marriage with an elaborate formal ceremony while concubines could be taken on later with minimal ceremony. After the rise of Communism, only strictly monogamous marital relationships are permitted, although divorce is a relatively simple process. Monogamy, polyandry, and polygyny Polyandry (a woman having multiple husbands) occurs very rarely in a few isolated tribal societies. These societies include some bands of the Canadian Inuit, although the practice has declined sharply in the 20th century due to their conversion from tribal religion to Christianity by Moravian missionaries. Additionally, the Spartans were notable for practicing polyandry.\\"Pomeroy, Sarah B.: Spartan Women, page 46. Oxford University Press\\"; Societies which permit group marriage are extremely rare, but have existed in Utopian societies such as the Oneida Community. Today, many married people practice various forms of consensual nonmonogamy, including polyamory and Swinging. These people have agreements with their spouses that permit other intimate relationships or sexual partners. Therefore, the concept of marriage need not necessarily hinge on sexual or emotional monogamy. =Christian acceptance of monogamy= In the Christian society, a \\"one man one woman\\" model for the Christian marriage was advocated by Saint Augustine (354-439 AD) with his published letter The Good of Marriage. To discourage polygamy, he wrote it \\"was lawful among the ancient fathers: whether it be lawful now also, I would not hastily pronounce. For there is not now necessity of begetting children, as there then was, when, even when wives bear children, it was allowed, in order to a more numerous posterity, to marry other wives in addition, which now is certainly not lawful.\\" (chapter 15, paragraph 17) Sermons from St. Augustine's letters were popular and influential. In 534 AD Roman Emperor Justinian criminalized all but monogamous man/woman sex within the confines of marriage. The Codex Justinianus was the basis of European law for 1,000 years. Several exceptions have existed for various Biblical figures, incestuous relationships such as Abraham and Sarah,\\"BibleGateway, Genesis 20,20:11-12\\"; Nachor and Melcha, Lot and his Daughters, Amram and Jochabed and more. Christianity for the past several years has continued to insist on monogamy as an essential of marriage. =Contemporary Western societies= In 21st century Western societies, bigamy is illegal and sexual relations outside marriage are generally frowned-upon, though there is a minority view accepting (or even advocating) open marriage. However, divorce and remarriage are relatively easy to undertake in these societies. This has led to a practice called serial monogamy, which involves entering into successive marriages over time. Serial monogamy is also sometimes used to refer to cases where the couples cohabitate without getting married. Unique practices Some parts of India follow a custom in which the groom is required to marry with an auspicious plant called Tulsi before a second marriage to overcome inauspicious predictions about the health of the husband. This also applies if the prospective wife is considered to be 'bad luck' or a 'bad omen' astrologically. However, the relationship is not consummated and does not affect their ability to remarry later. In the state of Kerala, India, the Nambudiri Brahmin caste traditionally practiced henogamy, in which only the eldest son in each family was permitted to marry. The younger children could have sambandha (temporary relationship) with Kshatriya or Nair women. This is no longer practiced, and in general the Nambudiri Brahmin men marry only from the Nambudiri caste and Nair women prefer to be married to Nair men. Tibetan fraternal polyandry (see Polyandry in Tibet) follows a similar pattern, in which multiple sons in a family all marry the same wife, so the family property is preserved; leftover daughters either become celibate Buddhist nuns or independent households. It was formerly practiced in Tibet and nearby Himalayan areas, and while it was discouraged by the Chinese after their conquest of the region, it is becoming more common again. In Mormonism, a couple may seal their marriage \\"for time and for all eternity\\" through a \\"sealing\\" ceremony conducted within LDS Temples. The couple is then believed to be bound to each other in marriage throughout eternity if they live according to their covenants made in the ceremony. Mormonism also allows living persons to act as proxies in the sealing ceremony to \\"seal\\" a marriage between ancestors who have been dead for at least one year and who were married during their lifetime. According to LDS theology, it is then up to the deceased individuals to accept or reject this sealing in the spirit world before their eventual resurrection. A living person can also be sealed to his or her deceased spouse, with another person (of the same sex as the deceased) acting as proxy for that deceased individual. One society that traditionally did without marriage entirely was that of the Na of Yunnan province in southern China. According to anthropologist Cia Hua, sexual liaisons among the Na took place in the form of \\"visits\\" initiated by either men or women, each of whom might have two or three partners each at any given time (and as many as two hundred throughout a lifetime). The nonexistence of fathers in the Na family unit was consistent with their practice of matrilineality and matrilocality, in which siblings and their offspring lived with their maternal relatives. In recent years, the Chinese state has encouraged the Na to acculturate to the monogamous marriage norms of greater China. Such programs have included land grants to monogamous Na families, conscription (in the 1970s, couples were rounded up in villages ten or twenty at a time and issued marriage licenses), legislation declaring frequent sexual partners married and outlawing \\"visits\\", and the withholding of food rations from children who could not identify their fathers. Many of these measures were relaxed in favor of educational approaches after Deng Xiaoping came into power in 1981. See also the Mosuo ethnic minority of China and their practice of walking marriage.

Founded by Dave Gold in 1982, there are stores are located in California, Arizona, Nevada, and Texas. The company also operates Bargain Wholesale, which sells wholesale to retailers across the United States and exports to more than 15 countries from showrooms in Los Angeles.

History 99 Cents Only Store, North Hollywood, California =Early History= 99 Cents Only Stores dates back to the 1960s when the company‚Äôs founder, Dave Gold, inherited a tiny liquor store in downtown Los Angeles and decided to run a test by selling bottles of wine at a fixed price-point of 99 cents. The test was instant success, and Dave thought that selling everything in the store for 99 cents would be hugely popular. \\"Whenever I'd put wine or cheese on sale for $1.02 or 98 cents, it never sold out,\\" Gold said in a 2001 interview with The Los Angeles Times. \\"When I put a 99 cent sign on anything, it was gone in no time. I realized it was a magic number.\\" On a ‚Äúlucky‚Äù Friday, August 13, 1982, Dave and Sherry Gold opened the first 99 Cents Only Store in Los Angeles. To celebrate the Grand Opening, Dave decided to sell television sets for only 99 cents to the store‚Äôs first 13 Families. More than 300 people showed up to stand in line and wait for the store to open. The huge line caught the media‚Äôs attention, and more than 10 TV outlets covered the store‚Äôs first day.

They were used mainly in the Northeast and Midwest. The widespread use of the tokens was a result of the scarcity of government-issued cents during the Civil War. Civil War tokens became illegal after the United States Congress passed a law on April 22, 1864 prohibiting the issue of any one or two-cent coins, tokens or devices for use as currency. On June 8, 1864 an additional law was passed that forbade all private coinage.Yeoman, R.S., A Guide Book of United States Coins (2004 edition), Whitman Publishing, 2003. Civil War tokens are divided into three types‚Äîstore cards, patriotic tokens, and sutler tokens. All three types were utilized as currency, and are differentiated by their designs. The collectible value of the tokens is determined chiefly by their rarity.  History  By 1862, the second year of the Civil War, government-issued coinage began vanishing from circulation. American citizens hoarded all coins with gold and silver, and eventually began hoarding copper-nickel cents as well. This made it extremely difficult for businesses to conduct transactions. In response, many merchants turned to private minters to fill the void left by the hoarded coins. The first of these privately minted tokens appeared in the autumn of 1862, by H. A. Ratterman, in Cincinnati, Ohio. New York issues followed in the spring of 1863, first with Lindenmueller currency store card tokens issued by New York City barkeep Gustavus Lindenmueller and then with Knickerbocker currency patriotic tokens issued by William H. Bridgens. It is estimated that by 1864, there were 25,000,000 Civil War tokens (nearly all redeemable for one cent) in circulation, consisting of approximately 7,000‚Äì8,000 varieties.George and Melvin Fuld, U.S. Civil War Store Cards, Quarterman Publishing, Inc., 1975. Lindenmueller token Lindenmueller currency, or \\"Lindenmueller tokens,\\" are one of the best-known and commonly struck types were store cards. Lindenmueller had more than one million of his one-cent tokens struck and placed into circulation in 1863. One of the common uses for the token was for streetcar fare. The Third Avenue Railroad company of New York, which had willingly accepted a large quantity of the Lindenmueller tokens in lieu of actual currency, asked Lindenmueller to redeem them. He refused, and the railroad had no legal recourse. Incidents such as these eventually forced the government to intervene.Tebben, Gerald. \\"An overview of Civil War Tokens\\" , Columbus, O., Civil War Tokens. Retrieved June 26, 2006. On April 22, 1864, Congress enacted the Coinage Act of 1864. While the act is most remembered for the introduction of the phrase \\"In God We Trust\\" on the newly created two-cent piece, it also effectively ended the usage of Civil War tokens. In addition to authorizing the minting of the two- cent piece, the act changed the composition of the one-cent piece from a copper-nickel alloy (weighing 4.67 grams) to a lighter, less thick piece composed of 95% copper (weighing 3.11 grams).\\"Indian Head Cents\\". CoinFacts.com.

Retrieved on June 23, 2006. While the Coinage Act made Civil War tokens impractical, the issue of their legality was decided on June 8, 1864, when Congress enacted , which made the minting and usage of non-government issued coins punishable by a fine of up to $2,000, a prison term of up to five years, or both. (Chapter 25 of Title 18 deals specifically with counterfeit and forgery). It did not make it illegal to own Civil War tokens. Evidence exists that the tokens were viewed as collectibles as early as 1863, when the first known listings of Civil War tokens were published.  Types  = Patriotic tokens = An example of a patriotic token Patriotic Civil War tokens typically displayed a patriotic slogan or image on one or both sides. Since the majority of these tokens were minted in Union states, the slogans and images were decidedly pro-Union. Some common examples of slogans found on patriotic tokens are \\"The Union Must and Shall Be Preserved,\\" \\"Union For Ever,\\" and \\"Old Glory\\". Some of the images found on patriotic tokens were the flag of the United States, a 19th-century cannon, and the USS Monitor.Farr, Arthur W. March 1999. \\"More on the . Retrieved July 1, 2006 Among the best- known varieties of patriotic tokens are the so-called \\"Dix tokens.\\" They are named for John Adams Dix, who served as Secretary of the Treasury in 1861. In a letter from Dix to a revenue cutter captain, Lieutenant Caldwell, he orders Caldwell to relieve another cutter captain of his command for refusing an order to transfer from New Orleans to New York City. The letter ends with the following sentence: \\"If any one attempts to haul down the American flag, shoot him on the spot.\\" The quote found its way to a number of patriotic tokens, albeit with a slightly modified wording (\\"haul down\\" is usually replaced by \\"tear it down\\"). = Store cards = An example of a civil war store card Civil War store cards differ from patriotic tokens in that one or both sides displays the name and/or location of a privately owned business. Businesses that could afford it had two custom dies made, with both advertising the business. Otherwise, only one side displayed the business's information.Civil War Patriotic Tokens. civilwartokens.com. Retrieved June 22, 2006. = Sutler tokens = Sutler tokens are similar to store cards. Rather than listing the name of a private business, however, these tokens bore the name of a particular army unit (usually a regiment) and the name of the sutler who conducted transactions with the regiment. Of the three types of Civil War tokens, sutler tokens are by far the rarest.  Collectible value  There are several factors that determine the collectible value of Civil War tokens. The main factor is rarity, which is measured on a scale from 1 to 10 (1 being the most common type). The scale was developed by noted numismatic dealer and writer George Fuld. The material used to mint Civil War tokens can also affect collectibility. Civil war tokens were minted using a variety of materials, copper being a common choice (often actually bronze). Other materials used for minting were nickel, tin, German silver, white metal, and silver. Examples of tokens minted using rubber are also known to exist.Civil War Tokens. civilwartokens.com.

It was a small teal of the Anas gibberifrons superspecies of the Anas subgenus Nettion. Its closest relative is probably Bernier's teal from Madagascar and, apart from having stronger wings and being considerably bigger (between a Sunda teal and a mallard in size), it seems to have looked very similar to that species. Earlier, it was proposed that Meller's duck, also from Madagascar, is the closest living relative of A. theodori, but as more remains of the latter were unearthed this appears far less likely. Apart from a few, brief descriptions, not much is known about the bird in life, but its habits probably did not differ significantly from those of its close relatives. Bones have been found in the Mare aux Songes swamp on Mauritius and more recently on R√©union also. The scientific name honours Th√©ÃÅodore Sauzier, who made many bones of extinct birds found on Mauritius available to science. Extinction The bird became extinct on both islands almost simultaneously and for the same reason: overhunting. On Mauritus, the \\"grey teals\\" were found in \\"great numbers\\" in 1681, but in 1693, Leguat (1708) found \\"wild ducks\\" to be already rare. In 1696, governor Deodati mentioned the species for the last time to be extant. On R√©union, the species is last mentioned to occur \\"in quantity\\" in de la Merveille's 1709 listing of the island's wildlife, but as Jean Feuilley had not listed waterfowl in his 1705 report, de la Merveille's record is obviously based on obsolete hearsay information. The last reliable R√©union record of the species appears to be the report of P√®re Bernardin in 1687; thus, the date of extinction can be assumed to be the late 1690s on Mauritius, and a few years earlier on R√©union. The reports of Bernardin and (1710) Boucher are puzzling insofar as that they mention both geese, sarcelles (teals, this species) as well as canards (ducks, larger than sarcelles) as occurring or having occurred on R√©union. It is possible that a carpometacarpus bone apparently of an Aythya diving duck is referrable to these canards. If so, these birds were probably related to the Madagascar pochard, of which only small numbers are known to remain.

After the game was open-sourced in 2008, an iOS version followed in 2009.  Plot   Gameplay  Space Trader is a combination first person action and trading game with co-operative multiplayer, tied together with online scoreboards. Players assume the role of Traders in a fictitious future universe. Their goal: to make as much money possible within a time limit. They accomplish this by leasing cargo ships, traveling to planets and trading with Merchants. Each Merchant trades different commodities, and each at different prices. Finding successful trade routes between these merchants is one of the strategic elements of the game. Players can also be stopped along the way by an omni-present government organization known as the Ministry of Accounts, and forced to pay taxes. As well, shady informants reveal the location of black market merchants and the location of criminal bosses, which the players can attempt to bring down for the bounty placed on their head by the Ministry of Accounts. In multiplayer, players work together in combat and attempt to thwart each other in trading by taking as many bonuses as they can from other players. All scores from games are uploaded to the Space Trader website, and players are ranked against one another. The Space Trader website features community scoreboards and forums, along with information about the game.  History  Space Trader was developed on base of the open-source id Tech 3 engine, as the first commercial title to use that engine since it was open sourced in August 2005. The game's development started in 2005, headed by Cameron Tofer and Marcia Tofer, both previously of BioWare, along with a group of other developers that have joined along the way. The game was released for Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X on July 25, 2007. Currently Space Trader is at version 1.0.4, with a beta version of 1.0.6 available. A free demo is also available on the website.

It describes him as the Earl of Huntington, which is a fairly late development in the ballads. It definitively places him in Richard the Lionhearted's reign. This ballad was written by the prominent 17th century broadside balladist Martin Parker, and published in 1632. By Parker's own account from it was based reliable historical sources, but more probably from the abundant literary and ballad sources then available.Stephen Knight, Thomas H. Ohlgren, \\"A True Tale of Robin Hood: Introduction\\", Robin Hood and Other Outlaw Tales (1997) This account includes the unusual details that Robin Hood was given to castrating monks and that he operated in Lancashire as well as Yorkshire. Unlike many of the 17th century broadsides it stresses the tradition that Robin Hood actively aided the poor. In the ballad's narrative, Robin Hood lives well as the Earl of Huntington, but is brought to penury by his spending and the enmity of the abbot of St. Mary's. He is outlawed, and his band lives by robbing, particularly the rich clergy, but they aid the poor. He catches the abbot, who then went to the king. The king offers a reward, but his men are either out-fought, or won over by Robin's courtesy. King Richard goes to Nottingham. Robin begs a pardon by letter, and the king is agreeable. Before he gets it, however, Robin takes a fever. He trusts a friar to bleed him (a common medical practice of the day), and the friar bleeds him to death. King Richard thinks the friar treacherous, and Robin foolish to have trusted him.

Shamsuzzoha was the first university teacher in erstwhile East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) who was killed by the Pakistani Military forces at the eve of 1969 revolution movement of East Pakistan, which ultimately became the Bangladesh Liberation War. In 2008, he was awarded the Independence Day Award. Early life He was born in the district of Bankura in West Bengal, India. After the India partition, he migrated to erstwhile East Pakistan in 1950. He passed his matriculation exam in 1948 from Bankura Zilla School and passed ISc in 1950 from Bankura Christian College. He achieved BSc (honours) degree in Chemistry in 1953 and MSc in 1954 from Dhaka University. Mohammad Shamsuzzoha also participated bravely in the Bengali Language Movement during his university life. In 1964 he obtained his PhD degree from Imperial College London.After the partition of India he migrated to the East Bengal. , Career At first Mohammad Shamsuzzoha joined Rajshahi University as a Development Officer in 1961 and on that year he also became lecturer in the Department of Chemistry. He was promoted as Reader of the Chemistry Department. On 1 May 1968 he received the Proctor post of the university. He was the first university teacher who was martyred from 1947 to 1969. Death Memorial Sculpture of Martyr Shamsuzzoha Following the murder of Sergeant Zahurul haq in custody, one of the accused convict of Agartala Conspiracy Case on 15 February, the students of Rajshahi University started staging demonstration. On 17 February the students were injured by the Pakistani police. On the same day local administration imposed section 144 on Natore-Rajshahi Highway near to Rajshahi University. When the students violated the section, the Pakistani army was deployed to shoot the students, but Shamsuzzoha talked with them and urged them not to fire. When the tension grew, the army fired on Shamsuzzoha. He was taken to the hospital and died there. A memorial sculpture was built right beside the Shahid Shamsuzzoha Hall,called \\"Sfulinga\\" for Dr. Shamsuzzoha Sir as a symbol of respect. Legacy Mohammad Shamsuzzoha was buried on front of the administration building of Rajshahi University. His death added a new dimension in the anti- Ayub mass movement, as well as the fall of Ayub government was quickened. 18 February is observed as Shahid Zoha Dibos (Martyr Zoha Day) in Bangladesh.

It is painless, and it is caused by a response of the palatal oral mucosa to chronic heat. A more pronounced appearance can occur with reverse smoking, sometimes distinguished from stomatitis nicotina by the term reverse smoker's keratosis. While stomatitis nicotina that is caused by heat is not a premaligant condition (i.e. it does not carry an increased risk of transformation to oral cancer), the condition that is caused by reverse smoking is premalignant. Signs and symptoms The palate may appear gray or white and contain many papules or nodules that are slightly elevated with red dots in their center. These red dots represent the ducts of minor salivary glands which have become inflamed by heat. The condition is painless. If a denture is normally worn while smoking, then the mucosa underneath the denture appears unaffected by the condition. In severe cases, the mucosa may show fissuring and develop a \\"dried lake bed\\" appearance. Other changes associated with tobacco use may be evident such as brown or black extrinsic staining of teeth from tar and other components of tobacco smoke. Causes The cause of nicotine stomatitis is thought to be chemical or thermally induced keratosis. The chemicals in tobacco may act as irritants in this condition. Chronic heat exposure is also responsible. Pipe smoking produces more heat on the palate than any other forms of smoking. Long-term drinking of very hot beverages can also cause a similar condition. The severity of the changes correlates with the frequency of the habit. The prevalence depends on a society's use of consuming hot beverages and of smoking in its various forms. A similar, but more pronounced palatal keratosis occurs with reverse smoking. This is where the lit end of the cigar or cigarette is held in the mouth, another form of smoking associated with high levels of heat in the mouth. This form of the condition is sometimes termed \\"reverse smoker's keratosis\\", and is a premalignant lesion. That is, the condition is associated with an increased risk of malignant transformation to oral squamous cell carcinoma (a type of oral cancer). Some sources do not distinguish between reverse smoker's keratosis and smoker's palate that is caused by heat. As such, these sources tend to state that stomatitis nicotina is a premalignant condition. Some reports show that there is an increased risk of tonsillar cancer, lung cancer and tumors of the posterior oral cavity in people who develop stomatitis nicotina. Diagnosis The diagnosis is normally made based upon the clinical appearance and history. Tissue biopsy is not usually indicated unless there are areas of ulceration or localized erythroplakia (red patches). The differential diagnosis is with other causes of white lesions (see leukoplakia for a more complete discussion). Specific conditions which can produce a similar appearance include Darier's disease, discoid lupus erythematosus, oral candidiasis, and oral lichen planus. If a biopsy is taken, the histopathologic appearance is one of hyperkeratosis and acanthosis. There may be squamous metaplasia of excretory ducts, which results in the visible papules if the ducts become hyperplastic. Neutrophils may fill some ducts. It is characterized as a \\"fissured\\" or \\"dried mud\\" appearance from excess keratin production by cells. Dysplasia is rarely seen. Treatment When the appearance is caused by heat, the lesion is usually completely reversible within a few weeks if the smoking habit is stopped. This is the case even if the condition has been present for decades. Without stopping smoking, spontaneous remission of the lesion is unlikely. If the lesion persists despite stopping smoking, this is usually then considered to be a true leukoplakia rather than a reactionary keratotis, and may trigger the decision to carry out a biopsy to confirm the diagnosis. Since this condition almost always develops in the setting of long term heavy smoking, it usually indicates the need for regular observation for cancers associated with smoking, e.g. lung cancer. Epidemiology The condition is uncommon. It occurs usually in elderly males who have a history of heavy pipe smoking, but it also can occur in cigar or cigarette smokers. The condition was once common, but has become more rare as habits such as pipe and cigar smoking have decreased in popularity.

NY 9P southbound at Saratoga Race Course in Saratoga Springs North of the hamlet of Maple Shade, NY 9P intersects with the western terminus of CR 71 (Cedars Bluff Road). Along the lakeside, NY 9P bends westward, soon bending away from the lake at Point Breeze, where the road crosses over the northern end of the lake on the Saratoga County Veterans Memorial Bridge, which was reconstructed in 2011. From this point to Circular Street, NY 9P is named Union Avenue. Past the lake, NY 9P enters the city of Saratoga Springs, where it intersects the terminus of CR 22 (Crescent Avenue) and CR 66 (Dyer Switch Road). NY 9P turns to the northwest, passing the Saratoga National Golf Club before the terminus of CR 65 (Meadowbrook Road). Turning westward, NY 9P enters interchange 14 with the Adirondack Northway (I-87) and passing Yaddo Gardens. After the gardens, the route passes the Saratoga Race Course and enters a section of downtown Saratoga Springs designated as the Union Avenue Historic District. Within the historic district, NY 9P serves a number of stately Victorian homes built in the second half of the 19th and early 20th centuries, as well as buildings owned by Empire State College, some of which were once Skidmore College Buildings. Union Avenue terminates at Circular Street, which abuts the eastern border of Congress Park. From here, NY 9P continues north on Circular Street before turning west on Spring Street a short distance after. The route continues along the north side of Congress Park for three blocks before ending at an intersection with US 9 and NY 50 (Broadway). History An alternate route of U.S. Route 9 between Malta and Saratoga Springs by way of the eastern shore of Saratoga Lake was originally assigned NY 9X . In December 1934, an alternate route of US 9 in New York City was designated as U.S. Route 9X. The alphanumerical duplication between the two routes was eliminated in April 1935 when NY 9X was redesignated as NY 9P. Major intersections NY 9P Truck New York State Route 9P Truck is a truck route bypassing NY 9P in Downtown Saratoga Springs. The route begins at NY 9P's interchange with the Adirondack Northway (I-87) at exit 14, continuing north to exit 15 and then west along NY 50, which is also cosigned as NY 29 Truck. The truck route terminates at an intersection with US 9, which continues westward with NY 50 and NY 29 Truck towards Downtown Saratoga. The route was created sometime around 2015. ;Major intersections See also * * References External links 009P Category:U.S. Route 9 Category:Transportation in Saratoga County, New York ","title":"New York State Route 9P"},{"id":"5674034","text":"Darell Lee Garretson (March 18, 1932 ‚Äì April 21, 2008) was an American professional basketball referee in the National Basketball Association (NBA) for 27 years from 1967 to 1994 wearing uniform number 10, and he later served as NBA Supervisor of Officials for 17 years from 1981 to 1998. During his career, Garretson officiated over 2,000 games, including 1,798 regular-season NBA games, 269 playoff games, 39 Finals games and five All-Star games. On April 4, 2016, Garretson was elected into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame as an official. Personal =Early life= Born in Long Point, Illinois, Garretson attended Illinois State Normal University (now Illinois State University) during the 1950s and later served in the U.S. Navy, stationed in San Diego, California. Discharging from the Navy in 1960, Garretson remained in California along with his wife, Jeanne. Becoming involved with sports, he served as manager of the Garden Grove, California team in the Little League World Series in 1968. He also officiated recreational, high school, and college basketball games, while working as a salesman, before being hired by the NBA. =Family= Darell Garretson and Jeanne Garretson have two sons, Ron, and Rick. Ron Garretson became a basketball official, and is currently a referee in the NBA. =Death= Darell Garretson died in his sleep on April 24, 2008 at his home in Mesa, Arizona at age 76. The cause of death is an unknown at this time, but it was reported that Garretson's health had been in decline following recent surgery and effects of illnesses. Following the news of his death, NBA commissioner David Stern said in a statement, \\"We are saddened by the passing of Darell Garretson. Darell was a man of extraordinary character, who touched many lives during his 31-year tenure as an NBA official and supervisor of officials.\\" Lamell McMorris, spokesman for the National Basketball Referees Association (NBRA), the union representing NBA officials, said, \\"Our grief at losing Darell Garretson is not just about the loss of an icon, a refereeing legend, although he certainly is both of those things. It is much more personal. Darell discovered and developed so many of our current referees. ... He took them and he coached them, tirelessly, and he made them some of the most elite referees in the world. And they love him for it.\\" Income tax fraud In 2000, Garretson pleaded guilty to fraud in an airline-ticket scheme involving purchasing less expensive tickets and pocketing the difference without reporting the additional income to the Internal Revenue Service. He was sentenced to 180 days' home detention, three years of probation, and a US$5,000 fine. Legacy As a referee, Garretson was credited for creating and heading the first union for NBA referees, known as the National Association of Basketball Referees, a predecessor to the present day NBRA. Later when he became officiating supervisor, Garretson was an advocate for increasing the number of officials per NBA game from two to three, beginning with the 1988‚Äì89 NBA season, rejecting arguments against the three-official system made by fellow veteran Earl Strom. The addition of the third official allowed for better coverage of the court and also provided mentoring for younger officials with two more experienced officials. Working in the NBA's front office, he also was involved with scouting prospective officials and providing instruction. He developed the concept of \\"refereeing the defense\\", a practice in which officials focus attention on a defensive player instead of watching the ball. He urged all officials to continue improving skills and achieving personal goals by focusing on every possible aspect. Former referee and current director of officiating, Ronnie Nunn said of Garretson, \\"[he] was a guy who drilled into you to get plays right.\\" As an official and supervisor in the NBA, Garretson was the target of criticism by the media and notable officials including, Jake O'Donnell, Richie Powers, and Earl Strom. Critics of Garretson claimed that he developed the current generation of referees into \\"robots\\" by suppressing individual personality. On the court, Garretson was also known to minimize the amount of communication between himself and players and coaches, which was considered an unpopular approach among members of the media.

The conversations between Bill and his sound technician Mike Shoup and drummer Ed McTaggart became the idea behind the song. The band's name \\"The Road Home\\" proved prophetic for Bill when he died soon so young. After Sprouse's untimely death at age 26, Shoup dug up an old 4 track tape of the song and asked Dom Franco of the Maranatha! group Bethlehem to add pedal steel guitar to it.

Ries is noted for applying classical sculptural reduction to cold optical crystal rather than using traditional hot techniques such as blowing or molding. He refined his skills during the height of American studio glass movement under the mentorship of its principal founder, Harvey Littleton. Ries's work includes the largest non-assembled glass forms in existence, and is collected in museums worldwide. Biography =Early life= alt=Christopher Ries with father Raymon RiesChristopher Ries was born to florists Raymond and Mildred Ries and was raised in a log cabin on a farm near Columbus, Ohio. As a young adult he expressed an interest in art and ceramics. Throughout high school he produced pottery in a makeshift studio in his parents‚Äô root cellar. In 1971 he matriculated to The Ohio State University to pursue a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in ceramics. He soon became more interested in the glass used to glaze pottery than the pottery itself. In order to explore glass as a medium for artistic expression, he built what became The Ohio State University's first glass studio and served as its first instructor. Ries spent the next several years blowing glass and investigating glass types, chemical compositions, and properties. During his senior year at The Ohio State University, Ries attended a guest lecture given by Harvey Littleton. Littleton was struck by Ries's accomplishments as both a glass artist and teacher, and asked Ries to become his research assistant at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison. Ries accepted the offer and enrolled at the institute the following autumn. Ries spent the next two years under the mentorship of Littleton. Ries's interest in glass's optical properties grew, and began carving cold glass instead of blowing hot glass. Tools to sculpt large blocks of glass weren't available at the time, so Ries independently developed much of the equipment he needed during his spare time. He graduated the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison in 1978 with a master's degree in fine arts and returned to Columbus. He lives with four of his children, Banks, Chase, Catherine and Caroline. =Career= After graduating the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison, Ries spent several years searching for the ideal glass to be used in sculpture. Ries's search ended when he discovered the lead crystal manufactured by Schott Optical (now Schott North America). For the next two years he regularly travelled to Duryea, Pennsylvania, to purchase pieces of cullet from Schott. He would then sculpt, carve, and polish these pieces in his studio in Columbus. As Ries's technique developed, Dr. Franz Herkt, president of Schott Optical, invited Ries to work with the company as an independent contractor with the title Artist in Residence. Ries accepted the distinction and in 1986 signed an agreement which allowed him to work within the Duryea facility. He created a body of work which Schott and Ries co-produced and co-owned. Ries also established a private studio in Tunkhannock, Pennsylvania, which he has used to explore concepts in glass and occasionally other media including wood and paint. Most of the masterworks Ries produced at the Schott facility were modeled after forms created at his private studio. Ries's relationship with Schott continued until a fire destroyed his on-site studio on 3 March 2015. Production of large Ries studio work has ceased and is not expected to resume. His private studio in Tunkhannock, Pennsylvania is still operational.  Artwork  Ries's sculptures are noted for their changing internal optical compositions and technical proficiency. Ries's primary medium is clear lead crystal, a glass with an unusually high refractive index, extreme light transmission in the visual range, and outstanding homogeneity. These qualities enable Ries to create the optical effects found within his work. alt=Ries with raw block of optical crystalRies begins with large blocks of optical glass and reduces them to the desired form by cutting, carving, grinding, and polishing them. His larger sculptures are taken from source material that can weigh over 4,000 pounds, and the process of reducing and polishing can take as much as a year. Ries's Opus was at the time of its creation the world's largest monolithic glass sculpture. It weighs nearly 1,500 pounds (680 kilograms) and was sculpted from a 3,000 pound (1361 kilogram) block of glass. One of Ries's most famous works, the 1,100 pound (499 kilogram) Sunflower IV, took four months to anneal and required a further 1,800 estimated hours to carve. Contemporary critics have noted Ries's unique ability to exploit glass's optical properties for artistic expression. James Yood, professor of contemporary art theory and criticism at Northwestern University, called Ries's work ‚Äúan art of such suggestiveness and finesse, of ceaseless transition and surprise that it constitutes one of the most intriguing exercises in the poetics of optics anywhere in contemporary art.‚Äù Ries himself characterizes his work as a ‚Äúvessel for light,‚Äù noting that ‚Äúall that we know about the universe, the composition of the stars, and the distances within the universe is studied through light...It is the one medium that gathers, focuses, amplifies, transmits, filters, diffuses and reflects it. It is the quintessential medium for light. I see it all on a symbolic level.‚Äù Ries's works have won numerous awards and are exhibited in major collections and museums throughout the United States, Europe, and Japan, including the Corning Museum of Glass, the Cincinnati Art Museum, the National Heisey Glass Museum, the National Liberty Museum, the Cleveland Museum of Art, and the Tampa Museum of Art.

The title refers to the metaphorical death of peaceful citizen and family man Matt Helm and the rebirth of the deadly and relentless assassin of World War II. The book sees Matthew Helm, a one-time assassin and special agent for the American government during the war, being reactivated (code name: Eric) when a former colleague turns rogue and eventually kidnaps Helm's daughter. Afterwards, he agrees to return to duty as an assassin and counter- agent working for a secret agency run by \\"Mac,\\" his superior officer from 13 years earlier (although published in 1960, the story itself takes place in 1958). Death of a Citizen is notable for its grimness of tone and events as compared to the usual thriller of the late 1950s and early 1960s. After a few initial missteps as his \\"citizen\\" persona is shucked off, Helm re-becomes the competent, hard-boiled, and ruthless agent he had been earlier. The ending of the book is particularly shocking, perhaps, in that he shoots down an adversary who is not directly threatening him and then tortures and kills the person responsible for kidnapping his baby daughter. As a result of his actions, his daughter is rescued ‚Äî but as the book ends his peace-loving wife is staring in horror at the bloody-handed monster that her apparently sedentary husband has become. Hamilton would write a total of 27 Matt Helm novels between 1960 and 1993 (with a 28th volume as yet unpublished). The books maintain a loose continuity between each other, although later volumes would downplay Helm's Second World War connections in order to keep the character up-to-date. In the late 1960s, several motion pictures starring Dean Martin as Helm were produced; these films were produced as comedies and contained little of Hamilton's concepts. Death of a Citizen was adapted into the film The Silencers.

White, 548 U.S. 53 (2006), is a US labor law case of the United States Supreme Court on sexual harassment and retaliatory discrimination. It was a landmark case for retaliation claims. It set a precedent for claims which could be considered retaliatory under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. In this case the standard for retaliation against a sexual harassment complainant was revised to include any adverse employment decision or treatment that would be likely to dissuade a \\"reasonable worker\\" from making or supporting a charge of discrimination. Facts In June 1997, Sheila White was the only woman working in the Maintenance of Way department at BNSF‚Äôs Tennessee Yard. When she applied for the job at BNSF, her previous experience operating forklifts was noted by Marvin Brown, her interviewer at BNSF. White was hired as a \\"track laborer\\", a job that involves removing and replacing track components, transporting track material, cutting brush, and clearing litter and cargo spillage from the right-of-way. Soon after White arrived on the job, she was assigned to operate the forklift. While she also performed some of the other track laborer tasks, operating the forklift was White's primary responsibility. In September 1997, White complained to BNSF officials that her immediate supervisor, Bill Joiner, had repeatedly told her that women should not be working in the Maintenance of Way department. Joiner, White said, had also made insulting and inappropriate remarks to her in front of her male colleagues. After an internal investigation, Burlington suspended Joiner for 10 days and ordered him to attend a sexual-harassment training session. On September 26, Brown told White about Joiner's discipline. At the same time, he told White that he was removing her from forklift duty and assigning her to perform only standard track laborer tasks. Brown explained that the reassignment reflected co-worker's complaints that, in fairness, a \\"more senior man\\" should have the \\"less arduous and cleaner job\\" of forklift operator. On October 10, White filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). She claimed that the reassignment of her duties amounted to unlawful gender-based discrimination and retaliation for her having earlier complained about Joiner. In early December, White filed a second retaliation charge with the Commission, claiming that Brown had placed her under surveillance and was monitoring her daily activities. That charge was mailed to Brown on December 8. A few days later, White and her immediate supervisor, Percy Sharkey, disagreed about which truck should transport White from one location to another. Some aspects of this conversation are disputed, however later that day Sharkey told Brown that White had been insubordinate. Brown immediately suspended White without pay. White invoked internal grievance procedures. Those procedures led Burlington to conclude that White had not been insubordinate. Burlington reinstated White to her position and awarded her back pay for the 37 days she was suspended. White filed an additional retaliation charge with the EEOC based on the suspension. The anti- retaliation provision of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 forbids employer actions that \\"discriminate against\\" an employee (or job applicant) because he has \\"opposed\\" a practice that Title VII forbids or has \\"made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in\\" a Title VII \\"investigation, proceeding, or hearing\\". (a). Judgment =First Instance= After exhausting administrative remedies, White filed suit in federal court, where a jury rejected her claims of sex discrimination but awarded her damages of $43,000 after finding that she had been retaliated against in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/04a0102p-06.pdf =Sixth Circuit= On appeal, BNSF argued that White had not suffered \\"adverse employment action,\\" and therefore could not bring the suit, because she had not been fired, demoted, denied a promotion, or denied wages. In November 2002, a panel of the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals initially agreed, where Judge James S. Gwin was joined by Judge Robert B. Krupansky, over the dissent of Judge Eric L. Clay.White v. Burlington Northern & Santa Fe Ry. Co., 310 F. 3d 443 (2002) The case was reheard en banc, however, and, in April 2004, the full court found for White, holding that the suspension without pay - even if back pay was eventually awarded - was an \\"adverse employment action,\\" as was the change of responsibilities within the same job category.White v. Burlington N. & Santa Fe Ry. Co., 364 F.3d 789, 792 (6th Cir. 2004) (en banc). The judges differed as to the standard they should apply in assessing such claims.364 F. 3d, at 795‚Äì800, with id., at 809 (Clay, J., concurring) =Supreme Court= One hour of oral arguments were heard on April 17, 2006, where Gregory G. Garre, the Deputy Solicitor General of the United States, appeared as a friend for the railroad. On June 22, 2006, the Supreme Court delivered judgment unanimously in favor of Sheila White. It affirmed the decision of the Sixth Circuit, but for different reasons than those used by the lower court. Justice Stephen Breyer wrote for the majority.The Supreme Court, 2005 Term ‚Äî Leading Cases, 120 Harv. L. Rev. 312 (2006). Justice Alito concurred in the judgment, but disagreed with the majority's interpretation of the antiretaliation provision of Title VII, writing that \\"[t]he practical consequences of the test that the majority adopts strongly suggest that this test is not what Congress intended.\\" Significance In this case the standard for retaliation against a sexual harassment complainant was revised to include any adverse employment decision or treatment that would be likely to dissuade a \\"reasonable worker\\" from making or supporting a charge of discrimination.

It stars Wesley Snipes and Michael Wright as brothers Roemello and Raynathan Skuggs. Considered the second film of Cooper's \\"Harlem trilogy,\\" it focuses on the two brothers who are major drug dealers in the New York City neighborhood of Harlem, specifically the namesake Sugar Hill. Plot Through the course of the film, several flashbacks are shown involving the Skuggs brothers, including (in the beginning of the film) the drug-overdose death of their mother Ella (Khandi Alexander), the non-fatal shooting of their drug-addicted musician father, Arthur Romello \\"A.R.\\" Skuggs (Clarence Williams III) (ultimately at the hands of the man they would later work for‚ÄîGus Molino (Abe Vigoda), and a scene where Roemello is offered a full scholarship to Georgetown. Roemello as a teenager (Dul√© Hill) avenges his father's shooting by shooting and killing Sal Marconi (Raymond Serra), Gus's cousin. After contemplating for a while, Roemello decides to quit dealing and start a new life with his girlfriend, Melissa (Theresa Randle), to the disdain of Raynathan, who is scared and hesitant to leave the drug game. However, Roemello learns that getting out is nowhere near as easy as getting in. A series of events lead up to Roemello's eventual departure from the drug game, such as the death of his best friend, Ricky Goggles (Steve Harris) at the hands of an up-and-coming Brooklyn drug dealer and former boxing champion, Lolly Jonas (Ernie Hudson). The Skuggs brothers and their associates find Ricky's burned body hanging from the side of a neighborhood apartment building. They later go after and then kill Tony Adamo, one of the other men responsible for Ricky Goggles‚Äô death. Because of this, an eventual street war starts off between The Skuggs crew and Lolly's organization. Melissa becomes more hesitant of being involved with Roemello, because of his lifestyle. After learning of the death of an aspiring teenage ‚Äústick-up kid‚Äù, Kymie (Donald Faison) in Roemello's neighborhood (Kymie, in fact, saves Roemello's life in a drive-in shooting by Lolly's people), she decides to break off with Roemello and would have one date with basketball star, Mark Doby (Vondie Curtis Hall). The date starts off fine as Mark takes Melissa back to his house but he becomes drunk, physically and verbally abuses Melissa and nearly rapes her by forcing her to perform oral sex. She barely escapes by punching Mark in the groin and running out the door. As she returns home, she is shamed by her mother for being a ‚Äútramp‚Äù. She finally returns to Roemello and they begin to make plans to leave New York City. Before Roemello and Melissa depart for North Carolina, they stop by to visit A.R. However, upon arriving at A.R.‚Äôs apartment, they find him dead of a drug overdose. Raynathan gave A.R. the heroin that would eventually kill him, with Raynathan‚Äôs reasoning being that he wanted ‚Äúput him out of his misery‚Äù. Raynathan is found across the street, coming out of Gus‚Äô restaurant, where he gunned down Gus, Lolly, and Harry, Gus's son. Roemello tells Raynathan what happened to A.R., but Raynathan accepts responsibility of their father's death. After seeing Melissa waiting for Roemello, Raynathan fires his gun at her, and the brothers proceed to fight each other and Raynathan accidentally shoots Roemello. Realizing this, Raynathan panics and shoots himself in the stomach, taking his own life. Roemello and Melissa, sometime later, do move to North Carolina, where they have a young son, but Roemello is found in a wheelchair, likely paralyzed from the waist down (though the extent of the paralysis is not fully explained), however he is enjoying family life.

Unity and conflict The most influential figure within the Toyotomi was Toyotomi Hideyoshi, one of the three \\"unifiers of Japan\\". Oda Nobunaga was another primary unifier and the ruler of the Oda clan at the time. Hideyoshi joined Nobunaga at a young age, but was not highly regarded because of his peasant background. Nevertheless, Hideyoshi's increasing influence allowed him to seize a significant degree of power from the Oda clan following Oda Nobunaga's death in 1582. As the virtual ruler of most of Japan, Hideyoshi created a new clan name \\"Toyotomi\\" in 1584, and achieved the unification of Japan in 1589. When Hideyoshi died in 1598, his son Toyotomi Hideyori was only five years old. Five regents were appointed to rule until his maturity, and conflicts among them began quickly. In 1600, Tokugawa Ieyasu deposed Hideyori and took power after winning the Battle of Sekigahara. In 1614, Hideyori came into conflict with the Tokugawa clan, leading to Tokugawa Ieyasu's Siege of Osaka from 1614 to 1615. As a result of the siege, Hideyori and his mother, Yodo- dono, committed seppuku in the flames of Osaka castle. After their death, the Toyotomi clan dissolved, leaving the Tokugawa clan to solidify their rule of Japan and the last member of the Toyotomi clan was (1609‚Äì1645).

Overview In the earliest times, points were operated manually by levers. Gradually, these were centralised and came to be operated from a signal box, either by rods, or by double wire arrangements. Since the limitation of mechanical operation restricted the design of track layouts on the one hand, and tended to require more signal boxes, even lightly used ones, on the other hand, there has always been a desire of railway administrations to increase the distance that remote turnouts can be operated. This requires some kind of power operation of points and signals. The principal means of power operation include hydraulic, pneumatic and electric. More recently with the increase in weight of rail, and the introduction of high speed turnouts with finer angles requiring multiple drives, points have become stiffer and beyond the capability of mechanical drives, forcing the introduction of point machines if not already done so.  Principle  Modern point machines have an electric motor and gears to convert the rotational motion of the motor into the linear motion required to switch the points. The gear assembly also provides required transmission ratio so that it can generate necessary force to move switch blades. The machine performs following functions: # Moving switch blades. # Locking the blades # Detection and proving the position of blades.  Point machine conversion - manual to motorized  A point machine conversion system consists of a remotely controlled device attached to an existing manually operated point that allows the shunter/driver to remotely operate hand points with a radio handset. Each converter can be used as a stand-alone or multiple units can be installed operating together with routing.  In tie unit  The latest development is to mount the switch motor inside a faux railroad tie (aka sleeper) where it is relatively hidden from damage from track maintenance machines.

They have defined golden or black circles all over their body.Hoffman et al. (2010)  Description  The crawfish frog grows from 2.2 to 3.0 in (5.6 to 7.6 cm) in length. It ranges from yellow to brown in color, with a white ventral surface. The numerous dark brown spots on its back each has a light-colored ring around it. It has a distinct skin fold on either side of its back, which are much more pronounced in males than females, and a relatively small tympanum.  Behavior  Crawfish frogs are found primarily in association with prairie or grassland habitat, though they will also make use of pastures and overgrown fields. They spend most of the year in association with a terrestrial crayfish burrow. This species spends a substantial amount of time active and above ground even on hot summer days, but they never stray far from their burrow which serves as an important retreat from predators, a vital source of water, an escape from grassland fires, and a means to get below the frost line during winter. Crawfish frogs feed opportunistically on insects and other small invertebrates that pass by their burrow. The crawfish frog breeds following mild, rainy weather in mid- March throughout most of its range (breeding occurs much earlier in the southern portion of its distribution). During this time, males seek out ephemeral ponds and wetlands that lack fish and begin calling. The low- frequency call may carry over a mile, drawing females in from the surrounding area. Once the females arrive, amplexus takes place and the females deposit up to 7,000 eggs at a time in large, globular masses. The eggs hatch in about 12 days, and the tadpoles complete metamorphosis into froglets within three or four months. The newly metamorphosed juvenile frogs must quickly find a crayfish burrow to occupy to avoid predation. Crawfish frogs become sexually mature at two to three years of age and may live up to seven years or more in the wild.  Geographic range  The crawfish frog is found in former prairie regions from Indiana west to Kansas, south to Texas, and east to Mississippi, though it is believed to be locally extirpated in many regions, and remaining populations are often localized and isolated. In 2016 a sizable population was documented in Sumter County, Alabama. A new county record was added in 2017 in Perry County, Arkansas within the Ouachita Mountains. See Notes below.  Subspecies  The two subspecies of crawfish frog (R. areolata) are: *Southern crawfish frog, L. a. areolatus (Baird & Girard, 1852) *Northern crawfish frog, L. a. circulosus (Davis and Rice, 1883)  Conservation status  The crawfish frog is listed as near threatened by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, and is listed as endangered in Iowa (where it has likely been extirpated) and Indiana. Habitat loss is the biggest threat to this species, though disease (chytridiomycosis) and competitive pressure from other anurans have also been identified as potential stresses.

The question of Bob Jones University's tax-exempt status was ultimately resolved in Bob Jones University v. United States, in which the court ruled that the First Amendment did not protect discriminatory organizations from losing tax-exempt status..

Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 lists organizations that qualify for tax-exempt status and includes those which are charitable, religious, or for educational purposes. But a rise in the prevalence of Christian private schools in the 1960s and the Civil Rights Act of 1964 led the IRS to re-evaluate its policy. The IRS announced in 1970 that private schools with racially discriminatory admissions policies would no longer receive tax exemptions.Internal Revenue Service News Release, July 10, 1970, 7 STAND FED TAX REP. (CCH) #6970 (1970) The IRS then notified Bob Jones University of its intention to revoke the University's tax-exempt status because of the University's racially discriminatory admissions policy. As a result, the University would be subject to taxation and its donors would not be able to claim their gifts to the school as charitable deductions.Bob Jones Univ. v. Simon, 416 U.S. at 727. Bob Jones University filed suit to block the IRS from revoking its tax-exempt status, alleging \\"irreparable injury in the form of substantial federal income tax liability.\\" In 1971, the United States District Court for the District of South Carolina granted a preliminary injunction, but in 1973 the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed that decision.

The United States Treasury was represented by Assistant Attorney General Scott P. Crampton, with Solicitor General Robert Bork accompanying on the brief. Todd argued that Bob Jones University had met all the requirements of 501(c)(3) as set forth by Congress, but had its 501(c)(3) status revoked by the IRS nonetheless., Bob Jones University v. Simon: Oral Argument and Opinion Announcement. The Oyez Project at IIT Chicago-Kent College of Law. 14 March 2014. Inclusion on the list of tax-exempt organizations was essential to receive donations from foundations and individuals, and Bob Jones argued that removal from this list constituted irreparable harm to the university. Todd claimed that \\"the lower court held that the [IRS] Commissioner exceeded the statutory authority given him, that he has authority to promulgate regulations but not to change law, and that that's a matter for Congress to decide, and we of course contend that that's absolutely correct.\\" He also argued that Bob Jones University was not seeking an injunction on the collection of taxes resulting from the loss of tax-exempt status, but rather sought only an injunction on the removal of the University from the IRS list of registered 501(c)(3)s. This argument suggested that the case \\"involved taxes only very remotely\\" and was therefore not covered by the Anti-Injunction Act, which would bar Federal Courts from preventing the collection of any taxes by the IRS. Lastly, Todd contended that revocation of tax-exempt status by the IRS was an attempt to regulate the admissions policies of private universities, and not an effort motivated by protecting tax revenue. On behalf of the Treasury, Crampton argued that Bob Jones would owe $1.25 million in income taxes and saw their actions as \\"taxpayers trying to stop the assessment of tax.\\" Supreme Court decision US Supreme Court Justice Lewis Powell - Wrote the opinion of this case Bob Jones University v. Simon was decided May 15, 1974 in an 8-0 decision with majority opinion written by Lewis F. Powell, Jr., in which Justice Burger, Brennan, Stewart, White, Marshall, and Rehnquist joined. Justice Blackmun filed an opinion concurring in the result of the Court's decision. Justice Douglas took no part in the decision of this case. The Court held that the Anti-Injunction Act of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U. S. C. ¬ß 7421(a), prohibited the University from obtaining judicial review by way of injunctive action. The Court further upheld that the Court of Appeals did not err in \\"holding that ¬ß 7421(a) deprived the District Court of jurisdiction to the issue of injunctive relief the petitioner sought.\\"Bob Jones Univ. v. Simon, 416 U.S. at 749. Lastly, the Court admits to recognizing the \\"harsh regime\\" in which ¬ß 7421(a) has placed on ¬ß501 (c)(3) organizations threatened with loss of tax-exempt status and withdrawal of advanced assurance of deductibility of contributions. But, the Court stated that \\"this matter is for Congress, which is the appropriate body to weigh the relevant, policy-laden considerations, such as the harshness of the present law.\\", Bob Jones Univ. v. Simon - 416 U.S. 725 (1974) Within Section I of the Court's opinion the Court sought to detail the provisions which outlined the requirements needed in order for an organization to be exempt from the taxes and receive tax-deductibles as stated in the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, specifically Section 501(c)(3)., IRS, 6 Apr 2014. Additionally under the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, for organizations that had their 501(c)(3) status revoked, a provision allowed for litigation concerning the legality of the IRS's action after the assessment and attempted collection of taxes.Bob Jones Univ. v. Simon, 416 U.S. at 731. A legal suit could also be brought forward in a federal District Court or in the Court of Claims following the collection of any federal tax and the denial of a refund by the IRS. The court made it explicit that the language of the Anti- Injunction Act mandates that \\"no suit for the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection of any tax shall be maintained in any court.\\", Bob Jones Univ. v. Simon, 416 U.S. 725, U.S. Supreme Court, section III, pg 736 (1974) Furthermore, the courts have interpreted the principle language of the act to serve as \\"the protection of the Government's need to assess and collect taxes as expeditiously as possible with a minimum of pre-enforcement judicial interference.\\", Bob Jones University v.

(b) even if the plaintiff would owe no federal income taxes because of possible deductions for depreciation of plant and equipment, the plaintiff would still be liable for federal social security and unemployment taxes, which taxes were also contemplated by the Anti-Injunction Act, and (c) in any event, the plaintiff sought to restrain the collection of taxes from its donors by forcing the Internal Revenue Service to continue to provide advance assurance that contributions to the plaintiff would be tax-deductible, thereby reducing the donors' tax liability, which aspect was also covered by the Anti-Injunction Act even though the plaintiff sought to lower the taxes of persons other than itself; (3) the Anti-Injunction Act was not rendered inapplicable on the ground that the Service's actions constituted an attempt to regulate the admissions policies of private universities rather than an effort to protect the government's tax revenues, since there was no showing that the Service's position did not represent a good-faith effort to enforce technical requirements of the tax laws; (4) application of the Anti- Injunction Act did not deny due process of law to the plaintiff because of any irreparable injury it would suffer pending resort to alternative procedures for review whereby the plaintiff could obtain Tax Court review of any assessment for income taxes or alternatively could institute a refund suit after payment of income, social security, or unemployment taxes, since such alternative procedures offered the plaintiff a full, even though delayed, opportunity to litigate the legality of the Service's actions; and (5) the Anti-Injunction Act barred the instant action since the plaintiff's contentions as to violations of its constitutional rights were sufficiently debatable so as to foreclose the necessary determination that under no circumstances could the government ultimately prevail. =Concurring opinion= US Supreme Court Justice Harry Blackmun, concurred on the opinion of the Court Justice Blackmun concurring on the result of the Court: Justice Blackmun expressed the view that the purpose of the suit was to restrain \\"the assessment and collection\\" of a tax under the Anti-Injunction Act, since an injunction, if granted, would directly prevent the collection of income taxes from the plaintiff, and the action was barred since it had not been shown that under no circumstances could the government ultimately prevail., Bob Jones Univ. v.

Subsequently, the University paid the Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA) tax of $21 on one of its employees for that year in order to not come under the purview of the Anti-Injunction Act. After being denied a refund, the University proceeded to sue the IRS for revoking its tax- exempt status. The United States government filed for a counterclaim of $498,675.59 for unpaid federal unemployment taxes for the years 1971 to 1975.Bob Jones Univ. v. United States, 461 U.S. at 582.

The US District Court for the District of South Carolina ordered the IRS to restore the University's tax-exempt status on the grounds that the IRS policies violated the Free Exercise and Establishment Clause. In 1980, the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, in a split decision, determined that the dating policy, even if founded on religious conviction, violated its nondiscriminatory public policy. The request for a refund was dismissed and the government's counterclaim was reinstated.

United States. Greenville, SC: Bob Jones University, 1983. Role in subsequent decisions Bob Jones University v. Simon has been cited in multiple cases in the Court of Appeals and Supreme Court since its 1974 ruling. The exceptions to the Anti-Injunction Act laid out in Bob Jones Univ. v. Simon have been followed in several cases, notably in its \\"companion case\\" Alexander v. \\"Americans United\\" Inc.. In Alexander, the Supreme Court considered the exemptions in determining that a non-profit organization's suit against the IRS based on constitutional claims would not continue under the Anti-Injunction Act.Freund, Paul A. \\"The Supreme Court, 1973 Term.\\" Harvard Law Review 88.1(2005): 220-224. The rulings in Bob Jones Univ. v. Simon and Alexander are considered a stricter reading of the Anti-Injunction Act for limiting the kinds of suits allowed to proceed before the enforcement of taxation by the IRS. Bob Jones Univ. v. Simon has also been cited and distinguished in the decisions of other cases. In Security and Exchange Commission v. Credit Bancorp Ltd. as considered by the District Court for the Southern District of New York, the use of liens by the IRS were considered to be too different from the facts of Bob Jones Univ. v.

Regan. 465 U.S. 367. Supreme Court of the United States. 1984. p.382. This occurred due to the state of South Carolina lacking a direct method of challenging the removal of bearer bonds.South Carolina v. Regan, 401 The ruling therefore expanded on the instances in which the Anti-Injunction Act was not applicable, beyond the two exceptions set out by Bob Jones Univ. v.

It was for a long time only known from a single description, that of Dubois published in 1674. He stated: When subfossil bones were finally recovered in the late 20th century, they were initially described under a new name as the original description was believed to be invalid. However, only the genus initially assigned by Rothschild was incorrect. The R√©union night heron was the largest Nycticorax of the Mascarene Islands and larger even than the nankeen night heron. Unlike its relatives from Mauritius and Rodrigues, it was not adapted to a terrestrial lifestyle; its wings were strong and its legs not adapted to chasing prey on foot. Dubois mentions that the birds lived on fish. Extinction Of all the reports mentioning ardeid birds on R√©union, only the one of Dubois can be assigned to this species. Significantly, Jean Feuilley in 1705 did not mention these birds, and only in the second half of the 18th century are herons on R√©union referred to again, with the striated heron being the only species found, but \\"very rare\\". Thus, the R√©union night heron probably became extinct around 1700. However, as there are no good reasons for its disappearance (neither habitat destruction nor introduced predators would have affected it much, nor does it seem to have been a favorite target for hunters), it may have persisted until considerably later.

Morro de S√£o Paulo (translation: St. Paul's Hill) is one of 5 villages of the island of Tinhar√© in the municipality of Cairu, located in the state of Bahia, Brazil. The main beaches of the Morro de S√£o Paulo are located on east side of the island . They are: Primeira Praia, Segunda Praia, Terceira Praia, Quarta Praia and Quinta Praia (also known as Praia do Encanto). The settlement was home to a large Tumpinamba population prior to the arrival of the Portuguese. A Portuguese colony was established as early as 1535. The settlement is a site of large-scale tourism, and has three registered historic sites.  History  Martim Afonso de Sousa, landed in 1531 and baptized this island \\"Tynhar√©a\\" and the Bahian accent soon transformed that name to \\"Tinhar√©\\". In 1535 the village of Morro de S√£o Paulo was founded in the extreme north of the island by Francisco Romero and the local population. Morro de Sao Paulo was the site of patrols and attacks by German submarines between 1942 and 1945 as part of German naval attacks across the coast of Bahia and Sergipe during World War II. The German government initially targeted merchant ships off Bahia and Sergipe, but civilian casualties were numerous. The German submarine U-507 attacked the Itagiba off the Morro de S√£o Paulo Lighthouse, killing the majority of the 179 passengers. The citizen of Bahia experienced scarcity, speculation, and famine due to the threat of German attack from 1942 to 1945; Morro de S√£o Paulo was largely abandoned by the federal government and suffered from both famine and lawlessness.  Education  Morro de S√£o Paulo is home to the Waldorf pedagogy school, Escola CreArte. Transportation The village is from the city of Salvador by route and 60 km by sea. The only way to get to the island is by boat or by charter flights that go from the airport of Salvador to the local airstrip or by regular flights to Valen√ßa Airport.

Speir (October 6, 1895 - April 22, 1972) was an American \\"talent broker\\" and record store owner from Jackson, Mississippi. He was responsible for launching the recording careers of most of the greatest Mississippi blues musicians in the 1920s and 1930s. It has been said that, \\"Speir was the godfather of Delta Blues\\" and was \\"a musical visionary\\". Without Speir, Mississippi's greatest natural resource might have gone untapped.\\" Biography Born Henry Columbus Speir in Prospect, Mississippi, Speir was a white businessman who ran a music and mercantile store on Farish Street, in Jackson's black neighborhood. In 1926, through selling blues records in his store, he began working as a scout for the record companies producing the records, such as Okeh, Victor, Gennett, Columbia, Vocalion, Decca and Paramount. Using a metal disc machine in his store, Speir made demo recordings of the musicians that he sent to the labels, before arranging for more formal recording sessions. Word spread among blues musicians that Speir could help them make records, and many came to audition at the store. This audition process ‚Äî along with the ensuing recording sessions ‚Äî was dramatized in the Wim Wenders-directed installment of the television mini-series Martin Scorsese Presents the Blues: A Musical Journey, entitled \\"The Soul of a Man\\", which aired on PBS in 2003. Among the numerous musicians whom Speir introduced to the record companies were William Harris, Ishman Bracey, Tommy Johnson, Charlie Patton, Son House, Skip James, Robert Johnson, Bo Carter, Willie Brown, the Mississippi Sheiks, Blind Joe Reynolds, Blind Roosevelt Graves, Geeshie Wiley, and Robert Wilkins. He also auditioned, but turned down, Jimmie Rodgers. Speir retired from recording in 1936, and left Farish Street after a 1942 fire at his store. In the 1960s, Speir was extensively interviewed by blues scholar Gayle Dean Wardlow about the recordings he had made. On April 22, 1972, Speir died at his home in Pearl, Mississippi after a heart attack. He is buried alongside his wife at Lakewood Memorial Park Cemetery, in Clinton, Hinds County, Mississippi.

The route begins at an intersection with Merrick Road (unsigned County Route 27 or CR 27; formerly NY 27A) in Massapequa, serving several communities in the town of Oyster Bay before entering the city of Glen Cove and terminating at an intersection with Pulaski Street. From here, the right-of-way continues west for a short distance as Pratt Boulevard (CR 243) to Brewster Street and Glen Cove Avenue. Route 107 is the only State Highway on Long Island to enter a city other than New York City. The route connects with several major parkways and expressways and has a concurrency with NY 106 through Hicksville and Jericho Gardens. Route description = Massapequa to Hicksville = NY 107 begins at an intersection with Merrick Road (CR 27, former NY 27A) in the town of Massapequa as a northern continuation of Division Avenue, also present at this intersection. NY 107 proceeds north on Hicksville Road as a two-lane commercial street through Massapequa, passing west of Fairfield Elementary School as it enters a residential section of town. At the junction with Broadway (CR 149), NY 107 proceeds northwest on Hicksville Road, crossing into the town of Oyster Bay.

NY 107 continues northward, passing some strip malls before proceeding northwest, passing a mix of residences and businesses. The route remains two-lanes and soon becomes primarily residential as it turns northward through the North Massapequa section of Oyster Bay. Just after the intersection with Alken Avenue, NY 107 enters a partial cloverleaf interchange with Southern State Parkway (exit 29). After the Southern State Parkway, NY 107 bends northward, now in the Plainedge section of Oyster Bay.

A short distance later, the route enters a junction with Stewart Avenue (CR 35) in front of the Plainedge Shopping Center. NY 107 continues northwest on Hicksville Road as a two-lane residential street. The route becomes commercial at a junction with Seamans Neck Road (CR 191), soon intersecting NY 24 (Hempstead Turnpike) at-grade. After the junction with NY 24, NY 107 proceeds northeast as a four-lane residential boulevard through the Bethpage section. Now known as Hicksville-Massapequa Road, NY 107 crosses into the town of Hempstead and enters an at-grade interchange with the northern terminus of North Wantagh Avenue (CR 189). This junction once served as the northern terminus of NY 115 until the early 1970s. The route then intersects with Central Avenue. The route remains four lanes, bending northwest and becomes a commercial boulevard, re-entering the town of Oyster Bay. The route becomes a four lane street once again after a junction with Hicksville Road. = Hicksville to Glen Cove = NY 106 and NY 107 northbound in Jericho NY 107 proceeds northwest, becoming a two-lane commercial and industrial street through Oyster Bay, changing names to South Broadway and intersecting with South Oyster Bay Road (CR 9). The route enters the Hicksville section of Oyster Bay as a four-lane commercial boulevard, becoming a divided highway once again at Gerald Avenue. NY 107 continues northwest as the divided roadway, intersecting with Old Country Road (CR 25) as a four-lane commercial street. NY 107 then enters downtown Hicksville, crossing under a railroad junction of the Long Island Rail Road just east of the Hicksville. After crossing under the tracks, NY 107 continues northwest as a four-lane street, entering an at-grade interchange with NY 106 (Newbridge Road). After the at- grade interchange, NY 106 and NY 107 become concurrent as North Broadway, a four-lane boulevard through Hicksville. Passing east of Broadway Mall, the route became a six-lane boulevard through the Jericho Gardens section of Oyster Bay. A short distance after, NY 106 and NY 107 enter a cloverleaf interchange with the Northern State Parkway (exit 35). After that, the route crosses South Marginal Road at-grade, then entering exit 41, a cloverleaf interchange with the Long Island Expressway (I-495). After that interchange, NY 106 and NY 107 continue northwest as North Broadway, a six-lane divided boulevard. Entering the East Birchwood section, they enter another cloverleaf interchange, this time with NY 25 (the Jericho Turnpike). Immediately after NY 25, NY 106 and NY 107 enter an interchange, where NY 106 proceeds northeast on Jericho-East Norwich Road, while NY 107 continues north on Cedar Swamp Road. NY 106/NY 107 northbound at the interchange with the Northern State Parkway in Jericho Gardens NY 107 leaves East Birchwood on Cedar Swamp Road, passing south of Jericho Middle School as it winds northwest as a four-lane residential boulevard. Now in the Brookville section, the route condenses to a two-lane residential street, passing south of the Tam O Shatner Country Club as it winds west. Passing north of a residential complex, NY 107 bends northwestward once again, crossing through several mansions and intersecting with Wheatley Road. At Wheatley Road, NY 107 enters the village of Upper Brookville, passing south of Long Island University's CW Post as it becomes four-lanes and enters an at-grade intersection with NY 25A (Northern Boulevard). After NY 25A, NY 107 enters Old Brookville village, remaining a two-lane residential road. The route makes a short bend to the northwest at Hoaglands Lane, winding north Old Brookville into an interchange with the Glen Cove Arterial Highway (NY 900B). NY 107 at the junction with NY 900B (Glen Cove Road) in Glen Head At that junction, NY 107 becomes part of the Glen Cove Arterial Highway, passing southwest of Cedar Brook Country Club as Glen Cove Road. The route is a four lane arterial, winding through the Glen Head section of Oyster Bay. A short distance later, NY 107 intersects with another portion of Cedar Swamp Road, which forks to the northeast. After this junction, NY 107 becomes a four-lane freeway through Glen Head, with the median being replaced by a concrete barrier. Along this stretch, NY 107 crosses under the Long Island Rail Road's Oyster Bay Branch, just west of the Glen Street station. Now in the city of Glen Cove, NY 107 passes the water tower and bends northwest. At the city line, NY 107 becomes known as Pratt Boulevard. Through Glen Cove, NY 107 remains a four-lane arterial, intersecting with another section of Pratt Boulevard. A short distance later, passing several businesses to the south, intersecting with Pulaski Street. This intersection serves as the northern terminus of NY 107, while Pratt Boulevard continues west as CR 243\\\\. CR 243 connects NY 107 to Brewster Street and Glen Cove Avenue, where Pratt Boulevard ends. History NY 107 was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, extending from the hamlet of Massapequa on South Oyster Bay to the city of Glen Cove on Long Island Sound. Originally, NY 107 followed Cedar Swamp Road and Sea Cliff Avenue (now Christopher Columbus Avenue) to Sea Cliff, where it ended at the junction of Sea Cliff Avenue and Prospect Avenue. It was realigned to continue to Glen Cove by way of Cedar Swamp Avenue and Glen Street. In the mid-1960s, the northernmost segment of NY 107 was moved onto the Glen Cove Arterial Highway, a new bypass of Glen Street. A study by the New York State Department of Transportation suggested the highway would connect to one of two proposed bridges to Rye across Long Island Sound.

The Church has been characterized as National Monument since 1910.  History  The church was built in the second half of the 12th century by the provincial master of the Order of the Knights Templar in Portugal, Gualdim Pais. It was used as a burial place for the Knights Templar of Tomar and, later, by the Knights of the Order of Christ, which succeeded the Templars in the 14th century. Gualdim Pais is buried in the church, and his original tomb slab, dated from 1195 and bearing a gothic inscription, is still preserved inside.  Overview  The current building is mostly the result of a reconstruction carried out in the 13th century in early Gothic style. The main fa√ßade has a beautiful rose window and a simple portal with several archivolts, and is flanked by a free-standing bell tower. The interior is very simple. The church has three naves covered by a wooden roof, and the columns of the pointed arches of the naves are devoid of capitals. The main chapel of the apse is covered by a Gothic ribbed vault. The tracery of the small rose window in the Eastern wall of the nave has the shape of a pentagram. In the 16th century the church was restored and several chapels were added to the southern side of the church. Notable are the polychromed statue of the Virgin Mary and Child (early 16th century) in the main altar and the funerary monument of Diogo Pinheiro, first Bishop of Funchal, a fine Renaissance work dated from 1525, located on the wall of the main chapel. On the left side nave, in front of the chapel displaying the statue \\"Virgin Mary\\" there is a slab carved with the arms of two (2) families whose faded Latin inscription reads, immediately under the arms, \\"T.DA.CUNHA\\" appearing to indicate that one of the persons buried under it was a relation of the famous commander Trist√£o da Cunha.

Between 1935 and 1940 she was viceregal consort of Canada while her husband was the governor general. She was also the author of several novels, children's books, and biographies, some of which were published under the name Susan Tweedsmuir.  Life  Susan was born in Mayfair, London. She was a daughter of Norman de L'Aigle Grosvenor (son of the first Lord Ebury) and his wife Caroline Susan Theodora Stuart-Wortley (a granddaughter of the first Lord Wharncliffe), and a cousin of the Dukes of Westminster. She married John Buchan on 15 July 1907, and became the Baroness Tweedsmuir (known as Lady Tweedsmuir) when he was created Baron Tweedsmuir in 1935. The Buchans had four children, Alice, John, William, and Alastair, two of whom would spend most of their lives in Canada. She was a childhood friend of Virginia Stephen (later Virginia Woolf), and they remained friendly, although not always close, in adult life. The Hogarth Press, run by Leonard and Virginia Woolf, published a work of Lady Tweedsmuir's in 1935 and she was the recipient of one of the last letters Virginia Woolf ever wrote.Nigel Nicolson, Ed, The Letters of Virginia Woolf, London, the Hogarth Press, 1975-1980, letters number 30, 1781, 1786, 2708, 2953, 2980, 3033, 3040, 3041, 3064, 3390, 3394, 3427, 3705.

Sonnabend (September 17, 1925 ‚Äì December 7, 2008Sonesta Hotels Announces Passing of Roger Sonnabend, Executive Chairman of the Board) was an American hotelier and businessman. He was the head of Sonesta International Hotels Corporation. Early life and education Roger, the eldest of three brothers, graduated from MIT and took the helm at the Nautilus Hotel and Beach Club, in Atlantic Beach, New York, when he was 21. He graduated Harvard Business School in 1949. Career The family business was known as Sonnabend Operated Hotels, which later merged with Childs Restaurant Group when A.M. Sonnabend purchased a controlling interest in Childs in 1955. Childs was renamed Hotel Corporation of America when the Sonnabend Operated Hotels were merged with Childs. Two prominent hotels included were the Plaza Hotel (New York) and the Mayflower Hotel (Washington DC). Roger was promoted to President upon the death of his father, the founder of the chain. In 1969, the company engaged an advertising agency to create a new brand name. The agency felt the company already had a great name that was used by the Rib Room restaurants that operated at many of the hotels. The name was Sonesta. Sonesta is derived from \\"Sonny\\" and \\"Esther\\". AM Sonnabend was known to many as \\"Sonny\\". Among the many commercial interests of AM Sonnabend, was a Holstein dairy farm located in Massachusetts. The Sonnabends often enjoyed \\"baked potato Sonesta\\" when entertaining at the farm and the recipe was later used when serving baked potatoes at the Rib Room restaurants. Baked potatoes Sonesta were topped with butter, sour cream and chives. This popular American tradition was first introduced by the RIb Room restaurants. Among the hotels managed by HCA was a 400-room luxury ocean-front hotel in Southampton Parish, Bermuda‚Äîoriginally named the Carlton Beach. It became entangled in extensive litigation between the builder/owner, the J. Irwin Miller family, and HCA. After a Court resolution that satisfied no one, the hotel was purchased by HCA and later renamed the Sonesta Beach. It was demolished after suffering severe damage in a hurricane around 2005. Roger's political work landed him on the master list of Nixon political opponents.c References *Company History via Sonesta Hotels *Callahan, David (December 8, 2002).

PSSI‚Äôs primary mission is to build an ever-growing number of informed and security-minded policy practitioners dedicated to the development and safeguarding of democratic institutions and values in the Czech Republic and its regional neighbors. PSSI works to identify and analyze select foreign policy and security-related concerns in transatlantic relations and other theaters of the world, propose sound, achievable policy responses and host regular roundtables and major conferences on these topics. PSSI is especially alert to the intersection of global finance/energy and national security considerations.History, About PSSI, Prague Security Studies Institute, Accessed 11-June-2009 History The founding of PSSI was the result of nearly five years of planning and development. In 1997, the National Security Assessments Program (NSA) was established as an entity within the Civic Institute, one of the Czech Republic‚Äôs first non-profit policy groups following the Velvet Revolution. The initial focus of the NSA Program was to enrich the national and regional debates with respect to the security-related dimensions of post-communist governance. Over a two-year period, the NSA Program made substantial progress in informing and influencing the largely underdeveloped national security policy agenda of the Czech Republic. The NSA Program, headed by Roger W. Robinson, Jr. and Petr Vanƒçura, convened three annual conferences, each with over 200 participants. The first conference, ‚ÄúNATO and Central European Security in the 21st Century‚Äù held in April 1999, was held on the fiftieth anniversary of NATO. The second conference, ‚ÄúA Tenth Anniversary Assessment of Central European Freedoms‚Äù in April 2000, was held to commemorate this historical development. The third, ‚ÄúTrans-Atlantic Missile Defense and Security Cooperation,‚Äù took place in April 2001. Speakers from roughly eight Western and Central European countries and the US attended each of these annual conferences. The distinguished speakers included former CIA Director, James Woolsey; former US National Security Advisor, Richard Allen; US Ambassador to the Czech Republic, John Shattuck; former US Assistant Secretary of Defense, Richard Perle; prominent Soviet dissident, Vladimir Bukovsky; former Advisor to the Prime Minister of Poland, Piotr Naimsky; Air Marshal and former Chief of British Defence Intelligence, Sir John Walker; Professor of International Security Studies at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, Dr. Robert Pfaltzgraff, Jr.; German Ambassador Hagen Graf Lambsdorff; Sorbonne Prof. Francoise Thom; Director of the Institute for Strategic Studies in Bonn, Dr. Holger Mey; William F. Martin, former Deputy Secretary of the US Department of Energy. In 2000, the NSA Program was spun off from the Civic Institute to create The Bell Association for Freedom and Democracy. In the succeeding two years, the concept of a national security-oriented training program for future policy practitioners evolved and led to the founding of the Prague Security Studies Institute (PSSI) in early 2002. PSSI was led by former Czech National Security advisor and Director of the Foreign Intelligence Service, Old≈ôich ƒåern√Ω and Roger W. Robinson, Jr., who also served as Co-Founders of the Institute. Programs PSSI conducts a range of activities under its Security Scholars Program, Program of Atlantic Security Studies, Regional Outreach Program and Corporate Council Program. Regional Outreach Program PSSI‚Äôs Regional Outreach Programs seeks to contribute to democratic institution-building in post- communist countries and to share know-how, technical expertise and professional experiences gained during the transition to democracy in the Czech Republic. The gatherings primarily involve graduate students and young professionals from those states still operating under largely authoritarian regimes ( e.g., Belarus, Russia, China, etc.) as well as young American journalists interested in this historical period and transformational process. The Outreach Program provides training with respect to the construction of a free, democratic society with a focus on reforming the security sector via the Security ReformInitiative http://www.pssi.cz/regional-outreach- program/security-reform Among other countries, the Program works closely with students and early career professionals from Ukraine, Moldova and Kosovo and organizes a series of meetings with, and briefings by, current and former Czech security policy experts and practitioners from the Parliament.  Security Scholars Programs  Robinson-Martin Security Scholars Program ( RMSSP) PSSI‚Äôs flagship program, launched in early 2002, is a two-semester, advanced introductory course to Security Studies held on the premises of PSSI for highly qualified Czech University students. The program offers lectures by, and interaction with, some 20 foreign policy luminaries from around the world in small group settings. As is stated on PSSI‚Äôs webpage, the overarching goal is building an ever-growing number of young, visionary professionals across the post-communist space well-versed in key security-related subjects and challenges. MA Degree Program in Security Studies PSSI co-sponsors Charles University‚Äôs master's degree Program in Security Studies to help enrich and accelerate the theoretical and practical training of security policy professionals and provide them with detailed knowledge concerning a number of prominent global ‚Äúflashpoints.‚Äù and issue areas such as terrorism and WMD proliferation, energy security, counterspace defense, festering regional conflicts, the eurozone crisis, Putin‚Äôs Russia, China‚Äôs rise, financial sanctions etc. The MA Degree Program offers courses well beyond regional and transatlantic security concerns, covering the Middle East, East Asia and other theaters and focusing on disciplines, such as international economics and finance, intelligence gathering and dissemination and global energy security. In the Fall of 2012, an English-language curriculum was introduced, greatly expanding access to this cutting-edge program. Whitaker Chair and Lecture Series in Security Studies Named in honor of one of PSSI¬¥s principal benefactors, Dr. James Q. Whitaker, this high-level Lecture Series focuses on free-market economics and geopolitical benefits, policy prescriptions important to Central and Eastern Europe as well as on priority security challenges worldwide. Summer School Since 2005, PSSI, in cooperation with NATO‚Äôs Public Diplomacy Division, has offered an intensive course of study in July each year for graduate students in political science, international relations and other relevant fields from NATO‚Äôs member states and partner countries. The Summer School often has as many as 15 nationalities represented in each these sessions. Subjects include key future challenges for NATO as well as pressing issues on the global security agenda, such as the trajectory of Russia, transatlantic relations, Afghanistan, energy security and the new NATO‚Äôs Strategic Concept. Program of Atlantic Security Studies Established in 2003 to augment PSSI‚Äôs Security Scholars Program, the Program of Atlantic Security Studies serves as the Institute‚Äôs public policy arm. It seeks to identify and analyze relevant foreign policy and security-related issues that affect the transatlantic community as well as international security more broadly. The primary focus of PASS is to organize international conferences, roundtables, and workshops that bring together high-level decision-makers, opinion leaders, and experts in a number of fields from different countries and disciplines that would, in many cases, not be exposed to one another under normal professional circumstances. PASS conferences have covered topics such as the NATO Strategic Concept, Asia-Pacific Security Challenges, Trilateral Space Security, and Democracy and Security. Corporate Council Program (CCP) The Corporate Council Program was established in the fall of 2003, Chaired by William F. Martin. The Program offers PSSI students the benefits of integrating into their academic course load the management and decision-making skills of leading business executives from across the globe. The CCP seeks to construct mutually-reinforcing relationships between select multinational corporations/banks and PSSI. Under its banner, is our The Club of Prague, which seeks to provide a forum for a sophisticated dialogue among the region‚Äôs leading energy experts and the exploration of cooperative ventures.

As far as the tongue-in-cheek press releaseFound at www.p3music.com. by their record label P3 Music can be taken seriously, the band is named after a 1985 episode of The New Twilight Zone in which a child is taught bizarre magic tricks through his television set.The details of the episode can be found on IMDb. In 2004 The Uncle Devil Show performed a handful of live shows in Scotland and released the album A Terrible Beauty, co-written by \\"Herring\\" and \\"Barr\\". It featured guitar-driven pop songs with surreal lyrics often containing incongruous obscenities. Subject-matter varied from stolen bicycles, a man's love for Gilbert O'Sullivan, transvestism, drug-addled TV presenters in limousines and a woman who teaches her canary to sing Mot√∂rhead's \\"Ace of Spades\\", to a man filled with murderous hatred for pigeons.

The company's main fireworks office and operations are in Bellport, NY with a manufacturing and government work factory in Radford, Virginia. According to the American Pyrotechnics Association, an industry trade group, Fireworks by Grucci is \\"one of the nation's premier pyrotechnics firms.\\"  History  The company traces its pyrotechnic roots to Bari, Italy, where Angelo Lanzetta reportedly was an apprentice to an Italian fireworks family. Lanzetta was the great-great-grandfather of Felix Grucci Sr., after whom the company was named. Grucci Sr. continued to develop the company with such innovations as the stringless shell, which improved fireworks safety by eliminating burning fallout. The company also developed mock atomic bomb tests for the Department of Defense. The Grucci family received accolades for its performance on the Charles River in Boston during the 1976 bicentennial celebration, its first major performance outside the New York metropolitan area. In 1979, the Gruccis became the first American family to win the Gold Medal for the United States at the annual Monte Carlo International Fireworks Competition, an event revered by the fireworks industry as the most prestigious competition in the world. This also earned the family their nickname, \\"America's First Family of Fireworks,\\" from the New York press. In 1983, disaster struck the company when an explosion at the company's factory in Bellport, New York killed two family members and heavily damaged dozens of nearby homes. As a result, the company moved its operations from Bellport to Yaphank, New York, a more secluded area. In 2008, the company provided fireworks for a party on Staten Island to celebrate Julius Nasso, a film producer and friend of the Gotti family, getting out of prison https://radaronline.com/exclusives/2008/01/gotti- settles-all-family-business-php/  Facility  Grucci's Brookhaven facility is set in a tightly controlled enclosure. Safety is kept at a premium by using caution signs, eight-foot-high barbed wire fencing, and huge sand-and-gravel barriers. In addition, copper plates are placed on the outside of the assembly buildings to discharge static, while no more than four workers are allowed at a time in any one building. Technology Fireworks by Grucci has adapted the use of technology, including the use of computers to electronically fire the shells. It has also switched from using the traditionally used cardboard gun barrels to fiberglass and steel, which is better able to absorb a misfire.  Noteworthy displays  Fireworks at the 2019 Salute to America event Fireworks by Grucci has produced fireworks displays for various United States and international events, including: * Seven consecutive U.S. Presidential inaugurations beginning with Ronald Reagan; *Statue of Liberty Centennial (1986); *Brooklyn Bridge Centennial; * Olympic Games in Lake Placid, Los Angeles, Salt Lake City, Beijing, and more; * World's Fairs in Knoxville, Tennessee, New Orleans, Los Angeles and Taejon, Korea * Dubai 2014 fireworks display, a Guinness world record. Including 479,651 shells fired in just six minutes on New Year's Eve, at a rate of almost 80K shells per minute and 1,332 fireworks per second * Donald Trump's Salute to America, Fourth of July 2019 event, used Grucci fireworks.https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/july-4th- fireworks-donor-lobbied-president-trump-tariffs/story?id=64108794 The company has also done displays in Florida and Hawaii.

Paterson started studying fine arts in the 1960s at the University of Alberta (U of A), but didn't complete her degree. Instead, she met her husband at the university, got married and then worked as a stay- at-home mom. Later, she went back to U of A and earned her bachelor of fine arts in 1988. Paterson sculpted numerous public commissions, including Lois Hole \\"A Legacy of Love and Learning\\", and the \\"Famous Five\\" monuments in Calgary, Alberta's Olympic Square and on Parliament Hill in Ottawa, Ontario. A detail image from the \\"Famous Five\\" monuments was featured on a Canada Post stamp in October 1999, and was pictured on the Canadian $50.00 bill. An image of part of the statue can now be seen on the inner pages of the Canadian passport. For the \\"Famous Five\\" sculpture, which is titled the Women are Persons! Monument, she first created model sculptures that were later scaled up into life-sized bronze.

In 1936, after Sheng Shicai expelled 30,000 Kazakhs from Xinjiang to Qinghai, Hui led by General Ma Bufang massacred their fellow Muslim Kazakhs, until there were 135 of them left. From Northern Xinjiang over 7,000 Kazakhs fled to the Tibetan Plateau via Gansu and were wreaking massive havoc so Ma Bufang solved the problem by relegating the Kazakhs into designated pastureland in Qinghai, but Hui, Tibetans, and Kazakhs in the region continued to clash against each other. Tibetans attacked and fought against the Kazakhs as they entered Tibet via Gansu and Qinghai. In northern Tibet, Kazakhs clashed with Tibetan soldiers and then the Kazakhs were sent to Ladakh. Tibetan troops robbed and killed Kazakhs 400 miles east of Lhasa at Chamdo when the Kazakhs were entering Tibet. In 1934, 1935, 1936-1938 from Qumil Eliqsan led the Kerey Kazakhs to migrate to Gansu and the amount was estimated at 18,000, and they entered Gansu and Qinghai. Tibetan troops serving under the Dalai Lama murdered the American CIA agent Douglas Mackiernan and his two White Russian helpers because he was dressed as a Kazakh, their enemy. Soviet persecution of Kazakhs led to Kazakhs from Soviet Kazakhstan moving to Xinjiang. The Kazakhs had settled in the Dzungaria area of Xinjiang after the Dzungar genocide by the Manchus wiped out most of the native Dzungar Oirats and fleeing from Soviet engineered famines against the Kazakhs like the Kazakh famine of 1919‚Äì1922 and Kazakhstan famine of 1932-1933. The Kazakhs had defected to the Republic of China and fought against the Soviet Communist backed Uyghurs in the Ili Rebellion. The initial exodus began in 1950 or the Year of the Tiger, when the victorious Chinese Communist Army took control, not guaranteeing nor overtly denying the Kazakh way of life: tribalism and Islam. Families voted at Barkol and set out to preserve their way of life in the steppes of Kashmir. This initial journey to Kashmir was opposed by the victorious Chinese Red Army as they passed through Chinese territory. The first attack happened at Barkol in Kumul Prefecture and the second near Timurlik. The Kazakh groups that survived fled into Tibet to survive. The victory by the Chinese Red Army was not the only thing that hindered the initial Kazakh exodus; they also suffered illness which killed countless individuals. It took three months for the Kazakhs to cross Tibet and arrive at Srinagar, Kashmir. Of the 400 families that fled China, only 350 arrived at Srinagar in the initial exodus. In 1962, the Kazakhs embarked on another exodus from Xinjiang. This time the Kazakh and members of other ethnic groups fled to the Soviet Union due to mass riots and communist reforms that again were imposed on the Kazakhs' traditional way of life.

SMAD3 is a member of the SMAD family of proteins. It acts as a mediator of the signals initiated by the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-Œ≤) superfamily of cytokines, which regulate cell proliferation, differentiation and death. Based on its essential role in TGF beta signaling pathway, SMAD3 has been related with tumor growth in cancer development.  Gene  The human SMAD3 gene is located on chromosome 15 on the cytogenic band at 15q22.33. The gene is composed of 9 exons over 129,339 base pairs. It is one of several human homologues of a gene that was originally discovered in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. The expression of SMAD3 has been related to the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK/ERK pathway), particularly to the activity of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase-1 (MEK1). Studies have demonstrated that inhibition of MEK1 activity also inhibits SMAD3 expression in epithelial cells and smooth muscle cells, two cell types highly responsive to TGF-Œ≤1.  Protein  SMAD3 is a polypeptide with a molecular weight of 48,080 Da. It belongs to the SMAD family of proteins. SMAD3 is recruited by SARA (SMAD Anchor for Receptor Activation) to the membrane, where the TGF-Œ≤ receptor is located. The receptors for TGF-Œ≤, (including nodal, activin, myostatin and other family members) are membrane serine/threonine kinases that preferentially phosphorylate and activate SMAD2 and SMAD3. Once SMAD3 is phosphorylated at the C-terminus, it dissociates from SARA and forms a heterodimeric complex with SMAD4, which is required for the transcriptional regulation of many target genes. The complex of two SMAD3 (or of two SMAD2) and one SMAD4 binds directly to DNA though interactions of the MH1 domain. These complexes are recruited to sites throughout the genome by cell lineage- defining transcription factors (LDTFs) that determine the context-dependent nature of TGF-Œ≤ action. The DNA binding sites in promoters and enhancers are known as the SMAD-binding elements (SBEs). These sites contain the CAG(AC)(CC) and GGC(GC)(CG) consensus sequences, the latter also known as 5GC sites. The 5GC-motifs are highly represented as clusters of sites, in SMAD-bound regions genome-wide. These clusters can also contain CAG(AC)(CC) sites. SMAD3/SMAD4 complex also binds to the TPA-responsive gene promoter elements, which have the sequence motif TGAGTCAG.  Structure  =MH1 domain= The X-ray structures of the SMAD3 MH1 domain bound to the GTCT DNA reveal characteristic features of the fold. The MH1 structure consists of four-helices and three sets of antiparallel Œ≤-hairpins, one of which is used to interact with DNA. It also revealed the presence of a bound Zn2+, coordinated by His126, Cys64, Cys109 and Cys121 residues. The main DNA binding region of the MH1 domain comprises the loop following the Œ≤1 strand, and the Œ≤2-Œ≤3 hairpin. In the complex with a member of the 5GC DNAs, the GGCGC motif, the convex face of the DNA-binding hairpin dives into the concave major groove of the duplex DNA containing five base pairs (GGCGC /'GCGCC'). In addition, the three residues strictly conserved in all R-SMADS and in SMAD4 (Arg74 and Gln76 located in Œ≤2 and Lys81 in Œ≤3 in SMAD3) participate in a network of specific hydrogen bonds with the dsDNA. Several tightly bound water molecules at the protein-DNA interface that contribute to the stabilization of the interactions have also been detected. The SMAD3 complex with the GGCGC site reveals that the protein-DNA interface is highly complementary and that one MH1 protein covers a DNA binding site of six base pairs. =MH2 domain= The MH2 domain mediates the interaction of R-SMADS with activated TGF-Œ≤ receptors, and with SMAD4 after receptor-mediated phosphorylation of the Ser-X-Ser motif present in R-SMADS. The MH2 domain is also a binding platform for cytoplasmic anchors, DNA-binding cofactors, histone modifiers, chromatin readers, and nucleosome- positioning factors. The structure of the complex of SMAD3 and SMAD4 MH2 domains has been determined. The MH2 fold is defined by two sets of antiparallel Œ≤-strands (six and five strands respectively) arranged as a Œ≤-sandwich flanked by a triple-helical bundle on one side and by a set of large loops and a helix on the other.  Functions and interactions  = TGF-Œ≤/SMAD signaling pathway = SMAD3 functions as a transcriptional modulator, binding the TRE (TPA responsive element) in the promoter region of many genes that are regulated by TGF-Œ≤. SMAD3 and SMAD4 can also form a complex with c-Fos and c-jun at the AP-1/SMAD site to regulate TGF-Œ≤-inducible transcription. The genes regulated by SMAD3-mediated TGFŒ≤ signaling affect differentiation, growth and death. TGF-Œ≤/SMAD signaling pathway has been shown to have a critical role in the expression of genes controlling differentiation of embryonic stem cells. Some of the developmental genes regulated by this pathway include FGF1, NGF, and WNT11 as well as stem/progenitor cell associated genes CD34 and CXCR4. The activity of this pathway as a regulator of pluripotent cell states requires the TRIM33-SMAD2/3 chromatin reading complex. = TGF-Œ≤/SMAD3-induced repression = Besides the activity of TGF-Œ≤ in the up-regulation of genes, this signaling molecule also induces the repression of target genes containing the TGF-Œ≤ inhibitory element (TIE). SMAD3 plays also a critical role in TGF-Œ≤-induced repression of target genes, specifically it is required for the repression of c-myc.The transcriptional repression of c-myc is dependent on direct SMAD3 binding to a repressive SMAD binding element (RSBE), within TIE of the c-myc promoter. The c-myc TIE is a composite element, composed of an overlapping RSBE and a consensus E2F site, which is capable of binding at least SMAD3, SMAD4, E2F4, and p107.  Clinical significance  = Diseases = Increased SMAD3 activity has, however, been implicated in the pathogenesis of scleroderma. SMAD3 is also a multifaceted regulator in adipose physiology and the pathogenesis of obesity and type 2 diabetes. SMAD3-knockout mice have diminished adiposity, with improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. Despite their reduced physical activity arising from muscle atrophy, these SMAD3-knockout mice are resistant to high- fat-diet induced obesity. SMAD3-knockout mouse is a legitimate animal model of human aneurysms‚Äêosteoarthritis syndrome(AOS), also named Loeys-Dietz Syndrome (type 3). SMAD3 deficiency promotes inflammatory aortic aneurysms in angiotensin II-infused mice via the activation of iNOS. Macrophage depletion and inhibition of iNOS activity prevent aortic aneurysms related to SMAD3 gene mutation = Role in cancer = The role of SMAD3 in the regulation of genes important for cell fate, such as differentiation, growth and death, implies that an alteration in its activity or repressing of its activity can lead to the formation or development of cancer. Also several studies have proven the bifunctional tumor suppressor/oncogene role of TGF beta signaling pathway in carcinogenesis. One way in which SMAD3 transcriptional activator function is repressed, is by the activity of EVI-1. EVI-1 encodes a zinc-finger protein that may be involved in leukaemic transformation of haematopoietic cells. The zinc-finger domain of EVI-1 interacts with SMAD3, thereby suppressing the transcriptional activity of SMAD3. EVI-1 is thought to be able to promote growth and to block differentiation in some cell types by repressing TGF-Œ≤ signalling and antagonizing the growth-inhibitory effects of TGF-Œ≤.  Prostate  The activity of SMAD3 in prostate cancer is related with the regulation of angiogenic molecules expression in tumor vascularization and cell-cycle inhibitor in tumor growth. The progressive growth of primary tumors and metastases in prostate cancer depends on an adequate blood supply provided by tumor angiogenesis. Studies analyzing SMAD3 levels of expression in prostate cancer cell lines found that the two androgen-independent and androgen receptor-negative cell lines (PC-3MM2 and DU145) have high expression levels of SMAD3. Analysis of the relation between SMAD3 and the regulation of angiogenic molecules suggest that SMAD3 may be one of key components as a repressor of the critical angiogenesis switch in prostate cancer. The pituitary tumor-transforming gene 1 (PTTG1) has also an impact in SMAD3-mediated TGFŒ≤ signaling. PTTG1 has been associated with various cancer cells including prostate cancer cells. Studies showed that the overexpression of PTTG1 induces a decrease in SMAD3 expression, promoting the proliferation of prostate cancer cells via the inhibition of SMAD3.  Colorectal  In mice, mutation of SMAD3 has been linked to colorectal adenocarcinoma,[3] increased systemic inflammation, and accelerated wound healing.[4] Studies have shown that mutations in SMAD3 gene promote colorectal cancer in mice. The altered activity of SMAD3 was linked to chronic inflammation and somatic mutations that contribute to chronic colitis and the development of colorectal cancer. The results generated on mice helped identify SMAD3 like a possible player in human colorectal cancer. The impact of SMAD3 has also been analyzed in colorectal cancer human cell lines, using single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) microarray analysis. The results showed reductions in SMAD3 transcriptional activity and SMAD2-SMAD4 complex formation, underlining the critical roles of these three proteins within the TGF-Œ≤ signaling pathway and the impact of this pathway in colorectal cancer development.  Breast  TGF-Œ≤-induced SMAD3 transcriptional regulation response has been associated with breast cancer bone metastasis by its effects on tumor angiogenesis, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). There have been identified diverse molecules that act over the TGF-Œ≤/SMAD signaling pathway, affecting primarily the SMAD2/3 complex, which have been associated with the development of breast cancer. FOXM1 (forkhead box M1) is a molecule that binds with SMAD3 to sustain activation of the SMAD3/SMAD4 complex in the nucleus. The research over FOXM1 suggested that it prevents the E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase transcriptional intermediary factor 1 Œ≥ (TIF1Œ≥) from binding SMAD3 and monoubiquitinating SMAD4, which stabilized the SMAD3/SMAD4 complex. FOXM1 is a key player in the activity of the SMAD3/SMAD4 complex, promoting SMAD3 modulator transcriptional activity, and also plays an important role in the turnover of the activity of SMAD3/SMAD4 complex. Based on the importance of this molecule, studies have found that FOXM1 is overexpressed in highly aggressive human breast cancer tissues. The results from these studies also found that the FOXM1/SMAD3 interaction was required for TGF-Œ≤-induced breast cancer invasion, which was the result of SMAD3/SMAD4-dependent upregulation of the transcription factor SLUG. MED15 is a mediator molecule that promotes the activity of the TGF-Œ≤/SMAD signaling. The deficiency of this molecule attenuates the activity of the TGF-Œ≤/SMAD signaling pathway over the genes required for induction of epithelial-mesenchymal transition. The action of MED15 is related with the phosphorylation of SMAD2/3 complex. The knockdown of MED15 reduces the amount of SMAD3 phosphorylated, therefore reducing its activity as transcription modulator. However, in cancer, MED15 is also highly expressed in clinical breast cancer tissues correlated with hyperactive TGF-Œ≤ signaling, as indicated by SMAD3 phosphorylation. The studies suggest that MED15 increases the metastatic potential of a breast cancer cell line by increasing TGF-Œ≤- induced epithelial‚Äìmesenchymal transition.  Kidney  Smad3 activation plays a role in the pathogenesis of renal fibrosis, probably by inducing activation of bone marrow-derived fibroblasts  Nomenclature  The SMAD proteins are homologs of both the Drosophila protein \\"mothers against decapentaplegic\\" (MAD) and the C. elegans protein SMA. The name is a combination of the two. During Drosophila research, it was found that a mutation in the gene MAD in the mother repressed the gene decapentaplegic in the embryo. The phrase \\"Mothers against\\" was inspired by organizations formed by mothers to oppose social problems, such as Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD); and based on a tradition of such unusual naming within the gene research community.\\"Sonic Hedgehog, DICER, and the Problem With Naming Genes\\", Sep 26, 2014, Michael White. psmag.com A reference assembly of SMAD3 is available.
