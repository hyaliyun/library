Set in an indeterminate country this novel is informed by the corrupt politics and the Mafia of Sciascia's experiences in 1970s Sicily. Plot summary The book starts with the murder of District Attorney Vargas, who is prosecuting a high- profile case. The subsequent investigation failing, the police assign the protagonist Inspector Rogas, \\"the shrewdest investigator at the disposal of the police,\\"p4 of 2003 edition. to solve the case. While he is starting his investigation, two judges are killed. After Rogas discovers evidence of corruption surrounding the three government officials, he is encouraged by superiors \\"not to forage after gossip,\\" but to trail the \\"crazy lunatic who for no reason whatever was going about murdering judges.\\"p8 of ibid. This near admission of guilt drives Rogas to seek out those wrongfully convicted by the murdered judges. Rogas finds his likely suspect in Cres, a man who was convicted of attempting to kill his wife. Mrs. Cres accused her husband of trying to kill her by poisoning her rice, which she escaped only because she fed a small portion first to her cat, who died. Rogas concludes that he was probably framed by his wife, and seeks him out, only to find that he has sneaked away from his house. Meanwhile, another district attorney is killed, and eyewitnesses see two young revolutionaries running away from the scene. Rogas, close to finding his man, is demoted, and told to work with the political division to pin the crimes on the revolutionary Left. From this point, Rogas finds Galano, the editor of a revolutionary paper, and has his phone tapped. This leads to Rogas discovering the Minister of Justice at a party with many revolutionary leaders. After this, he and the Minister have a discussion, where the Minister claims he would prefer the revolution, but feels the country is not ready. Following this, Rogas speaks to the President of the Supreme Court, who details a philosophy of justice wherein the court is incapable of error by definition. He also discovers that his suspect, Cres, is in the same complex as the President, but Rogas does not pursue him, hoping that he will kill the President. After Rogas realizes that Cres lives in the complex under a pseudonym and wasn't there to commit a murder, he meets with the Secretary-General of the revolutionary party. Both of them are killed. The book ends with the murder of the Secretary-General being blamed on Rogas. Availability Equal Danger is available in paperback under (New York: NYRB Classics, 2003).

Despite dozens of appearances in television series and theatrical films, he remains best known as the original \\"Chester\\" in the radio version of Gunsmoke. Early career Born in Salt Lake City, Utah, Baer had a circus background, but began his radio career at Utah station KSL. He studied drama at the University of Utah. =Circus= Early in his career, Baer was a circus ringmaster and publicist. He left those roles for military service in World War II. In the 1950s, he had a job training wild animals at Jungleland USA in Thousand Oaks, California. Still later, he served as a docent at the Los Angeles Zoo. =Military= Baer was a member of the United States Army Air Force during World War II, serving in the Pacific Theatre and earning seven service stars. =Radio= Baer in the 1930s served on radio as director of special events for KSL. His first network show was The Whistler, which was soon followed by appearances on Escape (notably narrating \\"Wild Jack Rhett\\" and as the title patriot in an adaptation of Stephen Vincent Benet's \\"A Tooth for Paul Revere\\"), Suspense, Tales of the Texas Rangers (as various local sheriffs), Dragnet, The CBS Radio Workshop, Lux Radio Theater, The Six Shooter, and Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar, to name a few. In 1952, he began playing Chester, the trusty jailhouse assistant to Marshal Matt Dillon on Gunsmoke, eventually ad-libbing the character's full name, \\"Chester Wesley Proudfoot\\" (later changed to \\"Chester Goode\\" in the televised version of the series, which featured Dennis Weaver in the role of Chester). Baer's portrayal of Chester was generally considered his finest and most memorable role, and as he often said, the one he found most fulfilling. Baer also worked as a voice actor on several other radio shows produced by Norman MacDonnell, performing as Pete the Marshal on the situation comedy The Harold Peary Show, as Doc Clemens on Rogers of the Gazette, and as additional characters on Fort Laramie and The Adventures of Philip Marlowe. Other recurring roles included Eb the farm hand on Granby's Green Acres (the radio predecessor to television's Green Acres), Gramps on The Truitts, and Rene the manservant on the radio version of The Count of Monte Cristo. His later radio work included playing Reginald Duffield and Uncle Joe Finneman on the Focus on the Family series Adventures in Odyssey in the 1980s and 1990s. Radio playwright and director Norman Corwin cast Baer as Simon Legree in the 1969 KCET television reading of his 1938 radio play The Plot to Overthrow Christmas. Films and television As an on- camera performer, Baer was recognizable by his distinctive voice, his paunchy appearance, and his balding head. Often he portrayed fussy, bossy, and/or obstinate officials or neighbors. Extended television roles included blustering, by-the-book Mayor Stoner on The Andy Griffith Show, the neighbor Darby on The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet, frequent guest appearances on The Addams Family as insurance man and city commissioner Arthur J. Henson, and in the late 1990s, Miles Dugan on The Young and the Restless. He also appeared as a telephone executive on Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C. Baer guest-starred in the 1950s on NBC's The Dennis Day Show and It's a Great Life, on CBS's Hey, Jeannie!, on ABC's The Law and Mr. Jones with James Whitmore, on the syndicated crime drama Johnny Midnight with Edmond O'Brien, and on the NBC children's western series, Fury with Peter Graves and Bobby Diamond. He made six guest appearances on Perry Mason during the last five seasons of the CBS legal drama, including the role of Edward Farraday in the 1962 episode, \\"The Case of the Captain's Coins,\\" and Willard Hupp in the 1963 episode, \\"The Case of the Bouncing Boomerang.\\" He also appeared on the ABC sitcom Harrigan and Son, on the ABC/Warner Bros. crime drama, The Roaring 20s, on NBC's crime drama Dan Raven starring Skip Homeier, and on the NBC family drama, National Velvet. Baer was cast twice on Walter Brennan's sitcom, The Real McCoys. He also guest-starred on the CBS sitcoms Dennis the Menace, with Jay North, and Angel, starring Annie Farg√©. In the latter, he carried the lead as Dr. Mathews in the single episode \\"The Dentist\\", with Maudie Prickett as his dental secretary. In 1961, Baer guest-starred on Marilyn Maxwell's short-lived ABC drama series, Bus Stop. On April 13, 1962, he appeared, along with Frank Ferguson and Royal Dano in ABC's crime drama Target: The Corruptors in the episode \\"Journey into Mourning\\". He was cast as hotel owner Mr. Kringelein in the 1962 film, Gypsy, opposite Natalie Wood and Rosalind Russell. In 1963, Baer appeared with Charles Aidman and Karl Swenson in the three-part episode \\"Security Risk\\", a story of international blackmail and intrigue, on the CBS anthology series, GE True, hosted by Jack Webb. In 1964, Baer was cast as a sheriff in an episode of Mickey Rooney's short-lived Mickey sitcom, and as a scientist in an Outer Limits episode, \\"Behold, Eck!\\" He was seen in four episodes of Hogan's Heroes and eight episodes of Bewitched in various roles as advertising clients of McMann and Tate. Baer was cast as Horace Greeley, who came to Colorado in 1859 in the Pikes Peak Gold Rush, in the 1965 episode \\"The Great Turkey War\\" of the syndicated series, Death Valley Days. Michael Constantine played Pollock. In the story line, a fledgling Denver copes with vandalism and the theft of turkeys, and Greeley is determined to report the truth about the emerging settlement. In 1967, Baer appeared as General Whitfield on the I Dream of Jeannie episode, \\"Fly Me to the Moon\\". Baer made two appearances on Petticoat Junction. In the 1966 episode, \\"Jury at the Shady Rest\\", he was Bailiff Tucker. Then, in the 1969 episode, \\"The Glen Tinker Caper\\", he was Judge Madison. Later guest appearances included Three for the Road, Three's Company (as a cooking competition judge), The San Pedro Beach Bums, The A-Team, Star Trek: Voyager, The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, The Dukes of Hazzard, Night Court, Newhart, Little House on the Prairie, The Golden Girls, Hazel, and Mad About You. He also played the role of the minister who married J. R. and Sue Ellen Ewing for their second marriage on Dallas. He also made guest appearances on F Troop. Baer's film roles included parts in several live-action Disney features, including Follow Me, Boys! (again as a mayor), The Ugly Dachshund, and Those Calloways. He also appeared in Two on a Guillotine and Dave (as the Senate majority leader). Baer had a featured role in the 1958 war drama The Young Lions, portraying a German officer and friend of Marlon Brando. Baer was especially proud of his brief appearance in a little-known film, White Dog, a powerful story about racism. Baer plays a character seen at first as a kindly grandfather, only to reveal himself as a hateful bigot who has trained the title character to attack black skin. Baer remarked, \\"Often racism, like true evil, presents itself with a smile and a handshake\\". Some 10 years earlier, Baer played a closet racist in a well-known Christmas episode of Bewitched. The episode \\"Sisters at Heart\\" aired on ABC on December 24, 1970, in which he played the role of Mr. Brockway, the owner of a toy-manufacturing firm.Pilato (2001), p. 216.Metz (2007), p. 64. Commercials Baer voiced Ernie Keebler in the cookie commercials before he suffered a stroke in 1997 which affected both speech and movement. He recovered sufficiently to make a handful of appearances at old-time radio conventions in his later years. In the 1980s he dressed in old-time garb as \\"Mr. S\\", one of the company founders, in commercials for S&W; Fine Foods. Personal life In 1946, Baer met and married circus aerialist and bareback rider Ernestine Clarke. They were together for 54 years until her death on August 5, 2000, in Tarzana, California. Baer was a long-term member of St. Nicholas Episcopal Church in Encino, California, where he served in many capacities, including head usher. In 1969, Baer gave the eulogy at the funeral of The Andy Griffith Show castmate Howard McNear. McNear had portrayed Mayberry's Floyd the Barber and Baer had played Mayor Roy Stoner. McNear also portrayed Doc Adams in the radio version of Gunsmoke, often interacting with Baer's character, Chester Proudfoot. On November 11, 2002, following another stroke, Baer was taken to the Motion Picture & Television Country House and Hospital. Eleven days later, at the age of 88, he died there.

They are primarily marine, though some species are known to live in fresh or brackish waters. The various species of this family are known informally as stonefish, stinger, stingfish and ghouls. The most prominent genus of the family is Synanceia, which is sometimes placed in the family Scorpaenidae. Its species are known to have the most potent neurotoxins of all the fish venoms, secreted from glands at the base of their needle-like dorsal fin spines. The vernacular name of the species derives from their behaviour of camouflaging as rocks. The type species of the family is the stonefish, Synanceia verrucosa.

May 1924 Established in 1901, Belsize Motors was based in Clayton, Manchester, England. The company was founded by Marshall & Company and took its name from their Belsize works, where they had built bicycles. Marshall & Company Marshall & Company of Clayton Lane, probably Manchester's first automobile manufacturer, built its first car in 1897. The cars were very similar to the French Hurtu, itself a Benz replica, and were sold badged as Marshalls. Agencies were established in London and Dublin and the car gained a Gold Medal for efficiency at the 1899 London exhibition. A new more modern four-seat model appeared in 1901 with twin-cylinder engine made by Buchet and was the first to carry the Belsize name as the \\"Marshall Belsize\\". In 1903 the company name was changed to Belsize Motors and Engineering. In 1906 this changed again to Belsize Motors Ltd. Before the First World War they were a major player in the United Kingdom's motor industry, employing 1200 people and making up to 50 vehicles a week. A bewildering range of models were made including taxis, commercial vehicles and fire engines with engines of up to 14.5 litre capacity. Post First World War After the First World War they followed a single model policy at first with the 15 hp of 2798 cc but this was joined in 1921 by the Belsize-Bradshaw with a 9 hp 1294 cc V-twin engine made by Dorman and designed by Granville Bradshaw that was partly air-cooled and partly oil-cooled. This gained a reputation for being unreliable and was dropped in 1924. It was replaced by a 1250 cc conventional 4-cylinder model, the 10/20 or RM, and a 1696 cc six the 14/30. The latter was at last an up-to-date car with overhead valves, four-wheel brakes and a four-speed gearbox, but at ¬£415 to ¬£650 it was expensive when compared with the opposition. It was however, too late. The company, which had been in the hands of the receiver since 1923, ceased trading in late 1925. The company also tried to build a 2496 cc, straight eight engine but this probably never got past the prototype stage although it was advertised at ¬£1050.

One type of neckbreaker involves the wrestler slamming an opponent's neck against a part of the wrestler's body, usually the knee, head or shoulder. The other type of neckbreaker is a slam technique in which the wrestler throws an opponent to the ground by twisting the opponent's neck. This also refers to a \\"back head slam\\" where a wrestler drops to the mat while holding an opponent by their neck. Variations = Argentine neckbreaker = The attacking wrestler first places their opponent face-up across their shoulders, as in an Argentine backbreaker rack, and hooks the opponent's head with one hand and their leg with the other. From here, the attacking wrestler throws the legs of the opponent out backwards and drops down to the mat while holding onto the opponent's head, dragging the opponent down with them to drive their back into the ground and the back of the opponent's neck into the shoulder of the attacking wrestler. Used by Manabu Nakanishi as Hercules Cutter. = Arm trap neckbreaker = This move sees an attacking wrestler take hold of an arm of an opponent and then move to a back to back position, so that the opponent's arm hooks across and round the opponent's own head. At this point, the attacking wrestler falls backwards to the ground, forcing the opponent's own arm to drag them to the mat. A straight jacket variation, also known as a cross-armed neckbreaker and double handcuff neckbreaker, exists and sees where the wrestler face their opponent, grab both of their arms and twist around so they have their opponent in a straight jacket hold before finally dropping down to drag the opponent to the floor. Popularized by William Regal as the Regal Cutter. = Corkscrew neckbreaker = Also known as a standing somersault neckbreaker and/or rolling neckbreaker, this move sees the attacking wrestler place the opponent in a three-quarter facelock and perform a somersault forwards, then falls down supine, using the momentum of the flip to twist the opponent's neck and back into the ground. Popularized by Johnny Mundo as the Moonlight Drive. =Diving neckbreaker= The attacking wrestler jumps from a raised platform (usually the second turnbuckle) and grabs an opponent's neck while in midair, thereby taking them down. = Elevated neckbreaker = An elevated neckbreaker refers to any neckbreaker performed on an opponent who is held on an elevated position. Normally a wrestler places the opponent on the turnbuckle so that they face away from the ring. The wrestler takes hold of the opponent by their neck, and from this position performs many variations of the neckbreaker, like falling to a sitting or kneeling position, or just running forward and pulling the opponent away from the corner, and dropping them in a standard neckbreaker. There are also double team variations.  Cradle elevated neckbreaker  In this variation of a muscle buster, which focuses more of the attack on the neck, a wrestler holds the opponent upside-down, with both legs hooked and with the back of the opponent's neck against the wrestler's shoulder, and then drops to a kneeling or sitting position so that the opponent‚Äôs neck hits against the shoulder. It is usually performed against an opponent who is sitting on the top turnbuckle.  Gutwrench elevated neckbreaker  A move in which the attacking wrestler performs a gutwrench and lifts the opponent so that their back rests across one of the wrestler's shoulders. The wrestler then reaches forward with both hands and grabs the opponent under the chin. At this point, the wrestler would drop down to the mat backwards, causing the opponent to drop from an elevated height and land on the back of their neck. = Fireman's carry neckbreaker = This moves sees a wrestler take an opponent across their shoulders in a fireman's carry. Once there the wrestler does a fireman's carry slam, extending the knee adjacent to the opponent's face and neck. The opponent then lands neck-first across the extended knee, snapping their neck in a similar manner to a shoulder neckbreaker..Used by Hirooki Goto and KENTA as the Ushigorashi. = Gator Roll = This neckbreaker variation is based on an amateur wrestling technique that requires the wrestler to capture their opponent in a front facelock, as well trap the arm closest to the wrestler's body in the facelock. The wrestler will then spin their body opposite the opponent, either releasing their opponent or continuing to spin with the hold intact. The wrestler can perform the move from a standing position for more impact or from a kneeling position as a wear-down hold. = Hip toss neckbreaker = A hip toss neckbreaker involves the attacker delivering a hip toss to the opponent, and while the opponent is falling down on their back in mid-air, the attacker grabs the opponent's head and neck to execute a neckbreaker, falling down to the mat with the opponent. = Inverted facelock neckbreaker = This move sees the wrestler stand behind the opponent, bends them backwards, and apply an inverted facelock. The wrestler then drops down to a single knee with the extended knee impacting with the neck of the opponent. =Neckbreaker slam= Also known as a falling neckbreaker, this move sees the attacking wrestler stand back to back with their opponent, then reaches over their shoulder and takes hold of the opponent by their head or neck. The wrestler then falls to their back while maintaining the hold, dragging the opponent down with them to drive their back into the ground. This move is often used by a wrestler who ducks under an attempted attack by the opponent, such as a clothesline, and is thus back to back with their opponent. A jumping variation also exists. Inverted facelock neckbreaker slam This is a move in which a wrestler places their opponent in an inverted facelock and then pivots 180¬∞, catching the opponent's head with their free arm (or both arms) and then dropping down onto their back so that both wrestlers are in a supine position, as in a neckbreaker slam. This move is also known as a \\"Reverse Twist of Fate\\".Used by Reby Sky. = Overdrive = This is a version of a swinging neckbreaker where the attacking wrestler would use a leg rather than hands to perform the twist. With the opponent bent forwards (presumes the opponent is spun around, neck landing on the inside of the wrestler's knee. Inverted overdrive A move described as an inverted overdrive is another version of a swinging neckbreaker, in which the attacking wrestler would use a leg (in this case a knee) rather than hands to perform the twist. In this move a wrestler would first place one knee (the one closest to an opponent) against the base of the opponent's neck, who is leaning forward, while underhooking one of the opponent's arms (the furthest one) before falling backwards down to the mat as the opponent is spun over, landing on the back of the head on the attacking wrestler's knee. = Pumphandle neckbreaker = This version of the neckbreaker sees the attacking wrestler put the opponent in a half nelson pumphandle position, lift them up as one would with a vertical suplex, and then drop down onto one knee as the opponent's neck is sent down onto the other knee. = Shoulder neckbreaker = Better known as a hangman's neckbreaker and also known as a kneeling neckbreaker or a sitout neckbreaker. From a back to back position, the attacking wrestler reaches back and pulls the opponent's head over their shoulder, then drops to a sitting, kneeling, or a split-legged position, causing the back of the opponent's neck to impact on the shoulder of the attacking wrestler. Another version of this move is similar to the neckbreaker slam which sees both wrestlers fall to their backs with the opponent's neck being forced down to the mat instead of onto the attacking wrestler's shoulder. A swinging version also exists. This move was the longtime finisher for \\"Ravishing\\" Rick Rude, who called it the Rude Awakening, and was also the finisher of former WWE wrestler Layla, who referred to the move as The LayOut. Gory neckbreaker Tara setting up the Widow's Peak (gory neckbreaker) on Gail Kim The elevated shoulder neckbreaker, first sees the attacking wrestler lift an opponent into a position where the opponent and the wrestler are back to back with the opponent's head pulled across the shoulder of the attacking wrestler and their legs hooked over the wrestler's legs (the Gory special). From this position the attacking wrestler will drop to a sitting or kneeling position, driving the back of the opponent's neck into the shoulder of an attacking wrestler and the knees of the opponent into the mat. This move can also see the opponent's neck placed over the attacking wrestler's head instead of their shoulder. This move is also famously known as the Widow's Peak, used by Tara. Peyton Royce uses this as her finishing move. =Somersault neckbreaker= Also known as a front flip neckbreaker, the attacking wrestler stands in front of and facing a sitting opponent before running toward them and performing a somersault over them. As the wrestler falls, they grab the opponent by the head or neck, driving the opponent's head backwards to mat with both wrestlers landing on their backs. The maneuver can also be used against a standing opponent, usually when they are bent over. The standing variation can be used as a counter to a vertical suplex or a similar maneuver. Popularized by Marcus Alexander Bagwell as the Blockbuster.  Neck snap  In this variation, the attacking wrestler stands behind and facing a sitting opponent before running toward them and performing a somersault over them. As the wrestler falls, they grab the opponent by the back of the head or neck, pushing it downwards as they drop to the mat. This causes the opponent to jerk their neck backwards, snapping it to the mat. = Swinging neckbreaker = The attacking wrestler applies a front facelock while they place their hands side by side under each other shoulder and uses their free hand to grab hold of the opponent's far hand before swinging over the opponent and down to the ground, in a semi-circular motion, so that both the wrestler and the opponent fall to the ground back-first, causing the back of the opponent's neck to impact on the shoulder of the attacking wrestler. One variation sees the attacking wrestler fall to a seated position, slamming the opponent's neck into the mat between their legs. Another version that sees the attacking wrestler swing inward, throwing the opponent over and to the ground, is often referred to as a whiplash. Eve Torres uses this move, calling it 'The Heart Breaker'. Nikki Cross currently uses this moves; she calls it 'The Purge'.  Whiplash  Also known as a snap swinging neckbreaker, the standard version of this move is in a style similar to that of a swinging neckbreaker, in which the wrestler holds them in a front facelock, keeping their heads side by side under each other shoulder. At this point the attacking wrestler swings inward as they dive to the ground, twisting on the opponent's neck and in the process, driving their neck and shoulders into the ground. An elevated version first sees the attacking wrestler raise an opponent off the ground, often using a suplex lift, to place the opponent's leg on the top ring rope so that they are face-down while the wrestler holds them in a front facelock, keeping their heads side by side under each other shoulder, making the wrestler the only other thing than the ring ropes keeping the opponent off the ground. At this point the attacking wrestler swings inward as they dive to the ground, twisting on the opponent's neck and in the process lifting the opponent's entire body off the rope, driving their neck and shoulders into the ground. A double team version of this move also exists. Another slight variation of the (standing) whiplash move sees the attacking wrestler hook both the opponent's legs (as in a cradle suplex) while keeping both their heads side by side under each other shoulder before then performing the whiplash. Current WWE superstar Elias Samson uses this as his finisher, calling it the Drift Away.

This was followed by a meeting in Dallas with Grudem, John Piper, Wayne House, and others. A subsequent meeting was held in Danvers, Massachusetts; at this meeting, the Danvers Statement on Biblical Manhood and Womanhood was finalized.Roger E. Olson (2004), The Westminster Handbook to Evangelical Theology, Westminster John Knox Press, p. 312.

Turner (2008), Bill Bright & Campus Crusade for Christ: The renewal of Evangelicalism in Postwar America, UNC Press, p. 209. In the late 1990s, CBMW published articles and papers critical of Gender-Neutral Bible translations. CBMW has drawn Christian media attention by expressing concerns about such translations.Glen G. Scorgie, Mark L. Strauss, and Steven M. Voth (2009), The Challenge of Bible Translation: Communicating God's Word to the World, Zondervan, Note 55.Art Toalston, \\"Bible scholars quickly begin debate of new gender-neutral NIV revision ,\\" Baptist Press News, 30 January 2002.

The CBMW opposes same-sex marriage. =The Danvers Statement= The CBMW adopted the Danvers Statement in 1988. It summarizes the CBMW's views on sex and gender roles. The Danvers Statement\\"Core Beliefs: The Danvers Statement on Biblical Manhood and Womanhood.\\" Council on Biblical Manhood and Womanhood (CBMW), 1987. Web: 13 July 2010. has been endorsed or adopted by the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, Southwestern Baptist Seminary, Midwestern Baptist Theological Seminary, Cedarville University, and several independent churches. Randall Balmer says that the Statement was an attempt to \\"staunch the spread of biblical feminism in evangelical circles.\\" Seth Dowland suggests that the authors of the statement \\"framed their position as a clear and accessible reading of Scripture. The Danvers Statement is included in readers such as Evangelicalism and Fundamentalism: A Documentary Reader (NYU Press, 2008). The Danvers Statement recognized the \\"genuine evangelical standing of many who do not agree with all of our convictions.\\"Mary Stewart Van Leeuwen (2010), A Sword Between the Sexes?: C.S. Lewis and the Gender Debates, Brazos Press, p. 76. =1994 statement on abuse= In 1994, at the request of Christians for Biblical Equality (a leading Christian egalitarian organization), three leaders of CBMW (then-President Dr. Ray Ortlund, Mary Kassian, and Wayne Grudem) met with three of the CBE's leaders in Chicago to discuss potential points of agreement. According to Grudem, both sides overcame some misunderstandings about each other. One result of the meeting was an agreement to work on a joint statement on abuse in marriage, which was drafted by the CBMW with feedback from the CBE.\\"Personal Reflections on the History of CBMW and the State of the Gender Debate,\\" CBMW.org, 31 May 2009. However, before it was to be issued, the CBE's board declined to join the statement. The statement was later published in the CBMW's own newsletter (later renamed the Journal for Biblical Manhood and Womanhood). It has subsequently been published on their website and in many of their publications.\\"Statement on Abuse ,\\" CBMW, November 1994. James Beck, declining the joint statement on behalf of the CBE Board of Directors, stated: \\"We do not feel it would be helpful to convene a joint press conference at ETS to issue a joint statement on abuse. CBE‚Äôs position on abuse flows directly out of our theological understanding of Scripture and what it teaches about gender and roles. If we attempt to issue a joint statement with an organization that differs fundamentally from us on this issue, we feel both organizations would be giving very mixed signals to their respective constituencies.\\" Wayne Grudem commented: ‚ÄúWe regret that CBE declined to join us in this statement. If CBE will not join us in something on which we agree (condemning abuse), then I see little hope that they will be willing to join us in constructive dialogue on issues where we disagree. This is unfortunate for the evangelical world.‚Äù =Nashville Statement= On 29 August 2017, CBMW released a manifesto on human sexuality known as the \\"Nashville Statement\\". The Statement expresses support for an opposite-sex definition of marriage, for faithfulness within marriage, for chastity outside marriage, and for a link between biological sex and \\"self-conception as male and female.\\" The Statement sets forth the signatories' opposition to LGBT sexuality, same-sex marriage, polygamy, polyamory, adultery, and fornication. The statement was signed by 150 evangelical leaders, and includes 14 points of belief. The Statement: :* Affirms that God designed marriage as a lifelong union between male and female, and that marriage ‚Äúis meant to signify the covenant love between Christ and his bride the church.‚Äù :* Denies that differences between men and women render the sexes ‚Äúunequal in dignity or worth.‚Äù :* Denies that LGBT identities are consistent with God‚Äôs purposes; :* Affirms that ‚ÄúChrist Jesus has come into the world to save sinners and that through Christ‚Äôs death and resurrection forgiveness of sins and eternal life are available to every person who repents of sin and trusts in Christ alone as Savior, Lord, and supreme treasure.‚Äù Since its release, the Nashville Statement has been endorsed or adopted by the Presbyterian Church in America (PCA), The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, Midwestern Baptist Theological Seminary, Union University, and Cedarville University. Due to perceived homophobia, transphobia, and misogyny, the Nashville Statement has attracted controversy. * The statement was opposed not only by LGBT advocates, but also other conservative Christians, including Evangelicals and Catholics. * An opposing statement was published on 30 August 2017 by Christians United, a group of signatories. Brandan Robertson drafted the Christians United statement, and the Rev. Steve Chalke and other edited it. Signatories included John C. Dorhauer, the General Minister and President of the United Church of Christ; Yvette Flunder; and Jayne Ozanne. * Nashville mayor Megan Barry stated \\"[the] so-called 'Nashville statement' is poorly named and does not represent the inclusive values of the city & people of Nashville\\". * The Episcopal Bishop of Central Florida, Gregory Brewer, described the statement as \\"tone deaf to the nuances of Jesus\\". * Jesuit priest James Martin, replied to the Nashville Statement with his own set of affirmations and denials, beginning with \\"I affirm: That God loves all LGBT people\\".

The dances bearing the name sl√§ngpolska can be divided into two major types. The first type is for two or four people, and is one of the sixteenth-note versions of the polska. The dances of this type usually have in common that they are danced on the spot, either during parts of the dance or during the entire dance. Focus is on different holds and on the divisions between them, and these divisions could be responsible for the name sl√§ngpolska. A typical sl√§ngpolska of this type could consist of two basic set positions: one in which the couple is spinning around one another while holding crossed hands outstretched with centrifugal force, the other in which the couple is spinning around one another in a closer position while holding the partner's shoulders and arms. The division between the two parts of the dance is then made by e.g. both dancers spinning out from their hold and then spinning once on their own with a clap of hands, followed by a returning to the hold. A common dance step consists of four steps distributed in the following way over three beats: one long, two short, one long (\\"one...-two-and-three...\\").Sl√§ngpolska, video Beat 1, 2 and 3 have almost equal stress and length, which also is reflected in the corresponding music. A very free variant of this sl√§ngpolska type, consisting of walking through the room with different holds and turning on the spot with different holds and the same walking steps, could just as well be danced to or time music, as do the related Norwegian dances gangar and bonde, but in Sweden it is most commonly danced to time music. The second type of sl√§ngpolska is more related to other polskas than to the above sl√§ngpolska type, in that the couples move counterclockwise around the periphery of the room, and choose to do so with or without rotation clockwise around an internal axis, one full rotation for each measure. The music and dances in this category share a high tempo, giving a \\"tossing\\" feeling, which is often reflected in the rotation part of the dance in the form of a jump or a lift as part of the step recurring in every measure until the couple decides to dance without rotation for a while. The name has been used from midwest Sweden (V√§rmland) to the north of Sweden, and there is a large diversity in music and dance character, since the name mainly refers to the tempo. Both in midwest and north Sweden there are examples of dances which can both be danced as a slower \\"polska\\" and as a faster \\"sl√§ngpolska\\" with retention of the basic steps.

Early life and career  Makiguchi was born in the small village of Kashiwazaki, Niigata Prefecture, Japan, in 23 July 1871 (Lunar calendar date on 6 June). Adopted by the Makiguchi family, he moved to Hokkaido, Japan's northernmost island, at the age of 14. Working his way through school, he graduated from Sapporo Normal School (today's Hokkaido University of Education). First employed as an assistant teacher at a primary school affiliated with his alma mater, he later taught high school and served as a dormitory superintendent. Makiguchi's novel approach to geography appears in his book Jinsei Chirigaku (A Geography of Human Life) published in 1903 when he was 32. In this work, Makiguchi rejects the prevailing approach to the study of geography, based on the rote memorization of facts and place names, instead advocating a rational understanding of geography based on the relationship of the individual, human activity and industrial advancement to nature. Although recognized as an able teacher, Makiguchi's uncompromising attitude toward authorities created problems. His clashes with officials of the Ministry of Education, school inspectors, ward assemblymen, city councilmen, and top officials of the city of Tokyo were frequent and resulted in frequent transfers between schools.Murata, Kiyoaki. Japan's New Buddhism: An Objective Account of Soka Gakkai. New York and Tokyo: Weatherhill, 1969. pp. 73-74 After moving to Tokyo, he served as principal in a succession of six primary schools, from 1913 to 1932. During those years, he devoted much consideration to the relationship between life and education, developing his theories on s≈çka or the creation of value, the happiness of the individual, the prosperity of society at large, and their interrelationships in practice. In June 1928, Makiguchi embraced the philosophy and practice of Nichiren Buddhism, having been introduced by Tokyo business high school principal Sokei Mitani. His close friend and disciple Josei Toda followed his Buddhist conversion in 1930.  Educational reformer  His aforementioned work Jinsei Chirigaku (A Geography of Human Life), predates the academic study of geography at the Imperial Universities of Kyoto and Tokyo in 1907 and 1911, respectively, and pioneered a new approach to teaching geography in Japan. Written between the First Sino-Japanese War and the Russo-Japanese War, the work presents human geography as a subject for both formal and nonformal learning to advance an understanding of cultural differences shaping and shaped by the relationship between human activity and its natural environment. While \\"Japanese geographers of the time were chiefly concerned with describing the physical features of the earth,\\"Murata, p72 Makiguchi was arguably the first to discuss human geography as a system of knowledge correlating location theory and spatial distribution of human phenomena with economic, social and political geographies. In Makiguchi's words, \\"it is through our spiritual interaction with the earth that the characteristics that we think of as human are ignited and nurtured within us.\\"Makiguchi, Tsunesaburo. A Geography of Human Life. Ed. by Dayle M. Bethel. Caddo Gap Press, 2002, p25 In this work, Makiguchi also formulated the concept of humanitarian competition as an approach to international relations, writing that: \\"The important thing is the setting of a goal of well being and protection of all people, including oneself but not at the increase of self-interest alone. In other words, the aim is the betterment of others and in doing so, one chooses ways that will yield personal benefit as well as benefits to others. It is a conscious effort to create a more harmonious community life.\\"Makiguchi. A Geography of Human Life. p.286 In response to problems throughout the education system that resulted from the Meiji government's adoption of the Imperial Rescript, Makiguchi published the first volume of S≈çka Ky≈çikugaku Taikei (The System of Value- Creation Pedagogy) together with his close friend and disciple J≈çsei Toda on 18 November 1930.Kumagaki, Kazunori. \\"Value-Creating Pedagogy and Japanese Education in the Modern Era,\\" The Journal of Oriental Studies, vol. 10 (2000) Special Issue, p31 The date was later adopted as the Founding Day of S≈çka Gakkai. The four-volume work, published over a period of five years, sets forth his thoughts on education and proposals for systemic reform. Rather than education serving the state, as embodied in the Imperial Rescript on Education, Makiguchi proposed a student-centered education with the purpose of ensuring the happiness of the learner.Kumagai, pp32-34 He also proposed the creation of an educational system comprising a partnership of school, home and community. In this system, a child would spend half a day in school and the other half in apprenticeships and other types of work activities at home and in the community befitting the nature and needs of the child. Makiguchi felt that implementing such a system would change bored, apathetic learners into eager, self-directed students. \\"Makiguchi developed a theory of value that combined the idea of happiness as the goal of life with that of value as something that can be created. ... In value-creating pedagogy the main point of education is to aim for a happy life and develop the ability and attitude required to create value.\\"Kumagai, p41 =Theory of value, value-creation and happiness= Soka philosophy and soka educational theory essentially arose out of Makiguchi's imperative to reform the Japanese education system which increasingly served to support the country's imperialist war efforts against its Asian neighbors. His conceptualizations of value, value creation and happiness thus frame his educational theory. He distinguished value as that which emerges or is created from the relationship or interaction between self and object; truth, not a value but an object whose existence cannot be created but revealed or discovered; the value of beauty, a measure of sensory impact on aesthetic awareness; the value of gain, a measure of holistic advancement in life; and the value of good, a measure of contribution to social or public well-being. For Makiguchi, value is determined by \\"whether something adds to or detracts from, advances or hinders, the human condition.\\" Makiguchi's theory of value emphasizes a \\"participatory inter-connectedness of individuals through community engagement\\" that meaningfully enhances the well-being of both the individual and society through the transformational process of pursuing value creation. \\"Human life is a process of creating value,\\" Makiguchi wrote, \\"and education should guide us towards that end. Thus, educational practices should serve to promote value creation.\\" Founder of S≈çka Ky≈çiku Gakkai The publisher of Makiguchi's S≈çka Ky≈çikugaku Taikei, volume one, in 18 November 1930 was S≈çka Ky≈çiku Gakkai (Ââµ ‰æ° Êïô ËÇ≤ Â≠¶ ‰ºö; English: Value-Creation Education Society), a society of reform-minded educators and teachers that over the course of the 1930s grew more inclusive of broader social reform and became today's Soka Gakkai organization. His gradual shift in focus from educational to religious means of social reform may be traced to several factors, including the personal tragedies of the deaths of four of his children and the increasing military dominance in every facet of society, in tandem with his embrace of Nichiren's philosophy. In Nichiren's teachings Makiguchi had found support for his theory of value-creation and a world view consistent with his aims of educational reform and social betterment centered on addressing the subjective realities of the individual. According to Brian Victoria, Makiguchi had an \\"absolute faith in Nichiren and his teachings [...]. Faith in any other religious teaching was, by definition, an evil practice that had to be eradicated. In other words, despite postwar SGI claims to the contrary, Makiguchi had no sympathy for ‚Äòfreedom of religion‚Äô for anyone other than himself and those who strictly adhered to his sectarian viewpoint.\\"  Wartime arrest  During World War II, Makiguchi opposed Japan's military government's attempts to impose the doctrine of State Shinto through strict control of religions and thoughts inimical to its war effort. While there was some debate as to whether Makiguchi's actions were in direct opposition to the war, it is clear that \\"his outspoken criticism of the prevailing belief system represents an implicit and explicit protest against an extreme abuse of the educational process for militarist purposes.\\" In 1943, due to his refusal to accept the talisman and support the war, he was arrested and imprisoned as a \\"thought criminal\\" together with J≈çsei Toda and 20 senior leaders of S≈çka Ky≈çiku Gakkai for violating the Peace Preservation Law revised in 1941 and under which tens of thousands were arrested. Already in his seventies, Makiguchi was subjected to harsh interrogation as the authorities sought to force him to recant his beliefs. Most of the other imprisoned members of Soka Kyoiku Gakkai caved to the extreme interrogation tactics, however Makiguchi never yielded, continuing to assert the value of freedom of religion as a fundamental human right. On 18 November 1944, Makiguchi died in prison of malnutrition.https://www.tmakiguchi.org/biography.html  Legacy  A secular network of Soka schools around the world, including several independent secondary schools, and two universities (S≈çka University of Japan and Soka University of America) were established by Daisaku Ikeda based on Makiguchi's pedagogy.\\"The fairly recent growth in the internationalization of Soka education,\\" writes Paul Sherman, specialist in global citizenship education in higher education, \\"is a reflection of Makiguchi's ideas on the important function of education in human development, in that he believed a key purpose of education was to cultivate global-minded individuals who could be empathetically engaged with the world, while at the same time maintain their roots at the local community level.\\" Though contemporaneously obscure in Japanese scholarship of the 1930s,Makiguchi's value-creating system of education has attracted the attention of educators around the world. His S≈çka Ky≈çikugaku Taikei has been translated into English, Portuguese, French and Vietnamese. In Brazil, Makiguchi's theory of education based on value-creation has been sponsored in 55 schools and introduced in 1,103 classrooms to more than 340,000 students.de Melo Silva, Dilma, \\"Makiguchi Project in Action‚ÄîEnhancing Education for Peace,\\" The Journal of Oriental Studies, vol. 10 (2000), p62 Makiguchi is remembered to this day by members of the Soka Gakkai in Japan and the Soka Gakkai International (SGI) around the world. During morning and evening prayers, members take a moment to express gratitude to the first three presidents of Soka Gakkai: Tsunesabur≈ç Makiguchi (president from 1930-1944), J≈çsei Toda (president from 1951‚Äì1958), and Daisaku Ikeda (president from 1960‚Äì1979, honorary president from 1979 to the present and president of SGI from 1975 to the present) In film The 1973 film Ningen kakumei (The Human Revolution), directed by Toshio Masuda, dramatizes the educational career of Makiguchi, his relationship with Josei Toda, and his WWII imprisonment for his beliefs during which he died.

His most productive literary period was the interwar period of the 1920s and 1930s. He was much admired by the upper echelons of society and the artistic avant-garde who made him a cult favorite. He has been categorized as an early Modernist and Imagist. Morand was a graduate of the Paris Institute of Political Studies, preparing him for a diplomatic career, and also attended Oxford University. A member of the upper class and married into wealth, he held various diplomatic posts and traveled widely. He was typical of those in his social group who enjoyed lives of privilege and entitlement, adhering to the inevitability and desirability of class distinction. Morand espoused a reflexive adherence to racial, ethnic and anti-Semitic ideologies. His intellectual influences included the writing of Friedrich Nietzsche, Oswald Spengler, and the author of a treatise on the superiority of the white race, Joseph Arthur de Gobineau. During World War II, he pledged allegiance to the French Vichy regime, and became a government functionary, and Nazi collaborator. He served as Vichy ambassador in Romania and Switzerland during World War II. He was a patron and inspirational figure for the Hussards literary movement, which opposed existentialism. Morand made four bids for admission to the prestigious Acad√©mie fran√ßaise and was finally accepted in 1968, over the protest of Charles de Gaulle. Early years Source material indicates that Morand was born in Russia to French parents who subsequently moved to Paris. Morand's father, Eug√®ne Morand was a playwright and painter. The elder Morand was a curator at the Louvre and served as director of the √âcole des Arts D√©coratifs. The Morand home was a gathering place for the social elite and those notable in the arts and literature. Jules Massenet, composer of popular operas of the era, sculptor Auguste Rodin and writer Oscar Wilde were guests. As a youth Morand was introduced to such luminaries as the actress Sarah Bernhardt, and poet St√©phane Mallarm√©. The multi-faceted writer and diplomat Jean Giraudoux was his tutor and became a lifelong friend. His father allied himself with those who believed in the innocence of Alfred Dreyfus, yet maintained a policy of banning Jews from the Morand home.Winegarten, Renee, \\"Who was Paul Morand?\\" book review, \\"Paul Morand: Fancy Goods/Open All Night, translated by Ezra Pound, preface by Marcel Proust, retrieved August 22, 2012Paul Morand biography, Cengage, Gale, Short Story Criticism, 1996, retrieved August 23, 2012 Morand, a man of fin de si√®cle sensibilities, believed in the credo of \\"art for art's sake.\\" He was ingrained with a deep pessimism, influenced by his father's cautionary advice to \\"be always distrustful\\". He was an intellectual proponent of Friedrich Nietzsche, and Oswald Spengler espousing the philosophers‚Äô belief in the decadence and decline of civilization. For Morand, class distinctions spoke to the natural order of a civilized society and he subscribed to theories based on the superiority/inferiority of race. He was influenced by the writing of Joseph Arthur de Gobineau, an aristocrat, who presented his case for the superiority of the white race in an essay written in 1853, \\"Essay on the Inequality of the Human Races\\".\\"Essay on the Inequality of the Human Races\\", retrieved August 23, 2012 Morand was sent to study at Oxford University. In 1913, he was appointed cultural attach√© to the French Embassy in London. His sojourn in England brought him into acquaintance with the prominent members of British society and aristocracy. Morand often dined at the H√¥tel Ritz in the company of Marcel Proust and his confidante, the Princess H√©l√®ne Soutzo. The Princess, born H√©l√®ne Chrissoveloni, was the daughter of a prominent Greek merchant banker. At the time she made Morand's acquaintance, she was married to an aristocrat of Greek-Romanian extraction, Prince Dimitri Soutzo. Morand and Princess Soutzo had an extended romantic liaison; she divorced her husband in 1924 and married Morand in 1927.\\"Proust's Last Infatuation\\", retrieved August 25, 2012  World War I  Morand served briefly in the military prior to the outbreak of World War I, but managed to avoid active service in the hostilities and was assigned to the reserve corps. An avid, active sportsman, he had failed his medical exam as unfit for service. Many attributed this exemption to the intervention and influence held by his mistress, Princess Elena Su»õu (n√©e Chrissoveloni, 5 Feb 1879 in Gala»õi - 26 Feb 1975 in Paris), the wife of the Romanian general and military attach√© Prince Dimitri Su»õu (Greek: Soutzos, Romanian: Su»õu or Sutzu).http://ghika.org/Familles/Soutzo/Sutzu_01.pdf His wealth allowed Morand to travel and indulge his interests in fast cars, fine horses and women. During the war years, Morand's life of privilege continued unabated. He frequented the theatres, attended and gave lavish entertainments, and dined in the best restaurants. He spent 1914 to 1918 living alternately in England, Rome, Madrid and Paris. Morand cultivated the Dada and avant-garde art movements. It was in 1917 that he met Jean Cocteau at the premiere of Cocteau's ballet \\"Parade\\", whose musical score had been composed by Erik Satie and its production design executed by Pablo Picasso. He wrote of his political sympathies during World War I in a journal he kept in 1916 and 1917, which appeared in a volume that was not published until 1948. Morand, like his compatriot, French politician Joseph Caillaux, was committed to effectuating a conciliatory relationship with the Germans and, in essence, the negotiation of a separate peace.  Interwar period  His post-war life continued much as it had. A tradition of \\"Saturday dinners\\" had been established with Cocteau and his circle, congregating at the newly in vogue jazz milieu of the Paris cabaret, \\"Le Boeuf sur le Toit\\". Morand and the couturiere Coco Chanel traveled in the same social circles and he became her friend and confidante.Vaughan, Hal, Sleeping with the enemy: Coco Chanel's Secret War. Alfred A. Knopf, 2011, p. 41 In 1925, Morand was posted in the French legation in Bangkok, Thailand. He used this posting as a jumping off point for extensive travel. He documented his perceptions, filtered through a mindset of the privileged European who lived to the fullest a life of entitlement. He disparaged the cultures of countries through which his travels took him. He had strong theories on race, decrying that the world was becoming a \\"foul age of the half-caste\\". He derided democracy, bemoaning that Europe had become impotent, in his eyes, \\"egotistical, democratic, divided.\\" Morand had a brief stint in the French cinema. During this period, he met 18-year-old actress Josette Day (later \\"Belle\\" in Cocteau's film La Belle et la B√™te), who became his mistress. Morand had been hired to collaborate with Alexandre Arnoux on a scenario for a proposed project, Don Quichotte, to star the opera singer Feodor Chaliapin. The French version of the film Don Quichotte was reviewed by The New York Times upon its opening in New York. Herbert L. Matthews, writing for the newspaper, criticized the Morand/Arnoux script but called it \\"an admirable film\\", attributable to the talents of director G. W. Pabst and its lead player Chaliapin.Matthews, Herbert L, review of Don Quichotte, The New York Times, April 23, 1933, retrieved August 24, 2012 Many were then fleeing Nazi Germany, with a proportion of those in the arts, many of them Jewish, taking refuge in France. Morand saw these exiles as unwanted interlopers. He penned a veiled, anti-Semitic, \\"xenophobic diatribe\\" titled \\"France la Doulce\\", replete with quaint, antique vocabulary. He demonized these emigrants (i.e., Jews) as \\"pirates\\" whether naturalized or not, called them \\"scum\\". In October 1933, he wrote an article for a new weekly periodical edited by Henri Massis, who had a long-standing alliance with the anti-Semitic, political monarchists, Action Fran√ßaise. Morand alerted the French populace to the peril that was forthcoming: :\\"At this time, every country except ours is killing its vermin.... Don't let us leave Hitler to pride himself on being the only person to undertake the moral rehabilitation of the West.\\"  World War II  In August 1939, Morand was sent to London, assigned to a responsible post at the French embassy. In a prime position to ally himself with Charles de Gaulle and the Free French Forces, Morand instead deserted his post. He relocated to Vichy and swore allegiance to the Vichy government. Such a defection was in keeping with Morand's ideology, his long-term admiration for Philippe P√©tain, and his association with the daughter of Pierre Laval, the Comtesse de Chambrun. There were dilemmas, however; as president of the film censorship board, Morand had to ban for moral reasons a film for which he had written the script. He divided his time between Paris and Vichy, moving freely between the occupied and collaborationist sections of France. In 1941, he rallied against the hedonism of the French, championing the virtues of patriotism, vitality, and the [Nietzschean] \\"feeling of life\\" demonstrated by the Nazis. Morand and his pro-German wife welcomed into their Paris mansion the artists sanctioned and lauded by the Nazi regime, such as Arno Breker, Hitler's favorite sculptor, and Ernst J√ºnger, whose novels glorified warfare. In 1943, the Vichy government appointed Morand ambassador to Romania. His tenure in Bucharest earned him no diplomatic distinction. He spent his time using his stature to benefit his own interests and plunder the embassy. During air raids over Bucharest in 1944, Morand fled. He was subsequently transferred to Bern, Switzerland, where he and his wife remained after the war.  Later life  After the war, he was charged with collaboration with the enemy, but suffered no penalty other than having his government pension revoked. He spent the following years residing in Switzerland, Tangiers, the H√¥tel de Crillon, and his wife's opulent Paris home. Morand became an inspirational figure for a literary group who espoused their views in the anti-existentialist journal The Hussards, founded by his friend Roger Nimier. Morand had sought election into the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise in 1939 and 1941, and both times his bid was denied. He attempted to achieve the prestigious distinction again in 1958. This third attempt illuminated the record of his wartime activities and generated an organized opposition to his membership. Charles de Gaulle vetoed his admission. Morand ultimately was granted membership in 1968 but was denied the formal ceremonies that traditionally accompanied the investiture of new members, and de Gaulle refused to receive him at the Elys√©e Palace. It is believed that Morand never reassessed his elitist worldview and political ideology, resolutely retaining his mindset until the end of his life. In interviews, he consistently contrived to evade any references to World War II. It is further posited that he and his wife had used their position to make some attempts to aid Jewish friends but that it was done to dramatise the influence and power they held in the Nazi regime, rather than a demonstration of their humanity. He never came to recognize the suffering that millions endured under totalitarianism.  Legacy  Ezra Pound, who was then living in Paris, translated his first volume of short stories, titled Tendre Stocks, into English. Marcel Proust supplied the preface. With the publication of two volumes of poetry, Lampes √† arc (Arc-Lamps) and Feuilles de temp√©rature, (Temperature Records), he gained attention and praise that garnered renewed interest in his earlier work. His output was prolific in the interwar period of the 1920s and 1930s, and tapered off during World War II. Morand made four trips to New York City between 1925 and 1929. He attended soirees which featured such American cultural notables as Carl Van Vechten, F. Scott Fitzgerald and his wife Zelda, Louise Bryant and her future husband, diplomat William Bullitt.Van Vechten, Carl, The Splendid Drunken Twenties: Selections from the Daybooks 1922-1930, University of Illinois Press, 2003, p. 159, In 1930, Morand published his observations of the Manhattan scene in New York. Morand explains that he wrote strictly from the viewpoint of the foreign visitor for the foreign reader; he \\"followed no other method of telling about New York than to show what pleased me.\\" http://www.city-journal.org, Lukacs, John, \\"How Certain Foreigners Saw New York\\", retrieved August 24, 2012 Reviewing the book, one critic noted that Morand \\"keeps on repeating the contemporary bromide that ‚Äòthe Jews own New York, the Irish run it, and the Negroes enjoy it...Italians hardly can be assimilated.‚Äô\\" Speakeasies, Morand had concluded: \\"I can not think of anything sadder.\\" New York City's theatre/entertainment district, the Broadway thoroughfare and its central hub Times Square, suggested to Morand an apocalyptic future: :\\"[Broadway is] a profanation of everything of music, of art, of love, of colors. Here I have a complete vision of the end of the world.\\" In spite of his eccentric summations on New York culture, Morand expressed his appreciation for the city ‚Äî concurrently disclosing his admiration for the fascist leadership of Benito Mussolini: :\\"I love New York because it is the greatest city in the universe...the only people who after the war [World War I] went on building...besides Italy, who do not demolish but construct.\\" Morand was considered a writer of cosmopolitan sensibility who created vivid scenarios of life amid the dislocations ‚Äî and what some saw as the moral disintegration ‚Äî of post-World War I Europe. The writing was fast-paced, noteworthy for its wit and mastery of descriptive style. The stories reflected an urban ennui and disillusionment felt by those leading lives fueled by intense emotions and hedonistic self-indulgence.Georges Lema√Ætre wrote in 1938: \\"Beyond any doubt Morand is the most typical representative and interpreter of French literature today...His defects and merits, are they not the defects and merits of the world today...\\" Supporters and enthusiasts of Morand, Cocteau and Andr√© Breton appreciated his \\"spiteful humour and surreal urban poetry, and aphoristic prose.\\" French critics praised his descriptive facility with words, leading them to categorize him as a \\"modernist\\", and \\"imagist\\".Thompson, Ian. Tender Shoots by Paul Morand - review. The Guardian. 8 January 2012. Retrieved 23 August 2012. In 1945, Morand traveled to St. Moritz at the request of Coco Chanel who had enlisted him to write her memoirs. The result was The Allure of Chanel, a slim volume promoted as a conversation between the author and his subject. Morand's post-World War II literary output concentrated on historical novellas. He devised exotic locales and historical events as metaphors for contemporary politics ‚Äî \\"decoding the past as a link to the present.\\" The plots, replete with counterrevolutionaries, nobility unjustly victimized, highlighted collaborationist heroes seeking redemption. In these works Morand was making a case for himself; his fictional characters serving as proxies for an apologist justification of his own wartime activity. \\"...Many of Morand's historical figures...[can be] likened to a comedian, accidentally thrust into the unfolding drama of history...a comedy of errors...[the characters] merely symbols.\\" Parfait de Saligny appeared in 1946. La Flagellant de S√©ville, 1946, draws parallels between the Napoleonic wars and the Nazi occupation of Europe. La Folle amoureuse, Montociel: le rajah aux grandes Indes, were published in 1947.Van Noort, Philpot Kimberly, Paul Morand: The Politics and Practice of Writing in Post-War France, Editions Rodopi, 2011, p. 51-62, Not all critics were laudatory. While acknowledging his masterful use of language, they cited the lack of substance in his observations and tendency towards generalizations. It was said his characters were not fully realized portraits but presented to the reader as exaggerated personages, crafted for effect. Over time, critical appraisal of Morand's work has undergone revision. While recognized for his technique, the content of his work has been faulted for its lack of insightful analysis of a people in cultural context, instead relying on generalizations and stereotype. His work speaks to the :\\"marked insistence on reinforcing preconceptions about national characteristics...It \\"conveys not just a failure of humane sympathy but a political outlook that posits the Spenglerian collapse of Western civilization into chaos.\\" Morand's writing disclosed his \\"nostalgia for authority and order\\" which in his view, was under threat by the insistent forces of democracy.  Death  Morand died in Paris on 24 July 1976, at the age of 88.

Suradji's victims, ranging in age between 11 and 30, were strangled after being buried in the ground up to their waists as part of a ritual. He buried his victims in a sugarcane plantation near his home, with their heads facing his house, which he believed would give him extra power. Background Ahmad Suradji lived in Medan, the capital of Indonesia's North Sumatra province. He worked as a cattle-breeder and as a dukun, a class of shaman reputed to possess supernatural powers. Suradji's clientele were often women seeking his guidance on how to find good fortune or maintain their beauty. According to Suradji, his deceased father visited him in a dream in 1986 and commanded him to murder 70 women as part of a black magic ritual. Death His three wives, who were sisters, were also arrested for assisting in the murders and helping him hide the bodies. One of his wives, Tumini, was tried as his accomplice and was sentenced to death before it was reduced to life imprisonment. He was sentenced to death by firing squad and executed on 10 July 2008.http://www.nbcnews.com/id/25632189/ns/world_news- asia_pacific/t/indonesia-executes-man-murders/ Murders On 24 April 1997, 21-year-old Sri Kemala Dewi asked a 15-year-old rickshaw puller named Andreas to take her to \\"Datuk\\". She informed him to keep it a secret and never requested to be picked up. Three days later, Dewi's naked and decomposing body was found in a sugarcane field by a man and was later dug up by a group of people who then called the police. Andreas reported to the police and Dewi's family that he had dropped her off at Suradji's house three days earlier, and so police visited Suradji for confrontation. Although he denied any links with Dewi's killing, police found Dewi's handbag, dress and bracelet in his home. He was later arrested on 30 April 1997. During interrogation, Suradji slowly confessed to Dewi's murder but also revealed that he had killed up to 42 girls in the same fashion and an excavation process had to be carried out in the sugarcane field where Dewi's body was located. Throughout the process, 42 bodies had been found with some being so decomposed to the point where they were unidentifiable. He told police that he had a dream in 1986 in which his father's ghost directed him to drink the saliva of 70 dead young women so that he could become a mystic healer. Suradji thought that it would take him too long to encounter 70 dead women singly and so he took up the initiative to kill. As a sorcerer, or dukun, women came to him for spiritual advice for such things like making themselves more beautiful or richer or so Suradji could cast a spell on their spouses so they'll never have an affair. He would take them into a sugarcane field and bury them up to their waist, claiming it was part of the ritual. He would then strangle them until they were dead and proceed to drink their saliva. After, he would strip the clothes from their bodies to accelerate decomposition and bury them back into the ground with their heads pointing toward his house.

Its main source is located in the Los Buellis Hills slightly west of Felter Road. Berryessa Creek has many tributaries, including Piedmont Creek, Calera Creek, and Penitencia Creek. In the summer, Berryessa Creek is mostly dry except in Milpitas, where much of its water comes from urban runoff and tributaries. In winter, however, the creek can flood very high and pose a hazard for surrounding residences. The creek was named after a member of the prominent Basque‚ÄìSpanish Berreyesa family: Nicolas Berreyesa, a Californio settler granted the Rancho Milpitas in 1834. Course Berryessa Creek begins in the Los Buellis Hills near Felter Road. Several different forks of the creek gradually merge until Berryessa Creek becomes a single stream at Piedmont Road. The various forks are located mostly in undeveloped hills owned by a local water department and are used for cattle grazing. After crossing under Piedmont Road, Berryessa Creek forms the northern boundary of Berryessa Creek Park in the Berryessa neighborhood. At Morrill Avenue, Berryessa Creek becomes a straightened ditch. It then winds its way north into Milpitas. In Milpitas, Piedmont Creek, Arroyo de los Coches, and Calera Creek, respectively, dump into Berryessa Creek. The large creek then ends at Lower Penitencia Creek, which continues on to merge with Coyote Creek near the Newby Island Landfill at Dixon Landing Road, and then into the San Francisco Bay. Tributaries Berryessa Creek has several tributaries that are primarily from Milpitas. Some of the tributaries are described below. =Piedmont Creek= Piedmont Creek has three or four forks beginning at private ranch properties in the eastern foothills in Milpitas. The south fork is from government property leased to cattle ranching companies and is used to graze cattle. The north fork also originates in the eastern hills but instead begins at the Silvas' private ranch. At Piedmont Road, the two forks of Piedmont Creek becomes an underground stream that winds under residences and dumps into the Berryessa Creek in an industrial zone. The entire length of the creek is only about three miles long. =Arroyo de los Coches= Arroyo de los Coches, alternatively called Los Coches Creek, is a seasonal stream from the Milpitas hills. Named in the 1800s by the Spanish, its name means \\"Creek of the Wild Pigs.\\" (Los Coches Creek still has many wild pigs.) The creek begins at the former JMP Ranch that is now about to be developed into 17 single-family homes. It passes by Spring Valley Homes and travels parallel to Vista Ridge Road. Now in Ed R. Levin County Park, the creek keeps going west and then winds downhills with Calaveras Road by its side. After crossing Piedmont Road, which marks the boundary between the urban and rural sections of Milpitas, the creek turns into a straightened ditch and continues to travel parallel to Calaveras Road. After going under Interstate 680, it merges with Berryessa Creek. =Calera Creek= Calera Creek begins at north Ed R. Levin County Park from a number of springs from the west side of the Monument Peak ridge. It rushes down steep hillsides at about 45 degrees. The creek then reaches the urban parts of Milpitas as it passes by the historic Higuera Adobe. As an artificially created ditch, it then traverses through a number of housing developments and passes Milpitas High School. Calera Creek then merges with Berryessa Creek. Calera Creek used to be a prime spot for native rainbow trout fishing. When it was converted into a ditch in the 1960s to prevent flooding the newly constructed housing developments, the creek lost almost all of its fish . The Santa Clara Valley Water District now places several plaques at the banks of Berryessa Creek informing passers-by about the ecology and environment of the creek.

Since its inception, the choir has included children from Uganda, Kenya, Rwanda, South Africa, Nigeria, and Ghana. Many of the children have lost one or both parents to AIDS and other poverty-related diseases, and all of them are victims of extreme poverty. The choir is a Christian organization and one of its principles (from its web site) is \\"instilling Christian principles through teaching and leading by example.\\" Background The choir was founded in 1984 by Ray Barnett. Barnett was traveling in war-torn Uganda when he gave a small boy a ride from his destroyed home to a safer village. During their journey, the child did what he knew how to do best ‚Äì he sang. That simple song of dignity and hope became the catalyst for a program that has changed the lives of thousands of children. From there the African Children's Choir was born. Rallying support from the west, Barnett conducted the first tour, in 1984. As the organization grew so did the needs of the children. The choir began selecting Kenyan children in 1990. By 2002, the first South African choir toured in North America. Music for Life has now facilitated over forty tours through the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom. The choir serves as the main fund raising branch for its parent organization, Music For Life Institute, with proceeds from the choir's work used to fund Christian education and relief efforts for African children affected by poverty and disease. Performances The choir has released a number of albums and DVDs over the years, and has performed at major events and venues around the world. The choir has appeared at the British House of Commons and the Pentagon, at some of the world's most prestigious halls, including the Royal Albert Hall, the London Palladium, the International Club of Berlin and the Palais des Beaux Arts in Brussels, Belgium. They also performed with Christian music legend, Bill Gaither in his Gaither Homecoming series. In 2005, the choir achieved increased worldwide visibility through several highly publicized performances. They performed at the Live 8 concert in London with Mariah Carey, and were featured on The Tonight Show and The Ellen DeGeneres Show. In 2006, they performed at an event for one.org and before the United Nations for its UNAIDS summit. In December 2006, they made a second appearance on The Tonight Show. The choir has also recorded songs for the soundtracks of major motion pictures including Oprah Winfrey's Beloved, Hotel Rwanda and Blood Diamond. The African Children's Choir currently has two choirs on tour in the United Kingdom and Canada. These Choirs are composed of children from Uganda. The choir sang during the Canadian Idol season 4 finale. On 25 April 2007, they performed as part of American Idol's Idol Gives Back, singing \\"You Raise Me Up\\" with Josh Groban. They also performed on the finale of American Idol season 6 at the Kodak Theatre on 23 May 2007. The African Children's choir was featured in broadcasts and podcasts celebrating 2007 World Party Day. In 2007, the choir performed with the band Dispatch for three sold-out concerts at Madison Square Garden in New York. The African Children's Choir toured in Australia at the Queensland Youth Symphony at Queensland Music Festival.1999 The choir appears on Michael W. Smith's 2008 album A New Hallelujah, which was live recorded during a worship concert in Houston. In 2008, the choir sang for former President George W. Bush and recorded with Michael W. Smith. On 29 September 2009, the choir celebrated their 25th Anniversary at the Hotel Vancouver in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, where the choir held their first performance 25 years before. Special guests at the event included Bob Geldof who used to live in Vancouver where he used to work for the Georgia Straight, Paul Rodgers and Michael McDonald. Also in 2009, the choir performed for Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth II and Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni at Commonwealth Day in London, England. Alicia Keys sang with the choir at Black Ball Gala. The choir sang for US Global Leadership Coalition honoring former First Lady and Senator Hillary Clinton. The choir sang \\"All You Need is Love\\" for the Playing for Change Campaign. In 2010, The choir was featured on \\"A Christmas Cornucopia\\" with Annie Lenox. The choir were part of the \\"Commonwealth Band\\" who performed with the Military Wives at the Diamond Jubilee Concert in 2012. The choir also performed with two other choirs from the United States and France singing \\"What a Wonderful World\\" for the Playing for Change campaign. Programs in Africa Other than the touring Choir, which is the primary fundraising and awareness program of the organization, Music for Life operate several programs in Africa: =Music for Life Centers= The Music for Life program runs in 12 Centers, (10 in South Africa, 2 in Uganda), where they work with approximately 50 children in each center. These children have either been orphaned by AIDS, or have parents that can no longer care for and provide for them, or who are in the care of aged grandparents who are unable to effectively care for them. Music for Life Centers provides music, dance, life skills, as well as nutrition and education (many of the centers are actually based in schools). = African Children's Choir Primary Schools = These are schools that have been developed for African Children's Choir participants. The children in these schools have all been on tour and are selected for their musical ability, academic potential and have been orphaned and/or come from vulnerable situations. The schools build upon the experiences these children have had while on tour and continue to further develop these children's talents and abilities while providing the support of a family. = Community Primary Schools = These schools are part of the Music for Life Program that assists children (who are not in the choir) and their communities. These schools have either been built by, or have been financially supported by sponsors. The first of these schools was the African Outreach Academy in Uganda, which served as a community support model in 1984 and was the original home of the African Children's Choir. = Teachers Training College = In Sudan, where the infrastructure was decimated by civil war, Music For Life is rebuilding the educational system by providing training for new teachers throughout the country. =12 Million Orphans= 12 Million Orphans is an educational campaign representing the over 12 million orphans in sub-Saharan Africa. The program lobbies and cares for some of these children, provides information on this vulnerable sector, and focuses the world's attention on their issues. The main program to reach these children is the Music for Life Centers.

Charge-pump circuits are capable of high efficiencies, sometimes as high as 90‚Äì95%, while being electrically simple circuits. Description Charge pumps use some form of switching device to control the connection of a supply voltage across a load through a capacitor. In a two stage cycle, in the first stage a capacitor is connected across the supply, charging it to that same voltage. In the second stage the circuit is reconfigured so that the capacitor is in series with the supply and the load. This doubles the voltage across the load - the sum of the original supply and the capacitor voltages. The pulsing nature of the higher voltage switched output is often smoothed by the use of an output capacitor. An external or secondary circuit drives the switching, typically at tens of kilohertz up to several megahertz. The high frequency minimizes the amount of capacitance required, as less charge needs to be stored and dumped in a shorter cycle. Charge pumps can double voltages, triple voltages, halve voltages, invert voltages, fractionally multiply or scale voltages (such as √ó3/2, √ó4/3, √ó2/3, etc.) and generate arbitrary voltages by quickly alternating between modes, depending on the controller and circuit topology. They are commonly used in low-power electronics (such as mobile phones) to raise and lower voltages for different parts of the circuitry - minimizing power consumption by controlling supply voltages carefully.  Terminology for PLL  The term charge pump is also commonly used in phase-locked loop (PLL) circuits even though there is no pumping action involved unlike in the circuit discussed above. A PLL charge pump is merely a bipolar switched current source. This means that it can output positive and negative current pulses into the loop filter of the PLL. It cannot produce higher or lower voltages than its power and ground supply levels.  Applications  * A common application for charge-pump circuits is in RS-232 level shifters, where they are used to derive positive and negative voltages (often +10 V and ‚àí10 V) from a single 5 V or 3 V power supply rail. * Charge pumps can also be used as LCD or white-LED drivers, generating high bias voltages from a single low-voltage supply, such as a battery. * Charge pumps are extensively used in NMOS memories and microprocessors to generate a negative voltage \\"VBB\\" (about ‚àí3 V), which is connected to the substrate. This guarantees that all N+-to- substrate junctions are reversely biased by 3 V or more, decreasing junction capacitance and increasing circuit speed.Jenne, F. \\"Substrate Bias Circuit\\", US Patent 3794862A, Feb 26, 1974. * A charge pump providing a negative voltage spike has been used in NES-compatible games not licensed by Nintendo in order to stun the Nintendo Entertainment System lockout chip.Kevin Horton. Colordreams Revision C. Last modified 2007-09-30. Accessed 2011-09-15. * As of 2007, charge pumps are integrated into nearly all EEPROM and flash-memory integrated circuits. These devices require a high-voltage pulse to \\"clean out\\" any existing data in a particular memory cell before it can be written with a new value. Early EEPROM and flash-memory devices required two power supplies: +5 V (for reading) and +12 V (for erasing). , commercially available flash memory and EEPROM memory requires only one external power supply ‚Äì generally 1.8 V or 3.3 V. A higher voltage, used to erase cells, is generated internally by an on-chip charge pump. * Charge pumps are used in H bridges in high-side drivers for gate-driving high-side n-channel power MOSFETs and IGBTs. When the centre of a half bridge goes low, the capacitor is charged through a diode, and this charge is used to later drive the gate of the high-side FET a few volts above the source voltage so as to switch it on. This strategy works well, provided the bridge is regularly switched and avoids the complexity of having to run a separate power supply and permits the more efficient n-channel devices to be used for both switches.

Founded in 2001, the club competes in the Eerste Divisie, the second tier of Dutch football, and hosts home matches at the Yanmar Stadion. The club builds on former clubs from Amsterdam and is a result of ambitions of the Almere city council to play an active role in top sports. To that end, the sports club Omniworld was formed, which comprises a volleyball branch, a basketball branch and a football branch. Prior to the 2010‚Äì11 season, the club was renamed to Almere City FC. History Almere City can trace its history back to 1976, with the merger of DWS, Volewijckers and Blauw-Wit into FC Amsterdam. Disgruntled DWS supporters founded their own club, De Zwarte Schapen, named after their nickname, which translates as \\"Black Sheep\\". The club quickly rose through the ranks of Dutch amateur football, eventually reaching the Hoofdklasse. After several violent incidents on the pitch and a six-month suspension by the Royal Dutch Football Association (KNVB), the club moved from Amsterdam to nearby Almere and changed its name to Sporting Flevoland. Club's logo from 2001 to 2010 That name was changed to FC Omniworld in 2001 as a result of the efforts of a consortium (in which the city of Almere was a participant) to bring professional sports to Almere. These plans included a basketball club (BC Omniworld, now defunct), a volleyball club (VC Omniworld, now defunct) and the football club (FC Omniworld). However, when the Leefbaar Almere party became the largest party in the city council in 2002, the community withdrew from the project. This caused the club to fail the criteria for admission to the professional league in 2004. TOF-begroting: middenmoot Jupiler League Private investors were found, and the club managed to meet the first two criteria for admission (among which is a balanced budget) in late 2004 and early 2005. After FC Omniworld's stadium (the 3,000 seater Yanmar Stadion) and pitch were approved by the KNVB as well, the club met all criteria for admission, and joined the 19 clubs already in the Eerste Divisie. The club's first official match would have been held on 12 August 2005 against BV Veendam. However, the referee postponed the match shortly before the kick-off because heavy rain had made the artificial turf pitch unplayable. The club's professional debut came a week later, in an away match against FC Eindhoven, a 2‚Äì0 defeat. FC Omniworld registered its first official goal a few days later, in a 2‚Äì3 home defeat against FC Den Bosch, as Juan Viedma Schenkhuizen scored to make the score 1‚Äì2 in the 37th minute. Omniworld's first league point was achieved a week later, on 29 August against Go Ahead Eagles (2‚Äì2). The club's first victory came on 16 September, when Fortuna Sittard were defeated 3‚Äì2. In its first season, Omniworld finished in 19th place with 29 points from 38 matches. Forward Sjoerd Ars ended in fifth place in the top goalscorer ranking, with 17 goals.Jupiler League teampagina Ars was transferred to Go Ahead Eagles for the 2006‚Äì07 season, but the results for Omniworld improved.

In March 2010, the club was renamed AFC Almere City before being changed again a few weeks later to Almere City FC, as the \\"AFC\\" prefix was deemed to be too reminiscent of the club's partners AFC Ajax.

The Bridge School Benefit was an annual charity concert usually held in Mountain View, California, every October at the Shoreline Amphitheatre from 1986 until 2016 with the exceptions of 1987 and 1988. The concerts lasted the entire weekend and were organized by musicians Neil Young and Pegi Young. An annual Bay Area highlight, the concerts were billed online as the primary means of funding for The Bridge School; over both days, the reserved seats alone brought in well over a million dollars every year. Partial proceeds benefited the Bridge School, which assists children with severe physical impairments and complex communication needs. One of the thrusts of the program is the use of advanced augmentative and alternative communication and assistive technology. History The first concert was in October 1986, and, with the exception of 1987, the concert was held every year until 2016. The benefit was known for having a relatively high-profile lineup and strong performances, primarily due to Young's extensive connections within the music industry. He performed every year, and oftentimes he would opt to do so multiple times throughout the weekend. At times he would bring another artist on stage and do a collaboration of one of his songs with them. On November 18, 1997, The Bridge School Concerts, Vol. 1, a compilation CD containing 15 songs, was released by Reprise Records through Amazon. In 2006, a six-volume set entitled The Bridge School Collection, Vol.1 was released through iTunes. The set contains 80 recordings from the concerts and a digital booklet. Additional volumes from the concerts were released on iTunes annually through 2011. On October 24, 2011, Reprise Records released The Bridge School Concerts 25th Anniversary Edition, a compilation CD containing 25 songs, with critical acclaim. The last concerts were held in October 2016. On June 14, 2017, Neil and Pegi Young announced that the Bridge School Concerts would no longer continue.

It is typically held when a boy turns three years old. Among those who practice the upsherin, the male infant does not have his hair cut until this ceremony.  Background  The upsherin tradition is a relatively modern custom in Judaism and has only become a popular practice since the 17th century. Yoram Bilu, a professor of anthropology and psychology at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, suggests that there is little or no religious basis for the custom and its popularity is probably mainly social. The following are some quotes from his paper,\\"From Milah (Circumcision) to Milah (Word): Male Identity and Rituals of Childhood in the Jewish Ultraorthodox Community\\" (Ethos 31 (2): 172-203 published by the American Anthropological Association in 2003) > Two disparate hair-related practices appear to have converged in the > haircutting ritual: the growing of ear-locks payoth - s.d.] and the shearing > of the head hair. ... Ritual haircut, probably modeled on the Muslim custom > of shaving male children's hair in saints' sanctuaries, was practiced by > native Palestinian Jews (Musta'arbim) as early as the Middle Ages. Rabbi > Isaac Luria Ashkenazi, the 16th-century founder of the celebrated Lurianic > School of Kabbalah who assigned special mystical value to the ear-locks, was > instrumental in constituting the ritual in its present form. The ritual > remained primarily a Sephardi custom following Luria, but in the last 200 > years it became widespread among East European Hasidim. From Palestine it > spread to the Diaspora communities, where it was usually celebrated in a > more modest family setting. Rabbi Chaim Vital wrote in Sha'ar Ha-Kavanot that \\"Isaac Luria, cut his son's hair on Lag BaOmer, according to the well-known custom.\\" However, the age of his son is not mentioned. An obvious problem raised by Avraham Yaari, in an article in Tarbiz 22 (1951), is that many sources cite that Luria held one should not cut one's hair for the entire sefirah ‚Äì including Lag BaOmer, (see Shaarei Teshuva, O.C. 493, 8). We know from travellers that by the 18th and 19th centuries, the hilula at Meron on Lag BaOmer with bonfires and the cutting of children's hair had by then become an affair of the masses. A well- known Talmud scholar from Bulgaria, Rabbi Abraham ben Israel Rosanes, wrote that, in his visit to Palestine in 1867, he saw an Ashkenazi Jew giving his son a haircut at the hilula. R. Rosanes says that he could not restrain himself, and went to the Jew and tried to dissuade him, yet was unsuccessful; he also complained that most of the Ashkenazi and Sephardi Jews of Israel were participating in this \\"insanity,\\" with \\"drinking and dancing and fires.\\" A Hasidic rebbe, R. Yehudah Leibush Horenstein, who emigrated to Palestine in the middle of the 19th century, writes that \\"this haircut, called halaqe, is done by the Sephardim in Jerusalem at the tomb of Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai during the summer, but during the winter they take the boy to the synagogue or Beit Midrash and perform the haircut with great celebration and parties, something unknown to the Jews in Europe.\\"  Customs  In the Hasidic community, the upsherin marks a male child's entry into the formal educational system and the commencement of Torah study. A yarmulke and tzitzis will now be worn, and the child will be taught to pray and read the Hebrew alphabet. So that Torah should be \\"sweet on the tongue,\\" the Hebrew letters are covered with honey, and the children lick them as they read. Sometimes the hair that is cut off in the upsherin ceremony is weighed, and charity is given in that amount. If the hair is long enough, it may be donated to a charity that makes wigs for cancer patients.{{cite web url=https://www.theyeshivaworld.com/news/human-interest/165770/lev-malka- calls- on-the-tzibur-to-donate-hair-for-children.html title=Lev Malka Calls on the Tzibur to Donate Hair for Children website=TheYeshivaWorld.com date=April 25, 2013{{ Other customs include having each of those attending the ceremony snip off a lock of hair, and encouraging the child to put a penny in a tzedakah box for each lock as it is cut. Sometimes the child sings a Hebrew song based on the Biblical verse: \\"Torah tzivah lanu Moshe, morashah kehilat Yaakov\\" [\\"Moses commanded the Torah to us, an eternal heritage for the congregation of Jacob\\" (Deut 33:4). Among some Hasidic sects, such as Skver, Chernobyl, and Gur, the upsherin is held at age two. This custom is based on the tradition that Abraham celebrated his son Isaac's second birthday, hinted at in the Biblical verse: \\"The child grew and was weaned, and Abraham made a great feast.\\" (Genesis 21:8) Among some sephardic communities, particularly in Jerusalem, the practice (known to them as \\"chalaka\\") is performed at age five. = Lag BaOmer upsherins = Cutting hair is not allowed during the time of the Counting of the Omer but is permitted on Lag BaOmer. This is why boys who turned three between Pesach and Lag BaOmer celebrate upsherin on this date. It is customary that at the Lag BaOmer celebrations by the tomb of Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai in Meron, Israel, boys are given their first haircuts while their parents distribute wine and sweets. Similar upsherin celebrations are simultaneously held in Jerusalem at the grave of Shimon Hatzaddik for Jerusalemites who cannot travel to Meron. In 1983 Rabbi Levi Yitzchak Horowitz, the second Bostoner Rebbe, reinstated a century-old tradition among Bostoner Hasidim to light a bonfire and conduct upsherins near the grave of Rabbi Akiva in Tiberias on Lag BaOmer night. The tradition had been abandoned due to murderous attacks on sojourners to that relatively isolated place.Horowitz, Y. F. and Morgenstern, Ashira (24 November 2010). \\"Seasons: The Bostoner Rebbetzin remembers and reflects on the occasion of the first yahrtzeit of Grand Rabbi Levi Yitzchak HaLevi Horowitz, ztz\\"l, 18 Kislev 5771\\". Mishpacha, Family First supplement, p. 52.  Hasidic interpretation toward Biblical allusion  In the Bible, human life is sometimes compared to the growth of trees.see Deuteronomy 20:19, Isaiah 65:22, Jeremiah 17:8 According to Leviticus 19:23, one is not permitted to eat the fruit that grows on a tree for the first three years. Some Jews apply this principle to cutting a child's hair. Thus little boys are not given their first haircut until the age of three. To continue the analogy, it is hoped that the child, like a tree that grows tall and eventually produces fruit, will grow in knowledge and good deeds, and someday have a family of his own. Hasidic Rabbis have made this comparison, and in some communities a boy before his first haircut is referred to as orlah, as we refer to a tree in its early years. Chabad Hasidim have another explanation. > For the first three years of life, a child absorbs the surrounding sights > and sounds and the parents‚Äô loving care. The child is a receiver, not yet > ready to give. At the age of three, children‚Äôs education takes a leap‚Äîthey > are now ready to produce and share their unique gifts.\\"  See also  * First haircut  Notes   External links  * What is Upsherin? from judaism.about.com * Upsherin from aish.com * Upshernish at chabad.org Category:Yiddish culture Category:Judaism and children Category:Rites of passage Category:Jewish law and rituals Category:Jewish life cycle Category:Human hair Category:Yiddish words and phrases ","title":"Upsherin"},{"id":"2169789","title":"Playing the Angel"},{"id":"2169797","text":"Lucas (\\"Luuk\\") Petrus van Troost (born 28 December 1969 in Schiedam, Zuid- Holland) is a former Dutch cricketer, who captained the national team.

This work is considered one of the earliest Arabic Islamic histories to have survived to the present day. Life The author's father  øAbdullah and brother Muhammad were the leading Egyptian authorities of their time (early 9th century) on Malikite Islamic law. After the father's death, the family were persecuted by the caliph Al-Wathiq for their adherence to orthodox doectrine. Although much quoted by early traditionists and historians, they are rarely mentioned by name because of a family disgrace. In the reign of the caliph Al-Mutawakkil the historian and his brothers were accused of embezzlement of a deceased estate, imprisoned, and one of the brothers even died under torture.  øAbd ar-Ra·∏•man ibn  øAbd al-·∏§akam was, strictly speaking, a traditionist rather than a pure and general historian. He was interested mainly in historical incidents which illustrated early Muslim customs which he could use to teach Islamic law.Torrey, preface to Arabic edition; and more particularly the article by Robert Brunschvig. His sources were books compiled by very early traditionists and now lost, and oral sources such as his own father. Works Four manuscripts survive of the author's historical work, all of them considered to derive from a single copy originally perhaps made by one of his students.Torrey, p. 17 of preface to Arabic edition. Two of these are titled simply Fut≈´·∏• mi»ôr (, Conquest of Egypt), one is titled Fut≈´·∏• mi»ôr wa akhbƒÅrahƒÅ (, Conquest of Egypt and some account of it, i.e. of the country), and one has the fuller title given at the head of this article.Torrey, p. 4 of preface to Arabic edition. A critical edition of the entire Arabic text was published by Charles Torrey, who had earlier translated the North African section into English. A short portion of the work covering only the Muslim conquest of Spain was translated into English by John Harris Jones (G√∂ttingen, W. Fr. Kaestner, 1858, pp. 18‚Äì22). The Spanish and North African sections have also been translated into French and Spanish by a number of historians. However, these account for only a small part of the book. Most of the work is devoted to the legendary pre-Islamic history of Egypt, The Muslim conquest of Egypt, The Muslim conquest of North Africa, its early Muslim settlements and its first Islamic judges. His work is an almost invaluable source as arguably the earliest Arab account of the Islamic conquests of the countries it deals with. However, ≈íit was written some 200 years after the events it describes, and therefore largely mixes facts with later legends.See the critical study by Brunschvig, who attempts to sort the historical from the legendary.

Along with the French Concorde F-WTSB, the aircraft was used to enable sufficient testing to allow for the Concorde fleet to receive certification. It was stored at Filton airfield from the mid-1980s until 2003, when it was transported by road to the Brooklands Museum in Weybridge, Surrey. History G-BBDG first flew on the 13 February 1974, having been registered on 7 August 1973. Its main uses were finalising the Concorde design before the other aircraft entered passenger service and certification prior to Concorde entering passenger service. There were some differences between this aircraft and the final production aircraft, such as a thinner fuselage skin. The aircraft was painted in British Airways livery throughout its testing period. The aircraft flew a total of 1282 hrs 9 mins; its final flight was on the 24 December 1981. After the final flight, it was stored at Filton in a state of semi-airworthiness throughout 1982, where it could be returned to flight in two weeks if required. However this was never required and the aircraft was eventually bought by British Airways as part of a Concorde support buy-out in 1984. The aircraft never entered service with British Airways; instead it was used as a major source of spare parts, allowing the airline to operate a fleet of seven aircraft. A hangar was constructed for it at Filton airfield in the late 1980s; its tail was removed prior to its being put in the hangar. In 1995, Concorde G-BOAF had its nose damaged in a handling accident at Heathrow Airport. British Airways swapped this nose with the nose of the Filton Concorde. As well as its nose and tail, other parts were taken, including its engines, landing gear and the majority of the components from the hydraulic system. The original nose was later repaired at Brooklands and returned to G-BBDG. The aircraft was considered for scrapping many times, but was always found to be useful. In 2001, it was used to test reinforced cockpit doors required for all aircraft after the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks. When British Airways and Air France retired their fleets in 2003, Brooklands Museum at Weybridge in Surrey accepted the aircraft as a museum exhibit. It was dismantled as fully as possible and the rest was cut up into five major sections and transported by road to Brooklands Museum. The task of structurally disassembling and reassembling the aircraft was carried out by Air Salvage International (ASI). It was then restored by a team of over 100 volunteers from the museum, assisted by students from the University of Surrey. The Concorde Experience was opened at the museum in July 2006 by Prince Michael of Kent; it allows visitors to enter the aircraft and experience a virtual flight at speeds up to Mach 2. After many years of being retired and placed in Brooklands, in 2014, Brooklands Museum tested the droop- nose of the Concorde mechanically (without using electricity and any control from the cockpit), the test was deemed a success and helped prove it was possible to activate the nose that hasn't been used for many years. On 23 July 2016, G-BBDG had its nose lowered by Jodie Kidd independently for the first time since its retirement, it was watched by a huge crowd including former captains and crew of the aircraft.

The early castle  The first castle was founded by William de Londres of Ogmore Castle soon after 1106 following the capture of Gower by the Normans. In 1116 the Welsh of Deheubarth retook the Gower Peninsula and forced William to flee his castle which was put to the torch. The castle was rebuilt soon afterwards, but was probably destroyed again in 1137 when Gower was once more retaken by the princes of Deheubarth. The Londres or London family finally died out in 1215 when Gower was again taken by the Welsh under the leadership of Llywelyn the Great. In 1220 the Welsh were expelled from the peninsula and the government of Henry III of England returned the barony of Gower to John de Braose who rebuilt both Swansea Castle and Oystermouth.  In de Braose hands  Oystermouth castle, with its village and lighthouse, 1839 A 1910s photograph by P. B. Abery. In the 13th century the Braose family were Lords of Gower and held the castle as part of their extensive land holdings and titles, including other castles on Gower and in the Welsh Marches. The de Braose dynasty could afford to rebuild Oystermouth castle in stone. A high curtain wall was built, internal buildings added, a chapel, basements, three storey residential buildings with fireplaces and garderobes on each floor. The castle had every residential feature necessary for living in some comfort and was also refortified cleverly. Towards the end of the century Oystermouth rather than Swansea Castle became their principal residence. Edward I paid a brief visit here in December 1284. By 1331 the Lords of Gower were living elsewhere and the castle declined in importance in the 14th century. The daughter of the last de Breos Lord, Aline de Breos, who improved the chapel making it one of the finest in any castle in south Wales, later married John de Mowbray, and the Lordship of Gower including the castle at Oystermouth passed to the de Mowbrays through this marriage, and then to the Herbert family, and finally the Somersets, who became successive Marquis of Worcester and finally Dukes of Beaufort.  Decline and decay  After the Middle Ages, the castle gradually fell into ruin. A survey of Gower made in 1650 describes Oystermouth Castle as [a]n old decayed castle of no use, but of a very pleasant situation. It was portrayed in art in the 18th century as a picturesque ruin, and was restored by George Grant Francis in the 1840s while the castle was owned by the then Duke of Beaufort. In 1927 the Duke of Beaufort gave the castle to Swansea Corporation; today, the castle is maintained under the responsibility of the City and County of Swansea council. 2000s restoration In 2009 the National Assembly for Wales announced it was investing ¬£19 million in the country's heritage sites in an attempt to boost tourism. As part of the programme Oystermouth Castle closed in 2010 while it underwent a ¬£1 m refurbishment; it reopened to the public in July the following year. Following the first phase of conservation works Oystermouth Castle reopened to the public in mid July 2011. The scheme includes new visitor facilities, an educational space, improvements to access and a 30-foot high glass viewing platform and bridge that leads to Alina's Chapel. Notable features of the castle Oystermouth Castle, showing the gatehouse and the chapel window On either side of the entrance gate the walls curve inward, showing that at one time there were supposed to be two round towers built into the gatehouse. It is unknown whether these were ever built. The chapel (on the second floor of the chapel block) has 14th century traceried windows. According to local tradition the chapel was built under the direction of Aline de Mowbray. Remnants of an ornate medieval painting dating back to the 14th century have recently been found in the chapel. The surviving painting is thought to be over 700 years old and was spotted during conservation work in the historic attraction's chapel area. Exposure to the elements has taken its toll on the painting over time but expert Cadw analysis suggests it's a double-arched canopy that contains the figures of angels. Some of the clear elements of the painting that remain include a wing with multiple feathers and circular shapes that form a head with yellow hair surrounded by a nimbus. It's thought the painting is both highly important and testimony to the original design of the chapel attributed to Alina de Breos in the early 14th century that once formed part of a larger work of art.

Rodwell and published by Cambridge University Press, which describes the plant communities which comprise the British National Vegetation Classification. Its coverage includes all native vegetation communities and some artificial ones of Great Britain, excluding Northern Ireland. The series is a major contribution to plant conservation in Great Britain, and, as such, covers material appropriate for professionals and amateurs interested in the conservation of native plant communities. Each book begins with an introduction to the techniques used to survey the particular vegetations within its scope, discussing sampling, the type of data collected, organization of the data, and analysing the data. Each community is discussed with an overall emphasis of the ecology of the community, so that users can consider the relationships of various plant communities to each other as a function of climatic or soil conditions, for example.

Britannia are happy to lead any such Sons as endavwrance and God Always saves endavour\\" Bussa's rebellion (14‚Äì16 April 1816) was the largest slave revolt in Barbadian history. The rebellion takes its name from the African-born slave, Bussa, who led the rebellion which was defeated by British forces. Bussa's Rebellion was the first of three large-scale slave rebellions in the British West Indies that shook public faith in slavery in the years leading up to the abolition of slavery in the British Empire and emancipation of former slaves. It was followed by the large-scale rebellion in Demerara in 1823 and by an even larger rebellion in Jamaica in 1831‚Äì32. Collectively these are often referred to as the \\"late slave rebellions\\". Bussa Bussa () was born a free man in West Africa of possible [Nigerian) descent and was captured by African slave merchants, sold to the British, and transported to Barbados (where slavery had been legal since 1661) in the late 18th century as a slave. Not much is known about him and there are no records of him prior to this date. Since slave owners almost never bothered to keep detailed records about the lives of their slaves (who were considered property), virtually no biographical information about Bussa is available. Records show a slave named \\"Bussa\\" worked as a ranger (a head officer among the slaves) on \\"Bayley's Plantation\\" in the parish of Saint Philip around the time of the rebellion. This position would have given Bussa more freedom of movement than the average slave and would have made it easier for him to plan and coordinate the rebellion. Revolt Bussa Emancipation Statue (1985) in Bridgetown The revolts arose at a time when the British Parliament was working on schemes to ameliorate the conditions of slaves in the Caribbean. Preparation for this rebellion began soon after the House of Assembly discussed and rejected the Imperial Registry Bill in November 1815, which would have registered colonial slaves. Historians believe that slaves interpreted some of the parliamentary proposals as preparatory to emancipation, and took action when freedom did not take place.\\"The Emancipation Wars\\", National Library of Jamaica Among Bussa's collaborators were Washington, Franklin, John and Nanny Grigg, a senior domestic slave, and Jackey on Simmons' Plantation, as well as other slaves, drivers and artisans. Jackey was a Creole driver who was an important figure. The planning was undertaken at a number of sugar estates, including Bailey's plantation, where it began. By February 1816, Bussa was an African driver, one of the few in his position. He and his collaborators decided to start the revolt on 14 April, Easter Sunday. Bussa, King Wiltshire, Dick Bailey, and Johnny led the slaves into battle at Bailey's Plantation on Tuesday, 16 April. He commanded some 400 freedom fighters, both men and women, most of whom were believed to be Creole, born in the islands. He was killed in battle. His forces continued the fight until they were defeated by superior firepower of the colonial militia. The rebellion failed but its influence was significant to the future of Barbados. Legacy * Bussa remains a popular figure in Barbados. * In 1985, 169 years after his rebellion, the Emancipation Statue, created by Karl Broodhagen, was unveiled in Haggatt Hall, in the parish of St Michael. * 1998, the Parliament named Bussa as one of the ten National Heroes of Barbados.

It is typically fitted upon an aircraft that possesses a sharp nose-up attitude during the takeoff and landing phases of flight, which would result in a conventional nose cone obscuring the flight crew's view of the runway and ground alike. On an aircraft fitted with a droop nose, the pilot is able to lower the nose cone, thereby improving visibility. Throughout the majority of a flight, the nose would be kept in the raised position for greater aerodynamic efficiency. Droop noses have typically been installed on supersonic airlines, such as Concorde and the Tupolev Tu-144, and high speed experimental aircraft, such as the record-breaking Fairey Delta 2 and the Sukhoi T-4 strategic bomber. History Concorde prototype just prior to landing. Note the lowered position of its droop nose British Airways Concorde in Singapore Airlines livery at Heathrow Airport. Note the raised nose The first supersonic delta to receive a drooped nose was the Fairey Delta 2, a British experimental high speed aircraft. The Delta 2 featured a relatively long tapered nose, which smoothly flowed into its cylindrical cross-section fuselage, to generate a high level of aerodynamic efficiency.Wood 1975, p. 75. It was recognised that such a lengthy nose would negatively impact the pilot's forward vision during landing, take-off and ground movements; thus, to retain the aerodynamically- optimised nose cone while also providing adequate downwards visibility, the drooped nose was devised. Accordingly, the nose section of the Delta 2, including the cockpit, could be drooped by 10¬∞ using a hydraulically-actuated mechanism. A similar arrangement was subsequently adopted on Concorde.\\"Fairey FD2.\\" Royal Air Force Museum, Retrieved: 13 December 2016.Wood 1975, p. 76. The Delta 2 soundly demonstrated its favourable high speed performance qualities during flight testing; rapidly proving to be faster than any other British-built aircraft in existence of that time.Wood 1975, p. 77. On 10 March 1956, the Fairey Delta 2 broke the World Air Speed Record, raising it to 1,132 mph (1,811 km/h) or Mach 1.73.\\"50 years ago: 16 Mar 1956.\\" Flight International, 10 March 2006.Wood 1975, p. 79. Thus, the Delta 2 became the first aircraft to exceed .Peter Twiss; Faster Than the Sun, London, Grub Street, 1963. Around this time, Fairey sought to produce a straightforward fighter derivative of the Delta 2 that retained many of its features, with efforts largely centering around Operational Requirement F.155. On 1 April 1957, Fairey were informed by officials within the Ministry of Supply that their proposals were the favourite to meet Operational Requirement F.155.Wood 1975, p. 85. However, on 4 April 1957, Duncan Sandys, the Minister of Defence, announced the effective termination of nearly all fighter aircraft development for the RAF, instantly removing the F.155 requirement. The Delta 2 became a key development platform for what would later be known as Concorde, an early supersonic airliner, which harnessed a cutting-edge ogee or ogival delta wing design. It was decided to convert one of the two Delta 2 aircraft into a testbed for the ogival wing shape. Re-designated as the BAC 221, much of the airframe apart from the wing remained unaltered, the droop nose being one of the features that was carried over.Henry Matthews and Peter Davison; The Speed Saga: FD-2 and BAC.221, HPM, 2006.Flight 1964, pp. 133‚Äì134. The BAC 221 was used for varied flight testing from 1964 until 1973, after which it was placed on public display.\\"British Aircraft Corporation 221.\\" Royal Navy Fleet Air Arm Museum, Retrieved: 13 December 2016. Concorde was furnished with a droop nose, which was developed and manufactured under contract by Marshall's of Cambridge by a team led by Norman Harry OBE. Needing to endure temperatures in excess of at supersonic flight, the nose window and visor glass were developed by Triplex.\\"Triplex in Concorde: The story behind the film\\". Flightglobal.com, 1968. Retrieved 7 June 2011. The droop nose enabled the airliner to switch between being streamlined to reduce drag for optimal aerodynamic efficiency and not obstructing the pilot's view during taxi, take-off, and landing operations. Concorde's droop nose was accompanied by a moving transparent visor that retracted into the nose prior to being lowered. When the nose was raised to horizontal, the visor would rise in front of the cockpit windscreen for aerodynamic streamlining. A controller in the cockpit allowed the visor to be retracted and the nose to be lowered to 5¬∞ below the standard horizontal position for taxiing and take-off. Following take-off and after clearing the airport, the nose and visor were raised. Prior to landing, the visor was again retracted and the nose lowered to 12.5¬∞ below horizontal for maximal visibility. Upon landing, the nose was raised to the 5¬∞ position to avoid the possibility of damage. There was also a standby droop system if the main system failed, operated from the cockpit centre console, and as a last resort if both hydraulic systems failed, a lever could be pulled in the cockpit which released the mechanical latches, allowing the nose to fall under gravity to the 12.5 degree position. canards and lowered droop nose The Tupolev Tu-144, a contemporary counterpart to Concorde that was developed by the Soviet Union, also featured a droop nose. Its configuration was not identical to that of Concorde however, the visor of the Tu-144 was fixed to the nose and was capable of retracting. The Tu-144 exhibited a noticeable tendency for the nose to pitch downward, which was cancelled out via the addition of retractable canards that would deploy when the nose was lowered; the landing speed of the Tu-144s was around , which remained higher than that of Concorde.\\"Ground- Effect Characteristics of the Tu-144 Supersonic Transport Airplane.\\" NASA Dryden Center.

He served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1943 to 1945. Elected as a member of the Manitoba Cooperative Commonwealth Federation, Johnson had a tenuous relationship with the party leadership and was expelled from the party caucus in 1945. After leaving the legislature, he became a member of the communist Labor-Progressive Party. Johnson was born in Rapid City, Manitoba. His ancestors had moved from Pennsylvania to Ontario in the late eighteenth century. Many were Quakers, and almost all were farmers. He was educated in Rapid City, and at the Brandon Normal School, Brandon College and the Manitoba Medical College. He received a degree in medicine in 1926. He served in the ranks of the 27th Battalion during World War I, and was awarded a Military Medal and recommended for a commission. From 1926 to 1931, he served in the Philippines as a hospital superintendent. On returning to Manitoba, he served on the Brandon School Board and the Brandon Health Unit from 1937 to 1943. Johnson became politically active during this period. He was a member of the Brandon Reconstruction Club in the 1930s, a local division of the Canadian League for Social Reconstruction. In 1936, he became a vice-president of the Brandon CCF club. Johnson was a vocal proponent of socialism, and criticized others in the party who were reluctant to use the term openly. He was elected to the Manitoba legislature in a by-election held in the Brandon constituency on November 18, 1943. Along with Beresford Richards, who had been elected for The Pas earlier in the year, he soon became a prominent figure on the party's left-wing. The CCF was the official opposition party during this period, and Johnson distinguished himself in the legislature as his party's health and welfare critic. Since the 1930s, Johnson had called for cooperation among Canada's left-wing parties. In 1945, this position caused both Johnson and Richards to be expelled from the CCF caucus. Johnson and Richards argued that the CCF should promote friendly relations with the Soviet Union after World War II, and should seek cooperation with other progressive and working-class parties to prevent the Conservatives from returning to power at the federal level. This strategy of cooperation was identical to that favoured by the Labor-Progressive Party in 1945. Many in the CCF believed Johnson and Richards were directly influenced by the LPP, and accused them of disrupting the party. After Richards made their position public in a speech to the legislature, the provincial CCF council suspended both MLAs from the party. Johnson and Richards sat in the legislature as independent members, and sought re-election as \\"Independent CCF\\" candidates in the 1945 provincial election. Richards was re-elected, and later returned to the CCF fold. Johnson faced opposition from an official CCF candidate, however, and finished third. The winner in Brandon was Leslie McDorman from the Liberal-Progressive party. Johnson appealed for reinstatement to the CCF after the election, but was rejected at the party's December 1945 convention. Unlike Richards, whose motivations in 1945 have been described as \\"naive and confused\\", Johnson's personal philosophy had shifted to Marxism by this period. He joined the Labor-Progressive Party a few years after his expulsion from the CCF. In 1949, he accused social democratic parties such as the CCF of being traitors to the working-class and of propping up the existing capitalist order. Johnson ran as an independent candidate in the riding of Brandon in the 1949 federal election. Neither the CCF nor the LPP endorsed an official candidate, leaving Johnson as the de facto candidate of a united left. He finished a distant third, behind Liberal James Ewen Matthews . Johnson later attended the Asia and Pacific Rim Peace Conference in the People's Republic of China in 1952, during the period of the Korean War.\\"Letter from Moscow: ‚ÄòScotty‚Äô Visits the Ballet,\\" The Fisherman (Vancouver), 21 October 1952 References Category:1898 births Category:1972 deaths Category:Canadian anti-war activists Category:Canadian communists Category:Canadian Expeditionary Force soldiers Category:Physicians from Manitoba Category:Manitoba Co-operative Commonwealth Federation MLAs Category:People from Brandon, Manitoba Category:Independent candidates in the 1949 Canadian federal election ","title":"Dwight Johnson (politician)"},{"id":"2169874","text":"Open source products include permission to use the source code, design documents, or content of the product.

The oldest town between Regensburg and Italy, it lies on the river Isar at an altitude of 421 m (1381 ft). It has 18,033 inhabitants (2016) and covers an area of 44 km¬≤. It is easily reached by the A 92 autobahn and regional trains on the Munich‚ÄìRegensburg line. Furthermore, it takes just 10 minutes to get to Munich airport. Moosburg is popular with commuters who travel to Munich, Freising, and Munich airport. There is considerable industry in the town consisting of chemical, electro-technical, food processing, and machine- building plants. History There was a Benedictine abbey in Moosburg in the 8th century: a cluster of dwellings and artisans sprang up around it. Duke Heinrich der L√∂we started the construction of the Kastulus Minster (cathedral) in 1171, dedicated to Saint Castulus ‚Äì whose supposed relics were brought to the city. In the 12th century, a town was established and received its first charter in 1311. The walls and moat were completed in the 15th century. The town reached its peak during the early part of the 16th century. In 1599, the Benedictines moved to Landshut, reducing Moosburg's importance. Sieges and plundering during the Thirty Year War started the decline of the town. In 1702, a fire reduced half the buildings to ashes. Moosburg suffered further depredation during the War of the Austrian Succession and the Napoleonic Wars. Another disastrous fire in 1865 resulted in the downtown area being redeveloped in the style of the late 19th century. During the 1920s and 1930s, new industries revived the town. In September 1939, a prisoner of war camp Stalag VII-A was built to accommodate 10,000. By early 1945, the number of registered prisoners had grown to more than 70,000‚Äîincluding many in associated labor camps. It is likely that the presence of this camp close to the town center spared it from large-scale bombing. After the liberation of the camp by the Americans at the end of April 1945, it was turned into Civilian Internment Camp #6 for 12,000 German men and women suspected of criminal activity for the Nazi regime. From 1948, the camp served to house German refugees exiled from Eastern Europe. It became a new part of the town, named Moosburg-Neustadt.Moosburg Online: POW camp Stalag VII A  Main sights and culture  The main altar of the Kastulus Minster is the principal masterpiece of the wood sculptor Hans Leinberger of Landshut. Originally, the altar was a triptych in which the side panels could be swiveled inward to close the altar. Today, the side panels hang above the choir stalls. The Romanesque-style west doorway of the Minster was actually built in the 19th century. The Baroque facades that survived the 1865 fire can be seen at the east end of Herrnstrasse, for instance, the red front of the chemist's shop. The memorial to inmates of Stalag VII-A is a fountain in the center of Neustadt. It consists of four bas-reliefs created out of local stone by the French sculptor Antoniucci Volti while he was a prisoner in the camp.

Kennedy, written by Dalton Trumbo, Mark Lane, and Donald Freed, and directed by David Miller. It stars Burt Lancaster and Robert Ryan. Miller had previously worked with Trumbo on his film Lonely Are the Brave (1962). Plot A narrator states that, when asked about the Kennedy Assassination and the Warren Commission report, United States President Lyndon B. Johnson said he doubted the Commission's findings. The narration ends by mentioning that the segment did not run on television, and was cut from a program about Johnson at his own request. At a gathering in June 1963, shadowy industrial, political and US intelligence figures discuss their growing dissatisfaction with the Kennedy administration. In the plush home of lead conspirator Robert Foster, he and the others try to persuade Harold Ferguson, a powerful oil magnate dressed in white, to back their plans for Kennedy's assassination. Fellow conspirator James Farrington, a black-ops specialist, labels this as \\"executive action\\". He shows the group that magnicide is indeed a viable option. He refers to the Lincoln, Garfield, and McKinley assassinations as examples, as well as unsuccessful attempts including against Franklin Roosevelt in 1933. He explains these attempts were carried out by alleged lone fanatics; later scenes show the grooming process unwittingly undergone by Lee Harvey Oswald to fulfill precisely that role in the present conspiracy. Ferguson remains unconvinced, saying such schemes are \\"only tolerable when necessary, and only permissible when they work\\". Obtaining his approval is crucial to the conspirators, although Farrington proceeds to organize two shooting teams in anticipation that Ferguson will change his mind. One of the teams is shown during practice in the Mojave Desert, shooting moving targets at medium-to-long range. One of the shooters says that he can only guarantee the operation's success if he fires at a target moving below 15 miles per hour. After one of their meetings, Foster and Farrington discuss their murky, paranoid fears about the future of the country under Kennedy, and the security of ruling-class white people across the globe. They both seem privy to plans known to the CIA that Ferguson, a civilian, is perhaps unaware of. Foster forecasts the world population in 2000 at seven billion, most of them non-white and \\"[swarming] out of their breeding grounds into Europe and North America\\". He sees victory in Vietnam as an opportunity to control the developing world and reduce its population to 550 million, ominously adding \\"I know; I've seen the data\\". He also states that the same methods can then be applied to unwanted groups in the United States: Asians, blacks, Latinos, poor whites, etc. Ferguson watches news reports and becomes highly concerned at Kennedy's increasingly liberal direction: action on civil rights, adoption of the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, and nuclear disarmament. The decisive moment comes in an anti-Kennedy news report on the deteriorating situation in South Vietnam. It is followed by Kennedy's October 1963 decision (National Security Action Memorandum #263) to withdraw all US advisers from Vietnam by the end of 1965, effectively ending America's direct involvement in the Vietnam War. Ferguson calls Foster and tells him he now supports their project. The scene of the shooting is described. As news of the assassination reaches the conspirators, the film surveys its effects. The shooters leave Dallas and the conspirators work to cover up the evidence. Farrington and his assistant Tim discuss the inconvenience of Oswald's survival. Tim approaches nightclub owner Jack Ruby, who stalks and kills Oswald. The plotters discuss the political fallout in Washington, D.C., concerned about retribution from Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy and the believability of the plot. Foster states that \\"Bobby Kennedy is not thinking as Attorney General but as a grieving brother. By the time he recovers it will be too late\\". The conspirators agree that people will believe in the story because \\"they want to\\". Soon after, Foster receives a call from Farrington's assistant: Farrington has died of a heart attack at Parkland Hospital. The conspirators are now insulated from the link to the group that committed the killings. Their work is not quite finished. A photo collage of 18 material witnesses is shown, all but two of whom, the film states, died of unnatural causes within three years of the assassination. A voice-over says that an actuary of the British newspaper The Sunday Times calculated the probability that all these people who witnessed the assassination would die within that period of time to be 100,000-trillion-to-one. Cast * Burt Lancaster as James Farrington * Robert Ryan as Robert Foster * Will Geer as Harold Ferguson * John Anderson as Halliday * Ed Lauter as Operations Chief * President John F. Kennedy in archival footage Production The actor Donald Sutherland has been credited as having conceived of the film, and for hiring Lane and Freed to write the screenplay. Sutherland had planned to act in and produce Executive Action, but abandoned the project after failing to obtain financing, and took a role in another film. Executive Action was Robert Ryan's final film: he died of cancer four months before its release. Steve Jaffe, former DA Jim Garrison's investigator, was the film's technical consultant and supervising producer. =Music= The film's musical score was composed by Randy Edelman. Reception Released two weeks before the tenth anniversary of Kennedy's assassination, Executive Action opened to a storm of controversy about the events it depicts, and was consequently pulled from many theaters in its first few weeks. Many television stations also refused to run trailers for the film, among them WNBC-TV in New York City. Besides the negative press, the film was also generally panned. Pauline Kael called it a \\"feeble, insensitive fictionalization...It's a dodo-bird of a movie, the winner of the Tora! Tora! Tora! prize in miniature. With matchlessly dull performances.\\"Pauline Kael, 1982, 5001 Nights at the Movies: A Guide from A to Z, New York: Holt, Rinehart and Winston Leonard Maltin declared the film a \\"bomb\\" in his Movie Guide, calling it an \\"excruciatingly dull thriller [that] promised to clear the air about JFK's assassination but was more successful at clearing theaters.\\"Leonard Maltin, 2014, Leonard Maltin's 2015 Movie Guide, Penguin (Also in earlier editions) In contrast, The New York Times gave it a positive review, its critic Nora Sayre writing that the film \\"offers a tactful, low-key blend of fact and invention. The film makers do not insist that they have solved John Kennedy's murder; instead, they simply evoke what might have happened...The film's sternest and strongest point is that only a crazed person acting on his own would have been acceptable to the American public ‚Äî which, at that time, certainly did not want to believe in a conspiracy.\\"Nora Sayre, \\"Suspense Film Dramatizes Kennedy Assassination:The Cast\\", New York Times, November 8, 1973. Retrieved May 5, 2016 Meanwhile, Roger Ebert was equivocal, giving the film two stars and calling it \\"a dramatized rewrite of all those old assassination conspiracy books.\\" Ebert stated \\"There‚Äôs something exploitative and unseemly in the way this movie takes the real blood and anguish and fits it neatly into a semi-documentary thriller.\\" He added that \\"Executive Action doesn't seem much to want to entertain\\" and called Miller's direction \\"colorless\\". Ebert continued, saying that the film \\"borrows from actual newsreel footage of Kennedy, Oswald and Jack Ruby for most of its power. And it does have power, make no mistake. It has the power of evoking what will probably remain, for most of us, the most stunning public moment of our lives: the moment when we first learned that the President had been shot\\". Comparison to similar films At least five other American films dramatize the Kennedy assassination as a conspiracy; Executive Action sits alongside Oliver Stone's JFK (1991); John MacKenzie's Ruby (1992); the 1984 William Tannen film Flashpoint; and Neil Burger's 2002 pseudo-documentary Interview with the Assassin. Despite many similarities with the plot of JFK, Executive Action presents a far more direct and unemotional account of its own touted conspiracy than does Stone's film. Executive Action is directed in an almost documentary style, and was filmed on a small budgetBox Office Information Online‚Äîdespite the presence of two big Hollywood names, Robert Ryan and Burt Lancaster. Furthermore, the story is told entirely from the perspective of the conspirators. Home media Executive Action was released on DVD on October 23, 2007 in the United States and Canada. It is now available for online viewing through Amazon.com Prime Video, Apple's iTunes store's downloadable application and online also through Vudu, Google Play and YouTube for both download and/or streaming video rentals.

Although it may occupy the site of an earlier fortification, it is a castle in name only as it is a grand Tudor fortified manor house built in courtyard style. The castle A charter of 1306 granted in Swansea refers to tenants of \\"the ancient knight's fees\\" (that is, military tenants) at Oxwich, and this indicates that there may have been some fortifications on the site before the present castle.Williams (1998), p. 13 At this time Oxwich was owned by the de Penres family, who had been in possession since the 1230s. However, with the exception of a ruined tower to the north-east of the castle, which may predate the Tudor building, (and may be the \\"castrum de Oxenwych\\" mentioned in a document of 1459) nothing remains of any earlier works.Williams (1998), p. 25 The existing buildings were largely created in the 16th century. They consist of a Gateway (built 1520‚Äì1538) leading to a courtyard, a Hall at the east of the courtyard opposite the Gateway (1559‚Äì1580) and a South Range (1520‚Äì38). At the corner of the Hall and the South Range is the six-story South-East Tower. To the north-east of the Castle are the remains of a large stone dovecote.Williams (1998), pp. 32‚Äì33 The Gateway is surmounted by a plaque with the coats of arms of the Mansell family and the Penrice and Scurlage families to which Sir Rhys was related.Williams (1998), p. 31 The East Range carried a large Hall, and, with the South-East Tower to which it was connected, provided extensive accommodation. It is possible that the construction of this range may have led to the bankruptcy of its builder, Sir Edward Mansell.Williams (1998), pp. 33‚Äì35 The South Range contained a kitchen.Williams (1998), p. 32 History Oxwich was originally built by Sir Rice Mansel (d. 1559), who also owned Old Beaupre Castle. The structure was built over the original ruined castle, the residence of the Norman de la Mare family during the 13th and 14th century.Hughes (1992), p. 44 His son, Sir Edward Mansel (d. 1595) succeeded to the property and between 1560‚Äì80 created a much grander structure, called the Great House, capable of housing a large number of guests and retainers. It was a leading example in Wales of the Elizabethan prodigy house. By 1632 however the Castle was already leased out by the Mansell family.Williams (1998), p. 25 Parts of the building collapsed in the eighteenth century. Following this, parts of the South Range were rebuilt and it continued to be used as a farmhouse into the 20th century. In 1949 the Castle was threatened with demolition but was saved and given to the State.Williams (1998), p. 29 The building is now in the care of Cadw. The Oxwich Brooch During maintenance works at the Castle in 1968, a gold brooch was discovered by Cyril Grove, which is a rare fine example of medieval British jewellery. The brooch is in the form of a gold ring with mounts, of the period 1320‚Äì1340, two inches in diameter. It is set with three rubies and three cameos; it is believed that the cameos were added at a later date and that the brooch may have originally contained sapphires. It may once have been part of the treasure of Edward II or an heirloom of the Mansel family. The brooch is now on display at the National Museum Cardiff. \\"Mediaeval ring brooch\\", CADW website, accessed 3 April 2016Williams (1998), p. 36  External links  *\\"Oxwich Castle\\" in Cadw website, accessed 26 March 2016 *\\"Oxwich Castle\\" in Castles of Wales website, accessed 26 March 2016 * References ;Notes ;Sources *Hughes, Wendy.

National Hydrography Dataset high-resolution flowline data. The National Map , accessed October 3, 2011 The Assabet rises from a swampy area known as the Assabet Reservoir in Westborough, Massachusetts, and flows northeast before merging with the Sudbury River at Egg Rock in Concord, Massachusetts, to become the Concord River. The Organization for the Assabet, Sudbury and Concord Rivers (OARS), headquartered in West Concord, Massachusetts, is a non-profit organization dedicated to the preservation, protection, and enhancement of the natural and recreational features of these three rivers and their watershed. As the Concord River is a tributary of the Merrimack River, it and the Assabet and Sudbury rivers are part of the larger Merrimack River watershed. Etymology The Assabet River has had many variations of the same name over time, and its etymology is uncertain. Various Native American meanings are associated with the name. Assabet is said to come from the Algonquian word for \\"the place where materials for making fish nets comes from.\\" Other cited Algonquian meanings include \\"at the miry place\\" or \\"it is miry.\\" It is possible to decode the name Assabet in the Eastern Algonquian Loup language spoken by the Nipmuc people who lived and fished on the river prior to European settlement. The word assa-pe-t segments into: assa, \\"turn back\\"; pe, a short form of nippe, \\"water\\", used in compounds; and a locative suffix, -t, a shorter form of -et after the vowel, so its name in Loup means \\"at the place where the river turns back.\\" During floods the Assabet River reaches peak height sooner than the Sudbury River, so that at the junction of the two rivers the Sudbury's direction of flow can temporarily reverse. A Eurocentric interpretation is that the river's name is a corrupted spelling of Elizabeth, or an attempted transliteration of the Nipmuc name.McAdow 1990: p. 73 Various historic maps and documents denote the river's name as Asibath, Assabeth, Asabett, Assabet, Elizbeth, Elizabet, Elizabeth, Elsabeth, Elsibeth, and Isabaeth. The uniform spelling \\"Assabet\\" was not adopted until at least 1850. Historic maps up until 1830 mostly label the river the Elizabeth, but by 1856 maps consistently call it the Assabet. The name's history is further complicated by the fact that the tributary Elizabeth Brook in present-day Stow flows into the Assabet River. History Indigenous people lived in what became central Massachusetts for thousands of years prior to European settlement. Indigenous oral histories, archaeological evidence, and European settler documents attest to historic settlements of the Nipmuc near and along the Assabet River. Nipmuc settlements on the Assabet intersected with the territories of three other related Algonquian-speaking peoples: the Massachusett, Pennacook, and Wampanoag.McAdow 1990: pp. 105‚Äì109 Geography Bridge completed in 2017 for the Assabet River Rail Trail in downtown Maynard The Assabet River rises from a swampy area in Westborough known as the Assabet Reservoir.McAdow 1990: pp. 51‚Äì52 Streams located in the towns of Shrewsbury and Grafton feed the reservoir. From Westborough the river flows northeast , starting at an elevation of and descending through the towns of Northborough, Marlborough, Berlin, Hudson, Stow, Maynard, Acton, and finally Concord, where it merges with the Sudbury River at Egg Rock () at an elevation of to form the Concord River. The Assabet's watershed covers . The Assabet marshes in Stow measure about , and the Assabet River National Wildlife Refuge and environs in Stow, Maynard, Sudbury, and Marlborough encompass . =Average and low flow= According to U.S. Geological Survey records the average flow at the gauge in Maynard is per second. February, March, and April flows average greater than per second. July, August, and September flows average less than per second, with some weekly flows averaging less than per second. Five municipal wastewater treatment plants discharge cleaned water into the Assabet River (three upstream of the Maynard gauge). In summer months this cumulative contribution of more than per day (roughly per second) can be more than half of the river's total volume. =Human geography= As of 2020 there are nine dams on the Assabet River. Seven dams powered mills: Aluminum City, Allen Street, Hudson, Gleasondale, Ben Smith, Powdermill, and Damonmill / Westvale. The Nichols and Tyler dams are modern dams built for flood control. Damonmill Dam is partially breached so it does not retain water, though it slows flow at flood times. A tenth mill dam‚ÄîPaper Mill Dam in Maynard‚Äîwas destroyed by the 1927 flood. As of 2020, 39 road bridges, two Assabet River Rail Trail pedestrian and cycle bridges, one abandoned railroad bridge in Hudson, and one active railroad bridge in Concord cross the river. The Powdermill Dam was constructed to power the American Powder Mills, a complex of 40 buildings situated on along both sides of the river through the towns of Acton, Concord, Maynard, and Sudbury. The complex manufactured gunpowder between 1835 and 1940. Evidence of 23 recorded explosions during that period remains at a few locations along the river.Mark 2014: pp. 78‚Äì82 Acton Hydro Company, Inc., currently owns the dam and is renovating it to generate electricity again. None of the other historic mill dams presently provide hydropower. Biology The Assabet River near Route 2, Concord, Massachusetts Despite its small watershed area and habitat loss to suburbanization, the Assabet River and greater Concord River basin host many native and naturalized species of trees, wildflowers, aquatic plants, birds, fish, mammals, reptiles, amphibians, crustaceans, and insects. Introduced invasive plants threaten the continued health and presence of native plants along the river.McAdow 1990: p. 121 =Native and naturalized species= Trees native to the Assabet River area include red maple, silver maple, black willow, river birch, hemlock, and swamp white oak.McAdow 1990: pp. 122‚Äì124 They are joined by the native shrubs buttonbrush, common elderberry, highbush bluebuerry, multiflora rose, smooth arrowwood, and sweet pepperbush.McAdow 1990: pp. 125‚Äì127 Wildflowers abound along the Assabet's banks. Blue flag and yellow flag‚Äîthe latter particularly abundant between Hudson and Stow‚Äîgrace the riverbanks with color.McAdow 1990: pp. 128‚Äì135 Other wildflowers present in the area include arrow arum, arrowweed, bittersweet nightshade, cardinal flower, jewelweed, joe-pye weed, pickerelweed, purple loosestrife, swamp loosestrife, swamp smartweed, sweetflag, true forget-me- not, and the poisonous water hemlock. Marsh plants habitating the area include various species of burreed (but predominantly Sparganium americanum), cinnamon fern, common cattail, great bulrush, marsh fern, marsh mermaid weed, reed canary grass, royal fern, soft rush, tussock sedge, and wild rice.McAdow 1990: pp. 136‚Äì141 Native aquatic plants present on or under the Assabet's waters include common elodea, coontail, duckweed, low watermilfoil, various species of pondweeds, water celery, watermeal, watershield, white water lily, and yellow pond lily.McAdow 1990: pp. 142‚Äì149 Given the Assabet's proximity to differing habitats such as forests, pastures, fields, and marshes, a wide variety of birds live in or migrate to the area.McAdow 1990: pp. 150‚Äì159 The belted kingfisher‚Äîthe only kingfisher of the northeastern United States‚Äîsummers and sometimes winters on the lower Assabet. The migratory American yellow warbler, Baltimore oriole, common grackle, common yellowthroat, eastern kingbird, gray catbird, northern flicker, tree swallow, and wood thrush inhabit the area in the springs, summers, and sometimes falls. Other species‚Äîblack-capped chickadee, cedar waxwing, downy woodpecker, tufted titmouse, and white-breasted nuthatch‚Äîlive near the Assabet all year round. Some bird species visible from the river inhabit primarily fields, pastures, and old buildings, including American woodcock, barn swallow, bobolink, killdeer, and song sparrow.McAdow 1990: pp. 160‚Äì161 Bobolinks nest in the grass at Orchard Hill in Stow along the Assabet. The barn swallows feed over the water near Tyler Dam in Marlborough; some of them nest in the grass with the bobolinks while others live in a barn near Orchard Hill. A subset of birds living near or on the Assabet prefer marshy environments, including American bittern, black-crowned night heron, great blue heron, green heron, marsh wren, and red-winged blackbird.McAdow 1990: pp. 162‚Äì165 A variety of migratory and nonmigratory ducks habitate the Assabet watershed, including American black duck, blue-winged teal, common merganser, mallard, pied-billed grebe, ring- necked duck, and wood duck.McAdow 1990: pp. 166‚Äì169 Depending on the time of year, one may see some birds of prey along the Assabet. The osprey is uncommon but may be encountered near the Assabet, especially in Stow and Hudson.McAdow 1990: pp. 170‚Äì172 The migratory broad-winged hawk is common in the fall, while the red-tailed hawk lives in the area year-round. American kestrels and northern harriers hunt in the area primarily during the fall. Naturally, multiple fish species inhabit the river. Brook trout, chain pickerel, and largemouth bass are common. The Massachusetts Division of Fisheries and Wildlife stocks brook trout in the Assabet's tributaries, including the above- mentioned Elizabeth Brook, though there are existing natural populations.McAdow 1990: pp. 174‚Äì177 Chain pickerel live in weedy areas along the Assabet. Largemouth bass thrive in the Assabet Reservoir and in the calm waters before Hudson. Other native fish one may encounter on the Assabet include American eel, black crappie, brown bullhead, golden shiner, northern pike, pumpkinseed, white sucker, white perch, yellow perch, and a few other small species. Common mammals living near the Assabet include minks, muskrats, raccoons, red foxes, and white-tailed deer.McAdow 1990: pp. 178‚Äì183 North American river otters are less common but may be encountered along the river. The little brown bat was once abundant in the area before decimation by the fungal disease white-nose syndrome; other bat species remain present in large numbers. A few native reptile species inhabit the Assabet's waters. Some species‚Äîsuch as common snapping turtle, common watersnake, eastern garter snake, painted turtle, and ribbon snake‚Äîare relatively abundant.McAdow 1990: pp. 184‚Äì186 Other reptiles‚ÄîBlanding's turtle and spotted turtle‚Äîare critically endangered, and though present along the Assabet are rarely seen by humans. Various native amphibians inhabit the Assabet River watershed. Common species include American bullfrog, green frog, leopard frogs, and pickerel frog, all of whose vocalizations may be heard during the spring and summer.McAdow 1990: pp. 187‚Äì188 Spring peeper, wood frog, and eastern newt also live in the area. At least one crustacean calls the Assabet home: freshwater crayfish of the genus Cambarus.McAdow 1990: p. 189 The Assabet's shaded banks provide prime mating grounds for damselfly and dragonfly species, as they mate near streams and wetlands and lay their eggs underwater. Damselfly species in the area include bluet, black-winged damselfly, eastern forktail (Massachusetts's most common damselfly), and violet dancer.McAdow 1990: pp. 190‚Äì197 Dragonfly species mating along the Assabet include cherry-faced meadowhawk and other species of the genus Sympetrum, common whitetail, the migratory green darner, and twelve-spotted skimmer. Aquatic insects plying the Assabet's waters include common water strider, giant water bugs of the genus Belostoma, grousewinged backswimmer and other species of backswimmers, various species of water boatmen, and whirligig beetles of genera Dineutus and Gyrinus. =Invasive species= Water caltrop, more commonly known as water chestnut, is an invasive aquatic plant native to western Asia. It was initially introduced in the United States in the 1870s in Cambridge, Massachusetts, followed by deliberate introduction into ponds near the Concord and Sudbury Rivers. It is now an invasive, habitat-destroying plant across many eastern states, including along the Assabet River. On the Assabet River, OARS organizes an annual plant pulling event in early July. Volunteers in canoes hand-pull the surface-floating rosettes of leaves and nuts before the nuts mature and fall to the river bottom. Other invasive species in the Assabet basin include the aquatic plant European water clover and the fish carp. =Extirpated species= Alewife is an anadromous species of herring found in North America, meaning it mates and is born in freshwater but lives most of its life in saltwater. In pre-colonial and early colonial times, during their spring mating season alewife swam from the Atlantic Ocean upstream into the Merrimack River and then up the Concord, Assabet, and Sudbury rivers. The Industrial Age brought mill dams to these rivers. The dams denied alewife access to the upper reaches of the rivers, causing their local extinction. Beaver was common in the Assabet watershed in pre-colonial times. Concord was in part founded as a beaver pelt trading site between Native Americans and English colonists. Around 1630 it was estimated more than 10,000 beaver pelts were being taken annually in land that now makes up Massachusetts and Connecticut. Due to aggressive hunting, European settlers extirpated beaver from Massachusetts by 1750. Reintroduction to the state started in the Berkshires around 1930, then spread east. Beavers once again populate the Assabet River watershed: they are numerous enough that stream culverts under roads need to be periodically cleared of in-progress beaver dams, and beavers down trees on land adjacent to the river for food, dam construction, and den building. Licensed trappers are hired to remove nuisance beaver families. Where not intruding on human space, beavers improve the local ecology. Beaver dams create wetlands which foster wildlife diversity, contribute water to underlying aquifers, and combat summer droughts. Historic floods and flood control The official designation of major flooding on the Assabet River is a water depth of more than and a flow rate of per second as measured at the gauge maintained by the U.S. Geological Survey on a site behind the McDonald's in Maynard. The gauge site is downstream of of the making up the Assabet River drainage.Mark 2011: pp. 59‚Äì65 Major tributaries below the gauge which can contribute to downstream flooding are Fort Pond, Spence, and Nashoba brooks. =1927= According to the National Weather Service, \\"The 1927 hurricane season brought a tropical storm that swept northward across western New England on Nov. 3-4, 1927. As its warm, humid air rose over the mountains and hills, torrential rains fell, causing severe flooding over extensive areas in virtually all of northern New England and the upper Hudson basin in New York. Much of New England had been soaked by rains throughout October. In all, 85 people were lost.\\" Locally, the November 11, 1927, issue of The Maynard News reported damaged bridges, flooding at mill buildings closest to the river, and flooding further east at American Powder Mills. The Waltham Street Bridge‚Äîsituated next to what is now Tedeschi Food Mart in Maynard‚Äîwas destroyed in the flood. The bridge dated to 1840, and was widened to accommodate an electric trolley track and sidewalk in 1900. The bridge was replaced in 1928 and again in 2013. =1936= The Great Flood of 1936 was described as the worst flood in New England since 1850. Damage in Massachusetts was estimated in excess of $200 million at the time. The severe winter of 1935-36 had deep snowfalls and long cold snaps that iced streams and rivers solid. Spring came early, with mild weather and heavy rain. By mid- March, rivers were rising across the state. Locally, the flood damaged bridges and washed out roads. =1955= The 1955 floods occurred when remnants of Hurricane Diane reached New England. The Assabet River crested at , the highest water level measured since record keeping began in 1942. According to a Maynard resident, \\"In August of 1955 my parents brought me to see water flowing over the bridge. We stood on the south side, on Waltham Street.\\" =1968 and 1979= The 1968 and 1979 floods were the first major floods after two flood control dams were built upstream. Both floods peaked at at the gauge. In Maynard the 1968 flood put water over the retaining wall next to the mill buildings, necessitating sandbagging and pumping to save factory equipment belonging to Digital Equipment Corporation, which owned the entire mill complex at the time. The equally high water of January 1979 did not reach the mill because Digital had heightened the retaining wall. Walnut Street flooded: AT&T; had to sandbag its building on the Walnut Street side. =Flood control= Three major and eight minor flood control sites hold back high water in times of floods. The George H. Nichols Dam was built in Westborough in 1968 or 1969, the Tyler Dam in Marlborough in 1965, and the Delaney Complex (on the Elizabeth Brook tributary) in Stow in 1971. The minor sites are on other tributary brooks. Collectively, these have a flood hold-back capacity in excess of 3.5 trillion US gallons (1.3√ó1013 L). The Nichols Dam also serves as a water-providing reserve in times of low water, to help maintain some flow in the river. The two most recent major floods were in 1987 and 2010; for both, water level at the gauge peaked at , and volume was per second. In literature Nathaniel Hawthorne wrote in praise of the river in his collection of short stories Mosses from an Old Manse: > Rowing our boat against the current, between wide meadows, we turn aside > into the Assabeth. A more lovely stream than this, for a mile above its > junction with the Concord, has never flowed on earth, ‚Äî nowhere, indeed, > except to lave the interior of a poet's imagination. It is sheltered from > the breeze by woods and a hillside; so that elsewhere there might be a > hurricane, and here scarcely a ripple across the shaded water.McAdow 1990: > p. 49 Henry David Thoreau regularly visited and often took his students, including Louisa May Alcott, on educational boat trips up the Assabet River. Thoreau wrote a poem titled \\"The Assabet\\" to a love interest; its first stanza references rowing upon the river and reads: > Up this pleasant stream let's row For the livelong summer's day, Sprinkling > foam where'er we go In wreaths as white as driven snow‚Äî Ply the oars, away! > away! Thoreau reflected on the Assabet's natural sensory pleasures in his journal, contrasting them favorably against the heights of human endeavor and creation: > July 10, 1852 Assabet River > I wonder if any Roman emperor ever indulged in such luxury as this ‚Äî of > walking up and down a river in torrid weather with only a hat to shade the > head. What were the baths of Caracalla to this? Now we traverse a long water > plan some two feet deep; now we descend into a darker river valley, where > the bottom is lost sight of and the water rises to our armpits; now we go > over a hard iron pan; now we stoop and go under a low bough of the Salix > nigra; now we slump into soft mud amid the pads of the Nymphaea odorata, at > this hour shut.McAdow 1990: p. 117 See also * Assabet River Rail Trail * Assabet River National Wildlife Refuge * List of rivers of Massachusetts Notes References  Further reading * External links *OARS: Organization for the Assabet, Sudbury and Concord Rivers, a local conservation group *OARS info on boating and fishing, including maps *U.S. Geological Survey, Assabet River, provides current and historic river depths and flow rates Category:Massachusetts natural resources Category:Rivers of Worcester County, Massachusetts Category:Rivers of Middlesex County, Massachusetts Category:Tributaries of the Merrimack River Category:Rivers of Massachusetts Category:Wild and Scenic Rivers of the United States ","title":"Assabet River"},{"id":"2169901","text":"Ian Edginton is a British comic book writer, known for his work on such titles as X-Force, Scarlet Traces, H.

Many magicians hold him in high esteem for his skill and bold accomplishments. Career Max Malini was born in the small town of Ostrow on the borders of Russia and Austria. At a young age, he emigrated to the US with his Jewish family, settling in New York City. He studied juggling at age twelve, but under the tutelage of a fire-eater, ventriloquist, and magician, Professor Seiden, Max began his studies of magic when he was fifteen. As he grew older, he began performing in bars. As his reputation grew, he would sell tickets to see a private show in his hotel room. He specialized in close-up magic, performing with coins and card magic. Malini was part of that rare breed of performer, the itinerant magician, and even rarer breed of magician in that he performed magic based on sleight of hand rather than large illusions. (It made traveling much easier.) His performance style was marked by great audacity. For instance, according to magician Paul Daniels in his show \\"The Magic of Max Malini,\\" Max, speaking in a heavy Yiddish accent, would often walk up to a celebrity and, unannounced, bite a button from their cuff and magically restore it. He would also borrow a gentleman's hat for a coin effect, where he would cover the coin and attempt to make it flip over. This he would fail to do, but would finish by lifting the hat to reveal a block of ice under the hat, barely large enough to fit. One of Malini's signature routines was the blindfold card stab, which operated as follows. On a table a pack of cards were mixed and swirled around by a lady from the audience. The audience would blindfold Max with handkerchiefs. Malini then requested the name of a playing card, and when someone called out a card, he would stab a knife into the cards, then raise it up in the air, thereupon it was seen that he had impaled the correct card. He died in Honolulu, Hawaii, on October 3, 1942. He had been in poor health for some time and his last performances were done sitting in a chair. Though his cremation was in Hawaii and done by Oahu Cemetery, 2162 Nuuanu Avenue, his ashes were received in Chicago on January 5, 1943, and signed for by Myron Weinstein Brothers Memorial Chapel, 1300 West Devon Avenue, Chicago. His ashes are interred in the Waldheim Jewish Cemetery, 1400 Des Plaines Ave, Forest Park, IL 60130, Gate 47, Lot 137, Section D, Row 11, Grave 6, next to those of his first wife Lizzie Katz. His grave is unmarked.

He has been hailed as an intellectual genius and an Afrikaner hero.  His early years, before and during the Boer War  Marais was born in Pretoria, the thirteenth and last child of Jan Christiaan Nielen Marais and Catharina Helena Cornelia van Niekerk. He attended school in Pretoria, Boshof and Paarl, and much of his early education was in English, as were his earliest poems. He matriculated at the age of sixteen. After leaving school, he worked in Pretoria as a legal clerk and then as a journalist before becoming owner (at the age of twenty) of a newspaper called Land en Volk (Country and (the Afrikaner) People). He involved himself deeply in local politics. He began taking opiates at an early age and graduated to morphine (then considered to be non-habit forming and safe) very soon thereafter. He became addicted, and his addiction ruled his affairs and actions to a greater or lesser extent throughout his life. When asked why he took drugs, he variously pleaded ill health, insomnia and, later, the death of his young wife as a result of the birth of his only child. Much later, he blamed accidental addiction while ill with malaria in Mozambique. Some claim his use of drugs was experimental and influenced by the philosophy of de Quincey.Rousseau, L., 1974, Die Groot Verlange, Cape Town: Human & Rousseau Marais married Aletta Beyers, but she died from puerperal fever a year later, eight days after the birth of their son. Eug√®ne Charles Gerard was Marais' only child. In 1897 ‚Äî still in his mid-twenties ‚Äì Marais went to London to read medicine. However, under pressure from his friends, he entered the Inner Temple to study law. He qualified as an advocate. When the Boer War broke out in 1899, he was put on parole as an enemy alien in London. During the latter part of the war he joined a German expedition that sought to ship ammunition and medicines to the Boer Commandos via Portuguese East Africa (now Mozambique). However, he was struck down in this tropical area by malaria and, before the supplies could be delivered to the Boers, the war ended.  After the war  From 1905 Marais studied nature in the Waterberg ('Water mountain'), a wilderness area north of Pretoria, and wrote in his native Afrikaans about the animals he observed. His studies of termites led him to conclude that the colony ought to be considered as a single organism, a prescient insight that predated the elaboration of the idea by Richard Dawkins. In the Waterberg, Marais also studied the black mamba, spitting cobra and puff adder. Moreover, he observed a specific troop of baboons at length, and from these studies there sprang numerous magazine articles and the books My Friends the Baboons and The Soul of the Ape. He is acknowledged as the father of the scientific study of the behaviour of animals, known as Ethology.  Theft of his work  As the leader of the Second Afrikaans Language Movement, Marais preferred to write in Afrikaans, and his work was translated into various languages either late in his life or after his death. His book Die Siel van die Mier (The Soul of the Ant, but usually given in English as the Soul of the White Ant) was plagiarised by Nobel laureate Maurice Maeterlinck, who published La Vie des Termites (translated into English as The Life of Termites or The Life of White Ants), an entomological book,\\"Die Huisgenoot\\", Nasionale Pers, 6 January 1928, cover story. in what has been called \\"a classic example of academic plagiarism\\" by University of London's professor of biology, David Bignell. Marais accused Maeterlinck of having used his concept of the \\"organic unity\\" of the termitary in his book. Marais had published his ideas on the termitary in the South African Afrikaans-language press, both in Die Burger in January 1923 and in Huisgenoot, which featured a series of articles on termites under the title \\"Die Siel van die Mier\\" (The Soul of the (White) Ant) from 1925 to 1926. Maeterlinck's book, with almost identical content, was published in 1926. It is alleged that Maeterlinck had come across Eugene Marais' series of articles, and that it would have been easy for Maeterlinck to translate from Afrikaans to French, since Maeterlinck knew Dutch and had already made several translations from Dutch into French before.d'Assonville VD, Eugene Marais and the Waterberg, Marnix 2008 It was common at the time for worthy articles published in Afrikaans to be reproduced in Flemish and Dutch magazines and journals. Marais sent a letter to Dr. Winifred de Kock in London about Maeterlinck, in which he wrote that > The famous author had paid me the left-handed compliment of cribbing the > most important part of my work... He clearly desired his readers to infer > that he had arrived at certain of my theories (the result of ten years of > hard labour in the veld) by his own unaided reason, although he admits that > he never saw a termite in his life. You must understand that it was not > merely plagiarism of the spirit of a thing, so to speak. He has copied page > after page verbally. Supported by a coterie of Afrikaner Nationalist friends, Marais sought justice through the South African press and attempted an international lawsuit. This was to prove financially impossible and the case was not pursued. However, Marais gained a measure of renown as the aggrieved party and as an Afrikaner researcher who had opened himself up to plagiarism because he published in Afrikaans out of nationalistic loyalty. Marais brooded at the time of the scandal: \\"I wonder whether Maeterlinck blushes when he reads such things [critical acclaim], and whether he gives a thought to the injustice he does to the unknown Boer worker?\\" Maeterlinck's own words in The Life of Termites indicate that the possible discovery or accusation of plagiarism worried him: > It would have been easy, in regard to every statement, to allow the text to > bristle with footnotes and references. In some chapters there is not a > sentence but would have clamoured for these; and the letterpress would have > been swallowed up by vast masses of comment, like one of those dreadful > books we hated so much at school. There is a short bibliography at the end > of the volume which will no doubt serve the same purpose. Despite these misgivings, there is no reference to Eug√®ne Marais in the bibliography. Maeterlinck's other works on entomology include The Life of the Ant (1930). Professor VE d'Assonville wrote about Maeterlinck as \\"the Nobel Prize winner who had never seen a termite in his whole life and had never put a foot on the soil of Africa, least of all in the Waterberg.\\". Robert Ardrey, an admirer of Eug√®ne Marais's, attributed Marais' later suicide to this act of plagiarism and theft of intellectual property by Maeterlinck.Robert Ardrey,The Territorial Imperative: A Personal Inquiry into the Animal Origins of Property and Nations (1966) Ardrey said in his introduction to The Soul of the Ape, published in 1969, that 'As a scientist he was unique, supreme in his time, yet a worker in a science unborn.' He also refers to Marais' work at length in his book African Genesis.  Death  There is evidence that Marais' time and research in the Waterberg brought him great peace and joy and provided him with artistic inspiration. In the poem Waar Tebes in die stil woestyn, he writes (as translated into English by J. W. Marchant) 'There would I know peace once more, where Tebes in the quiet desert lifts it mighty rockwork on high ...'. (Tebus is one of the principal peaks of the area). That said, Marais was a long-term morphine addict and suffered from melancholy, insomnia, depression and feelings of isolation. In 1936, deprived of morphine for some days, he borrowed a shotgun on the pretext of killing a snake and shot himself in the chest. The wound was not fatal, and Marais therefore put the gun barrel in his mouth and pulled the trigger. He did so on the farm Pelindaba, belonging to his friend Gustav Preller. For those who are familiar with the dark moods of certain of Marais' poems, there is a black irony here; in Zulu, Pelindaba means 'the end of the business' ‚Äì although the more common interpretation is 'Place of great gatherings'. Marais and his wife Aletta are buried in the Heroes' Acre, Pretoria.  Legacy  Marais' work as a naturalist, although by no means trivial (he was one of the first scientists to practise ethology and was repeatedly acknowledged as such by Robert Ardrey and others), gained less public attention and appreciation than his contributions as a literalist. He discovered the Waterberg Cycad, which was named after him (Encephalartos eugene-maraisii). He was the first person to study the behaviour of wild primates, and his observations continue to be cited in contemporary evolutionary biology. He is among the greatest of the Afrikaner poets and remains one of the most popular, although his output was not large. Opperman described him as the first professional Afrikaner poet; Marais believed that craft was as important as inspiration for poetry. Along with J.H.H. de Waal and G.S. Preller, he was a leading light in the Second Afrikaans Language Movement in the period immediately after the Second Boer War, which ended in 1902. Some of his finest poems deal with the wonders of life and nature, but he also wrote about inexorable death. Marais was isolated in some of his beliefs. He was a self-confessed pantheist and claimed that the only time he entered a church was for weddings.Philip Copeman God's First Fisherman 2008, p. 44 An assessment of Marais' status as an Afrikaner hero was published by historian Sandra Swart. Although an Afrikaner patriot, Marais was sympathetic to the cultural values of the black tribal peoples of the Transvaal; this is seen in poems such as Die Dans van die Re√´n (The Dance of the Rain). The following translation of Marais' Winternag\\" is by J. W. Marchant: \\"Winter's Night\\" O the small wind is frigid and spare and bright in the dim light and bare as wide as God's merciful boon the veld lies in starlight and gloom and on the high lands spread through burnt bands the grass-seed, astir, is like beckoning hands. O East-wind gives mournful measure to song Like the lilt of a lovelorn lass who's been wronged In every grass fold bright dewdrop takes hold and promptly pales to frost in the cold! While the above translation is generally faithful, and is a fine poem in English, it does not quite capture the terse directness of the Afrikaans language, which makes Afrikaans poetry so bittersweet and evocative, striking straight to the heart and soul. Below follows a translation by Farrell Hope, which may closer reflect the original Afrikaans idiom. Note the above version by J. W. Marchant, as well as the third version below by At de Lange, both translate the Afrikaans word in the poem skade (damage) as if it was skadu (shade). This is a common error in translating the poem and misses the point Marais was making: that the British forces had destroyed the Boer farms. \\"Winternight\\" O cold is the slight wind, and keen. Bare and bright in dim light is seen, as vast as the graces of God, the veld's starlit and fire-scarred sod. To the high edge of the lands, spread through the scorched sands, new seed-grass is stirring like beckoning hands. O mournful the tune of the East-wind refrain, like the song of a girl who loved but in vain. One drop of dew glistens on each grass-blade's fold and fast does it pale to frost in the cold! An English translation by At de Lange preserves the musicality of the poem quite well: \\"Winter's Night\\" O cold is the windlet and spare. And bright in the dim-light and bare, as vast as God's mercy has bade, lie the plains in starlight and shade. And high in the ridges, spreaded in burnt ditches, are the grass plumes stirring like beckoning hands. O tune with grief laden on the east wind's drone, like the song of a maiden in her love made alone. In each grass blade's fold a drop of dew gleams bold, and it pales quickly to frost in the cold!

Rex and God Head, is a heavy-metal vocalist, musician and producer known primarily for his work with Ulver and Arcturus. Biography Born in Oslo but raised in Cascais, Kristoffer Rygg was 16 years old when he formed Ulver, considered one of the most iconoclastic bands from the Norwegian black metal scene. He was an instrumental instigator for later subcategories such as avant-garde metal. In addition, he was vocalist for Borknagar (1995‚Äì1997) and Arcturus (1993‚Äì2003), both of which comprise many eminent musicians from the early Norwegian black metal scene. Rygg was responsible for introducing Borknagar to the singer who replaced him, ICS Vortex, when he resigned from the band. Kristoffer Rygg possesses a wide range of vocal textures and styles, ranging from baritone, countertenor, crooning and even black metal style screaming. He often records multiple tracks of himself to create dense male choirs on albums such as the majority of the vocals on Kveldssanger. In 2005, Rygg collaborated with Portuguese musician/producer Daniel Cardoso in the project Head Control System. The music was described by the label as \\"groovy rock/metal with progressive edges and cinematic components.\\" Their first and only full-length, entitled Murder Nature was released on 4 April 2006 through The End Records. In recent years Rygg has been involved in freeform/improvisational project √Üthenor which includes notable musicians such as Stephen O'Malley of Sunn O))), Daniel O'Sullivan of Guapo and David Tibet of Current 93. In April 2008 he played five concerts with √Üthenor. It was his first time on stage in over a decade. Rygg has since participated in several mini-tours and concerts with √Üthenor. Their triple residency at the Oslo jazz club Bl√• resulted in the much-acclaimed 4th album En Form for Bl√•. In 2009, fifteen years after their only concert back in 1993, he decided to reintroduce Ulver live in concert. The first show was hosted by the Lillehammer Norwegian Literature Festival Norwegian Festival of Literature, and initiated by the late author Stig S√¶terbakken. A year later, and after a series of shows around Europe, Rygg stood in front of a full house at the main stage of Oslo's National Opera & Ballet. A DVD/Blu-ray from the event was released commercially,\\"\\" and includes liner notes by Rygg and S√¶terbakken. Rygg owns and operates Jester Records, an underground label specializing in experimental music, including Ulver, which has since their early metal days metamorphosed into a musical composite difficult to categorize. He has acted as guest vocalist, lyricist, engineer, producer, remixer etc. for a very large list of other artists, including Alkaline Trio, Mindless Self Indulgence, Genghis Tron, Darkthrone, Mayhem, Emperor, Ihsahn, Dimmu Borgir, The Gathering, Merzbow, Carpenter Brut and Sunn O))) et al.

Her dates of birth and death are not known. Mary Kent appeared in many playbills from 1692 onwards in London, playing minor parts in the United Company until the company's tumultuous breakup in 1695. She and her husband remained with the depleted parent troupe when the senior actors walked out to set up their own cooperative company, and during the consequent brief actor shortage at Drury Lane, she played more important parts, notably Flareit in Colley Cibber's Love's Last Shift and young Tom Fashion (as a breeches role) in John Vanbrugh's The Relapse in 1697. This role came at a time when it was common for boys to be portrayed by actresses and her casting was described as perhaps \\"an attempt to defuse the homosexual suggestions in his (Tom Fashion's) relationship with Coupler.\\" She continued to appear in minor roles at Drury Lane up to 1710, and had her first and only taste of female lead roles at the theatre operated by William Penkethman at Greenwich during the summer season of 1710. After this experience she did not return to supporting roles, but instead worked at a puppet theatre from 1710 to 1714. Only when John Rich opened his new theatrical enterprise in Lincoln's Inn Fields in December 1714 did she return to the stage, appearing in playbills for Rich's company up to 1718.

For his activities, he earned the nickname \\"God's smuggler\\". He is known for having prayed \\"Lord, make seeing eyes blind\\" when he was stopped at the border of a communist country for his car to be inspected. Biography Van der Bijl was born in Sint Pancras, the Netherlands, the fourth of six children of a poor, near-deaf blacksmith and an invalid mother.God's Secret Agent, Janet Benge, Geoff Benge, YWAM Publishing (2005) . He told John and Elizabeth Sherrill, when they transcribed his memories for their book God's Smuggler, \\"From the day I first put on wooden shoes ‚Äì klompen we call them in Holland ‚Äì I dreamed of derring-do\\". In the 1940s, he enlisted in the colonial army of the Dutch East Indies during the rebellion that would eventually form Indonesia, which first adventure initially had unpleasant results;J. Lee GRADY, Secret Agent Man, Charisma mag, USA, February 28, 2005 he endured a period of severe emotional stress while he was serving as a soldier. He was wounded in the ankle during the fighting; during his rehabilitation, he read the Bible obsessively, eventually converting to Christianity. Van der Bijl studied at the WEC Missionary Training College in Glasgow, Scotland. Ministry In July 1955, van der Bijl visited communist Poland \\"to see how my brothers are doing\\", a reference to the underground church there.F.P., Portes ouvertes, une histoire dans l‚ÄôHistoire, La voix du nord, France, October 3, 2012 He signed up on a government-controlled communist tour, the only legal way to be in the country. During that time, he felt called to respond to the Biblical Commission, \\"Wake up, strengthen what remains and is about to die\\" (). That was the start of a mission leading him into several communist-ruled countries in which religious belief was actively persecuted. In 1957, he travelled to the Soviet Union‚Äôs capital, Moscow, in a Volkswagen Beetle, which later became the symbol of Open Doors, the organization he founded. An older couple, the Whetstras, had given him their new car because they had prayed about it and believed that Andrew would need the car. A man who lived in Amersfoort, Karl de Graaf, claimed that God told him to teach Van der Bijl to drive. Later, when Van der Bijl was in a refugee camp in West Germany, Philip Whetstra called Van der Bijl to come to the Whetstras' new house in Amsterdam. Although Van der Bijl was violating the laws of all of the countries that he visited by bringing religious literature, he often placed the material in view when he was stopped at police checkpoints, as a gesture of his trust in what he believed to be God's protection.Brother Andrew, with John and Elizabeth Sherrill. God's Smuggler (1967), pp. 174, 198. That was the realization of his childhood dreams of darings-do. Van der Bijl visited China in the 1960s, after the Cultural Revolution had created a hostile policy towards Christianity and other religions, during the so-called Bamboo Curtain. He went to Czechoslovakia when the suppression by Soviet troops of the Prague Spring had put an end to relative religious freedom there. He encouraged Czech believers and gave Bibles to the Russian occupying forces. During that decade, he also made his first visits to Cuba after the Cuban Revolution. =God's Smuggler= In 1967, he published the first edition of God's Smuggler, written with John and Elizabeth Sherrill.Timothy C. MORGAN, Brother Andrew's Prophetic Plea: Stop Murdering Terrorists, Christianity today, USA, Mar 18, 2013 God's Smuggler tells the story of his early childhood, conversion to Christianity, and adventures as a Bible-smuggler behind the Iron Curtain. By 2002, it had sold over 10 million copies in thirty-five languages.God's Smuggler, Brother Andrew with John and Elizabeth Sherrill, 2002, page 8. By 2016 over 17 million copies had been sold. A comic book adaptation of God's Smuggler was published in 1972 by Spire Christian Comics. Middle East After the fall of communism in Europe, he shifted his focus to the Middle East and has worked to strengthen the church in the Muslim world. In the 1970s, he visited war-torn Lebanon several times, stating that \\"global conflict in the end times will focus on Israel and its neighbouring countries.\\" =Light Force and Secret Believers= In the 1990s, van der Bijl again travelled several times more to the Middle East. In his book Light Force, he tells of Arab and Lebanese churches in Lebanon, Israel and Israeli-occupied areas expressing great delight at the mere visit of a fellow Christian from abroad since they felt that the church in the Western world at large was largely ignoring them. In similar fashion, van der Bijl and a companion, Al Janssen, visited Hamas and PLO leaders, including Ahmed Yassin and Yasser Arafat, and handed out Bibles.Citation needed Van der Bijl's tenth book, Secret Believers: What Happens When Muslims Believe in Christ, was released on 1 July 2007.Library of Congress, LCCN Permalink 2007000476.

It was first performed on February 10, 1920, by General J√≥zef Haller at Puck (Putzig). In the early spring of 1945, following the Polish-Soviet advance into Pomerania, a number of such ceremonies took place in several locations. The most famous 1945 Weddings to the Sea were performed by the soldiers of the Polish Army on March 17, 1945 in Mrze≈ºyno (Regam√ºnde), and on March 18 in newly captured port of Ko≈Çobrzeg (Kolberg).  1920 Wedding to the Sea  In October 1920, General Jozef Haller was named commandant of the Pomeranian Front of the Polish Army, a unit created to peacefully recover former German Empire's province of Pomerelia, which was granted to the Second Polish Republic by the Versailles Treaty. On 18 January 1920, units of the 16th Infantry Division entered Torun (Thorn), and in the following days, Polish soldiers moved northwards, finally reaching the Baltic Sea coast on February 10. Their progress was slow but steady, with a few incidents of sabotage, carried out by the retreating Germans. Site of the 1920 Wedding in Puck - Kashubia Early in the morning of February 10, General Haller and his staff, on the way from Torun (Thorn) to Puck, met at Danzig Hbf. rail station with members of Polish community of the Free City of Danzig. Haller, fearing a German provocation, stayed in the train, which was entered by Dr. Jozef Wybicki, grandson of Jozef Wybicki, who handed to him two platinum rings, funded by Polish families of Danzig. One of the rings was later thrown into the sea in Puck. After the meeting, the train with Haller and other Polish officials headed for Puck, where it was welcomed by crowds of Kashubians. At the Puck Rail Station the General mounted a horse, heading towards the sea with a unit of uhlans. The symbolic event was witnessed, among others, by Wincenty Witos, Stanislaw Wojciechowski, Maciej Rataj, Pomeranian Voivode Stefan Laszewski, Polish envoy to Free City of Danzig Maciej Biesiadecki, General Kazimierz Sosnkowski, Dr Jozef Wybicki, and the \\"King of the Kashubians, Antoni Abraham\\". Main point of the ceremony was marked by a Roman Catholic service, with a sermon told by Reverend Jozef Wrycza. Flag of the Polish Navy was blessed, and then, to the salvo of 21 guns, it was raised on a mast by sailors Eugeniusz P≈Çawski and Florian Napierala. This symbolically meant that from then on, Polish seacoast was guarded by the Navy. Poland's Wedding to the Sea by Wojciech Kossak. Painting of the 1920 ceremony in Puck General Haller in his memoirs (published in 1964 in London) wrote that on that day, the Bay of Puck was frozen, so local fishermen cut an ice hole, into which Haller threw the ring. Before it fell into the water, the ring rolled on the ice: \\"Several fishermen ran after the ring, but none of them managed to catch it, and it fell into the icy water. When I asked why they did not catch it, the fishermen prophetically answered they would catch it in Szczecin\\". After throwing the ring into the water, Haller said the following words: \\"In the name of the Holy Republic of Poland, I, General Jozef Haller, am taking control of this ancient Slavic Baltic Sea shore\\". Wojciech Kossak, inspired by these events, painted in 1931 \\"Polish Wedding to the Sea\\". The 1920 wedding to the sea took place north of the Port of Puck, in the area which belonged to the Naval Airforce. A commemorative post was later erected there, with a Polish eagle and the date. The post was destroyed during the 1939 German Invasion of Poland. Its replica now stands in the Port of Puck, next to the bust of General Haller. On February 11, 1920, a day after the symbolic wedding, Kashubian fishermen invited Haller to Wielka Wies (now W≈Çadys≈Çawowo), to carry out another ceremony, this time in the open waters of Baltic Sea. Haller accepted the invitation, and entered a cutter \\"Gwiazda Morza\\" (\\"Star of the Sea\\"). This made the General a very popular person among the locals. Haller himself purchased a plot of land near Wielka Wies, founding a district called Hallerowo. The town of W≈Çadys≈Çawowo was created after a merger of Wielka Wies and Hallerowo.  1945 Weddings to the Sea  In the early spring of 1945, a number of symbolic Weddings to the Sea took place along the Baltic Sea coast. The most well-known such ceremonies were on March 17, 1945, at the town of Mrze≈ºyno (Regam√ºnde), and on March 18 at Ko≈Çobrzeg (Kolberg). This is what Polish historian Hieronim Kroczynski wrote in his book \\"Polskie tradycje morskie 967-1945\\" (\\"Polish Naval Traditions 967 - 1945\\"): \\"In early 1945, the First Polish Army, formed in the Soviet Union, and subordinated to the Soviet 1st Belorussian Front, reached Pomerania, the ancient land of the Piasts, which was to become Polish again. During the Pomeranian Operation, as our units approached the sea, Polish soldiers remembered the historic 1920 Wedding to the Sea. The 1945 ceremony took place in war situation, as until the end of the war, the 10-kilometer wide strip of coast was officially regarded as frontline. The headquarters of the First Army decided that its units were to organize their own weddings. These ceremonies took place from March 15 to April 6, along the Baltic Sea coast from Dziwnow (Berg Dievenow) to Gdynia (Gdingen). In the spirit of the 1920 tradition, rings were thrown into the water, and oaths of allegiance to the sea were sworn by the participants. Furthermore, in several cases flags of military units were dipped in water. On March 17, 1945, First Warsaw Cavalry Brigade had its own ceremony at Mrze≈ºyno, and on March 18, main ceremony of both First and Second Army took place at Ko≈Çobrzeg\\". The flag on the left marks the site of the 1945 Wedding in Ko≈Çobrzeg Polish historian Hieronim Kroczynski from Kolobrzeg, who has been investigating Polish weddings to the sea says that the first ceremony of this kind in 1945 took place on March 8, near the village of Grzybow, west of Kolobrzeg. On that day, a patrol of the 16th Infantry Regiment reached the shore. Colonel Wladyslaw Jurak, who had been a schoolteacher before the war, told the soldiers about the 1920 wedding, and the group spontaneously decided to repeat the ceremony. News of this event reached headquarters of the 6th Infantry Division, to which the 16th Infantry Regiment belonged. Soon, General Michal Rola-Zymierski found out about it, and on March 10, 1945, text of the oath taken during weddings to the sea was printed by a Polish Army newspaper \\"Zwyciezymy\\": \\"I swear to you, Polish Sea, that I, a soldier of the Homeland, faithful son of the Polish nation, will not abandon you. I swear to you that I will always follow this road, the road which has been paved by the State National Council, the road which has led me to the sea. I will guard you, I will not hesitate to shed my blood for the Fatherland, neither will I hesitate to give my life so that you do not return to Germany. You will remain Polish forever\\". Soon afterwards, a number of weddings took place: * March 12 at Mrzezyno, * March 15 at Dziwnowek, by soldiers of the 2nd Warsaw Infantry Division, in which Wojciech Jaruzelski served, * March 17 again at Mrzezyno, by soldiers of the 1st Warsaw Cavalry Brigade, * March 17, 18, 19, and 20 at Kolobrzeg, by soldiers of various units, and at different locations within the city, * April 6 at Gdynia. = Mrze≈ºyno (Regam√ºnde) = On March 17, 1945, two fully armed regiments of uhlans of the First Warsaw Cavalry Brigade stood ready at the main market square at Gryfice (Greifenberg). Following the order of their commandant, Major Stanislaw Arkuszewski, the soldiers headed towards Mrze≈ºyno, via Trzebiatow (Treptow an der Rega). After reaching the coastline, corporal Sochaczewski and uhlan Kobylinski rode their horses into the water, throwing two rings, which they had received from Major Arkuszewski. At the same time, uhlans of the 2nd and 3rd Regiments said the following words: \\"We swear eternal allegiance to the sea\\". Some sources claim that the oath was taken only by Major Arkuszewski. The tradition of the 1945 wedding is still alive in Mrze≈ºyno. Every year, patriotic events take place on March 17, and the ceremony is repeated by mounted reenactors, with rings thrown into the sea. = Ko≈Çobrzeg (Kolberg) = First Soviet units appeared in western suburbs of Ko≈Çobrzeg (Kolberg) on March 4, 1945. The Battle of Ko≈Çobrzeg began on the same day. By March 17, the Germans were pushed back to the beach and the sea, and in the night of March 17/18, the defenders of the city decided to abandon their lines, and evacuate most units to Swinem√ºnde. The ceremony took place on March 18 in the evening. Polish historian Pawel Pawlowski, manager of the Museum of Polish Weapons at Ko≈Çobrzeg says that the town was chosen for the main 1945 Wedding to the Sea due to its symbolic importance, as the Germans turned it into a fortress (Festung Kolberg). Furthermore, Nazi propaganda turned the 1807 Siege of Kolberg into a myth, making an expensive film about it. The decision about the main Ko≈Çobrzeg ceremony was taken on March 18 in the morning, after the hostilities had ended. On the same day in the evening, soldiers of the 7th Infantry Regiment of the First Polish Army were to take part in the wedding, which was organized by Colonel Piotr Jaroszewicz, who later became the Prime Minister of Poland. The ceremony began at 4 p.m. Central European Time, or at 6 p.m. Moscow Time, which was used by Soviet forces and Communist Polish troops. At this hour, some 200-300 soldiers of the 7th Regiment stood by the ruins of a fort near the entrance to the Port of Ko≈Çobrzeg. Specially constructed stand was filled with political officers, while the nearby lighthouse was in ruins, blown up by German engineers. The evening was cloudy, and soon it became to get dark. The ceremony began with a Roman Catholic service, then Polish national flag was raised, followed by a speech of Major Stanislaw Russijan, commandant of the 7th Regiment. The orchestra played Polish anthem, and another speech was given by Jaroszewicz, who said, among others: \\"Remember this day, as it is history. Future generations will talk about this event with respect, like we talk about our great ancestors. You are creating history, like once it was created by Boleslaw Chrobry and Wladyslaw Krzywousty. You have gone the right way, from the Oka river to the Baltic, you have not chosen the wrong way, through the sands of Iran, and the swamps of Italy. That is why you have captured Ko≈Çobrzeg\\". The ring was thrown into the sea by Corporal Franciszek Niewidziajlo, who himself was born in Kresy, near Zbaraz. Niewidziajlo also gave a speech, saying: \\"We have come here, to the Sea, after a hard and bloody effort. We see that our effort has not been wasted. We swear that we will never leave you. By throwing this ring into your waves, I am marrying you, because you have always been and always be ours\\".

The conquest resulted in the destruction of the Visigothic Kingdom and the establishment of the Umayyad wilaya of Al-Andalus. The conquest marks the westernmost expansion of both the Umayyad Caliphate and Muslim rule into Europe. During the caliphate of the Umayyad Caliph Al-Walid I, forces led by Tariq ibn Ziyad disembarked in early 711 in Gibraltar at the head of an army consisting of Berbers from north Africa. After defeating the Visigothic usurper Roderic at the decisive Battle of Guadalete, Tariq was reinforced by an Arab force led by his superior wali Musa ibn Nusayr and continued northward. By 717, the combined Arab-Berber force had crossed the Pyrenees into Septimania. They occupied further territory in Gaul until 759. Background six kings\\" in an Umayyad fresco in Qasr Amra, modern-day Jordan (710-750)Drayson, \\"Ways of Seeing\\". The historian al-Tabari transmits a tradition attributed to the Caliph Uthman who stated that the road to Constantinople was through Hispania, \\"Only through Spain can Constantinople be conquered. If you conquer (Spain) you will share the reward of those who conquer (Constantinople).\\" The conquest of Hispania followed the conquest of the Maghreb. Walter Kaegi says Tabari's tradition is dubious, arguing that conquest of the far western reaches of the Mediterranean Sea was motivated by military, political and religious opportunities. He considers that it was not a shift in direction due to the Muslims failing to conquer Constantinople in 678. Precisely what happened in Iberia in the early 8th century is uncertain. There is one contemporary Christian source, the Chronicle of 754 (which ends on that date), regarded as reliable but often vague. There are no contemporary Muslim accounts, and later Muslim compilations, such as that of Al-Maqqari from the 17th century, reflect later ideological influence. This paucity of early sources means that detailed specific claims need to be regarded with caution. The Umayyads took control of Hispania from the Visigoths, who had ruled for roughly 300 years. At the time of the conquest, the Visigothic upper class was beginning to fracture, and had many problems with succession and maintaining power. This was partially due to the fact that the Visigoths were only 1-2% of the population, which made it difficult to maintain control over rebelling populations. The ruler at the time was King Roderic, though this is somewhat contentious. The manner of King Roderic's ascent to the throne is unclear; there are accounts of a dispute with Achila II, son of his predecessor Wittiza. Later regnal lists, which cite Achila and omit Roderic, are consistent with the contemporary account of civil war. Numismatic evidence suggests a division of royal authority, with several coinages being struck, and that Achila II remained king of the Tarraconsense (the Ebro basin) and Septimania until circa 713. The nearly contemporary Chronicle of 754 describes Roderic as a usurper who earned the allegiance of other Goths by deception, while the less reliable late-ninth century Chronicle of Alfonso III shows a clear hostility towards Oppa, bishop of Seville (or Toledo) and probably a brother of Wittiza, who appears in an unlikely heroic dialogue with Pelagius. There is also a story of one Julian, count of Ceuta, whose wife or daughter was raped by Roderic and who sought help from Tangier. However, these stories are not included in the earliest accounts of the conquest.Rucquoi notes that the tale of Count Julian's wife or daughter does not appear in the Chronicle of 754 and considers it to be \\"probably a legend\\", but considers there may be more truth in the stories concerning Wittiza's family; Invasion According to the later chronicler Ibn Abd al-Hakam, the Tangier governor Tariq ibn Ziyad led a raiding force of approximately 1,700 men from North Africa to southern Spain in 711. However, 12,000 seems a more accurate figure. Ibn Abd al-Hakam reports, one and a half centuries later, that \\"the people of Andalus did not observe them, thinking that the vessels crossing and recrossing were similar to the trading vessels which for their benefit plied backwards and forwards\\". They defeated the Visigothic army, led by King Roderic, in a decisive battle at Guadalete in 712. Tariq's forces were then reinforced by those of his superior, the wali Musa ibn Nusayr, who planned a second invasion, and within a few years both took control of more than two-thirds of the Iberian Peninsula. The second invasion comprised 18 thousand mostly Arab troops, who rapidly captured Seville and then defeated Roderick's supporters at M√©rida and met up with Tariq's troops at Talavera. The following year the combined forces continued into Galicia and the northeast, capturing L√©on, Astorga and Zaragoza. According to the Muslim historian Al-Tabari,See: History of the Prophets and Kings (Tarikh al-Tabari) Iberia was first invaded some sixty years earlier during the caliphate of Uthman (Rashidun era). Another prominent Muslim historian of the 13th century, Ibn Kathir,See: Al-Bidayah wa al-Nihayah (Tarikh ibn Kathir) quoted the same narration, pointing to a campaign led by Abd Allah bin Nafi al Husayn and Abd Allah bin Nafi al Abd al Qays in 32 AH. However, this putative invasion is not accepted by modern historians. The first expedition led by Tariq consisted mainly of Berbers, who had themselves only recently come under Muslim influence. It is probable that this army represented a continuation of a historic pattern of large-scale raids into Iberia dating to the pre‚ÄìIslamic period, and hence it has been suggested that actual conquest was not originally planned. Both the Chronicle of 754 and later Muslim sources speak of raiding activity in previous years, and Tariq's army may have been present for some time before the decisive battle. It has been argued that this possibility is supported by the fact that the army was led by a Berber and that Musa, who was the Umayyad Governor of North Africa, only arrived the following year ‚Äì the governor had not deigned to lead a mere raid, but hurried across once the unexpected triumph became clear. The historian Abd al-WƒÅ·∏•id Dhann≈´n ·π¨ƒÅhƒÅ mentions that several Arab-Muslim writers mention the fact that Tariq decided to cross the strait without informing his superior and wali Musa. The Chronicle of 754 states that many townspeople fled to the hills rather than defend their cities, which might support the view that this was expected to be a temporary raid rather than a permanent change of government. The Chronicle of 754 stated that \\"the entire army of the Goths, which had come with him [Roderic] fraudulently and in rivalry out of hopes of the Kingship, fled\\". This is the only contemporary account of the battle and the paucity of detail led many later historians to invent their own. The location of the battle, though not clear, was probably the Guadalete River. Roderic was believed to have been killed, and a crushing defeat would have left the Visigoths largely leaderless and disorganized, partly because the ruling Visigoth population is estimated to have been a mere 1 to 2% of the total population. While this isolation is said to have been \\"a reasonably strong and effective instrument of government\\"; it was highly \\"centralised to the extent that the defeat of the royal army left the entire land open to the invaders\\". The resulting power vacuum, which may have indeed caught Tariq completely by surprise, would have aided the Muslim conquest. It may have been equally welcome to the Hispano-Roman peasants who were probably ‚Äì as D.W. Lomax claims ‚Äì disillusioned by the prominent legal, linguistic and social divide between them and the \\"barbaric\\" and \\"decadent\\" Visigoth royal family. In 714, Musa ibn Nusayr headed north-west up the Ebro river to overrun the western Basque regions and the Cantabrian mountains all the way to Gallaecia, with no relevant or attested opposition. During the period of the second (or first, depending on the sources) Arab governor Abd al-Aziz ibn Musa (714‚Äì716), the principal urban centres of Catalonia surrendered. In 714, his father, Musa ibn Nusayr, advanced and overran Soria, the western Basque regions, Palencia, and as far west as Gij√≥n or Le√≥n, where a Berber governor was appointed with no recorded opposition. The northern areas of Iberia drew little attention from the conquerors and were hard to defend when taken. The high western and central sub-Pyrenean valleys remained unconquered. At this time, Umayyad troops reached Pamplona, and the Basque town submitted after a compromise was brokered with Arab commanders to respect the town and its inhabitants, a practice that was common in many towns of the Iberian Peninsula. The Umayyad troops met little resistance. Considering that era's communication capabilities, three years was a reasonable time spent almost reaching the Pyrenees, after making the necessary arrangements for the towns' submissions and their future governance. New territorial and civil administration Northeastern al-Andalus, the Pyrenees and southern Gaul at the time of the Berber rebellion (739‚Äì742) = A preference for treaties = In 713, Abd al- Aziz ibn Musa subdued the forces of the Visigothic count Theodemir (or Tudmir), who had taken over southeastern Iberia from his base in Murcia after the power vacuum following king Roderic's defeat. Theudimer then signed a conditional capitulation by which his lands were made into an autonomous client state under Umayyad rule (\\"the rule of God\\"). His government and the Christian beliefs of his subjects were respected; in exchange, he pledged to pay a tax (jizya) and to hand over any rebels plotting against Umayyad rule or the Islamic religion. In this way, the life of many inhabitants remained much the same as before Tariq's and Musa's campaigns. The treaty signed with Theudimer set a precedent for the whole of Iberia, and towns surrendering to Umayyad troops experienced a similar fate, including probably the muwallad Banu Qasi based in the Ebro valley, and other counts and landowners. In exception to this pattern, some towns (Cordova, Toledo, etc.) were stormed and captured unconditionally by the Umayyads, to be governed by direct Arab rule. In the area thought to be part of King Roderic's territory, M√©rida also staged a prolonged resistance to the Umayyad advance, but was ultimately conquered in mid-summer 712. As of 713 (or 714), the last Visigothic king, Ardo, took over from Achila II, with effective control just over Septimania, and probably the eastern Pyrenean threshold and coastal areas of the Tarraconense. Islamic laws did not apply to all the subjects of the new rulers. Christians were ruled by their own Visigothic law code (Forum Iudicum) as before. In most of the towns, ethnic communities remained segregated and newly arriving ethnic groups (Syrians, Yemenites, Berbers and others) would erect new boroughs outside existing urban areas. However, this would not apply to towns under direct Umayyad rule. In Cordova, the cathedral was partitioned and shared to provide for the religious needs of Christians and Muslims. This situation lasted some 40 years until Abd ar-Rahman's conquest of southern Spain (756). = Taxation = An early governor (wali) of al-Andalus, al-Hurr ibn Abd al-Rahman al- Thaqafi, spread the rule of the Umayyad Caliphate up to the Ebro valley and the northeastern borders of Iberia, pacifying most of the territory and initiating in 717 the first forays across the Pyrenees into Septimania. In addition, he laid out the foundations of Umayyad civil administration in Iberia, by sending civil administration officials (judges) to conquered towns and lands guarded by garrisons established usually next to the population nuclei. Moreover, al-Hurr restored lands to their previous Christian landowners, which may have added greatly to the revenue of the Umayyad governors and the caliph of Damascus, by increasingly imposing the vectigalia on the former; this was a tax applied on a specific region or estate, and not per capitation (jizya). Only non-Muslims were subject to taxation, apart from a Muslim subject's compulsory alms-giving. The task of establishing a civil administration in conquered al-Andalus was essentially completed by the governor Yahya ibn Salama al-Kalbi 10 years later. The period following al- Hurr's office saw the establishment of the Arabs in southern Septimania during Al-Samh ibn Malik al-Khawlani's tenure as wali. Narbonne fell (720), and no sooner had he garrisoned it than the Arab commander led an offensive against Toulouse. During this Umayyad thrust or its aftermath, King Ardo died (721). Ethnic groups and internal tensions Northeast of Iberia, Duchy of Vasconia, and Septimania just after its conquest by Pepin (760) In the first stage of the invasion, the armies were made up of Berbers and different Arab groups. These peoples, clustered around the banner of the Umayyads, did not mix together, remaining in separate towns and boroughs. The Berbers, recently subdued and superficially Islamized, were usually in charge of the most difficult tasks and the most rugged terrains, similar to the ones found in their north African homeland, while the Arabs occupied the gentler plains of southern Iberia. Consequently, the Berbers went on to stations in Galicia (possibly including Asturias) and the Upper Marches (Ebro basin), but these lands remained unpleasant, humid and cold. The grievances resented by the Berbers under Arab rulers (attempts to impose a tax on Muslim Berbers, etc.) sparked rebellions in north Africa that expanded into Iberia. An early uprising took place in 730, when Uthman ibn Naissa (Munuza), master of the eastern Pyrenees (Cerretanya), allied with the duke Odo of Aquitaine and detached from Cordova. Those internal frictions continually threatened (or sometimes may have spurred) the ever-expanding Umayyad military effort in al- Andalus during the conquest period. Around 739, on learning the news of Charles Martel's second intervention in Provence, Uqba ibn al-Hajjaj had to call off an expedition to the Lower Rhone in order to deal with the Berber revolt in the south instead. The following year, the Berber garrisons stationed in Le√≥n, Astorga and other north-western outposts gave up their positions, and some of them even embraced the Christian religion. The Muslim settlement was thereafter established permanently south of the Douro's banks. The Berber rebellions swept the whole of al-Andalus during Abd al-Malik ibn Katan al-Fihri's term as governor. Reinforcements were then called from the other end of the Mediterranean in a military capacity: the \\"Syrian\\" (actually Yemeni Arabs). The Berber rebellions were quelled in blood, and the Arab commanders came up reinforced after 742. Different Arab factions reached an agreement to alternate in office, but this did not last long, since Yusuf ibn 'Abd al-Rahman al-Fihri (opposed to the Umayyads) remained in power up to his defeat by Abd al-Rahman I in 756, and the establishment of the independent Umayyad Emirate of Cordova. It was in this period of unrest that the Frankish king Pepin finally captured Narbonne from the Andalusians (759). In Yusuf's and Abd-ar-Rahman's fight for power in al-Andalus, the \\"Syrian\\" troops, a mainstay of the Umayyad Caliphate, split. For the most part, Arabs from the Mudhar and Qais tribes sided with Yusuf, as did the indigenous (second or third generation) Arabs from northern Africa, while Yemeni units and some Berbers sided with Abd-ar-Rahman, probably born to a north African Berber mother himself. In 756, south and central al-Andalus (Cordova, Sevilla) were in the hands of Abd-ar-Rahman, but it took still 25 years for him to hold sway over the Upper Marches (Pamplona, Zaragoza and all the northeast). Aftermath The Iberian Peninsula was the westernmost tip of the Umayyad Caliphate of Damascus and was under the rule of the governor of Ifriqiya. In 720, the caliph even considered abandoning the territory. The conquest was followed by a period of several hundred years during which most of the Iberian peninsula was known as Al-Andalus, dominated by Muslim rulers. Only a handful of new small Christian realms managed to reassert their authority across the faraway mountainous north of the peninsula. In 756, Abd al-Rahman I, a survivor of the recently overthrown Umayyad Dynasty, landed in al-Andalus and seized power in Cordova and Seville, and proclaimed himself emir or malik, removing any mentions of the Abbasid Caliphs from the Friday prayers. In the wake of these events, southern Iberia became de jure and de facto independent from the Abbasid Caliphate. Although this was not accepted outside al-Andalus and those North African territories with which it was affiliated, Abd al- Rahman, and especially his successors, considered that they were the legitimate continuation of the Umayyad caliphate, i.e. that their rule was more legitimate than that of the Abbasids. It seems that Abd ar-Rahman never considered establishing a separate principality. (See Caliphate of C√≥rdoba.) During the unification of al-Andalus in the reign of Abd ar-Rahman before his death in 788, al-Andalus underwent centralization and slow but steady homogenization. The autonomous status of many towns and regions negotiated in the first years of the conquest was reversed by 778, in some cases much earlier (Pamplona by 742, for example). The Hispanic Church based in Toledo, whose status remained largely undiminished under the new rulers, fell out with the Roman Church during the Adoptionist controversy (late 8th century). Rome relied on an alliance with Charlemagne (in war with the Cordovan emirs) to defend its political authority and possessions, and went on to recognize the northern Asturian principality (Gallaecia) as a kingdom apart from Cordova, and Alfonso II as king. The population of al-Andalus, especially local nobles who aspired to a share in power, began to embrace Islam and the Arabic language. However, the majority of the population remained Christian (using the Mozarabic Rite), and Latin (Mozarabic) remained the principal language until the 11th century. Historian Jessica Coope of University of Nebraska argues that the pre-modern Islamic conquest was unlike Christianization because the latter was \\"imposed on everyone as part of a negotiated surrender, and thus lacked the element of personal conviction that modern ideas about religious faith would require\\" while conquest of dar al-harb was not motivated by a goal of converting the population to Islam, but by the belief that everyone was better off under Islamic rule. Abd ar-Rahman I founded an independent dynasty that survived until the 11th century. That line was succeeded by a variety of short and small emirates (taifas) unable to stop the push of the expanding northern Christian kingdoms. The Almoravids (1086‚Äì1094) and the Almohads (1146‚Äì1173) occupied al-Andalus next, and the Marinids in 1269, but that could not prevent the fragmentation of Muslim-ruled territory. The last Muslim emirate, Granada, was defeated by the armies of Castile (successor to Asturias) and Aragon under Isabella and Ferdinand in 1492. The last wave of expulsions of Spaniards of Muslim descent took place in 1614. Chronology As discussed above, much of the traditional narrative of the Conquest is more legend than reliable history.

G. and M. D. Carleton. 2005. Superfamily Muroidea. Mammal Species of the World a Taxonomic and Geographic Reference, D. E. Wilson and D. M. Reeder eds. Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore There are two distinct subspecies, both endangered and listed together on federal and state endangered species lists. The northern subspecies (Reithrodontomys raviventris halicoetes) is lighter in color and inhabits the northern marshes of the bay, and the southern subspecies (Reithrodontomys raviventris raviventris) lives in the East and South Bay marshes. They are both quite similar in appearance to their congener species, the [Western harvest mouse, R. megalotis], to which they are not closely related. Genetic studies of the northern subspecies have revealed that the salt marsh harvest mouse is most closely related to the plains harvest mouse, R. montanus, (Presentation by Sarah Brown: Conservation genetics of salt marsh harvest mice (Reithrodontomys raviventris). Presented at College of Science and Math Symposium, California State University, San Luis Obispo. 5/01), which occurs now in the Midwest]. Its endangered designation is due to its limited range, historic decline in population and continuing threat of habitat loss due to development encroachment at the perimeter of San Francisco Bay. Description and comparison to similar species The southern population of the salt marsh harvest mouse tends to have dark brown fur above and a pinkish cinnamon or tawny belly; moreover, the tail is likewise bicolored. An adult's length is five to seven centimeters (2 to 3 inches) and a tail length of six to ten centimeters (2 to 4 inches). The height is between 1.5 and 2.1 centimeters (0.6 to 0.8 inches). Weight of a mature mouse is approximately 10 to 20 grams (0.35 to 0.7 ounces). The northern subspecies is also dorsally brown or reddish brown, but the venters tend to be white or cream, and rarely with a hint of reddish; tail length is usually about 120% of the body length.Sustaita et al. Salt marsh harvest mouse demography and habitat use in the Suisun Marsh, CA. Journal of Wildlife Management, Vol. 75, Issue 6, pp 1498-1509. August 2011. The upper incisors are grooved. As a member of the Neotominae subfamily, the dental formula of R. raviventris is . This species is nocturnal, with particularly noted activity on moonlit nights. This mouse is particularly resourceful, making use of ground runways of other rodents; moreover, he also exhibits climbing agility. It occupies marsh habitats where pickleweed and marsh plants abound. Its many predators feature hawk, snake and owl species, as well as shorebirds and larger mammals. Predation by domestic cats is an issue due to encroachment of the limited habitat by humans at the perimeter of the San Francisco Bay. As would be expected of a mouse native to salt marshes, this species is a competent swimmer and is tolerant of salt in its diet and water supply. It eats seeds and plants, especially pickleweed and glasswort, one of the most common salt marsh plant species. Similar species are the Plains Harvest Mouse, and the Fulvous Harvest Mouse, which has a longer tail. The species co-occurs with the similar Western harvest mouse, which tends to have dorsal fur that is more gray than R. raviventris and with ventral fur that is white to grayish; and the House mouse which is gray, has a scaly tail and incisors without grooves, unlike those of the salt marsh harvest mouse. Lifestyle Survey data from Suisun Marsh found that the salt marsh harvest mouse can live up to 18 months and possibly longer. Females commonly have two litters per year. In the summer, when salinity of water and vegetation increases, the mice have a notable advantage due to their ability to drink and survive purely on salt water. The northern species can survive purely on salt water, but prefers freshwater to saltwater. The southern species can survive on either, and does not display a preference.Golovanova, Galina. The Biogeography of the Salt Marsh Harvest Mouse (Reithrodonomys raviventris). Habitat The mice depend heavily on vegetation cover, particularly pickleweed and tules (Schoenoplectus spp.). Pickleweed (Salicornia virginica) is their primary and preferred habitat as well their main food source; However, R. raviventris are found in a variety of marsh habitats, including diked and tidal wetlands. The salt marsh harvest mouse is not an aggressive species; many mice live in close quarters, withstanding short durations of high population density due to seasonal flooding that restricts individuals to small patches of dry ground. They can also survive tidal or seasonal flooding due to their superior ability to swim, float and climb. R. raviventris home range and habitat use differ temporally across age and sex. Juveniles exhibit home ranges of 600‚Äì700 m¬≤ whereas adults exhibit home ranges of 1300‚Äì1500 m¬≤. Males and females also differ in the structural complexity of their occupied habitat during fall and summer (breeding season) but occupy the same habitat during winter and spring. While the cause is still unknown, this seasonal disparity in habitat use may be related to a reduced risk of predation and intraspecific competition in more structurally complex habitats. Furthermore, movement of R.raviventris individuals within their home ranges varies seasonally, with mean distance traveled highest in June and lowest in November. Range The salt marsh harvest mouse is an endangered species that is endemic to the San Francisco Bay. Its salt marsh habitat could be highly impacted by sea-level rise. This organism is known to be found in the following specific locales (among others): *Sonoma Creek discharge area known as the Napa Sonoma Marsh *Suisun Marsh, Solano County *Alman Marsh, adjacent to Shollenberger Park, Petaluma *Sausalito baylands *San Rafael baylands *Arrowhead Marsh in Oakland *San Francisco Bay sloughs in Alviso *Palo Alto baylands *Bair Island *Point Reyes National Seashore Conservation The salt marsh harvest mouse has lost much of its habitat to extensive development of bayside marshland, pollution, drugs, boat activity, and commercial salt harvesting. It has been on the endangered lists since the 1970s, and has protected habitat within numerous Bay Area wildlife refuges. Individual political jurisdictions have conducted research and established habitat protection strategies to protect the salt marsh harvest mouse. For example, the city of San Rafael, California has established a shoreline setback standard to prevent any land development within fifty feet of the shoreline; this measure has been applied to several specific land developments along the San Francisco Bay shoreline.Hogan, C. Michael et al. (1989). Spinnaker-on-the-Bay Expanded Initial Study, Earth Metrics Inc., prepared for the city of San Rafael, California Researchers like Katherine Smith of California Department of Fish and Wildlife are at the forefront of research helping to identify how threats like climate change impact the species while increasing the understanding of its biology, ecology and behavior.

He is best known as a leading researcher, author, and conspiracy theorist on the assassination of United States President John F. Kennedy. From his 1966 number-one bestselling critique of the Warren Commission, Rush to Judgment,name=Hawes Publications  url=http://www.hawes.com/1966/1966-12-25.pdf, p.2 to Last Word: My Indictment of the CIA in the Murder of JFK, published in 2011, Lane wrote at least four major works on the JFK assassination and no fewer than ten books overall. Early career Mark Lane was born in The Bronx, New York,\\"Citizen Lane\\", Chapter 1, Page 1 the son of Harry Arnold and Elizabeth Levin (Levin was changed to Lane in the 1920s), and raised in Brooklyn, New York. He served in the United States Army after World War II. After attending Long Island University, he received an LL.B from Brooklyn Law School in 1951.http://spectatorarchive.library.columbia.edu/cgi- bin/columbia?a=d&d;=cs19620305-01.2.11'Mark Lane, gadfly lawyer, author, who promoted JFK conspiracy theory, dies at 89,' The Washington Post, Matt Schudel, May 14, 2016 As a law student, Lane was the administrative assistant to the National Lawyers Guild and orchestrated a fund-raising event at Town Hall in New York City that featured American folk singer Pete Seeger. Following his admission to the New York bar in 1951, Lane established a practice with Seymour Ostrow in East Harlem. Although Lane acquired a reputation as \\"a defender of the poor and oppressed,\\" Ostrow later asserted that Lane was \\"motivated more by his ambition and quest for publicity than any dedication to a cause or concern for the interest of his clients.\\" The partnership dissolved in the late 1950s. In 1959, Lane helped found the Reform Democrat movement within the New York Democratic Party. He was elected with the support of Eleanor Roosevelt and presidential candidate John F. Kennedy (JFK) to the New York Legislature in 1960. During his own campaign, he also managed the New York City area's campaign for JFK's 1960 presidential bid.Citizen Lane: Defending Our Rights in the Courts, the Capitol, and the Streets; Mark Lane; Chicago Review Press; 2011. pp. 113‚Äì115 He was a member of the New York State Assembly (New York County's 10th District, encompassing East Harlem and Yorkville, where Lane resided) in 1961 and 1962. In the legislature, Lane spent considerable time working to abolish capital punishment. Lane promised to serve for only one term, and then manage the campaign for his replacement‚Äîwhich he did. In June 1961, during the civil rights movement, Lane was the only sitting legislator to be arrested for opposing segregation as a \\"Freedom Rider\\".Bugliosi, p. 1011 In 1962, he ran for Congress in the Democratic primary and lost.Bugliosi, p. 1001 In the 1968 presidential election, Lane appeared on the ballot as a third party vice- presidential candidate, running on the Freedom and Peace Party ticket (an offshoot of the Peace and Freedom Party) with Dick Gregory. Kennedy assassination Four weeks after the assassination of Kennedy on November 22, 1963, Lane published an article in the National Guardian dealing in-depth with 15 questions regarding statements by public officials about the murders of J. D. Tippit and John F. Kennedy from the perspective of a defense attorney. The statements were about the witnesses who claimed to have seen Lee Harvey Oswald on the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository; the paraffin test which, to Lane, indicated that Oswald had not fired a rifle recently; the conflicting claims about the rifle which at first was, as the police announced, a German Mauser and afterwards a smaller gauge Italian Mannlicher‚ÄìCarcano; the Parkland Hospital doctors announcing an entrance wound in the throat, and the role of the FBI and the press, who convicted Oswald before his guilt was proven. In June 1964, according to historian Peter Knight, Bertrand Russell, \\"prompted by the emerging work of the lawyer Mark Lane in the US ... rallied support from other noteworthy and left-leaning compatriots to form a Who Killed Kennedy Committee, members of which included Michael Foot MP, the wife of Tony Benn MP, the publisher Victor Gollancz, the writers John Arden and J. B. Priestley, and the Oxford history professor Hugh Trevor-Roper.\\" Russell published a highly critical article weeks before the Warren Commission Report was published, setting forth \\"16 Questions on the Assassination\\" and equating the Oswald case with the Dreyfus affair of late nineteenth-century France in which the state wrongly convicted an innocent man. Russell also criticized the American press for failing to heed any voices critical of the official version.\\"Peter Knight, The Kennedy Assassination, Edinburgh University Press Ltd., 2007, p. 77. Also see \\"External Links\\": \\"Sixteen Questions on the Assassination (of President Kennedy). In 1975, Lane became the Director of the Citizens Commission of Inquiry (CCI), which challenged the veracity of official accounts of the assassination Citizens Commission of Inquiry, newsletter, Harold Weisberg Archive, Hood College. http://jfk.hood.edu/Collection/Weisberg%20Subject%20Index%20Files/L%20Disk/Lane%20Mark/Lane%20Mark%201975/Item%2009.pdf =Warren Commission = Lane applied to the Warren Commission to represent the interests of Oswald, but the Commission rejected his request.Kiel, p. 162. Three months later Walter E. Craig, president of the American Bar Association, was appointed by the Commission to represent the interests of Oswald. Craig himself stated that he was not counsel for Oswald; and official records do not indicate that Craig or his associates named, cross-examined, or interviewed witnesses of their own.Kiel, pp. 161‚Äì3. Lane continued to search for clues for Oswald's innocence. He was called to testify before the Commission but was not permitted to cross-examine witnesses. According to R. Andrew Kiel in J. Edgar Hoover: The Father of the Cold War, \\"After the Warren Commission's final report was completed in September 1964, Lane interviewed numerous witnesses ignored by the Commission.\\" For Lane, Commission chairman Chief Justice Earl Warren had only contempt. According to biographer Ed Cray, Warren \\"deemed Lane a publicity seeker who 'played fast and loose' with the subject.\\" Warren maintained prior to his death that the Commission had investigated all leads and left no witness unheard. =Lane's testimony= Lane provided testimony to the Warren Commission in Washington, D.C. on March 4, 1964. Lane testified that he had contacted witness Helen Markham sometime within the five days preceding his appearance before the Commission and that she had described Tippit's killer to him as \\"short, a little on the heavy side, and his hair was somewhat bushy\\". He added, \\"I think it is fair to state that an accurate description of Oswald would be average height, quite slender with thin and receding hair.\\" In addressing the assertion that Markham's description of Tippit's killer was not consistent with the appearance of Oswald, the Warren Commission stated that they had reviewed the telephone transcript in which she was alleged to have made it. The Commission wrote: \\"A review of the complete transcript has satisfied the Commission that Mrs. Markham strongly reaffirmed her positive identification of Oswald and denied having described the killer as short, stocky and having bushy hair.\\" As a result of this, Lane was called to re-appear before the Warren Commission in July 1964. Chief Justice Earl Warren told him that the commission had \\"every reason to doubt the truthfulness\\" of some of Mr. Lane's testimony due to the appearance of him misrepresenting what Markham told him.'Warren Committee Challenged by Lane', New York Times, July 8, 1964 =Rush to Judgment= Lane published an indictment of the Warren Commission, entitled Rush to Judgment, using these interviews as well as evidence from the 26 volumes of the Commission's report. Despite the fact that the majority of Lane's material for his book came from the Warren Report itself, as well as from interviews with those who were at the scene, sixteen publishers canceled contracts before Rush to Judgment was published. The book became a number one best seller and spent 29 weeks on the New York Times best-seller list.name=Hawes Publications  url=http://www.hawes.com/1966/1966-09-11.pdf, p.2  url=http://www.hawes.com/1967/1967-03-26.pdf It was adapted into a documentary film in 1966. The book criticizes in detail the work and conclusions of the Warren Commission. Lane questions, among other things, the Warren Commission conclusion that three shots were fired from the Texas School Book Depository and focuses on the witnesses who had recounted seeing or hearing shots coming from the grassy knoll in Dealey Plaza. Lane questions whether Oswald was guilty of the murder of policeman J.D. Tippit shortly after the Kennedy murder. Lane also states that none of the Warren Commission firearm experts were able to duplicate Oswald's shooting feat.Bugliosi, p. 1005 According to former KGB officer Vasili Mitrokhin in his 1999 book The Sword and the Shield, the KGB helped finance Lane's research on Rush to Judgment without the author's knowledge. The KGB allegedly used journalist Genrikh Borovik as a contact and provided Lane with $2000 for research and travel in 1964.Christopher Andrew and Vasili Mitrokhin, The Sword and the Shield: The Mitrokhin Archive and the Secret History of the KGB, Basic Books, 1999. Excerpted here. According to the book, Soviet journalists, including KGB agent Genrikh Borovik, met with Mark Lane to encourage him in his research. Lane called the allegation \\"an outright lie\\" and wrote, \\"Neither the KGB nor any person or organization associated with it ever made any contribution to my work.\\"Letter to The Nation from Lane =Other books Lane wrote on the topic= Lane later wrote A Citizen's Dissent, documenting his response to the Warren Commission's governmental findings on the Kennedy assassination. He also wrote the first screenplay of the 1973 film Executive Action (starring Burt Lancaster and Robert Ryan), with Donald Freed, and his associate, Steve Jaffe, was supervising producer and credited with supplying much of the research material for the film. Lane asserted in his 1991 book Plausible Denial that he only worked on the first draft of the screenplay which was ultimately credited to Dalton Trumbo. He noted that he collaborated with Donald Freed on it and after seeing subsequent drafts, they complained both privately to the producer and publicly at press conferences, pointing out errors in the work.Plausible Denial, Thunder's Mouth Press copyright 1991 page 326 In 1991, Lane described Plausible Denial as his \\"last word\\" on the subject and told Patricia Holt of the San Francisco Chronicle: \\"I'll never write another sentence about the (JFK) assassination\\". In November 2011, Lane published a third major book on the JFK assassination titled Last Word: My Indictment of the CIA in the Murder of JFK. =Liberty Lobby appeal trial= Lane represented the political advocacy group Liberty Lobby as an attorney when the group was sued over an article in The Spotlight newspaper implicating E. Howard Hunt (a convicted Watergte burglar) in the Kennedy assassination. Hunt sued for defamation and was awarded $650,000 in damages. Lane successfully got this judgment reversed on appeal.E. Howard Hunt, Jr., Plaintiff-appellant, v. Victor L. Marchetti, Defendant, Liberty Lobby, a D.C. Corp., Defendant-appellee, 824 F.2d 916 (11th Cir. 1987) This case became the basis for Lane's book Plausible Denial. In the book, Lane claimed that he convinced the jury that Hunt was involved in the JFK assassination, but mainstream news accounts asserted that some jurors decided the case on the issue of whether The Spotlight had acted with \\"actual malice\\". Lane represented Willis Carto after Carto lost control of the Institute for Historical Review in 1993. =Random House suit= In 1995, Lane lost a defamation suit against book publisher Random House, which used the caption \\"Guilty of Misleading the American Public\\" under a photo of Lane in an advertisement for Gerald Posner's Case Closed. He sought $10 million in damages for disparagement of his integrity and the unauthorized use of his photograph. Lane was rebuked by Judge Royce C. Lamberth of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia who said: \\"A conspiracy theory warrior outfitted with Lane's acerbic tongue and pen should not expect immunity from an occasional, constrained chastisement.\\" A similar suit filed by Robert J. Groden against Random House was dismissed the previous year by a federal judge in New York. Vietnam War crimes investigations In 1970, Lane involved himself in several war crime inquiries being conducted primarily by antiwar organizations such as the National Committee for a Citizens Commission of Inquiry on U.S. War Crimes in Vietnam Citizens Commission of Inquiry and the Vietnam Veterans Against the War. Lane used his contacts and raised funds to support these events, including what would become the National Committee for a Citizens Commission of Inquiry on U.S. War Crimes in Vietnam National Veterans Inquiry and the VVAWs Winter Soldier Investigation. National Committee for a Citizens Commission of Inquiry on U.S. War Crimes in Vietnam and VVAW had originally combined their efforts toward the production of one large war crime investigation, and Lane was initially invited to join the organizing steering committee. Lane suggested the Winter Soldier name, based on Thomas Paine's description of the \\"summer soldiers\\" at Valley Forge shrinking from service to their country in a time of crisis. Lane would often travel with fellow activist Jane Fonda to antiwar speaking engagements and fundraising rallies. Lane was also writing a book, Conversations with Americans, a collection of interviews with US servicemen about war crimes in the Vietnam War. Lane's close association with the National Committee for a Citizens Commission of Inquiry on U.S. War Crimes in Vietnam and VVAW would be short-lived. Tod Ensign recalled > It was a mistake to think that celebrities like Jane Fonda and Mark Lane who > were used to operating as free agents would submit to the discipline of a > steering committee. We should have placed them, instead, on an advisory > panel where their visibility and political and money contacts would have > been used without having to tangle with them on broader strategic and > tactical questions.Tod Ensign; Viet Nam Generation: A Journal of Recent > History and Contemporary Issues, March 1994 National Committee for a Citizens Commission of Inquiry on U.S. War Crimes in Vietnam staffers criticized Lane as being arrogant and sensationalistic, and said the book he was writing had \\"shoddy reporting in it\\". National Committee for a Citizens Commission of Inquiry on U.S. War Crimes in Vietnam leaders refused to work with Lane further and gave the VVAW leaders a \\"Lane or us\\" ultimatum. VVAW did not wish to lose the monetary support of Lane and Fonda, so the National Committee for a Citizens Commission of Inquiry on U.S. War Crimes in Vietnam split from the project. The following month, after caustic reviews of Lane's book by authors and a Vietnam expert, VVAW also distanced itself from Lane. James Reston Jr., in the Saturday Review, calls Lane's book disreputable, in that all of the reports contained in it are admittedly unverified, and lean toward the salacious. \\"Lane makes no pretense of distinguishing between fact and a soldier's talent for embellishment\\", Reston observed. Commenting on the book's redeeming social value, Reston added that \\"it would be to show that a pattern of atrocities exists in Vietnam, proving that while My Lai was larger, it was not unique. This needs to be demonstrated, since the Pentagon continues to insist that My Lai was an isolated case. But the effort will have to be left to more responsible parties, like the National Veterans Inquiry.\\"James Reston Jr., Saturday Review, January 9, 1971, p. 26 A review of Lane's book by Neil Sheehan in the New York Times Book Review claimed that four of the 32 servicemen interviewed by Lane for the book had misrepresented their military service, according to the Defense Department. Lane responded to Sheehan's inquiries by stating that the Defense Department is the least reliable of all sources for verification of atrocity accounts and that verification of simple facts about the interviewees was \\"not relevant.\\" Sheehan called Lane's book irresponsible, concluding that, \\"Some of the horror tales in this book are undoubtedly true\\", and the \\"men who now run the military establishment cannot conduct a credible investigation... But until the country does summon up the courage to convene a responsible inquiry, we probably deserve the Mark Lanes.\\" New York Times Book Review, December 27, 1970 by Neil Sheehan Because of Sheehan's review, Simon and Schuster reneged on the contract for the book. When Lane disproved Sheehan's charges, they were forced to settle with him.Mark Lane; Citizen Lane, Chicago Review Press, 2012,218‚Äì220. The controversial book reviews caused concern in the VVAW leadership, as Andrew E. Hunt notes, > Sheehan's expos√© had placed VVAW leaders in a difficult position. Lane's > involvement with the planning of the Winter Soldier Investigation had been > extensive. His legal and financial assistance had proven invaluable. Few > VVAWers doubted his sincerity or devotion to the effort. Yet they feared > associating with Lane could tarnish months of difficult work. \\"Then the > question became, 'How do we protect our integrity?'\\" recalled Joe Urgo, > \\"'How do we separate ourselves from this guy?'\\" Organizers hoped Lane would > maintain a low profile. Their wishes were fulfilled.Andrew E. Hunt; The > Turning: A History of Vietnam Veterans Against the War; New York University > Press, 1999; p. 67 VVAW veterans involved with the WSI event then realized they needed to take control, and insisted that there be no more interference from the likes of Lane. A new, all-veteran steering committee was formed without Lane. Ultimately, the WSI was an event produced by veterans only, without the need of civilians such as Lane and Fonda.Gerald Nicosia; Home to War: A History of the Vietnam Veterans' Movement, 2001, p. 84  Assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.  Lane wrote Murder In Memphis with Dick Gregory (previously titled Code Name Zorro, after the Central Intelligence Agency's name for King) about the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., in which he alleged a conspiracy and government coverup.Bugliosi, p. 1002 Lane represented James Earl Ray, King's alleged assassin, before the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) inquiry in 1978. The HSCA said of Lane in its report, \\"Many of the allegations of conspiracy that the committee investigated were first raised by Mark Lane ...\\" Lane wrote an audio docu-drama \\"Trial of James Earl Ray\\" that was broadcast on: KPFK on Apr. 3, 1978 casting doubt on Ray's guilt Lane was Ray's lawyer for a time. He alleged that Ray was an innocent pawn in a government plot Peoples Temple =Engagement and work for the Peoples Temple= In 1978, Lane began to represent the Peoples Temple. Temple leader Jim Jones hired Lane and Donald Freed to help make the case of what it alleged to be a \\"grand conspiracy\\" by intelligence agencies against the Peoples Temple. Jones told Lane he wanted to \\"pull an Eldridge Cleaver\\", referring to the fugitive Black Panther who was able to return to the United States after repairing his reputation. In September 1978, Lane visited Jonestown, spoke to Jonestown residents, provided support for the theory that intelligence agencies conspired against Jonestown and drew parallels between Martin Luther King Jr. and Jim Jones. Lane then held press conferences stating that \\"none of the charges\\" against the Temple \\"are accurate or true\\" and that there was a \\"massive conspiracy\\" against the Temple by \\"intelligence organizations,\\" naming the CIA, FBI, FCC and the U.S. Post Office. Though Lane represented himself as disinterested, the Temple paid Lane $6,000 per month to help generate such theories. Regarding the effect of the work of Lane and Freed upon Temple members, Temple member Annie Moore wrote that \\"Mom and Dad have probably shown you the latest about the conspiracy information that Mark Lane, the famous attorney in the ML King case and Don Freed the other famous author in the Kennedy case have come up with regarding activities planned against us‚ÄîPeoples Temple.\\" Another Temple member, Carolyn Layton, wrote that Don Freed told them that \\"anything this drug out could be nothing less than conspiracy\\".Moore, Rebecca. A Sympathetic History of Jonestown. Lewiston: E. Mellen Press. =Jonestown tragedy= Lane was present in Jonestown during the evening of November 18, 1978, and witnessed or heard part of the events claiming at least 408 lives (out of a total recount of 915 carried out five days later); these events involved, up to some extent, murder-suicide by cyanide poisoning and were compounded by the murder of Congressman Leo Ryan and four others at a nearby airstrip. For months before that tragedy, Jones frequently created fear among members by stating that the CIA and other intelligence agencies were conspiring with \\"capitalist pigs\\" to destroy Jonestown and harm its members.See, e.g., Jim Jones, Transcript of Recovered FBI tape Q 234, Q 322, Q 051 This included mentions of CIA involvement in the address Jones gave the day before the arrival of Congressman Ryan.Jim Jones, Transcript of Recovered FBI tape Q 050 During the visit of Congressman Ryan, Lane helped represent the Temple along with its other attorney, Charles R. Garry, who was furious with Lane for holding numerous press conferences and alleging the existence of conspiracies against the Peoples Temple. Garry was also displeased with Lane for making a veiled threat that the Temple might move to the Soviet Union in a letter to Congressman Ryan. Late in the afternoon of November 18, two men wielding rifles approached Lane and Garry, who had earlier been sent to a small wooden house by Jones. It is not clear whether the gunmen were sent to kill Lane and Garry, but one of the gunmen recognized Charles Garry as an attorney in a trial that the gunman had attended. After a relatively friendly exchange, the men informed Garry and Lane that they were going to \\"commit revolutionary suicide\\" to \\"expose this racist and fascist society\\". The gunmen then gave Garry and Lane directions to exit Jonestown. Garry and Lane then sneaked into the jungle, where they hid and called a temporary truce while the tragedy unfolded.Tim Reiterman (1982) \\"Raven: The Untold Story of The Rev. Jim Jones and His People\\" , p. 563 On a tape made while members committed suicide by ingesting cyanide-poisoned punch, the reason given by Jones to commit suicide was consistent with Jones's previously stated conspiracy theories of intelligence organizations allegedly conspiring against the Temple, that men would \\"parachute in here on us\\", \\"shoot some of our innocent babies\\" and \\"they'll torture our children, they'll torture some of our people here, they'll torture our seniors\\".\\"Jonestown Audiotape Primary Project\\" Alternative Considerations of Jonestown and Peoples Temple. San Diego State University. Parroting Jones's prior statements that hostile forces would convert captured children to fascism, one temple member states, \\"[T]he ones that they take captured, they're gonna just let them grow up and be dummies\\". Annie Moore and Carolyn Layton were among the 900 who died. =After the tragedy= Lane later wrote a book about the tragedy, The Strongest Poison.Lane, Mark, The Strongest Poison, Hawthorne Books, 1980, Lane reported hearing automatic weapon fire, and presumes that U.S. forces killed Jonestown survivors.Moore, Rebecca, \\"Reconstructing Reality: Conspiracy Theories About Jonestown\\", Journal of Popular Culture 36, no. 2 (Fall 2002): pp. 200‚Äì20 While Lane blames Jones and Peoples Temple leadership for the deaths at Jonestown, he also claims that U.S. officials exacerbated the possibility of violence by employing agents provocateurs. For example, Lane claimed that Temple attorney (and later defector) Timothy Stoen, who, Lane alleged, had repeatedly prompted the Temple to take radical action before defecting, \\"had evidently led three lives\\", one of those being a government informant or agent.Lane, Mark, The Strongest Poison, Hawthorne Books, 1980, , p. 290 Later career and death Lane is the author of the 1970 book Arcadia in which he details the effort to prove that James Joseph Richardson, a black migrant worker in Florida, had been falsely accused of killing his seven children. He was convicted of the murders through corrupt means used by the authorities involved. Richardson had been on death row for almost five years for the crimes, escaping execution by virtue of the Furman v. Georgia Supreme Court decision. Nineteen years after the book was published he received a hearing in which the charges were dropped thanks to the interventions of Lane and Miami's then- prosecutor, Janet Reno.Frail and aged, man returns to Arcadia and a hurtful past, Sarasota Herald Tribune, Ian Cummings, October 27, 2013. Retrieved June 1, 2019. Richardson was released from prison after 21 years, and Richardson's babysitter, though suffering from dementia, later confessed to the murders. Lane resided in Charlottesville, Virginia. He continued to practice law and lectured on many subjects, especially the importance of the United States Constitution (mainly the Bill Of Rights and the First Amendment) and civil rights. At the annual Law Library of Congress and American Bar Association Law Day symposium 2001, on the question, \\"Who are the paradigms for the lawyer as reformer in American culture?\\", Mark Lane was one of the twelve legal figures featured by panel moderator, Bernard Hibbitts, professor at the University of Pittsburgh School of Law. On May 10, 2016, Lane died of a heart attack at his home in Charlottesville at the age of 89. Works * Arcadia. Holt, Rinehart and Winston, 1970, . * Chicago Eyewitness.

He represented the constituency of Nukulaelae in the Parliament of Tuvalu. He has served twice as the Prime Minister of Tuvalu. Political career Paeniu made his entrance on the political scene in 1989, when he won a seat in the Parliament of Tuvalu following a by-election. =First period of office as Prime Minister= Following the general election on 26 March 1989, he challenged incumbent Prime Minister Tomasi Puapua in the general election and won, becoming the youngest ever Prime Minister of Tuvalu at age 33. Paeniu formed a five-member Cabinet on 16 October 1989. The next general election was held on 25 November 1993. In the subsequent parliament the members were evenly split in their support of Bikenibeu Paeniu and the former Prime Minister Tomasi Puapua. As a consequence, the Governor-General dissolved the parliament on 22 September and a further election took place on 25 November 1993. The subsequent parliament elected Kamuta Latasi as prime minister on 10 December 1993, with a 7:5 majority over the group a members of parliament headed by Bikenibeu Paeniu. =Second period of office as Prime Minister= Kamuta Latasi was the prime minister until 24 December 1996. As the result the vote on a motion of no confidence Kamuta Latasi resigned and Bikenibeu Paeniu was elected as prime minister for the second time. In his second premiership term, an issue which arose was the controversy surrounding the design of the national flag of Tuvalu. Paeniu successfully led moves to revert the flag to a previously used design which included the British Union Jack. Paeniu is less overtly republican in inclination than Latasi. On 18 December 1997 the parliament was dissolved and the general election was held on 26 March 1998. Bikenibeu Paeniu was re-elected prime minister on 8 April 1998. Paeniu remained as prime minister until he resigned following the vote on a motion of no confidence on 27 April 1999 and Ionatana Ionatana was elected as prime minister. Subsequent career Paeniu sat as a Member of Parliament, representing the constituency of Nukulaelae island, until 2006. In addition, he served as Minister of Finance and Economic Planning in the cabinets of Koloa Talake, Saufatu Sopoanga and Maatia Toafa. Paeniu lost his seat in Parliament in the 2006 general election.

The area code was one of the original NANP area codes established in October 1947 by AT&T.; After the State of New Jersey with area code 201, the District of Columbia was the second numbering plan area (NPA). An NPA that comprises an entire state received a code in which the second digit was '0'.AT&T;, Notes on Nationwide Dialing (1955) According to the most recent projections from the North American Numbering Plan Administrator, 202 is projected to exhaust by late 2022.2020-1 NRUF and NPA Exhaust Analysis Since August 3, 2020, interim jeopardy procedures are in effect that limit new office code assignments to three per month. Each operating company may only file for three applications per month.NANPA NPA 202 (District Of Columbia) Interim Jeopardy Procedures 2020-08-03 In September 2020, it was announced that area code 771 will be added as an overlay area code for the District of Columbia, with a 13-month phase-in period. History Since the creation of the North American Numbering Plan (NANP) in 1947, most of the inner ring of the Washington metropolitan area has been a single local calling area, the Washington Metropolitan Exchange Area (WMEA). This is despite the fact that the WMEA spills into three numbering plan areas (NPAs): the District's 202, 301 in southern Maryland, and 703 in Northern Virginia. From the 1950s to 1990, it was possible to complete local calls in the WMEA with only seven digits. The entire WMEA was reachable via long-distance services by dialing area code 202, for which purpose AT&T; Long Lines had established cross-referenced operator routing codes for all affected central offices. This scheme was implemented via a system of central office code protection, in which central offices in the three numbering plan areas could not duplicate any central office prefixes for any of the three area codes in the WMEA. AT&T; Long Lines, Distance Dialing Reference Guide (1974-04-01) If a 1-202-574 number was in use in the District, the corresponding 1-703-574 number or 1-301-574 number could only be assigned to jurisdictions a safe distance from the metropolitan area, such as southwestern Virginia or the Eastern Shore of Maryland. Conversely, if a number was in use in the Virginia or Maryland suburbs, it could not be used in the District. By Spring 1990, C&P; Telephone (later part of Bell Atlantic and now Verizon), the Regional Bell Operating Company for the District, advised the North American Numbering Plan Administrator (NANPA) that the last interchangeable central office code in the area would be assigned in the second half of the year. The only remaining prefixes could not be assigned without breaking seven-digit dialing in the region, leading C&P; to terminate the central office code protection scheme in order to make additional prefixes available for use. This change was implemented in a permissive dialing period from April 1, 1990 to October 1, 1990, at which time all home-NPA (HNPA) local calls maintained seven-digit dialing; all HNPA direct-dialed toll calls, required 1 and ten-digits; foreign-NPA (FNPA) local calls were dialed with just the ten-digit number; FNPA direct dialed calls required dialing 1 and ten-digits. Operator-assisted calls were all dialed as 0 and ten-digits.NANPA Bellcore Information Letter IL-90/04-003 Although the end of central office code protection was intended to prevent area code splits, it did not provide enough relief to meet demand on either side of the Potomac River. In Maryland, the removal of code protection was successful for only a few months. By the end of 1990, the Chesapeake and Potomac Telephone Company of Maryland filed to assign area code 410 to Baltimore and the eastern half of Maryland, effective October 5, 1991.NANPA, Bellcore Information Letter IL-90/12-049 In Virginia, the delay amounted to six years, until 1996, when area code 540 was installed and permissive dialing ended January 27, 1996.NANPA, Bellcore Information Letter IL-95/04-007 The region's continued growth in the 1990s ultimately led to both suburban area codes being overlaid, with area code 240 overlaying 301 in 1997, and area code 571 overlaying 703 in 2000. Years after the introduction of mobile number portability, many cell phone customers on the Virginia and Maryland sides of the metro have 202 numbers. With 202 facing exhaustion in late 2022, the North American Numbering Plan Administrator announced in September 2020 that area code 771 would be added as an overlay for the District of Columbia. The Public Service Commission of the District of Columbia approved a plan to phase in the new area code over a 13-month period. When the 771 area code becomes active, all calls made from the District of Columbia will be required to include the area code. 202 had been one of the few urbanized area codes without an overlay, making Washington one of the largest cities where seven-digit dialing was still possible.NANPA Administration System: Area Code 202 The implementation of 771 will break seven-digit dialing for calls within the District.

On April 19, 1775, the first day of the American Revolutionary War, provincial minutemen and militia companies numbering approximately 400 engaged roughly 90 British Army troops at this location. The battle was the first instance in which American forces advanced in formation on the British regulars, inflicted casualties, and routed their opponents. It was a pivotal moment in the Battles of Lexington and Concord and in American history. The significance of the historic events at the North Bridge inspired Ralph Waldo Emerson to refer to the moment as the \\"shot heard round the world.\\" There were at least eight iterations of the North Bridge constructed over four centuries. The current wooden pedestrian bridge, an approximate replica of the bridge that stood at the time of the battle, was built in 1956 and extensively restored in 2005. The bridge and the surrounding 114 acres of land make up what is known as the North Bridge unit of the Minute Man National Historical Park and is managed by the National Park Service. It is a popular tourist destination. Origin and earliest iterations The Town of Concord was settled in 1635. Over the next two decades, colonial settlers established farms in the north quarter of the town. Many of these farms lay on the opposite side of the Concord River from the town center. To facilitate travel from their farms to the town, north quarter land owners built a bridge over the Concord River at or near this location by the early 1650s. The first mention of a bridge at this location appears in town records in 1654. The farm road crossing the bridge was later improved and came to be known as the Groton Road. Spring flooding of the river and deterioration required the replacement of the bridge approximately every 20 to 30 years. Colonial records suggest that the bridge was likely replaced in 1660, again around 1683, again around 1710, and again in 1731. In 1760, the town constructed a new bridge at this site. This version was the one that was present during the Concord Fight on April 19, 1775. \\"Concord Fight\\" A 1775 drawing by Amos Doolittle of the engagement at the North Bridge based on witness accounts and his own inspection of the bridgeThe engagement which took place at the North Bridge has historically been known as the \\"Concord Fight\\" and was a part of the larger Battles of Lexington and Concord. On April 18, 1775, General Thomas Gage, the military Governor of Massachusetts, dispatched a force of roughly 700 British soldiers from Boston to confiscate or destroy military supplies being stockpiled in Concord by the rebellious Massachusetts Provincial Congress. On their way to Concord, this force encountered a small group of militia on Lexington Green. After a brief skirmish there, the British soldiers marched on to Concord. Soon after reaching the town, Lieutenant Colonel Francis Smith sent six companies across the North Bridge to search provincial Colonel Colonel James Barrett's farm for munitions. Three of these companies went on to Barrett's farm while three, totaling roughly 90 men, held the North Bridge. These were the British light infantry companies from the 4th, 10th, and 43rd Regiments of Foot under Captain Walter Laurie. These companies initially held positions on the western side of the bridge but when the provincials advanced, they crossed the bridge and took up a position on the eastern bank. At about 10:30, the provincials noticed smoke rising in the direction of the village of Concord on the other side of the bridge. British regulars burned some wooden gun carriages they discovered there but the provincial militia beyond the bridge believed the regulars had set fire to the town. The provincials advanced in military order to take the bridge and moving on with the intention to stop the regulars from burning the town. As they advanced the British fired a few warning shots followed by a full volley. Several provincials were killed or wounded in this first round of firing. Seeing these casualties, Major John Buttrick of Concord, in command of the provincial column, commanded, \\"Fire, fellow soldiers, for God's sake fire!\\" and the provincials returned fire, causing the British to immediately retreat back to Concord. Three British soldiers were killed and nine wounded. On the provincial side two were killed and four wounded. This first instance of Americans fighting in military order and firing to deadly effect on British troops was a key turning point in the Battles of Lexington and Concord. It precipitated the British retreat back to Boston and is regarded as one of the most significant events in American history. Later iterations of the bridge An 1882 drawing of the Centennial Bridge with covered pavilionsIn 1788, a new bridge was constructed to replace the 1760 structure which had been in place during the battle. As with prior iterations, those with farms adjacent to the bridge paid for the replacement. In 1788 these included Captain David Brown, Lieutenant Elisha Jones, and Colonel John Buttrick, all of whom had fought at the North Bridge in 1775. In 1793, Concord constructed a new bridge several hundred yards downriver of the North Bridge, making the latter obsolete. The road was diverted to the new bridge and the old road over the North Bridge was abandoned by the town. That same year, the town authorized Elisha Jones to tear down the North Bridge. For the next 82 years, no bridge stood at the site. In 1874, as plans developed for the celebration of the centennial of the battle, the Town of Concord appointed a committee to oversee the placement of a monument on the west side of the river where the first minutemen died in combat. They were also charged with rebuilding the North Bridge. The new structure would not be open to traffic but instead would serve strictly as part of the larger memorial, providing access to the new statue and demonstrating to visitors what the area looked like on the first day of the Revolution. The centennial version of the North Bridge, constructed in 1874, has been described as \\"whimsical\\" and overly rustic, representing a Victorian era interpretation of what a colonial bridge looked like. The architect was William Ralph Emerson, cousin to Ralph Waldo Emerson, Concord's famed writer and transcendentalist. The most unusual features of the Centennial Bridge were its two pavilions or covered arbors protruding from either side of the center of the bridge covered with interwoven twigs, reminiscent of a Polynesian style. The Centennial Bridge was washed away during the spring freshet of 1888. It was replaced by a more austere bridge that same year. William R. Emerson also designed this bridge but left out the unusual decorative flourishes of his Centennial Bridge. Despite attempts to make the 1888 bridge stronger with large oak pilings and cross beams, it too was washed out by spring floods in 1909. The bridge was replaced by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in 1909. The architect was Joseph R. Worcester. The bridge had the appearance of historical accuracy in that it closely resembled the bridge as depicted by Doolittle, however many disliked it due to the fact that it was made of concrete. Existing bridge Left to right: the 1836 Battle Monument, the 1956 Old North Bridge (restored in 2005), and \\"The Minute Man\\" statue by Daniel Chester French In 1955 the 1909 concrete bridge was damaged beyond repair by flooding due to Hurricane Diane. This took place as the town was considering numerous landscape architectural plans to better preserve the monuments at the site and the surrounding grounds. Concord residents mounted protests, urging that the new commemorative bridge should be made of wood and not concrete. Massachusetts politicians including Massachusetts Commissioner of Public Works and future Governor John Volpe and the current Governor Christian Herter pressed for funding from Congress but this failed to pass. In 1956 the Commonwealth of Massachusetts undertook construction of a new bridge. The state engaged the architectural firm of Whitman and Howard to design the new bridge. Working for that firm, architect Howard Perkins was responsible for drafting the plans. Perkins closely examined the Doolittle drawing and came up with an interpretation based on the 1760 bridge. His design featured, according to architectural conservator Judith Q. Sullivan, \\"an arched pile bent bridge consisting of six bents of three piles each.\\" Perkins omitted some features evident in the Doolittle design and incorporated others not present for the sake of stability. The most prominent of these added features are the pile header beams which extend on either side of the bridge platform and the cross braces connected to them. These provide strength but also allow flexibility during floods The 1956 bridge used pressure treated wood but incorporated hand hewn timbers for an authentic appearance. The bridge is 109 feet and 8 inches long between abutments. Construction was completed in September 1956 and dedicated on September 29, 1956 by Governor Herter. In 1959, the bridge and surrounding land became part of the Minute Man National Historical Park. When the park was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1966, the bridge was listed as \\"a contributing structure which illustrates the continuing commemorative importance of the place.\\" In 2002, an engineering conditions assessment of the bridge was conducted and found significant deterioration. After further preservation studies, Minute Man National Historical Park embarked on an extensive restoration of the bridge in 2005. Monuments placed at the site =1836 Battle Monument= The 1836 Battle Monument and Old North Bridge In 1835, when there was no bridge at the site, Rev. Ezra Ripley, who resided nearby at the Old Manse, donated a narrow parcel of land to the town. This parcel would allow public access from Monument Street to the proposed site of a monument on the east bank where the Old North Bridge had stood. The parcel included a section of the old Groton Road which once led to the bridge as well as the grave sites of two British soldiers who were killed in the fight and buried nearby the bridge. The town of Concord erected the 1836 Battle Monument (as it is now known) with funds donated by the Bunker Hill Monument Association. The obelisk was designed by Solomon Willard and placed on the land donated by Ripley, near where the east abutment of the bridge had been. The inscription on the monument reads, \\"HERE On the 19 of April, 1775, was made the first forcible resistance to British aggression / On the opposite Bank stood the American Militia / Here stood the Invading Army and on this spot the first of the Enemy fell in the War of that Revolution which gave Independence to these United States / In gratitude to GOD and In the love of Freedom this Monument was erected AD. 1836.\\" Concord dedicated the monument on Independence Day, July 4, 1837. Congressman Samuel Hoar gave the dedication address. For the occasion, Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote his \\"Concord Hymn\\" which was sung by a chorus at the dedication. The first, and best known, of the four stanzas of this poem is: ::By the rude bridge that arched the flood, ::Their flag to April's breeze unfurled, ::Here once the embattled farmers stood ::And fired the shot heard round the world. This stanza was later etched into the pedestal of the 1875 \\"Minute Man\\" statue. =\\"The Minute Man\\" statue= \\"The Minute Man\\" by FrenchThe location of the 1836 Battle Monument did not sit well with some in Concord. Because there was no longer a bridge, the obelisk had been placed on the eastern bank where the British had stood during the Concord Fight. A Concord farmer named Ebenezer Hubbard was particularly annoyed that the spot where the first Americans had lost their lives during the Concord Fight remained unmarked. Upon his death in 1870, he left the Town of Concord $1,000 to place a monument on the west side of the Concord River and to reconstruct the Old North Bridge to provide access to it. The residents of Concord pressed to finish both the new bridge and monument in time for the centennial celebration in 1875. Daniel Chester French, then 21 years old, was engaged by the Monument Committee to sculpt a statue representing a minuteman. Although commissioned to sculpt a generic provincial soldier, French was inspired by the story of Capt. Isaac Davis of Acton, Massachusetts. Davis commanded the company which led the advance on the Old North Bridge. He was among the first killed and the first American officer killed in action during the Revolution. French attempted to model the facial features of his statue after photographs of Isaac Davis's descendants. The statue was cast from melted down Civil War cannons at the Ames Foundry. It was French's first public work and was well received. French is best known for his 1920 statue, \\"Abraham Lincoln\\", in the Lincoln Memorial. \\"The Minute Man\\" has been used as the symbol of the United States National Guard and on coins such as the Massachusetts state quarter. =Graves of British soldiers= 1910 marker for the grave of two British soldiersThree British soldiers were killed during the Concord Fight. They were Privates James Hall, Thomas Smith and Patrick Gray, all of the 4th Regiment of Foot. One of these men was carried to Concord center, died and was buried there. Two others died at the bridge and were buried adjacent to a stone wall forming the boundary of the Old Manse property. It is not known which of the three are buried at the Old North Bridge site. Initially, their graves were simply marked by two plain stones. Nathaniel Hawthorne, who resided at the Old Manse for a time, called these a \\"humbler...yet more interesting\\" token of the Concord Fight than the 1836 Battle Monument. In 1875, a granite slab simply inscribed, \\"Grave of the British Soldiers\\" was installed in time for the centennial. In 1910 residents of Concord placed a more substantial granite marker inscribed with a stanza from James Russell Lowell's 1849 poem, \\"Lines, Suggested By the Graves of Two English Soldiers On Concord Battle-Ground:\\" ::They came three thousand miles and died ::To keep the past upon its throne: ::Unheard, beyond the ocean tide, ::Their English Mother made her moan. 1975 Bicentennial Commemoration On the 200th anniversary of the battle, President Gerald Ford gave a speech at the bridge as part of the United States Bicentennial celebrations. A crowd of over 15,000 people attended the exercises.

Several styles of dance are shown in the film, such as tango, foxtrot, swing, rumba and merengue. Plot Based on a feature article written by Sewell, Mad Hot Ballroom looks inside the lives of 11-year-old New York City public school kids who journey into the world of ballroom dancing and reveal pieces of themselves along the way. Told from the students' perspectives as the children strive toward the final citywide competition, the film chronicles the experiences of students at three schools in the neighborhoods of Tribeca, Bensonhurst and Washington Heights. The students are united by an interest in the ballroom dancing lessons, which builds over a 10-week period and culminates in a competition to find the school that has produced the best dancers in the city. As the teachers cajole their students to learn the intricacies of the various disciplines, Agrelo intersperses classroom footage with the students' musings on life; many of these reveal an underlying maturity. Release The documentary premiered at the 2005 Slamdance Film Festival in Park City, Utah and was purchased by Paramount Classics and Nickelodeon Movies. It had a limited theatrical release in the United States on May 13, 2005. Mad Hot Ballroom was the second highest grossing documentary in 2005 after March of the Penguins.

Biography =Early years= Camilo de Almeida Pessanha was born the illegitimate son of Francisco Ant√≥nio de Almeida Pessanha, an aristocratic law student, and Maria do Esp√≠rito Santo Duarte Nunes Pereira, his housekeeper, on September 7, 1867, at 11.00 p.m., in S√© Nova, Coimbra, Portugal. The couple would have four more children. In 1870, after his father's graduation, the family moved to Azores, where he had been appointed public defender. In 1878 the Pessanha family was living in Lamego where young Camilo completed his basic schooling. In 1884 he finished his secondary studies and, following his father's footsteps, entered law school at the Coimbra University. A year later, he wrote his first poem, L√∫brica (Lascivious). The next several years he would write more poems and publish some of them in local newspapers. From early 1888 up to late 1889 he interrupted his studies, due to his frail health quite affected by depression over a sorrow of love. In October 1889 he resumed his studies and began a close and lifelong friendship with Ant√≥nio Os√≥rio de Castro, a fellow student and director of a paper where he published some his poems. Pessanha also became intimate with his friend's sister, Ana de Castro Os√≥rio, a would-be writer and pioneer feminist in Portugal. In 1890 he graduated, started working as an attorney and discovered the works of French poet Paul Verlaine, which would deeply influence him. = Life in Macau = In August 1893, lured by the mysteries of the Orient,Rep√≥rter X, Mem√≥rias de um Ex-Morfin√≥mano, Propaganda, Lisboa, 1976, pgs. 65-66 Pessanha applied for a position as philosophy teacher in the newly established gymnasium of Macau, then a Portuguese colony in distant China. He was appointed on December 18, along with Wenceslau de Moraes, among others. On February 19, 1894 he sailed to Macau where he docked April 10. In 1895 he bought a Chinese concubine from a broker. Her name was Lei Ngoi Long and brought with her Ngun-Jen, her daughter.Upon her mother's death, she would succeed her in Pessanha's affections. A year later, on 21 November, his son Jo√£o Manuel would born. The local Portuguese conservative community was shocked by this overt relationship, but Pessanha was disdainfully indifferent to them. Throughout the years, Pessanha would return for short stays in Portugal, due to failing health. During one of his stays he would have met Fernando Pessoa, an ardent admirer of Pessanha's poetry, influencing his work between 1909-1911 - his Paulismo phase. In spite of being thought of as an eccentric, over the years he became a central figure in the cultural, political and civic world of Macau. He was a respected teacher (of Philosophy, History, Geography, Portuguese Literature, Law), attorney and judge, and he was an adviser to the several governors of the city. In 1900 he was nominated public defender, and later judge. To pass his time, besides composing poetry, he immersed himself in the local culture, collected Chinese art and became a respected China authority in the colony. Pessanha died on March 1, 1926 due to tuberculosis aggravated by his chronic opium addiction.  His work  Since the poet had the unique talent of re-writing his works from memory and had the habit of giving his poems to close friends, many of his poems had either become lost or inadvertently destroyed. To counter this, Ana de Castro Os√≥rio urged Pessanha to place his poems in a single volume. With Pessanha's blessing, Jo√£o de Castro Os√≥rio published Clepsidra (1920). In the years that followed, other poems not included in Clepsidra but attributed to Pessanha appeared in the Portuguese press. Clepsidra eventually came out in a 1945 edition and was radically re-edited in 1956. Gaspar Sim≈ëes brought to light several more poems and versions of previously published poems as well as Pessanha's translations of Chinese elegies in his A Obra e o Homem: Camilo Pessanha (1967). In 1994, Paulo Franchetti authored a critical edition of Clepsidra including previously unknown fragments. At first primarily influenced by Ces√°rio Verde and Paul Verlaine, Pessanha became the most pure of Portuguese Symbolists.

The Star PD improved on its predecessor (Star Model PKM) by using a low-profile adjustable rear sight and by removing material from the slide and other small changes. These modifications, combined with its aluminum alloy construction, resulted in a slim, compact, lightweight and relatively powerful pistol, revolutionary for the time. As it also bore an external resemblance to the well-known M1911 pistol, the gun sold very well in the U.S. until it was replaced in 1990 by the Firestar M45. This pistol began the trend towards the production by other manufacturers of compact 1911-style pistols, which continues to the present day. However, the pistol did have some flaws. Very late-model PDs were built with manufacturing shortcuts, especially in the fabrication of the slide, and will not last as long as the earlier models. Even the earlier models are more likely to wear out more quickly with the use of full-power ammunition than steel-framed pistols due to the lightweight alloy construction. Well-known firearms writers such as Jeff Cooper applied the phrase \\"carried much, shot little\\" to the Star PD, and advocated purchasing two pistols - one for the practice range, and one for carry. In addition, the pistol uses an internal plastic buffer to reduce the battering effects of recoil on the alloy frame. This buffer gradually wears with use, and requires replacement after firing approximately 1000 rounds. Failure to replace the buffer when required will accelerate wear on the pistol, and pieces of a disintegrating buffer may cause malfunctions, quite possibly at critical times. Despite these flaws, and with proper maintenance, the Star Model PD was generally very well liked, and still has a strong following among some firearms enthusiasts. It is a common misconception that \\"PD\\" stands for \\"Police Department,\\" however, \\"PD\\" is actually the initials for Pete Dicky who submitted the idea for the Star PD to Star Bonafacia, in Spain.

Warrick in Return of the Jedi.David Tomblin: A.D. to Indy Jones, Starlog #86 pp. 44‚Äì46, 58. September 1984.  Overview  The film was created during production of Return of the Jedi, on which Tomblin worked as first assistant director, and as second unit director, filming Ewok battle scenes. \\"The film is a curiosity, half-documentary about the making of Jedi, half-fairy tale about a little boy who becomes an Ewok. He thinks he's the only Ewok in the world, but eventually finds there are others,\\" Tomblin said in a 1984 interview. One potential use of the film mooted at the time of filming was to use it as a promotional film for Return of the Jedi. However, post-production on Return of the Ewok was never completed, and it has never been officially released. The film is set in both the \\"real world\\" and the fictional locations of the Star Wars universe. Real world locations include Chelsea Football Club's stadium Stamford Bridge, Heathrow Airport and Elstree Studios and the actors' dressing rooms there. Fictional locations include Dagobah, the second Death Star, Jabba's Palace, and Endor. Throughout the film, these two realities are intermixed to produce an alternate reality.  Plot  Return of the Ewok focuses on the fictional account of Davis' decision to become an actor and act as Wicket in Return of the Jedi (notably, Davis refers to the film as Revenge of the Jedi, its temporary pre-release title). It also follows his transformation into Wicket. As Warwick and as Wicket, he visits and interacts with many of the cast and crew of the movie and then characters of the movie. As Warwick, he goes to Elstree Studios where he interacts with the cast, both in and out of character. At one point, he even interacts with Luke Skywalker as he jumps out of a movie screen. As Wicket, he goes to the Death Star to see Darth Vader, and is chased by Boba Fett, eventually meeting Yoda on Dagobah.  Production  Filming took place during the production of Return of the Jedi, including at lunchtimes and on weekends. \\"At lunch times, I would rush around and try and shoot pieces for it,\\" Tomblin said. George Lucas financed the film, though costs were limited to expenses such as film stock. \\"Everyone contributed their time and talent for absolutely nothing,\\" Tomblin said.  Cast  *Warwick Davis as Himself / Wicket W. Warrick *Roy Kinnear as the Talent Agent *Robert Watts as Producer *Harrison Ford as Himself / Han Solo *Mark Hamill as Himself / Luke Skywalker *Carrie Fisher as Herself / Princess Leia Organa *David Prowse as Himself / Darth Vader *Anthony Daniels as C-3PO *Frank Oz as Yoda *Peter Mayhew as Chewbacca *Jeremy Bulloch as Boba Fett *Tim Rose as Salacious Crumb Players of Chelsea Football Club also make an appearance in the film, alongside Davis' mother, father, and sister; Ashley, Sue, and Kim. David Tomblin also appears as himself and provides the voices of Darth Vader and Boba Fett. Michele Gruska is heard as the voice of Sy Snootles with Deep Roy and Simon Williamson playing Droopy McCool and Max Rebo respectively.  Music  *\\"Star Wars\\" Theme Music - John Williams *\\"Take the Long Way Home\\" - Supertramp  Versions  = Official = For many years, the only confirmed copy of Return of the Ewok was a video copy in Warwick Davis' own home entertainment center.Warwick Davis: Return of the Ewok, Starlog #101 pp. 29‚Äì31. December 1985. This copy has been said by Davis to have been frequently shown to only close family, friends, and colleagues. Despite viewings of the film by those close to him, he had never shown the film publicly, and many fans had never even heard of it until 1996, when Davis mentioned it in an interview for the Star Wars Insider magazine. Davis publicly screened the film at the first Star Wars Celebration in 1999, and it was also screened at Celebration II in 2002 and Celebration III in 2005. The original 16 mm print was said to be lost; according to Davis, his VHS copy is the only one in existence. However, a copy of the print, or even the original print, may actually reside in the Lucasfilm archives. Evidence of this was shown on the 2004 DVD release of the Star Wars Original Trilogy. A clip from the film of Wicket being chased by Boba Fett on the Death Star was included as part of the Easter egg of bloopers from the trilogy. It appeared in a widescreen format in good quality, suggesting that it had been preserved. In April 2005, approximately four minutes of the film was made available on the official Star Wars website for members of Hyperspace, the official fan club, to download and view after the film was shown at Celebration III. Davis said at the convention that he loaned his VHS tape to Lucasfilm, who made a digital copy of it, and since it was the best known copy, that it was the source for the Hyperspace clip. The copy online at StarWars.com shows a minimal amount of cleanup, and the soundtrack has been altered in several places. Where the original film used Supertramp's \\"Take The Long Way Home\\", the online version substitutes incidental music to avoid copyright clearance issues. Dialogue has also been changed--in one example, Wicket's cry of \\"Crikey, it's Lord Vader!\\" near the end of the film has been excised. Unlike its counterpart mockumentary, R2-D2: Beneath the Dome, Return of the Ewok has not yet been officially released on DVD or any other format. Davis has reportedly stated that a future release is \\"possible.\\" . In 2020, high quality footage from Return of the Ewok appears in Warwick & Son, a 6 minute documentary about Warwick Davis returning to play Wicket W. Warrick in 2019's Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker. The documentary is featured as bonus content on home video releases of the film and on Disney +.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAWVY8EKC6o&t;=1s = Bootlegs = In 2004, a recording of the entire film was put on eBay by someone who attended a screening, but the auction was pulled because the copy was reportedly given to the seller under strict agreement that it was not to be copied or sold. At least two people are alleged to have filmed it at Celebration II, but their copies have yet to surface. Although the film was also screened in the Pop Culture room at 2005's Celebration III, no illicit recordings have yet surfaced. The best known quality bootleg of the entire movie is a fan preservation project created in May 2005, a collaboration between fans Garrett Gilchrist and SKot Kirkwood. Their DVD version uses footage taken from the clip on StarWars.com combined with someone's camcorder recording of the movie from one of its public showings, as well as clips culled from other sources, such as a brief excerpt that was shown on VH1. Gilchrist digitally cleaned up portions of the video and audio, then combined and edited the footage from different sources together to reconstruct the film. At 25 minutes, this version is slightly longer than the original, with Gilchrist adding his own opening and ending credits. The first UK screening of this movie was at Empire Day 3 in Watford, England in 1996. A later showing was at the National Space Centre in Leicester for the Star Wars day convention on November 12, 2005. It was presented by Warwick Davis and also included a question-and-answer session afterward.

The technology has potential applications in diagnostic imaging and material science. Currently, it is used in medical research to measure the 3-D location and concentration of nanoparticles. Imaging does not use ionizing radiation and can produce a signal at any depth within the body. MPI was first conceived in 2001 by scientists working at the Royal Philips Research lab in Hamburg. The first system was established and reported in 2005. Since then, the technology has been advanced by academic researchers at several universities around the world. The first commercial MPI scanners have recently become available from Magnetic Insight and Bruker Biospin. The hardware used for MPI is very different from MRI. MPI systems use changing magnetic fields to generate a signal from superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) nanoparticles. These fields are specifically designed to produce a single magnetic field free region. A signal is only generated in this region. An image is generated by moving this region across a sample. Since there is no natural SPIO in tissue, a signal is only detected from the administered tracer. This provides images without background. MPI is often used in combination with anatomical imaging techniques (such as CT or MRI) providing information on the location of the tracer.  Applications  Magnetic particle imaging combines high tracer sensitivity with submillimeter resolution. Imaging is performed in a range of milliseconds to seconds. The iron oxide tracer used with MPI are cleared naturally by the body through the mononuclear phagocyte system. The iron oxide nanoparticles are broken down in the liver, where the iron is stored and used to produce hemoglobin. SPIOs have previously been used in humans for iron supplementation and liver imaging. = Blood pool imaging =  Cardiovascular  The first in vivo MPI results provided images of a beating mouse heart in 2009. With further research, this could eventually be used for real-time cardiac imaging.  Oncology  MPI has numerous applications to the field of oncology research. Accumulation of a tracer within solid tumors can occur through the enhanced permeability and retention effect. This has been successfully used to detect tumor sites within rats. The high sensitivity of the technique means it may also be possible to image micro-metastasis through the development of nanoparticles targeted to cancer cells. MPI is being investigated as a clinical alternative screening technique to nuclear medicine in order to reduce radiation exposure in at-risk populations. = Cell tracking = By tagging therapeutic cells with iron oxide nanoparticles, MPI allows them to tracked throughout the body. This has applications in regenerative medicine and cancer immunotherapy. Imaging can be used to improve the success of stem cell therapy by following the movement of these cells in the body. The tracer is stable while tagged to a cell and remains detectable past 87 days.  Superparamagnetic tracer  The SPIO tracer used in magnetic particle imaging is detectable within biological fluids, such as the blood. This fluid is very responsive to even weak magnetic fields, and all of the magnetic moments will line up in the direction of an induced magnetic field. These particles can be used because the human body does not contain anything which will create magnetic interference in imaging. As the sole tracer, the properties of SPIONs are of key importance to the signal intensity and resolution of MPI. Iron oxide nanoparticles, due to their magnetic dipoles, exhibit a spontaneous magnetization that can be controlled by an applied magnetic field. Therefore, the performance of SPIONs in MPI is critically dependent on their magnetic properties, such as saturation magnetization, magnetic diameter, and relaxation mechanism. The figure to the right is a representative image of a Point Spread Function (PSF) obtained using Relax Mode in MPI scanner, pointing out the signal intensity and full width at half maximum (FWHM) which corresponds to the signal resolution. Upon application of an external magnetic field, the relaxation of SPIONs can be governed by two mechanisms, N√©el, and Brownian relaxation. When the entire particle rotates with respect to the environment, it is following Brownian relaxation, which is affected by the physical diameter. When only the magnetic dipole rotates within the particles, the mechanism is called N√©el relaxation, which is affected by the magnetic diameter. According to the Langevin model of superparamagnetism, the spatial resolution of MPI should improve cubically with the magnetics diameter, which can be obtained by fitting magnetization versus magnetic field curve to a Langevin model. However, more recent calculations suggest that there exists an optimal SPIONs magnetic size range (~26 nm) for MPI. This is because of blurring caused by Brownian relaxation of large magnetics size SPIONs. Although magnetic size critically affects the MPI performance, it is often poorly analyzed in publications reporting applications of MPI using SPIONs. Often, commercially available tracers or home-made tracers are used without thorough magnetic characterization. Importantly, due to spin canting and disorder at the surface, or due to the formation of mixed-phase nanoparticles, the equivalent magnetic diameter can be smaller than the physical diameter. And magnetic diameter is critical because of the response of particles to an applied magnetic field dependent on the magnetic diameter, not physical diameter. The largest equivalent magnetic diameter can be the same as the physical diameter. A recent review paper by Chandrasekharan et al. summarizes properties of various iron oxide contrast agents and their MPI performance measured using their in-house Magnetic Particle Spectrometer, shown in the picture here. It should be pointed out that the core diameter listed in the table is not necessarily the magnetic diameter. The table provides a comparison of all current published SPIONs for MPI contrast agents. As seen in the table, LS017, with a SPION core size of 28.7 nm and synthesized through heating up thermal decomposition with post- synthesis oxidation, has the best resolution compared with others with lower core size. Resovist (Ferucarbotran), consisting of iron oxide made via coprecipitation, is the most commonly used and commercially available tracer. However, as suggested by Gleich et al., only 3% of the total iron mass from Resovist contributes to the MPI signal due to its polydispersity, leading to relatively low MPI sensitivity. The signal intensity of MPI is influenced by both the magnetic core diameter and the size distribution of SPIONs. Comparing the MPI sensitivity listed in the above table, LS017 has the highest signal intensity (54.57 V/g of Fe) as particles are monodisperse and possess a large magnetic diameter compared with others. The surface coating of SPIONs is of key importance as well, since it influences the stability, pharmacokinetics behavior, and biodistribution of particles in biological environments. The biodistribution of carboxy-dextran and PEG-modified SPIONs were studied by Keselman et al. using MPI. Results suggested that PEG-modified SPIONs had a relatively long blood half-life of 4.2 h before uptake by the liver and spleen, compared with carboxy-dextran coated SPIONs which cleared rapidly to the liver. The choice of surface coating influences the potential applications using MPI. A carboxy-dextran coated SPION is useful for imaging of liver while PEG-modified particles are more preferred for long-term circulation. Taking all these concepts and information into consideration, we can begin to define that the ‚Äúideal‚Äù particles in the context of producing better MPI sensitivity and resolution should possess the following characteristics: *magnetic core size around 26 nm and close to the physical diameter *monodisperse *suitable surface coating  Advantages  *High resolution (~0.4 mm) *Fast image results (~20 ms) *No radiation *No iodine *No background noise (high contrast)  Congresses, workshops  * WMIS MPI Interest Group Meeting * Homepage of the Annual International Workshop on MPI  References   Further reading  * First in vivo magnetic particle imaging of lung perfusion in rats.

After the retirement of Fujio Matsuda, Simone was both Chancellor of the University of Hawaii at Manoa and President of the University of Hawaii System from 1984 to 1992. As President at Manoa, Simone lobbied for greater independence from the Hawaiian legislature‚Äôs control in order to retain accreditation. During his tenure, UH Manoa consolidated departments, research institutes and federal cooperative programs from different parts of campus into the School of Ocean and Earth Sciences and Technology, a leading education and research resource. He became president of RIT on September 1, 1992, succeeding Thomas R. Plough. His tenure at RIT saw additional PhD programs (in microsystems engineering, computing and information sciences, and color science) inaugurated and improvements made to RIT's athletic program (such as the construction of the Gordon Field House and Activities Center and the elevation of the men's hockey team to Division I).

After taking over his father's real estate development business, Smith developed much of the Crystal City neighborhood, just south of Washington, D.C. Early life and education Smith was born to a Jewish family, the son of Leah (n√©e Goldstein) and Charles E. Smith. His father was a Jewish immigrant from Russia who founded the Charles E. Smith Companies in 1946. The company grew to become one of the largest commercial and residential landlords in the Washington, D.C., area, managing of office space and more than 30,000 residential units. Smith graduated from the University of Maryland, College Park.  Career  Robert and his brother-in-law, Robert P. Kogod, took control of Charles E. Smith Companies in 1967. Smith oversaw construction and development, and Kogod led leasing and management. Starting in the early 1960s, Smith developed the Crystal City neighborhood of Arlington, Virginia, just south of Washington, DC, which at the time, Smith said \\"was very unattractive\\" but Smith saw that \\"there was an airport, there was The Pentagon, and that driving to D.C. was a pretty short distance\\". Smith attracted government leases by offering discounted rents that did not go up over time. In 1988, an article in the Washington Post estimated his net worth to be $290 million. In 1995, Forbes estimated the Smith family fortune to be worth $560 million. In 2001, the residential division of the company was merged into Archstone, which was sold to Equity Residential and Avalon Bay in 2013. The commercial division of the company was merged into Vornado Realty Trust, which merged the division into JBG Smith in 2017. Philanthropy =Education and research= Smith gave a total of approximately $100 million to the University of Maryland, College Park, his alma mater, including $30 million each to the Clarice Smith Performing Arts Center, completed in 2001 and named after his wife, Clarice Smith, and the business school, Robert H. Smith School of Business, which was named after him in 1998. The Kogod School of Business at the American University in Washington, DC, is named after Robert P. Kogod, brother-in-law of Robert H. Smith. The Charles E. Smith Athletic Center at George Washington University is named in his father's honor. Smith's contributions to Johns Hopkins Hospital allowed for the construction of a new research and surgical building for the Wilmer Eye Institute. =Historic preservation efforts= Smith's donations help fund the Robert H. & Clarice Smith Auditorium at George Washington's Mount Vernon Estate and Gardens. Smith donated to fund the visitor's center at Thomas Jefferson's Monticello. The Thomas Jefferson Foundation renamed its International Center for Jefferson Studies the Robert H. Smith International Center for Jefferson Studies after Smith endowed the Center in 2004. In 2008, Smith donated $7 million of the $15 million cost to renovate President Lincoln's Cottage at the Soldiers' Home. On November 3, 2007, the National Society of Madison Family Descendants awarded the Madison Family Cup to Robert H. Smith for his extraordinary contributions to James Madison‚Äôs legacy and the preservation and development of Montpelier.Robert H. Smith receives the Madison Cup in 2007 Smith collected European paintings before donating his collection to the National Gallery of Art. Smith served as President of the gallery between 1993 and 2003, during which the museum expanded significantly. =Jewish causes= Smith's family also gave charitably to several Jewish communal causes in the greater Washington, DC, area, including the Charles E. Smith Life Communities, a senior housing and elder care campus in Rockville, Maryland, and the Charles E. Smith Jewish Day School, also in Rockville. Both organizations are named for Smith's father. He served as chairman of the board of governors at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem from 1981 to 1985 and was awarded an honorary doctorate degree in 1984. He served as president of the Washington D.C. chapter of the American Friends of the Hebrew University. =National Humanities Medal= In 2008, President George W. Bush awarded Smith with the National Humanities Medal. Personal life In 1952, Smith married artist Clarice Smith, n√©e Chasen. They had three children, Michelle and David, and Stephen (died 2003)..

Timeshare buyers generated $15 million in revenue for the Metairie company, as well as thousands more each year in maintenance fees. Three lawsuits against Legends have been consolidated and are currently pending in New Jersey Superior Court; two were filed by timeshare owners alleging mismanagement or impropriety in selling timeshares while the building was in violation of state fire codes, and one seeks class- action status for all timeshare owners. In a separate matter, Mountain Spa Inc., a McAfee-based spa company that rented space at Legends, sued the resort for $1 million in May 2006, alleging that the hotel frequently failed to provide heat and electricity when the spa rented space there starting in 2003. As a result, spa officials said they were frequently unable to operate its health club and had to close in August 2005.\\"Spa sues resort over electricity.\\" The Star-Ledger, Morris Edition, News section, pg. 29.

Biography Hagner was the son of government auditor Peter Hagner, and was born in Washington, D.C. After graduating the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, Hagner was assigned first to artillery, then topographical engineers, and finally ordnance in 1838, in which department service he spent the balance of his career. At the outset of the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, First Lieutenant Hagner was assigned to the siege battery company, and was brevetted captain and major for \\"gallant and meritorious conduct\\" in battles leading to the capture of Mexico City in 1847. In the years before the American Civil War, Hagner commanded several arsenals, responsible for maintenance and upkeep on weaponry and military stores. Considered a moderate unionist with a reputation of being a level- headed career soldier, the James Buchanan administration selected Hagner to command of the strategic St. Louis Arsenal at the outbreak of the war. The arsenal at the time was sought by both Union and Confederate sympathizers for its valuable contents, and during the early days of the war both legitimate and partisan guerrilla military units from both sides schemed to obtain control. While in command, Hagner used his authority to restrict Union Army Captain Nathaniel Lyon's access to the arsenal. Lyon was a well connected Republican who sought access to the arsenal for the purpose of arming pro- Union military units to fight against the seceding states. Lyon, enraged that his commander had denied him the arsenal's contents, then wrote of Hagner, making a threat to \\"pitch him in the river.\\" After the inauguration of Abraham Lincoln, Lyon began exerting pressure on the War Department through his friend Frank Blair, brother of the incoming Lincoln cabinet officer Montgomery Blair. Lyon sought to have Hagner relieved of the arsenal command and elevate himself as the replacement. Blair subsequently used his War Department connections to fulfill Lyon's request and Hagner's tenure at the arsenal was ended. By March 1862, Hagner was serving on a commission on ordnance contracts and claims. He served as inspector of factories manufacturing small arms for the government until late 1863, when Hagner was promoted lieutenant colonel and held command of Watervliet Arsenal until war's end. Brevetted brigadier general for service; Hagner was a full Colonel in the ordnance department when he retired from the Army in 1881.

Life and career Bauch was born in Gro√ü-Nossen, M√ºnsterberg District, Silesia, Prussia (now in Poland) and studied philosophy at Freiburg, Strasbourg, and Heidelberg. In 1901, he received his doctorate under Heinrich Rickert at Freiburg, which entitled him to teach some courses (one of his doctoral students was Rudolf Carnap, who later became a central figure of the Vienna Circle). Bauch completed his habilitation, entitling him to a professorship, at the University of Halle in 1903. He taught as a \\"titular professor\\" at Halle from 1903 to 1910, and from 1911 onward as an \\"ordinary professor\\" at the University of Jena. At Jena, he befriended Gottlob Frege and collaborated with the neo-Kantian philosopher of language Richard H√∂nigswald. Bauch was an influential figure in the Kant-Gesellschaft (Kant Society) and helped publish the Prussian Academy's edition of Kant's collected works. Until 1916, he was editor of the Kant Society's journal, Kant-Studien (Kant Studies). He was forced to resign after publishing an anti-semitic article in a right-wing nationalist tabloid, which caused a storm of controversy in the Kant Society. (Many neo-Kantians, including Bauch's subsequent colleague H√∂nigswald, were Jewish, and quite a few were social democrats.) In 1917, Bauch founded a philosophical society of his own, the German Philosophical Society, which issued the journal Beitr√§ge zur Philosophie des Deutschen Idealismus (Contributions to the Philosophy of German Idealism). Frege was among its contributors. When the Nazis came to power, Bauch's political views stood him in good stead. While many neo-Kantians had to emigrate and some ended up in concentration camps (including, for a year, H√∂nigswald), Bauch became head of the German Philosophical Society in 1934. Philosophical work Heinrich Rickert, whom Bauch studied under, was the most important leader of the so-called Baden school of neo-Kantianism after Wilhelm Windelband. Unlike its main rival, the Marburg school, the Baden neo-Kantians were more interested in practical philosophy than in the philosophy of science. They emphasized the distinction between fact and value and sought to use the concept of \\"value\\" for epistemological and ontological purposes. For example, to say that a sentence is \\"true\\" is sometimes equated with saying that it 'commands assent' (i.e., that it ought to be believed). Bauch, however, was a rather unorthodox scion of the Baden school, so much so that some commentators regard him as representing a distinct variety of neo- Kantianism. While Bauch shared an interest in the value theory, he also had a much more lively interest in the philosophy of mathematics and logic than was common among the Baden neo-Kantians. Unlike Rickert, he was sympathetic to Gottlob Frege's logicism (which Rickert had rejected on the old-fashioned Kantian grounds that logic was analytic, mathematics synthetic), and was conciliatory toward the Marburg neo-Kantians' belief in the unity of logic and mathematics.

Emerson was the town minister in Concord, chaplain to the Provincial Congress when it met at Concord in October 1774 and later a chaplain to the Continental Army. Emerson observed the fight at the North Bridge, a part of the Concord Fight, from his farm fields while his wife and children witnessed the fight from the upstairs windows of their house. Emerson died in October 1776 in West Rutland, Vermont, while returning home from Fort Ticonderoga. His widow, Phebe Emerson, remarried to the Rev. Ezra Ripley, who succeeded Emerson as the minister at First Parish Church in Concord.Richardson, Robert D. Jr. (1995). Emerson: The Mind on Fire. Berkeley, California: University of California Press, 182. Their family continued to live in the Old Manse. Ripley served as Concord's town minister for 63 years. In October 1834, Ralph Waldo Emerson moved to Concord and boarded at the Manse where he lived with his aging step-grandfather Ezra Ripley. He shared the home with his mother Ruth, his brother Charles, and his aunt Mary Moody Emerson.Richardson, Robert D. Jr. (1995). Emerson: The Mind on Fire. Berkeley, California: University of California Press, 184. While there, he wrote the first draft of his essay \\"Nature\\", a foundational work of the Transcendentalist movement. Also while living at the Old Manse, on January 24, 1835, Emerson proposed in a letter to Lydia Jackson.Richardson, Robert D. Jr. (1995). Emerson: The Mind on Fire. Berkeley, California: University of California Press, 190. After their marriage, they moved elsewhere in Concord, to a home he named \\"Bush\\", now known as the Ralph Waldo Emerson House.Wilson, Susan. Literary Trail of Greater Boston. Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company, 2000: 127. =Hawthorne years= In 1842, the American writer Nathaniel Hawthorne rented the Old Manse for $100 a year. He moved in with his wife, transcendentalist Sophia Peabody, on July 9, 1842, as newlyweds.Corbett, William. Literary New England: A History and Guide. Boston: Faber and Faber, 1993: 112. Peabody had previously visited Concord and met Ralph Waldo Emerson while working on a bas-relief portrait medallion of his brother Charles Emerson, who had died in 1836. She praised the town to Hawthorne, who responded, \\"Would that we could build our cottage this very now amid the scenes. My heart thirsts and languishes to be there\\".Mellow, James R. Nathaniel Hawthorne in His Times. Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 1980: 173. Prior to their arrival at the Manse, Henry David Thoreau created a vegetable garden for the couple. The Hawthornes lived in the house for three years. In the upstairs room that Hawthorne used as his study, one can still view affectionate sentiments that the two etched into the window panes. The inscription reads: :Man's accidents are God's purposes. Sophia A.

Large print edition. p. 174. On the first anniversary of his marriage, Hawthorne and his neighbor, poet Ellery Channing, searched the neighboring Concord River for the body of Martha Hunt, a local woman who drowned. Hawthorne wrote of the incident, \\"I never saw or imagined a spectacle of such perfect horror... She was the very image of death-agony.\\"Schreiner, Samuel A., Jr. The Concord Quarter: Alcott, Emerson, Hawthorne, Thoreau, and the Friendship that Freed the American Mind. Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley & Sons, Inc.: 2006: 116‚Äì117. The incident inspired the climactic scene in his novel The Blithedale Romance (1852). The Hawthornes hosted several notable guests while living here. In May 1845, future President of the United States Franklin Pierce visited along with their mutual Bowdoin College friend Horatio Bridge. Peabody recalled the meeting fondly and recorded her first impression of Pierce as \\"loveliness and truth of character and natural refinement.\\"McFarland, Philip (2004). Hawthorne in Concord. New York: Grove Press: 121‚Äì122. . During his time in the Old Manse, Hawthorne published about twenty sketches and tales, including \\"The Birth-Mark\\" and \\"Rappaccini's Daughter\\", which would be included in the collection Mosses from an Old Manse (1846).Corbett, William. Literary New England: A History and Guide. Boston: Faber and Faber, 1993: 113. One description of the house he wrote notes: \\"Between two tall gateposts of roughhewn stone... we behold the gray front of the old parsonage, terminating the vista of an avenue of black ash trees.\\" Apocryphally, the Hawthornes were forced out of the home for not paying their rent.Wineapple, Brenda (2003). Hawthorne: A Life. Random House: New York: 190. . In actuality, the Ripley family wanted to reclaim the home for themselves. The Hawthornes moved to Salem in 1845. Returning to Concord seven years later, by then living on the other side of town at The Wayside, Sophia Hawthorne visited the Old Manse on October 1, 1852, and referred to it as \\"the beloved old house\\".McFarland, Philip (2004). Hawthorne in Concord. New York: Grove Press: 181‚Äì182. . =Modern history= The Old Manse, viewed from its Concord River side The house remained in use by the Emerson-Ripley family until 1939, and was conveyed to the Trustees of Reservations on November 3, 1939. The house was conveyed complete with all its furnishings, and contains a remarkable collection of furniture, books, kitchen implements, dishware, and other items, as well as original wallpaper, woodwork, windows and architectural features. The Old Manse was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1966 and a Massachusetts Archaeological/Historic Landmark the same year. The Manse is open seasonally for guided tours given by the Trustees of Reservations. The garden, originally created by Thoreau, has been recreated. The on-site book store in the house specializes in the American Revolution, women's history, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Transcendentalism, and sustainability.

Professional career Originally signed by the St. Louis Cardinals as a free agent, Hamilton debuted in MLB as a starting pitcher for the Phillies in 1962 and posted a 9‚Äì12 record with an earned run average of 5.09. Pitching for the Mets on May 4, 1966, Hamilton tossed a one-hitter against the Cardinals in St. Louis; the one hit being a bunt single by opposing pitcher Ray Sadecki https://www.baseball- reference.com/boxes/SLN/SLN196605040.shtml. He showed more promise pitching out of the bullpen, and spent most of his career as a relief pitcher until his retirement in 1969, although he was converted back to a starting pitcher for the 1966 and 1967 seasons. In 1967, Hamilton was traded by the Mets to the Angels. On August 18, the Angels were playing the Boston Red Sox in a game that would have important implications for the American League (AL) pennant race. While facing outfielder Tony Conigliaro, who was set in a stance close to home plate, Hamilton hit him with a pitch on his left cheekbone that fractured both his cheekbone and eye socket, and severely damaged his retina. Conigliaro nearly died, and the damage to his vision kept him off the field the remainder of the year and all of 1968. Conigliaro made a promising-but- brief comeback in 1969‚Äì1970, until his vision problems returned, which eventually forced his early retirement from baseball in 1975 at age 30. Hamilton retired in 1969, finishing his career with the White Sox. Personal life Hamilton lived in Branson, Missouri with his wife, Jan. Together, they have a son and two daughters.

The newspaper was based in New York City, was printed in a tabloid format, and was published Monday through Friday. It ceased publication in June 1991. The National was an American attempt to emulate the model of several international all-sports publications, such as La Gazzetta dello Sport (Italy), L'Equipe (France), and others. The paper was founded by Mexican-American media mogul Emilio Azc√°rraga Milmo, who had owned Mexican television conglomerate Televisa and whose family had founded Univision. Azc√°rraga was also the chief financier for the paper and used the success of the international sports papers as his inspiration for founding The National. Overview When The National was launched, it featured National Basketball Association superstars Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson, and Patrick Ewing on the first cover to represent the Chicago, Los Angeles, and New York media markets (where the paper was initially available). The cover price was 50 cents. For his editor in chief, Azc√°rraga turned to veteran sportswriter Frank Deford. At the time of the forming of the paper, Deford was a writer for Sports Illustrated and an NPR contributor. He also had very little newspaper experience, especially where editing was concerned. Future ESPN executive Vince Doria was brought in to be executive editor. Deford immediately set out to get what was referred to by Bill Simmons as a \\"murderer's row\\" of sportswriters to join The National. Deford said that hiring Atlanta Journal-Constitution sports editor Van McKenzie away from the paper was the \\"best thing he did\\" and was the linchpin for getting many of the writers who eventually signed up to write for The National interested. Once McKenzie was hired, he brought his auto racing writer Ed Hinton and investigative reporter and NFL analyst Chris Mortensen with him. Norman Chad, who was writing for The Washington Post at the time, was hired, as was New York Daily News writer Mike Lupica, Rocky Mountain News writer Jay Mariotti, Wrestling Observer Newsletter writer Dave Meltzer, The Dallas Morning News writer Ivan Maisel, The Boston Globe writer Leigh Montville, and various others. Tony Kornheiser considered taking a job with the National but decided to stay at The Washington Post. =Problems= The National used The Wall Street Journal's printing and distribution network to publish separate editions in each time zone. However, this did not help matters. Problems arose almost from day one, as The National was not as widely circulated as expected. For the first few months, where the paper was being rolled out on a market-to-market basis, there was an expected circulation of 250,000 copies a day, eventually hoping to rise to 1,000,000 copies by 2001. The National also did not generate much in the way of advertising revenue as the publishers were unable to secure companies that were able (or willing) to purchase ad space. Furthermore, readers of The National could only receive the paper by purchasing it at retail outlets like newsstands and bookstores or in street boxes; the paper attempted to offer a home delivery subscription service but could not work out the logistics, and editor-in-chief Frank Deford noted that he had to cancel his own potential subscription account when everyone else on his street did. Timing also proved a concern. The Wall Street Journal facilities would often have deliveries leave the distributors at such an early time that The National was often unable to meet deadlines for game results. Another problem this created was inconsistency, as some cities that sold The National in street boxes often saw these boxes left empty. To top it off, major market papers refused to allow The National to run advertising in their publications and some sportswriters at competing local papers resorted to attacking the street boxes with baseball bats. The end As the year went on the financial state of The National got worse and worse, to the point where the paper had tens of millions of dollars cut from its budget as 1991 began. The cover price was increased by a quarter as well, which caused the already low circulation to decline further as readers were even less willing to spend 75 cents to receive national sports news that they could find in their local publications, or the nationally-distributed USA Today by comparison, for 50 cents or even less. Despite a last-ditch effort to start an online distribution through Compuserve, the declining circulation was enough for The National to announce it was ceasing publication. On June 13, 1991, The National put out its final issue with its front cover reading \\"We Had A Ball: The fat lady sings our song.\\" References External links * The National Promotional Video via YouTube * \\"The Greatest Paper that Ever Died,\\" by Alex French and Howie Kahn, Grantland, June 13, 2011 Category:Daily newspapers published in New York City Category:Defunct newspapers published in New York City Category:Publications established in 1990 Category:Publications disestablished in 1991 Category:Sports newspapers ","title":"The National Sports Daily"},{"id":"2170171","text":"Superstition is a belief, not based on human reason or scientific knowledge, that future events may be influenced by one's behaviour in some magical or mystical way.

Part of the \\"Historic Ensemble of the Potala Palace\\", Norbulingka is recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and was added as an extension of this Historic Ensemble in 2001. It was built by the 7th Dalai Lama and served both as administrative centre and religious centre. It is a unique representation of Tibetan palace architecture. Norbulingka Palace is situated in the west side of Lhasa, a short distance to the southwest of Potala Palace. Norbulingka covers an area of around and considered to be the largest man made garden in Tibet. Norbulingka park is considered the premier park of all such horticultural parks in similar ethnic settings in Tibet. During the summer and autumn months, the parks in Tibet, including the Norbulinga, become hubs of entertainment with dancing, singing, music and festivities. The park is where the annual Sho Dun or 'Yoghurt Festival' is held. The Norbulingka palace has been mostly identified with the 13th and the 14th Dalai Lamas who commissioned most of the structures that still stand today. During the invasion of Tibet in 1950, a number of buildings were damaged, but were rebuilt beginning in 2003, when the Chinese government initiated renovation works here to restore some of the damaged structures, and also the greenery, the flower gardens and the lakes. Names In Tibetan, Norbulingka means ‚ÄúTreasure Garden.‚Äù or Treasure Park\\". The word 'Lingka' is commonly used in Tibet to define all horticultural parks in Lhasa and other cities. When the Cultural Revolution began in 1966, Norbulingka was renamed People's Park and opened to the public. Geography and environment The palace, with 374 rooms, is located west of the Potala Palace, which was the winter palace. It is in the western suburb of Lhasa City on the bank of the Kyichu River. When construction of the palace was started (during the 7th Dalai Lama's period) in the 1740s, the site was a barren land, overgrown with weeds and scrub and infested with wild animals. The park, situated at an elevation of had flower gardens of roses, petunias, hollyhocks, marigolds, chrysanthemums and rows of herbs in pots and rare plants. Fruit trees including apple, peach and apricot were also reported (but the fruits did not ripen in Lhasa), and also poplar trees and bamboo. In its heyday, the Norbulingka grounds were also home to wildlife in the form of peacocks and brahminy ducks in the lakes. The park was so large and well-laid-out, that cycling around the area was even permitted to enjoy the beauty of the environment. The gardens are a favorite picnic spot, and provide for a beautiful venue for theater, dancing and festivals, particularly the Shodun or 'Yogurt Festival' at the beginning of August, with families camping in the grounds for days, surrounded by colorful makeshift windbreaks of rugs and scarves while enjoying the height of summer weather. There is also a zoo at Norbulingka, originally created to house the animals which were given to the Dalai Lamas. Heinrich Harrer helped the 14th Dalai Lama build a small movie theater there in the 1950s. History 253x253px Norbulingka Palace of the Dalai Lamas was built about 100 years after the Potala Palace was built on the Parkori peak, over a land area. It was built a little away to the west of the Potala for the exclusive use by the Dalai Lama to stay in during the summer months. Tenzing Gyatso, the present 14th Dalai Lama, stayed here before he fled to India. The building of the palace and the park was undertaken by the 7th Dalai Lama from 1755. The Norbulingka Park and Summer Palace were completed in 1783 under Jampel Gyatso, the 8th Dalai Lama, on the outskirts of Lhasa.The Dalai Lamas of Tibet, p. 102. Thubten Samphel and Tendar. Roli & Janssen, New Delhi. (2004). . and became the summer residence during the reign of the Eighth Dalai Lama. The earliest history of Norbulingka is traced originally to a spring at this location, which was used during the summer months by the 7th Dalai Lama to cure his health problems. Qing Dynasty permitted the Dalai Lama to build a palace at this location for his stay, as a resting pavilion. Since subsequent Dalai Lamas also used to stay here for their studies (before enthronement) and as a summer resort, Norbulingka came to be known as the Summer Palace of the Dalai Lama. The stables of the Dalai Lamas in Norbulingka, photographed in 1986 The 8th Dalai Lama was responsible for many additions to the Norbulingka complex in the form of palaces and gardens. However, it is sometimes reported that 6th through to 12th Dalai Lamas died young and under mysterious circumstances, conjectured as having been poisoned. Most of the credit for the expansion of Norbulingka is given to the 13th and the 14th Dalai Lamas. It was from the Norbulingka palace that the Dalai Lama escaped to India on 17 March 1959, under the strong belief that he would be captured by the Chinese. On this day, the Dalai Lama dressed like an ordinary Tibetan, and, carrying a rifle across his shoulder, left the Norbulinga palace and Tibet to seek asylum in India. As there was a dust storm blowing at that time, he was not recognized. According to Reuters, ‚ÄúThe Dalai Lama and his officials, who had also escaped from the palace, rode out of the city on horses to join his family for the trek to India‚Äù. The Chinese discovered this \\"great escape\\" only two days later. The party journeyed through the Himalayas for two weeks, and finally crossed the Indian border where they received political asylum. Norbulingka was later surrounded by protesters and subject to an attack by the Chinese. The summer residence of the Dalai Lama, located in the Norbulingka Park, is now a tourist attraction. The palace has a large collection of Italian chandeliers, Ajanta frescoes, Tibetan carpets, and many other artifacts. Murals of Buddha and the 5th Dalai Lama are seen in some rooms. The 14th Dalai Lama‚Äôs (who fled from Tibet and took asylum in India) meditation room, bedroom, conference room and bathroom are part of the display and are explained to tourists.Seth, pp.140‚Äì141 Layout Built in the 18th century, the Norbulingka Palace and the garden within its precincts have undergone several additions over the years. The vast complex covers a garden area of 3.6 km2 including 3.4 km2 of lush green pasture land covered with forests. It is said to be the ‚Äúhighest garden‚Äù anywhere in the world and has earned the epithet ‚ÄúPlateau Oxygen Bar.‚Äù The Norbulingka is the \\"world's highest, largest and best-preserved ancient artificial horticultural garden\\"., which also blends gardening with architecture and sculpture arts from several Tibetan ethnic groups; 30,000 cultural relics of ancient Tibetan history are preserved here. The complex is demarcated under five distinct sections. A cluster of buildings to the left of the entrance gate is the Kelsang Phodang (The full name of this palace is \\"bskal bzang bde skyid pho brang\\"), named after the 7th Dalai Lama, Kelsang Gyatso (1708‚Äì1757). It is a three-storied palace with chambers for the worship of Buddha, bedrooms, reading rooms and shelters at the centre. The Khamsum Zilnon, a two-storied pavilion, is opposite the entry gate. The 8th Dalai Lama, Jamphel Gyatso (1758‚Äì1804) substantially enlarged the palace by adding three temples and the perimeter walls on the south east sector and the park also came to life with plantation of fruit trees and evergreens brought from various parts of Tibet. The garden was well developed with a large retinue of gardeners. To the northwest of Kelsang Phodrong is the Tsokyil Phodrong, which is a pavilion in the midst of a lake and the Chensil Phodrong. On the west side of Norbulingka is the Golden Phodron, built by a benefactor in 1922, and a cluster of buildings which were built during the 13th Dalai Lama's time. The 13th Dalai Lama was responsible for architectural modifications, including the large red doors to the palace; he also improved the Chensel Lingkha garden to the northwest. To the north of Tsokyil Phodrong is the Takten Migyur Phodrong which was built in 1954 by 14th Dalai Lama and is the most elegant palace in the complex, a fusion of a temple and villa. The new summer palace, which faces south, was built with Central Government funds, and completed in 1956. The earliest building is the Kelsang Palace built by the Seventh Dalai Lama which is \\"a beautiful example of Yellow Hat architecture. Dalai Lamas watched, from the first floor of this palace, the folk operas held opposite to the Khamsum Zilnon during the Shoton festival. Its fully restored throne room is also of interest.\\"Dowman, Keith. 1988. The Power-places of Central Tibet: The Pilgrim's Guide. Routledge & Kegan Paul, London and New York. , pp. 62‚Äì63. The Norbulingka ‚Äôs most dramatic area was the Lake Palace, built in the southwest area. In the centre of the lake, three islands were connected to the land by short bridges. A palace was built on each island. A horse stable and a row of four houses contained the gifts received by the Dalai Lamas from the Chinese emperors and other foreign dignitaries. Construction of the 'New Palace' was begun in 1954 by the present Dalai Lama, and completed in 1956. It is a double-story structure with a Tibetan flat roof. It has an elaborate layout with a maze of rooms and halls. This modern complex contains chapels, gardens, fountains and pools. It is a modern Tibetan-style building embellished with ornamentation and facilities. In the first floor of this building, there are 301 paintings (frescoes) on Tibetan history, dated to the time when Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama met Chairman Mao Zedong.Chinese,p. 93 As of 1986, the palace had an antique Russian radio, and a Philips console still containing old 78 rpm records. Guard dog on Norbulingka wall The entire Norbulingka complex was delimited by two sets of walls. The area encompassed by the inner wall, painted yellow, was exclusively for the use of the Dalai Lama and his attendants. Officials and the Dalai Lama's royal family lived in the area between the inner yellow wall and the outer wall. A dress code was followed for visitors to enter the palace; those wearing Tibetan dress were allowed; guards posted at the gates controlled the entry, and ensured that no western hat-wearing people (which was made popular in Tibet during Lhamdo Dhondups time) were allowed inside. Wearing shoes inside the park was banned. Guards at the gate offered a formal arms salute to the nobles and high-ranking officials. Even the officials at the lower category also received a salute. The gates outside the yellow wall were heavily protected. Only the Dalai Lama and his guardians could pass through these gates. Tibetan mastiff dogs kept in niches of the compound walls, and tied with long yak hair leashes, were the guard dogs that patrolled the perimeter of the Norbulingka. On the east gate to the Norbulingka there are two Snow Lion statues covered in khatas (thin white scarves offered as a mark of respect), the Snow Lion on the left is accompanied by a lion cub. The mythical Snow Lion is the symbol of Tibet; according to legend they jump from one snow peak to another. Most of the buildings are closed now; have become storehouses or used as offices for those who take care of the maintenance works. Some additional buildings seen now are souvenir kiosks catering to the visitors. Restoration and preservation Norbulingka, August, 1993 During the Cultural Revolution, the Norbulingka complex suffered extensive damage.Chinese,p. 93 However, in 2001, the Central Committee of the Chinese Government in its 4th Tibet Session resolved to restore the complex to its original glory. Grant funds to the extent of 67.4 million Yuan (US$8.14 million) were sanctioned in 2002 by the Central Government for restoration work; restoration work beginning in 2003 mainly covered the Kelsang Phodron Palace, the Kashak Cabinet offices and many other structures.Chinese,p. 93 Norbulingka was declared a \\"National Important Cultural Relic Unit‚Äù, in 1988 by the State council. On 14 December 2001, UNESCO inscribed it as a World Heritage Site as part of the \\"Historic Ensemble of the Potala Palace\\". The historic ensemble covers three monuments namely, the Potala Palace, winter palace of the Dalai Lama, the Jokhang Temple Monastery and the Norbulingka, the Dalai Lama's former summer palace built in the 18th century considered a masterpiece of Tibetan art. The citation states: \\"preservation of vestiges of the traditional Tibetan architecture\\". This is viewed in the context of extensive modern development that has taken place under Chinese suzerainty in Tibet. The Chinese State Tourism Administration has also categorized Norbulingka at a ‚ÄúGrade 4 A at the National Tourism (spot) level,‚Äù in 2001. It was also declared a public park in 1959. Festivals Dancing at Sho Dun Festival, Norbulingka, 1993 Sho Dun Festival, also spelt Shoton Festival, (popularly known as the \\"yogurt festival\\") is an annual festival held at Norbulingka. The date for the festival is set according to the Tibetan calendar, which is a Lunar-based calendar. The festival is celebrated during the seventh month in the first seven days of the Full Moon period, which corresponds to dates in July/August according to the Gregorian calendar. The week-long festivities are marked by eating and drinking, with Ache Lhamo, the Tibetan opera performances as the highlight, held in the park and other venues in the city. On this occasion yak races are a special attraction held in the Lhasa stadium. During this festival, famed Opera troupes from different regions of Tibet perform at the Norbulingka grounds; the first opera troupe was founded in the 15th century by Tangtong Gyelpo, considered the Leonardo da Vinci of Tibet. Over the centuries other opera formats of the 'White Masked Sect' and the \\"innovative\\" 'Black Masked Sect' added to the repertoire, and all these forms and subsequent innovations are enacted at the Sho Dun festival. The Chinese observe the holidays of the Chinese calendar at the Norbulingka grounds with Tibetan music and dance under Government patronage. Tibetans also observe traditional holidays with Tibetan music and dance at this venue. During the reign of the Dalai Lamas (from the 7th Dalai Lama onwards), their annual shifting of residence from the Potala Palace to Norbulingka Palace was also an elaborate festive event. The Dalai Lama used to be escorted in a glittering procession to spend 6 months of the summer season in the Norbulingka Palace.

Overview Like Fort's previous works, this book deals largely with a number of anomalous phenomena, as well as his ongoing attack on current scientific theories. The book deals for the most part with trying to fit the various phenomena described into Fort's new theory of psychic and mental power ‚Äì the \\"Wild Talents\\" of the title ‚Äì that are detailed below. As did his previous book, Lo!, Wild Talents deals with a wide range of phenomena. Fort's writing style and tongue-in-cheek sense of self-deprecating humor is prominent, particularly in the section on his own purported psychic experiences, and the book is shorter than his previous works. The \\"Wild Talents\\" thesis In recounting a wide variety of odd phenomena, Fort largely disregards his previous teleportation theory, or at least incorporates him into his new thesis. Rather than a vague \\"Cosmic joker\\", as he postulated in his earlier books, the responsibility for these occurrences are freak powers that occur in the human mind, that cannot be naturally developed, but are there, Fort feels, as a sort of throwback to primeval times. Fort discusses many topics he had touched on before, though generally in more detail than in his other works ‚Äì poltergeists, spontaneous human combustion, animal mutilations, vampires, and ghosts ‚Äì along with many supposed cases of psychokinesis and ability to control one's surroundings. His thesis is that in primeval times, man needed such extraordinary powers in order to survive in the wilderness, and that all people can potentially develop these powers if they literally put their mind to it. He also explores alleged cases of witchcraft and murder by mental suggestion, compiling an impressive list of \\"occult criminology\\" (people apparently being murdered under peculiar or unexplainable circumstances) in support. He also attacks the general sense of taboo which he feels prevents wild talents from being accepted, and suggests that such \\"talents\\" would become acceptable if science would deem them as such. Fort also plays around with the idea that humans are able to transform into animals at will, citing a number of cases of werewolves and other similar creatures such as gorillas and hyenas. He also casually (and quite humorously) dismisses, in one chapter, reports of a talking dog that \\"disappeared in a thin, greenish vapor\\", because, in his view, it is an extraordinary event, and he only deals with quite ordinary ones. Fort also briefly mentions a purported psychic occurrence that happened to him and his family where he imagined a picture frame in his house falling from the wall and it then happened. He regards this with his usual tongue-in-cheek manner, and it is doubtful (as usual) that he seriously believes what he is saying.

Harney (Commander of the U.S. Army's Western Department) and Missouri State Guard commander Sterling Price at the beginning of the American Civil War. The truce sought to forestall the outbreak of violence in the state of Missouri following the Camp Jackson Affair, in which Union army troops under the command of Captain Nathaniel Lyon had captured Missouri State Militia mustered on the outskirts of St. Louis. While Lyon marched the captured militia to the St. Louis Arsenal through a crowd, a civilian riot ensued. The soldiers fired into the crowd and killed several people. In the aftermath of the riot, the Missouri State Legislature enacted the governor's \\"Military Bill\\" replacing the Missouri State Militia with a new Missouri State Guard. The governor appointed Sterling Price major general and commander of the State Guard. General Harney had been away from St. Louis during the Camp Jackson affair. Upon his return, he met with Price to sign a joint statement \\"for the purpose of removing misapprehensions and allaying public excitement,\\" its object being \\"that of restoring peace and good order to the people of the State in subordination to the laws of the General and State Governments.\\" The Price‚ÄìHarney Truce made federal forces responsible for order in the St. Louis area, and state forces responsible for order in the rest of the state. Under the terms of the truce, as understood by Harney, the agreement obligated the Missouri State Guard to protect Unionist Missourians from harassment and to hold the state for the Union. Harney also informed Price that several clauses in Missouri's recently enacted \\"Military Bill\\" would have to be modified to remove potential conflicts with the federal government's legal authority. The truce drew the immediate ire of a wide variety of Missouri Unionists (including the politically powerful Congressman Frank Blair), who lobbied President Lincoln and the War Department to have Harney relieved of command. In the face of reports of abuses against Missouri Unionists, and continued negotiations between Governor Jackson and the Confederate Government, Lincoln approved Harney's replacement as commander of the Western District by newly promoted Brigadier General Nathaniel Lyon. The change of command took place on May 30. Whereas Harney was recognized as a legalistic and cautious Unionist, Lyon was an outspoken Abolitionist, with a long-standing relationship with several militant Missouri Unionist organizations. Lyon's elevation effectively ended the truce with Price. On June 11 Missouri Governor Claiborne Fox Jackson held a last-ditch meeting at the Planter's House Hotel in St. Louis to delay open conflict in the State. Jackson was an open Confederate sympathizer and Price had been a conditional Unionist until the Camp Jackson Affair. During the meeting, Lyon angrily refused Price's requests to limit federal forces to the metropolitan St. Louis area, and to disband \\"Home Guard\\" companies established by Missouri Unionists. Lyon refused to accept any limitations on his military actions in the state, and eventually halted the meeting, informing Governor Jackson and MG Price that such limitations on federal authority \\"means war\\". Price and Jackson returned to the State Capitol at Jefferson City, and worked to concentrate State Guard forces in anticipation of open warfare with Unionist forces. Three days later Lyon landed troops at the state capital from steamboats and occupied the city without a shot fired. Lyon's mixed force of volunteers and Regulars subsequently routed the State Guard at the June 17, 1861 Battle of Boonville which gave Unionist forces control of Jefferson City, the Missouri River line and the strategic North Missouri Railroad. In the absence of Governor Jackson, who had fled to the southern part of the state with the Guardsmen, the State Constitutional Convention called itself into session, declared the office of governor vacant, and appointed Hamilton Gamble, former state chief justice, as governor of the Provisional Government of Missouri. Gamble served from 1861 to 1864, when he died in office.

Known as the \\"Gateway to the Isles\\", Oban is Cal Mac's busiest ferry terminal,  History  Oban station in 1948 Oban station opened on 1 July 1880. A ticket platform (long since disused but still in situ) was located on the west side of the single line, about to the south. Just south of there, a short branch line diverged to the east, towards a goods yard and engine shed. Two additional platforms were constructed on the west side of the station in 1904, following the opening of the branch from to . Following closure of the goods yard and engine shed, a rail-connected oil storage depot occupied part of the site for a number of years, although this has itself since closed. Since 1982, only the 1904-built platforms remain in use (still numbered as Platforms 3 and 4). The present small station building was officially opened on 3 January 1986, the occasion being marked by the naming of two Class 37 locomotives. Despite it being a listed building, the original station building was subsequently demolished.  Signalling  Since its opening on 1 July 1880, the single line between and Oban was worked by the electric token system, this being the first ever application of that system in everyday service. Oban originally had two signal boxes, namely Oban Station signal box (the larger of the two), and Oban Goods Junction signal box. The latter was situated about further south, where the line to the goods yard and engine shed diverged from the single line. The original signal boxes contained 21 and 5 levers, respectively. The single line between the two boxes was doubled in 1881. In connection with the station's enlargement, Oban Station Signal Box was replaced (on the opposite side of the line and slightly nearer the station) in 1904. The new box contained a frame of 64 levers, subsequently shortened to 48. Oban Goods Junction S.B. was replaced in 1929. Oban Goods Junction S.B. closed on 4 May 1969. Oban Station S.B. closed on 5 December 1982, when a 'no signalman' system of electric token working was introduced on the section from signal box. The last remaining semaphore signals were removed at that time, including the signal gantry. The Radio Electronic Token Block system was introduced in 1988 and the Train Protection & Warning System was installed in 2003.

The Virgin of Paris is a new style that is different from the classical contrapposto and is sometimes called one of the most decorative statues in all of Catholicism. It is in honour of the Blessed Virgin, mother of Jesus.Kleiner, Fred S. Gardner‚Äôs Art Through the Ages 13th Edition Volume 1. Boston: Thomson Wadsworth, 2009. Print. It retains an emotional appeal that links it to the Strasbourg Death of the Virgin. Details In this sculpture, Mary is shown standing, holding her son, Jesus Christ, against her body. Unlike previous renditions of this couple, both are naturalistic, with recognizable facial features. As usual in most religious sculptural depictions of the Holy mother and child of this time, Jesus does not look like a baby, but rather a miniature adult. However, the artist tried to combat this by giving the child the mannerisms of an infant as he plays with his mother‚Äôs veil and holds a ball. Mary stands in royal dress and a crown, depicting her as royalty. The ball her son holds is also an allusion to their royalty and holiness. The ball or orb in Christ‚Äôs hands is a reference to Christ as Salvator Mundi, or Saviour of the World. The orb symbolizes Earth, and how Christ is king of the entire world.\\"The End of Europe‚Äôs Middle Ages.‚Äù The Applied History Research Group. University of Calgary, 1998. Web. 3 March 2012.. Another view Style One of the main characteristics of Gothic sculpture was elegance. However, other changes occurred to sculpture, such as less enjambment into the background architecture, the contrasting of light and dark, and the Praxitlian ‚ÄòS‚Äô curve. Gothic style moved away from the Romanesque style by simplification. The greatest change though was in sculptures separation from the architectural. Instead of having figures be created against walls or columns, sculptures were carved away from their supports. Also apparent in the piece is the contrast of shadow and light, made evident by the deep recesses in the clothes fabric. The sculptor of Mary exaggerated the S-curve of her body, a signature element of Gothic style. However, the S-curve did not originate during the Gothic Period of Europe, but well before in Greece. In the 4th century BCE, Greek sculptors were enthralled by the body‚Äôs movements and muscles, and tried to capture complete naturalism through the S- curve. For Gothic sculptors, the desired effect was not of body movement, but of elegance and elongation.‚ÄúGothic Art & Architecture.‚Äù KATY School. Web. 3 March 2012. .

Services are operated by Abellio ScotRail.  History  This station opened on 1 August 1873 as a terminal station. This was the first railway station in the village of Tyndrum. Until 1877, it was the western extremity of the Callander and Oban Railway. Train stopping at Tyndrum Lower with a service from Glasgow Queen Street to Oban (1986) In 1877, the Callander and Oban Railway was extended from Tyndrum to Dalmally. Concurrently, the station was relocated west, onto the new through alignment. The new station was on a higher level, as the line had to climb steeply to reach the summit about to the west. The old terminus then became the goods yard. The through station was originally laid out with two platforms, one on either side of a passing loop. In 1894, the West Highland Railway opened a second station in Tyndrum, north of the village. In 1953, the suffixes \\"Upper\\" and \\"Lower\\" were added to the station names. Services to Callander & over the old C&O; route via Strathyre ceased on 27 September 1965 - they had been scheduled for withdrawal as a result of the Beeching Axe from 1 November that year, but ended five weeks prior to that date following a landslide in Glen Ogle that blocked the trackbed.\\"Callander and Oban Railway\\" Speller,J Spellerweb.net; Retrieved 26 August 2016 All services henceforth used the 1897 connection to the WHR at Crianlarich Upper to reach Glasgow.

A native of Cura√ßao, he played from to in MLB, Nippon Professional Baseball, and the Korea Baseball Organization. He was the first Cura√ßaoan to play in both MLB and the Dominican Professional Baseball League. Hitting home runs left-handed while playing softball as a teenager earned Meulens the nickname \\"Bam Bam\\" when his friends compared his power to the Flintstones cartoon character. Over the course of his career, Meulens would become the first to play for all four of the major Caribbean winter leagues. Playing career =Early career (1985‚Äì1993)= Hensley Meulens was signed by the Yankees as an undrafted free agent in 1985. After struggling in his first professional season in 1986 with the Gulf Coast Yankees, Meulens made a splash in 1987 with Single-A Prince William, hitting .300 with 28 HR and 103 RBI, also being named to the Carolina League All-Star team. His hitting cooled somewhat in 1988 and 1989 as he split time between the Double-A Albany-Colonie Yankees of the Eastern League and the Triple-A Columbus Clippers of the International League. His bat rebounded in 1990 for Columbus as he helped lead the team to the 1990 International League championships (where they ultimately lost to Rochester), hitting .285 with 26 HR and 96 RBI, and was named the 1990 International League MVP. Meulens' impressive 1990 season earned him a spot on the Yankees roster in 1991, but he was back in Columbus in 1992 to help lead the Clippers to the Governors' Cup Championship. =New York Yankees (1989‚Äì1993)= Meulens made his major league debut with the New York Yankees on August 23, 1989. Meulens never attained a permanent spot on the New York lineup, despite spending the entire 1991 season on the Yankees roster. Averaging a strike-out every three at bats, Meulens platooned in left field with Mel Hall. He saw limited action with the Yankees in late-season call-ups in 1992 and 1993. =Japan (1994‚Äì1996)= In November 1993, the Yankees sold Meulens' contract to the Chiba Lotte Marines of Nippon Professional Baseball, where he spent the 1994 season, hitting 23 home runs and driving in 69 runs while accumulating 135 strikeouts. The following season, Meulens signed with the Yakult Swallows, helping lead the Swallows to the 1995 Japan Series championship. =Back to America (1997‚Äì2002)= He returned to North America in 1997, and after an unsuccessful tryout with the Atlanta Braves, he reached the Majors again briefly playing with the Montreal Expos (while having a good season for the Expos' AAA affiliate Ottawa Lynx) and Arizona Diamondbacks. Unable to secure a contract with a major league team in 1999, Meulens signed with the Newark Bears of the independent Atlantic League. He made one last stop in Asia, playing 14 games with the SK Wyverns of the Korea Baseball Organization and batting only .196, before heading his professional playing career to the Mexican League with the Saraperos de Saltillo in 2001 and finally retiring, in 2002, after a mid-season injury while playing with the Pericos de Puebla. =International competition= Meulens represented the Netherlands at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia. His 4th-inning double gave the Cuban team their first Olympic loss in 21 games. Ultimately, the Netherlands took fifth place in the final standings. He returned to the team as a coach for the 2004 Summer Olympics and the 2009 World Baseball Classic. Meulens was named to serve as manager for the team during the 2013 World Baseball Classic.

They usually occur in pairs or tetrads, and divide along two planes of symmetry, as do the other lactic acid cocci genera Aerococcus and Tetragenococcus. They are purely homofermentative. Pediococcus dextrinicus has recently been reassigned to the genus Lactobacillus. Food processing Pediococcus is, along with other lactic acid bacteria such as Leuconostoc and Lactobacillus, responsible for the fermentation of cabbage, making it sauerkraut. In this process, the sugars in fresh cabbage are fermented to lactic acid, which gives sauerkraut a sour flavour and good keeping qualities. Pediococcus bacteria are usually considered contaminants of beer and wine, although their presence is sometimes desired in beer styles such as lambic and Berliner Weisse. Certain Pediococcus isolates produce diacetyl which gives a buttery or butterscotch aroma to some wines (such as Chardonnay) and a few styles of beer. Pediococcus species are often used in silage inoculants. Pediococci are used as probiotics, and are commonly added as beneficial microbes in the creation of sausages, cheeses and yogurts.

Williton station is on the West Somerset Railway line. Doniford Halt on the same line serves the nearby Haven Holiday centre. Williton is twinned with Neung-sur-Beuvron in the Loir-et-Cher d√©partement of France.Williton and District Twinning Association History Until 1902 Williton was part of the ancient parish of Saint Decuman, which included also the town of Watchet. The parish of St Decuman was part of the Williton and Freemanners Hundred. Within Williton parish, to the south-west, is Orchard Wyndham House, a Grade I listed building, which was the centre of an estate called \\"Orchard\\". Paleolithic, mesolithic and neolithic flints have been found at Doniford to the north-east of Williton while three Bronze Age barrows survive at Battlegore Burial Chamber, just north of the centre of Williton. The name of Williton is Anglo- Saxon and means \\"estate on the Willet\\" (river); the Willet is a brook that rises at Willet, flows north through the hamlet of Stream, and close to the former manor house of Williton, then it joins the Doniford Brook north-east of Williton. Both watercourses seem to have been known as the Willet in the 12th century. \\"Willet\\" may well be a British name. In the time of Edward the Elder the manor at Wiilitun was a royal hunting estate; its only pre-Conquest mention is in Edward's charter to the priory at Taunton, in which the prior and monks are enjoined to provide board and lodging for a single night, when the king was progressing, with dogs and falcons and their keepers, \\"ad Curig vel Willittun\\", \\"to Curry or else Williton\\".CS 612. William Henry Parr Greswell, 1905. Forests & Deer Parks of the County of Somerset p. 36; H. P. R. Finberg, ed. 1981. The Agrarian History of England and Wales Volume 1:ii, p. 456. In the Domesday Survey Williton continued to form a royal estate, with Carhampton and Cannington. In the Middle Ages the village was divided into the manors of Williton Fulford and Williton Hadley. An estate known as Williton Templar belonged to the Knights Templar, and was later known as Williton Hospital and Williton Regis. Originally the centre of the village appears to have been near the church but over time it has migrated to the north-east. Much of the centre of Williton dates from the later 19th century but Long Street includes several 17th-century houses, as do Bridge, Priest, Robert and Shutgate Streets. Agriculture has been the prime activity in the parish while Williton village became a local government and communal centre. Its importance increased with the creation of new toll roads that today are the main roads to the village. It is an important local shopping area and from 1894 has been an administration centre. It had a workhouse for the district, which became the local hospital until 1990 but has now been converted into housing. Doniford House has late medieval origins and was enlarged circa 1600. Beside the beach is an early 19th-century lime kiln which is thought to have been in operation until the 1930s. Before World War II at a site between Watchet and Doniford a gunnery range was established for various army units to practice anti-aircraft gunnery. Unmanned target aircraft were towed by planes from RAF Weston Zoyland and later were fired from catapults over the sea. Little of the camp buildings survive and it is now the site of a holiday park. Geology Doniford bay has Jurassic fossils in the cliffs. Charmouth fossils collects a number of their fossils from Doniford. The largest Ichthyosaurus fossil discovered was found in Doniford Bay and taken to a museum in Hanover. When it was examined in 2017 it was revealed as the largest specimen described. Governance West Somerset Council offices in the village The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council‚Äôs operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council. The village falls within the non-metropolitan district of Somerset West and Taunton, which was established on 1 April 2019. It was previously in the district of West Somerset, which was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, and part of Williton Rural District before that. The district council is responsible for local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection and recycling, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. Williton is an electoral ward of the district. Somerset County Council is responsible for running the largest and most expensive local services such as education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, policing and fire services, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning. It is also part of the Bridgwater and West Somerset county constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election. The Bakelite Museum Tourism Williton is a good centre for visiting the Quantock Hills, the Brendons and Exmoor as well as the coast at Minehead, Dunster, Blue Anchor and Watchet, which are on the West Somerset Coast Path. Accommodation may be obtained in the village. There are facilities nearby for camping, sailing and wind-surfing as well as the usual beach activities. On the nearby cliffs fossils are exposed. There is easy access to the West Somerset Railway, which is the longest private railway in the country, and is run by a trust. Places of interest are the Bakelite Museum and the Tropiquaria Zoo at the old radio station. Halsway Folk Music Centre is not far away. The village lies on the route of the Macmillan Way West and Celtic Way Exmoor Option. Facilities =Emergency Services= Williton fire station There is a police station in Priest Street and both a hospital and fire station off North Street. =Medical= The Medical Centre at the end of Killick Way has a doctors surgery and pharmacy. Williton Hospital, off North Street, is a part of the Somerset Coast Primary Care Trust but does not have a casualty department. The nearest dentists are in Williton or Minehead. =Educational= The West Somerset area uses a three-tier education system. St Peters Church of England First School was opened on its present site in Doniford Road in 1996. It has five classes of mixed ability. There is a fairly large middle school ‚Äî Danesfield Church of England ‚Äî which caters for children between 9 and 13. Older students generally travel to the West Somerset College in Minehead. Danesfield is also the centre for community education classes. There is a Somerset County library in Killick Way (closed Tuesdays). =Religious= St Peter's Church The date of the origin of St Peter's Church in Bridge Street is uncertain but it is believed that God has been worshiped on the site for more than 1000 years. The names of the Priests serving the Church and the parish can be traced back go the 13th century. The status of the Church changed dramatically in 1170 when The Lord of the manor, Sir Reginald Fitzurse, became one of the murderers of St Thomas a Becket. Following the murder the ownership of the manor passed to Reginald's brother Robert and the Knights Templar. The historian Collinson records (1792) that Robert rebuilt the chapel of Williton implying that the Saxon chapel was in ruins. The Liber Albus manuscripts in Wells Cathedral library show Robert gave to the Church of St Decuman, Watchet some important property and certain rights in the chapel. The church at Williton thus became very much a daughter Church of Watchet and became known as a Chapel of Ease. The current building is mostly from the 16th century and is now a Grade II* listed building. Further work was undertaken in the 17th century when the Church was known as All Saints. Further work was done from time to time and in 1810 a south extension was built though the Elizabethan windows were relocated and reused in the south wall. The church fell into a state if disrepair and in 1856 suffered a rather over enthusiastic restoration under the architect Charles Edmund Giles. The Priest responsible for the big restoration of 1856/59, Samuel Heathcote (at the Church 1854 to 1906), was appointed Perpetual Curate but was signing the registers as Vicar from 21 November 1889 showing that Williton had become a parish separate from Watchet. The full details of the Church are recorded in Harry Armstrong's book The Parish of St Peter Williton published privately in 1982 and printed by Langley Print of Taunton. Williton also has a Methodist Chapel. =Social= There is a recreation ground with a children's area. A new community hall (Williton Pavilion) has now been built after many years of fund raising and a National Lottery grant. The project was opposed by a small part of the local community, which is mostly people who live nearby and do not want the younger members of the community having more activities. There are many social activities within Williton including the social club which needs updating, bowling club, gardening club, rifle club, Women's Institute, Good Neighbours Club, British Legion and Young Farmers. The Scout Association and Girlguiding UK meet regularly. There is a weekly Country Market every Friday. A supermarket was proposed by a local businessman but there is large opposition. There is also a riding school located on Roughmore industrial estate open to anyone who wants to learn the equestrian arts. There are various Martial arts clubs including Judo, Ju-Jitsu, and Karate. =Transport= Williton Station Buses run to Taunton and Minehead for which timetables are available from the post office. There are also buses to nearby supermarkets. Williton railway station is on the preserved West Somerset Railway, which operates on most days through the year. There is a voluntary car service called WHEELs for those without transport for shopping, visits to the doctor etc. Demographics In the 2001 census Williton parish had 1,163 male and 1,411 female residents living in 1,103 households, with 27% being over 65 years. Of all residents, 62% described their health as good. Redevelopment There is a master plan for redevelopment of the centre of Williton. The West Somerset Council is due to centralise its offices on Williton and the plans for this include retail, residential and community facilities. Publications Williton has a regular monthly newsletter, delivered free to all homes in the village, called the Williton Window. The slogan is 'Your church and community magazine'. An information pack is available to newcomers through Williton Window. A book showing Williton as it used to be is The Book of Williton. An information leaflet on West Somerset organisations is available from the West Somerset Free Press. Further reading Chidgey, Joyce; Chidgey, Maurice. (2007).

It is on the Fort William route of the highly scenic West Highland Line. Services are operated by Abellio ScotRail. In 2005/06 it was the least used station on the West Highland Line, probably because of its position up a hill above the village, as opposed to on the Oban branch, which also offers services to and from Crianlarich and destinations to the south (usually at about the same time, as the trains tend to connect at Crianlarich).  History  Originally named \\"Tyndrum\\", this station opened concurrently with the West Highland Railway in 1894, as the second station in the village. In 1956, British Rail added the suffix \\"Upper\\" to the station's name, to distinguish it from the station on the Callander and Oban Line which then became known as . The station name was altered to \\"Upper Tyndrum\\" upon the introduction of RETB (see below), to reduce the risk of it being confused with \\"Tyndrum Lower\\" in radio communications. Services = 2011 services= Monday to Saturday, northbound, Upper Tyndrum has three services to Mallaig and one service to Fort William (Highland Caledonian Sleeper). Southbound, there are three services to Glasgow Queen Street and one service to London Euston (Highland Caledonian Sleeper, Saturdays excepted). On Sundays, there is just one service northbound to Mallaig and two services southbound to Glasgow Queen Street and London Euston. = 2019 services= Monday to Saturday, northbound, Upper Tyndrum has three services to Mallaig and one service to Fort William. Southbound, there are three services to Glasgow Queen Street and one service to London Euston (Saturdays excepted). On Sundays, there are two services northbound to Mallaig, two services southbound to Glasgow Queen Street, and one service to London Euston. The Highland Sleeper also calls at Glasgow Queen Street Low Level to set down only on each evening that it operates, so passengers can use this train to reach Glasgow (and Edinburgh).  Signalling  The signal box, which had 15 levers, was situated on the island platform. From its opening in 1894, the West Highland Railway was worked throughout by the electric token system. In 1967, the method of working between and was changed to the Scottish Region Tokenless Block system. The Down loop at Tyndrum Upper was signalled for running in either direction and the signal box was able to 'switch out' when not required. In August 1985, the method of working between Crianlarich and Rannoch reverted to the electric token block system. The semaphore signals were removed on 22 December 1985 in preparation for the introduction of Radio Electronic Token Block (RETB). The RETB system was commissioned by British Rail between and Upper Tyndrum on 27 March 1988. On 29 May of the same year, the RETB spread north to Fort William Junction, resulting in the closure of Upper Tyndrum signal box (amongst others). The RETB is controlled from a purpose-built Signalling Centre at Banavie railway station. Upper Tyndrum station is the boundary between the two signalling interlockings and the areas of control of the two signalmen. The Train Protection & Warning System was installed in 2003.

The magazine also features statistics for each covered league and interviews with players and staff members. Sharing production facilities with its parent publication at Gannett's corporate headquarters in McLean, Virginia, Sports Weekly is printed on newsprint and distributed throughout the United States and Canada. The magazine is regularly published on Wednesdays, though special editions that preview major events (such as the World Series and the Super Bowl) or cover fantasy sports are released several times per year, typically on newsprint of better quality than that used in the weekly editions. Background The magazine was first published by the Gannett Company as USA Today Baseball Weekly, formatted as a tabloid-sized publication focusing exclusively on baseball coverage that launched on April 5, 1991, in concert with the first week of regular season play for that year's Major League Baseball season. For its first ten years of publication, it was released on a weekly basis during the baseball season and bi-weekly during the off-season. The publication was renamed USA Today Sports Weekly on September 4, 2002, preceding the official start of the 2002 National Football League season, when it began to incorporate stories and statistics about the NFL. The editorial operations of Sports Weekly originally operated autonomously from those managed by the sports department of USA Today, before being integrated with its parent newspaper's sports unit in late 2005. Sports Weekly added coverage and interviews from the NASCAR circuit beginning with the February 15, 2006 issue. However this lasted only for the auto racing organization's 2006 racing season, with Gannett announcing it was dropping weekly coverage of NASCAR from Sports Weekly after one season after the November 22, 2006 issue of the publication; although it would continue to issue three special editions dedicated to NASCAR on an annual basis. For the 2007 professional and collegiate baseball season, USA Today Sports Weekly announced that it would incorporate more comprehensive baseball coverage, along with the return of college baseball features; beginning with the August 8 issue that year, the magazine also added weekly coverage of the NCAA college football season.

Plot The story takes place in Torrance, California, sometime in the late 1970s. A pugilistic ex-convict known as \\"Crump's Brother\\" is picked up by a local teen while hitchhiking on the freeway and informs him about two women he intends to party with in Torrance Beach, across from the Frankie Avalon house. The teen then informs his friends about the situation, but no one wishes to anger Crump's Brother by worming his chicks. Except for Tack who doesn‚Äôt care and goes to find the chicks. Joe and Hubbs, 2 long- haired stoners, drive around town and look for chicks on a Saturday night, all they have in their inventory is a half bottle of peppermint schnapps and a half joint of skank weed, but Hubbs is confident it will be enough. as they drive around town in their 1973 Volkswagen Type 3 Squareback, \\"The Blue Torpedo,\\" looking for drugs and women. They come across Tack, who informs them of the girls and makes a deal to shown them where the girls are for a ride there with them. They stop at the gas station and talk to their friend Crump, the gas station attendant, who also tells them of the girls and says there are only 2 of them and that they‚Äôre his brother‚Äôs chicks. Joe and Hubbs lie to Crump that there is another party going so they can distract him and his brother from the chicks so they can get there first. They leave Tack at the gas station because the girls are not Tack‚Äôs chicks and head for Torrance Beach to the chicks . They arrive at the house and find an extremely attractive girl named Lanie who sends them off to a liquor store for alcohol. When they return, they find the homeowner's daughter Jill, a jaded hippie girl who is Lanie's friend. In the meantime, Tack conscripts his nerdy friend Norm \\"Snot-rag\\" Hankey to take him to the beach. They arrive at the house and after a brief scuffle, Tack entices cooperation with news of a party in Palos Verdes, much to Joe and Hubbs' chagrin. At the house party, Muldoon, the party host, lets the girls in but shuts everyone else out. Lanie leaves following an altercation with Muldoon and drafts Joe to take her swimming in a neighbor's pool. The police shut down the party, and Hubbs and Jill locate Joe and Lanie next door. Lanie is smitten with Hubbs' aggressive nature, much to Joe's chagrin, and the two walk upstairs for sex. Having lost their beer to the police, Tack and the others raid a liquor warehouse for beer, and head for the house. Joe and Jill partially reconcile but return to find Tack and the Guzzlers converging on the home. A fight breaks out between Joe and Tack and Jill runs inside, eventually letting Joe back in and locking the door. After getting stoned, Hubbs tells Joe he has arranged for Lanie to give him fellatio as a \\"birthday present\\". Joe finds that Lanie asleep, covers her up, and walks out; he finds Hubbs with Jill making out on the couch; Joe is upset but learns that Jill was the instigator. They are interrupted when Crump's Brother arrives outside and begins to break down the door. They flee to the kitchen but shortly afterwards, they hear the commotion dying out; Jill's father, Warren, has returned from a college reunion and beaten the entire crowd of kids‚Äîincluding Crump's Brother‚Äîto unconsciousness with great ease. While Hubbs manages to escape by jumping through a window on the upper floor, Warren retains Joe and holds him hostage awaiting the arrival of the police. It also appears that Warren is very overbearing and emotionally abusive towards Jill. Eventually, a condescending lecture provokes a fight where Joe stands up for Jill against Warren and his rather cruel treatment of her, and Joe and Hubbs dramatically escape just ahead of the police. Enamored with Joe, Jill gives him her full name and geographical location (\\"north\\") so he can look her up later. The police arrest the entire crew of drunken teenagers, and Joe and Hubbs escape in the \\"Blue Torpedo\\". Hubbs jocularly chides Joe for his apparent cowardice in moving on Lanie and Jill, and dismisses Jill as a viable partner. Joe, no longer tolerant of Hubb's attitude, wrestles a surprised Hubbs into submission while driving and forces him to capitulate that Jill is \\"cool\\". Joe then places the Blue √ñyster Cult 8-track tape into the deck and plays \\"(Don't Fear) the Reaper\\". The song plays as the Blue Torpedo drives off through the night. Following the credits, Joe and Hubbs are offered Blue √ñyster Cult concert T-shirts outside a convenience store by two men, but Joe refuses because the shirts are bootlegs, and not official. The scalpers are played by actual Blue √ñyster Cult band members Eric Bloom and Donald \\"Buck Dharma\\" Roeser. Production The film is based on a short film, \\"Tack's Chicks\\", directed by James Melkonian at AFI in 1991, co-written by Melkonian and Rich Wilkes. Michael Kopelow also starred as Joe in the short. The feature script was written by Melkonian and Wilkes in 1991 and was shot in February 1993. The producers initially titled the film Tack's Chicks and then Teenage Wasteland, before settling on The Stoned Age. The St√∂ned Age was produced by David Heyman, who went on to produce the Harry Potter film series. The film was originally conceived with Led Zeppelin being Joe's favorite band, including \\"Trampled Underfoot\\" as the main title song, \\"In the Light\\" as the song that would accompany Joe's concert flashback, \\"Heartbreaker\\" and \\"The Lemon Song\\" as the songs that would introduce Lanie, and \\"Tangerine\\" as the \\"pussy\\" song. However, the rights to Led Zeppelin music were not available, and several other bands were considered, including Yes, Jethro Tull, The Who, The Grateful Dead, and Pink Floyd, before Blue √ñyster Cult was decided on. Melkonian acknowledges that there are a number of continuity problems, which are probably due to the low budget. In the kitchen scene, the faces of some crew members can be seen reflected in the front of the microwave oven. Also, there are various instances of things during the movie that didn't exist in the 1970s being clearly visible (or heard, since the Blue Oyster Cult song \\"Burnin' for You\\" wasn't released until 1981). For example, there are many points when the kitchen scene takes place near a busy road, in which cars from the 1980s and 1990s are clearly visible. There is also a point in the movie where a sign for the crafts store Michaels, which didn't exist until 1984, is also clearly visible. The fashion trends of the 1990s are clearly visible in the movie as well: for example, Joe and Hubbs are seen wearing sweatshirts tied around their waists and Joe wearing ripped jeans, which are reminiscent of grunge fashion.

TV Corporation was an American media company best known as the original purchaser of the pre-October 1950 short films and cartoons produced by Paramount Pictures, excluding Popeye and Superman. The initials stand for United Film Service (which once employed Walt Disney and other animators many years earlier), MTA TV (Motion Picture Advertising Service) of New Orleans, and Minot T.V. Operations of the three above-mentioned companies were consolidated into a new company, U.M. & M., in October 1954. The companies were previously producing TV commercials. Matty Fox, head of Motion Pictures for Television, signed a ten-year agreement with U.M. & M. to handle sub- distribution of its TV series.Box Office October 9, 1954 issue U.M. & M. handled the physical distribution of the television series Paris Precinct and Sherlock Holmes, and others. It did not market the shows, leaving the actual syndication to Guild Films.  Deals  In 1955, Paramount Pictures announced it was selling its short films and cartoons, and even a few of its features, including the Max Fleischer animated features Gulliver's Travels and Mr. Bug Goes to Town. Represented by A. W. Schwalberg, a former Paramount sales executive, U.M. & M. won the bid in December 1955, buying 1,600 short subjects for $3.5 million.Box Office, December 3, 1955, page 36. U.M. & M. got most of the material that Paramount put up for sale. The Popeye cartoons (including his first film appearance, the Betty Boop cartoon Popeye the Sailor) were sold in April 1956 to Associated Artists Productions (and in succeeding years to United Artists, MGM/UA Entertainment Co. and Turner Entertainment Co. ‚Äì today Turner is a division of WarnerMedia). The Superman cartoons were not included in the sale, as their rights had already reverted from Paramount to National Comics when the studio's film rights to the character expired; TV rights to those shorts were licensed by National to Flamingo Films, distributors of the Adventures of Superman television series. The material that U.M. & M. obtained from Paramount also included many live action short subjects, such as Cab Calloway and Duke Ellington shorts from the 1930s. Burns and Allen shorts were also included, as well as an early short, Singapore Sue, featuring a young Cary Grant. Other short subjects included in the sale included the following: * Inkwell Imps, The Max Fleischer Ko-Ko the Clown cartoons that were originally distributed by Paramount * Screen Songs, except the last six entries which were sold to Harvey Comics * Talkartoons, Early Paramount sound cartoon series * Betty Boop * Color Classics * Gabby * Stone Age Cartoons * Animated Antics * The Fleischer two-reelers Raggedy Ann and Raggedy Andy and The Raven * Almost all Noveltoons released prior to October 1950, including three early appearances from Casper * Little Lulu cartoons produced by Famous Studios * George Pal Puppetoons * Speaking of Animals shorts produced by Jerry Fairbanks, now owned by Shields Pictures The latest-released cartoon in the package was the Screen Songs cartoon, Boos in the Nite, released September 22, 1950. A total of 513 animated productions (shorts and features) from Fleischer, Famous, and George Pal were included in the package. The package was eyed by NBC for airing nationally, but this deal apparently fell through. Ironically, ABC would air a repackaging of many Paramount cartoons released after September 1950 once these cartoons were sold to Harvey Films.  Retitling and marketing the Paramount shorts  At the insistence of Paramount Pictures, who did not want their company name or mountain logo appearing on television at the time, U.M. & M. replaced the Paramount logo with its (usually) blue shield logo, and removed all references to Paramount Pictures, except for the phrase \\"Adolph Zukor presents\\". It is believed that U.M. & M. and NTA did not figure that TV viewers would link Zukor's name with Paramount Pictures, which Zukor founded. U.M. & M. color prints of Paramount cartoons usually have the opening credits listed in yellow print on a red background. Eventually, U.M. & M. started preserving the original credits, but continued to remove references to Paramount, Technicolor, Cinecolor, and Polacolor since the television prints were done in either Eastmancolor or Deluxe. The Eastmancolor prints generally have faded to red. For the black-and-white cartoons and shorts, U.M. & M. removed the Paramount logos from the original negatives and substituted its opening logo and an end card reading \\"A U.M. & M. TV Corp. Presentation\\" for the Paramount mountain. The Paramount copyright was replaced with the U.M. & M. copyright byline, but prints of Betty Boop cartoons have turned up with original Paramount copyright bylines on the Olive Films releases of Betty Boop. U.M. & M. began marketing the Paramount shorts and cartoons, at the expense of the live-action made-for-television product it was already syndicating. The marketing included a Miss Cartoon girlBroadcasting April 23, 1956, page 22 at their sales table at the NARTB convention in Chicago. Before all of the shorts could be retitled, National Telefilm Associates bought out the U.M. & M. package in May 1956 for $4 million.Box Office, May 19, 1956 page 22 The U.M. & M. copyright notices continued to be present on the NTA prints. The shorts were syndicated under NTA's Panorama of Entertaining Programs, as well as sold for home movie distribution. For this reason, the majority of the color cartoons purchased by U.M. & M. appear with NTA titles, though a select few circulate with U.M. & M. openings and closings. Most Little Lulu cartoons circulate with U.M. & M. openings however. A few feature a revised U.M. & M. logo with the original credits intact, though all references to Paramount and Technicolor are blacked out. These prints contain the only titles where the word \\"Corporation\\" in the U.M. & M. copyright is actually spelled out, and not abbreviated \\"Corp.\\" NTA acquired the Republic Pictures name in 1984, and through several acquisitions was eventually merged into Paramount Pictures, which in turn was owned by Viacom (as it has been since 1994). In early 2006, Viacom split itself into two corporations, one called Viacom (still owning Paramount Pictures), and the other called CBS Corporation. As a result, what would become Melange Pictures, LLC, a division of Viacom, now owns the theatrical distribution on behalf of Paramount Animation ‚Äî all the more ironic since Paramount Pictures originally released the classic shorts in the first place ‚Äî while Trifecta Entertainment & Media (inherited from CBS Television Distribution) owns the television distribution on behalf of Paramount Television Studios to the U.M. & M./NTA/Republic/Melange library, and Olive Films (under license from Paramount Home Entertainment) owns the home video distribution. Viacom and CBS re-merged on December 4, 2019 as ViacomCBS. However, restoration of the original Paramount openings to the black and white cartoons and shorts would be difficult, since U.M. & M. actually altered the original black-and-white negatives, although with today‚Äôs CGI technology it is possible to authentically recreate such titles. The UCLA Film and Television Archive has restored many of the classic Paramount cartoons, complete with their original titles.

He was born at Tours and entered the Society of Jesus in 1639. He taught rhetoric, and wrote extensively both in verse and prose. Works His first production, Eclog√¶ Sacr√¶ (Paris, 1659), won him the title of the Second Theocritus, and his poem on gardens, Hortorum libri IV (Paris, 1665), twice translated into English (London, 1673; Cambridge, 1706), placed him among the foremost Latin versifiers. Of his critical essays, the best known are: Observations sur les po√®mes d'Hom√®re et de Virgile (Paris, 1669); R√©flexions sur l'usage de l'√©loquence de ce temps (Paris, 1672); R√©flexions sur la po√©tique d'Aristote et sur les ouvrages des po√©tes anciens et modernes (Paris, 1674). He is also the author of several theological and ascetic treatises like De nova doctrina dissertatio seu Evangelium Jansenistarum (Paris, 1656); L'esprit du christianisme (Paris, 1672); La perfection du christianisme (Paris, 1673); La foi des derniers si√®cles (Paris, 1679). These books and many other pamphlets were collected in Oeuvres compl√©tes published at Amsterdam, 1709‚Äì10. Rapin's best titles to celebrity are his two posthumous works: Histoire du jansenisme, edited by Domenech (Paris, 1861), and M√©moires sur l'√©glise, la soci√©t√©, la cour, la ville et le jans√©nisme, edited by Aubineau (Paris, 1865). The latter book is the counterpart of the Jansenistic M√©moires de Godefroi Hermant sur l'histoire eccl√©siastique du XVIIe si√®cle, edited by Gazier (Paris, 1905). Ste-Beuve in his own Port Royal tries on every occasion to find Rapin at fault, but more recent studies on Jansenism show that he is, in the main, reliable.

His father was Ernie Johnson Sr., a Major League Baseball pitcher and Atlanta Braves play-by-play announcer. Early career Johnson's career began in 1977 while he was still a student at the University of Georgia, when he took a job as the news and sports director for the radio station WAGQ-FM in Athens, Georgia. He held that job until 1978, when he graduated from Georgia with a B.A. in journalism summa cum laude. In 1979, Johnson began his broadcasting career at WMAZ-TV in Macon, Georgia.

He has hosted the show since 1990. At the end of each broadcast, Ernie presents \\"E.J.'s Neat-O Stat of the Night,\\" which has become a popular part of the show but is sponsored by no one, hence the sign that says \\"Your logo here\\". This changed in May 2007 when vitaminwater stepped in as a sponsor for the segment, replaced by Panasonic's Viera line of televisions for 2008. For the 2005‚Äì2006 season, his segments were sponsored by Intel Centrino and most recently Suzuki. In the 2008 NBA Playoffs, his segments were presented by Geico and vitaminwater.

He attended high school at the private Marist School in nearby Brookhaven, Georgia. On the November 10, 2016 edition of Inside the NBA, Johnson and co-hosts were discussing the 2016 U.S. presidential election and the stunning upset of Donald Trump's victory over Hillary Clinton. While giving his remarks, Johnson talked about the build-up to Election Day, and how he would lean on his Christian faith and pray for the transition of power and for the division in the country. He also revealed that he wrote in his vote for Ohio governor John Kasich, who was one of the 17 Republican candidates and the last to suspend his campaign. In April 2017, he released his memoir, Unscripted: The Unpredictable Moments That Make Life Extraordinary. =Health= In 2003, Johnson was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, but continued his work through June 2006, when he began treatment. Due to his cancer, Johnson missed TNT's coverage of the British Open and PGA Championship, the last two golf major tournaments in 2006.

Spheeris died in 1984, at the age of 34, after a motorcycle accident.  Biography  Jimmie (James) Spheeris was born in Phenix City, Alabama, to Juanita 'Gypsy' and Andrew Spheeris, who owned and operated a traveling carnival called the Majick Empire.Various sources, including personal conversations with Jimmie Spheeris. These childhood years of colorful transience were a major influence on later work, as evidenced in songs such as \\"Lost in the Midway\\" and \\"Decatur Street,\\" among others. Spheeris had two sisters, Penelope and Linda, and a brother, Andy. After his father was murdered by a \\"belligerent carnival-goer,\\"\\"Remembering Jimmie Spheeris,\\" Pat Alston, Santa Monica Evening Outlook, page A-4, August 18, 1986. Gypsy Spheeris moved the family to San Diego, California. The family eventually settled in Venice, California. Gypsy Spheeris tended bar at an establishment on Main Street called The Circle. Spheeris moved to New York City in the late 1960s to pursue his songwriting career.\\"Remembering Jimmie Spheeris,\\" Pat Alston, Santa Monica Evening Outlook, page A-4, August 18, 1986. The liner notes on his debut album credit friend and fellow songwriter Richie Havens,Liner notes in the \\"Thank You\\" section of Isle of View, Columbia Records catalog number C30988 who introduced Spheeris to Columbia Records executive Clive Davis. Davis signed Spheeris to a four album recording contract and his debut album was released on the Columbia label. Spheeris' 1972 debut album, Isle of View, garnered a devoted following and FM radio airplay, most notably for the song \\"I Am the Mercury.\\" His 1973 album, The Original Tap Dancing Kid, was followed by a period of extensive concert touring. Spheeris returned to the recording studio in 1975 with The Dragon is Dancing and released Ports of the Heart in 1976. After Ports of the Heart, Spheeris had no recording contract. Except for a 1980 single, \\"Hold Tight,\\" Spheeris released no new material through a major record label. Spheeris died at the age of 34 in Santa Monica, California, when his motorcycle collided with a van at 2 a.m. on the morning of July 4, 1984. The driver of the van, Bruce Burnside, was charged with driving under the influence of alcohol and felony vehicular manslaughter.\\"Five deaths mar Westside's July Fourth\\", Will Thorne and Rick Cziment, Santa Monica Evening Outlook, page 1, July 5, 1984. Hours before his death, Spheeris finished the self-titled album, Spheeris, which was produced by Paul Delph. This final album was not publicly released for 16 years. Delph would later record two of Spheeris' songs for his final album A God That Can Dance. A song on Spheeris' final album entitled \\"You Must Be Laughing Somewhere\\" is based on the life of his friend, author John Kennedy Toole (whose novel, A Confederacy of Dunces, was posthumously awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1981). In 1998, independent record label Rain Records began re-releasing Spheeris' catalog on CD, but stopped production in 2001 following the cancellation of a music licensing contract with Sony Music Special Products (owner of Spheeris‚Äô catalog).  Style  Jimmie Spheeris, c. 1976 Spheeris primarily composed on the guitar and piano. His musical genre was generally in the folk music and singer-songwriter traditions, although later work explored jazz, rock music, jazz-rock fusion and new wave music. With few exceptions, Spheeris‚Äô guitar compositions employed the use of open tunings, also referred to as alternate tunings. Johnny Pierce (November 30, 1953 ‚Äì December 12, 2005), worked with Spheeris as a recording session and touring artist from 1973 to 1980, and wrote extensive guitar tablature regarding the tunings Spheeris used throughout his career.Johnny Pierce, The Jimmie Spheeris Memorial Gallery, Jimmie Spheeris: Guitar Tablature. Spheeris‚Äô vocal range was primarily baritone and tenor, with occasional falsetto flourishes. His voice is most often described by music critics and fans as \\"soulful,\\" \\"sultry,\\" or \\"smoky.\\"Example: \\"Spheeris Show Sparkles\\", Boo Browning, The Daily Oklahoman, page 18, November 8, 1976.  Musicians  Longtime friend Jackson Browne contributed backing vocals on Spheeris' 1976 album, Ports of the Heart. Recording artist Laura Nyro and Spheeris were also friends, sharing a New York City apartment for a time in the early 1970s.

George Wetherill benefited from the G.I. Bill to receive four degrees, the Ph.B. (1948), S.B. (1949), S.M. (1951), and Ph.D., in physics (1953), all from the University of Chicago. He did his thesis research, on the spontaneous fission of uranium, as well as nuclear processes in nature, as a U.S. Atomic Energy Commission Predoctoral Fellow. Upon receiving his Ph.D., Wetherill became a staff member at Carnegie's Department of Terrestrial Magnetism (DTM) in Washington, D.C. There, he joined an interdepartmental group of Carnegie scientists who were working to date the Earth's rocks by geochemical methods involving natural radioactive decay. This involved determining the concentration and isotopic composition of inert gases such as argon, as well as the isotopes of strontium and lead. He originated the concept of the Concordia Diagram for the uranium-lead isotopic system; this diagram became the standard means for determining precise ages of rocks, and of detecting the possibility of metamorphism, and it forms the basis for all high-precision geochronology in rocks dating back to the early history of the Earth. He was also a member of the Carnegie group that accurately determined the decay constants of potassium and rubidium, an effort that has also become fundamental to the measurement of geological time. Wetherill left DTM in 1960 to become a professor of geophysics and geology at the University of California, Los Angeles. There, he served as chairman of the interdepartmental curriculum in geochemistry (1964-1968), and as chairman of the Department of Planetary and Space Sciences (1968-1972). At UCLA, his interests in age-dating techniques expanded to include extraterrestrial material, as he began applying his radiometric chronology techniques to meteorite and lunar samples. At the same time, he began theoretical explorations into the origin of meteorites. His studies concentrated on collisions between objects in the asteroid belt together with resonances between their motions and those of planets. He computed how these events could move material into Earth-crossing orbits to become meteorites or larger Earth- impacting bodies responsible for the devastating impacts that caused mass extinctions of the majority of living species, including the dinosaurs. Later, he, along with scientists elsewhere, proposed that a certain unusual class of meteorites was not asteroidal in origin but instead came from the planet Mars. This was later confirmed by laboratory work elsewhere and is now well accepted. In 1975, Wetherill returned to Carnegie's Department of Terrestrial Magnetism as director. He remained director until 1991, when he became a staff member. At DTM, he began extending his research efforts into questions concerning the origin of the terrestrial planets--Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. He was stimulated by earlier studies by Victor Safronov (O. Yu. Schmidt Institute, Moscow), who showed that as a swarm of planetesimals coagulated into large bodies the swarm could evolve to produce a few terrestrial planets. Wetherill developed a technique to calculate numerically the orbital evolution and accumulation of planetesimal swarms, and he used the technique to reach specific predictions of the physical and orbital properties of terrestrial planets. His results agreed well with present observations. In addition to showing how the inner solar system formed, Wetherill's work provided the basis for a model of a giant-impact origin for the Moon and the core of Mercury. It also led to explanations for the isotopic abundances of present-day planetary atmospheres. Recently, Wetherill has shown that Jupiter plays an important role in the evolution of the Solar System; by ejecting comets from the solar system, it offers a protective presence to the inner planets. Wetherill's theoretical work supports discussions on the origins of the Solar System as well as on extrasolar planets. Wetherill provided leadership in the scientific community by serving on advisory committees for NASA, the National Academy of Sciences, and the National Science Foundation. For 17 years, he was editor of the Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences. He served as president of the Meteoritical Society, the Geochemical Society, the Planetology Section of the American Geophysical Union and the International Association of Geochemistry and Cosmochemistry. Wetherill died at his home in Washington, D.C Wednesday, July 19, 2006 after a long illness.

It is often considered the first full-length Indian feature film. Raja Harishchandra features Dattatraya Damodar Dabke, Anna Salunke, Bhalchandra Phalke, and Gajanan Vasudev Sane and is based on the legend of Harishchandra, with Dabke portraying the title character. The film, being silent, had English, Marathi, and Hindi-language intertitles. Phalke decided to make a feature film after watching The Life of Christ (1906) at a theatre in Bombay, now known as Mumbai. He went to London for two weeks to learn filmmaking techniques and founded Phalke Films Company. He imported the hardware required for the filmmaking and exhibition from England, France, Germany, and the United States. Phalke shot a short film Ankurachi Wadh (Growth of a Pea Plant) to attract investors for his venture. He published advertisements in various newspapers calling for the cast and crew. As no women were available to play female leads, male actors performed the female roles. Phalke was in charge of scriptment, direction, production design, make- up, film editing, along with film processing. Trymbak B. Telang handled the camera. Phalke completed filming in six months and 27 days producing a film of , about four reels. The film premiered at the Olympia Theatre, Bombay, on 21 April 1913, and had its theatrical release on 3 May 1913 at the Coronation Cinematograph and Variety Hall, Girgaon. It was a commercial success and laid the foundation for the film industry in the country. The film is partially lost; only the first and last reels of the film are preserved at the National Film Archive of India. Some film historians believe these belong to a 1917 remake of the film by Phalke titled Satyavadi Raja Harishchandra. The status of Raja Harishchandra as the first full-length Indian feature film has been debated. Some film historians consider Dadasaheb Torne's silent film Shree Pundalik, released on 18 May 1912, the maiden Indian film. The Government of India, however, recognises Raja Harischandra as the first Indian feature film.  Plot  King Harishchandra (D. D. Dabke) is shown teaching his son, Rohitashva (Bhalchandra Phalke), how to shoot with a bow and arrow in the presence of Queen Taramati (Anna Salunke). His citizens ask him to go on a hunting expedition. While on the hunt, Harishchandra hears the cries of some women. He reaches a place where the sage Vishvamitra (Gajanan Sane) is performing a yajna to get help from Triguna Shakti (three powers) against their will. Harishchandra unwittingly interrupts Vishvamitra in the midst of his yajna by releasing the three powers. To appease Vishvamitra's wrath, Harishchandra offers his kingdom. Returning to the royal palace, he informs Taramati of the happenings. Vishvamitra sends Harishchandra, Taramati, and Rohitashva in exile and asks them to arrange for dakshina. While in exile, Rohitashva dies and Harishchandra sends Taramati to ask the Dom king for arranging a free cremation. While Taramati is on her way to meet the Dom king, Vishvamitra frames her for the murder of the prince of Kashi. Taramati faces trial, pleads guilty and is ordered to be beheaded by Harishchandra. When he raises his sword to complete his task, a pleased Lord Shiva appears. Vishvamitra reveals that he was examining Harishchandra's integrity, returns the crown to him and brings Rohitashva back to life.  Cast  * Dattatraya Damodar Dabke as Harishchandra * Anna Salunke as Taramati, Harishchandra's wife * Bhalchandra Phalke as Rohitashva, son of Harishchandra and Taramati * Gajanan Vasudev Sane as Vishvamitra Other artists in the film were Dattatreya Kshirsagar, Dattatreya Telang, Ganpat G. Shinde, Vishnu Hari Aundhkar, and Nath T. Telang.  Production  = Development = On 14 April 1911, Dadasaheb Phalke with his elder son Bhalchandra went to see a film, Amazing Animals, at the America India Picture Palace, Girgaon. Surprised at seeing animals on the screen, Bhalchandra informed his mother, Saraswatibai, about his experience earlier that day. None of the family members believed them, so Phalke took his family to see the film the next day. As it was Easter, the theatre screened a film about Jesus, The Life of Christ (1906) by the French director Alice Guy-Blach√© instead. While watching Jesus on the screen, Phalke envisioned Hindu deities Rama and Krishna instead and decided to start in the business of \\"moving pictures\\". After completing his two-week trip to London to learn filmmaking techniques, he founded Phalke Films Company on 1 April 1912. During his London trip, Phalke had placed an order for a Williamson camera and Kodak raw films and a perforator which reached Bombay (now Mumbai) in May 1912. He set up a processing room and taught his family to perforate and develop the film. Though Phalke was certain of his idea of filmmaking, he could not find any investors. So, he decided to make a short film to demonstrate the techniques. He planted some peas in a pot, placed a camera in front of it, and shot one frame a day for over a month. This resulted in a film, lasting just over a minute, of the seed growing, sprouting, and changing into a climber. Phalke titled this short film Ankurachi Wadh (Growth of a Pea Plant) and showed it to selected individuals. Some of them, including Yashwantrao Nadkarni and Narayanrao Devhare, offered Phalke a loan. = Story = Painting by Raja Ravi Varma, depicting Harishchandra parting with his wife and son In his Marathi language magazine Suvarnamala, Phalke had published a story Surabaichi Kahani (A Tale of Sura). The story, which depicted the ill effects of alcoholism, was the first he considered for filming. After watching several American films screened in Bombay, he observed they included mystery and romance which the audiences liked. Family members suggested the storyline should appeal to middle-class people and women and should also highlight Indian culture. After considering various stories depicted in Hindu mythology, Phalke's family shortlisted the legends of Krishna, Savitri and Satyavan, and Harishchandra. At the time, a play based on the legends of Harishchandra was popular on Marathi and Urdu stages. Friends and neighbours had often called Phalke \\"Harishchandra\\" for having sold all his belongings, except his wife's mangala sutra, to fulfil his filmmaking dream. So, Phalke decided on the legends of Harishchandra and wrote the script for his feature film. = Casting = Phalke published advertisements in various newspapers like Induprakash calling for the cast and crew required for the film. It was well- received and huge number of applicants came in for the auditions. Despite a growing response to the advertisement, he was not satisfied with the performers' skills. He discontinued the advertisements and decided to scout for the artists through theatre companies. Padurang Gadhadhar Sane and Gajanan Vasudev Sane were among the first artists to join Phalke Films Company. The former was playing female roles in the Natyakala theatre company; the latter was performing in Urdu plays. Both joined for a salary of 40 per month. Gajanan Sane introduced his acquaintance Dattatraya Damodar Dabke. Phalke was impressed with his physique and personality and offered him the lead role of Harishchandra. In response to the advertisement, four prostitutes auditioned for the role of Taramati. Phalke rejected them for not having satisfactory looks and revised the advertisement to read: \\"Only good-looking women should come for interview.\\" Two more prostitutes auditioned but left after two days. A young lady, who was a mistress, auditioned and Phalke selected her for the female lead. She rehearsed for four days. However, on the fifth day, her master objected to her working in the film and took her away. In despair, Phalke also visited Bombay's red-light area on Grant Road in Kamathipura. He was asked either to pay a high salary or to marry the woman. One day, while having tea at a restaurant on Grant Road Phalke noticed Krishna Hari alias Anna Salunke, an effeminate young man with slender features and hands. Salunke was working as a cook or waiter at the restaurant on a monthly salary of . He agreed to work in films when Phalke offered him a raise of five rupees. Phalke auditioned many boys for the role of Rohitashva, son of Harishchandra and Taramati, but none of the parents would allow their children to work in the film as the character would have to live in the forests and was to die. Finally, Phalke's elder son Bhalchandra was assigned the role. He became the first child actor in Indian cinema. = Pre-production = Phalke seated on a chair with a small roll of film in his hands Phalke hired around forty people for his film studio known as a factory in those days. Since working in films was a taboo, Phalke advised his artists to tell others they were working in a factory for a man named Harishchandra. Phalke watched several foreign films to learn about screenplay writing and then completed the script for Raja Harishchandra. The film had an all-male cast as no women were available to play female leads. After coming to the studio, male actors playing female roles were asked to wear saris and do women's chores like sifting rice, and making flour to help Saraswatibai. Though some actors were associated with theatres, most of the cast did not have any prior acting experience. Phalke ran several rehearsals with the actors. Often, he had to wear a sari himself and act out the scene. A number of photographs from English periodicals showing various facial expressions were hung up in the rehearsal studio. All the actors had to go through a mandatory exercise where they were asked to make similar faces. About the same time, the Rajapurkar Natak Mandali drama company visited Bombay. Many of the company's shows were based on Hindu mythology. Phalke met the company's proprietor, Babajirao Rane, and explained his idea of indigenous film production. Rane was impressed by the idea and offered his support by lending his actors and their costumes. Phalke decided to use material like Harishchandra's crown, wig, swords, shields, and bows and arrows in the film. Phalke's brother-in-law owned two drama companies, Belgaokar Natak Mandali and Saraswati Natak Mandali. He offered similar help, but Phalke politely declined as the majority of the cast and crew were finalised. Phalke designed the costumes and stage scenes based on the paintings of Raja Ravi Varma and M. V. Dhurandhar. He painted the scenes for the palace, jungle, mountains, fields and caves himself on curtains. After the sets were erected for the indoor shooting, painter Rangnekar was hired for the monthly salary of 60. Phalke imported the hardware required for the filmmaking and exhibition from England, France, Germany, and the United States from manufacturers including Houghton Butcher, Zeiss Tessar, and Path√©. This included negative and positive film stocks, cameras, lights, Film laboratory equipment, printing and editing machines, negative cutting tools, and film projectors. He decided to take on the responsibility for the scriptment, direction, production design, make-up, Film editing, and film processing. He asked Trymbak B. Telang, his childhood friend from Nashik, to come to Bombay. Telang was working as a priest at the Trimbakeshwar Shiva Temple. Phalke had taught him still photography as a childhood hobby. After his arrival, Phalke trained Telang in the operation of the Williamson camera and made him the film's cinematographer. = Filming = Anna Salunke as Sita in Lanka Dahan (1917) Production design for the film started after the monsoon season of 1912. While the sets were being erected at Phalke's bungalow at Dadar, an outdoor shooting was scheduled at Vangani, a village outside Bombay. Some of the male actors playing female roles, including Anna Salunke who was playing the female lead, were not ready to shave off their moustaches because it is part of one of the Hindu rituals to be performed after the death of one's father. Phalke persuaded the actors and their fathers to have the moustaches shaved and the unit left for Vangani. The unit was lodged at the village temple and continued their rehearsals until Phalke arrived from Bombay. The villagers were frightened to see the troupe of people wearing costumes, wielding swords, shields, and spears while practising the scenes. They informed the Patil (village headman) that dacoits (robbers) had entered the village. He immediately reported to the Faujdar (commander) who visited the temple. The unit explained film-making to them, but the Faujdar did not believe their story and arrested everyone. When Phalke reached the village, he immediately met the Patil and the Faujdar explaining to them again about cinema and filming by showing them the equipment. Without loading film into the camera, he asked his unit to enact one of the film's scenes and went through the motions of filming a scene. After viewing the scene, the Faujdar understood Phalke's new venture and released everyone. While playing with other children, Bhalchandra fell on a rock and his head started bleeding. Phalke treated him with a first aid kit, but he remained unconscious. Various unit members suggested that Bhalchandra should be taken to Bombay for further treatment and once he was completely recovered, shooting could be resumed. The scene that was to be filmed showed Rohitashva, Bhalchandra's character, dead on a funeral pyre. Resuming the outdoor shoot after Bhalchandra's recovery would have delayed the production and incurred costs. To avoid both, Phalke stoically decided to shoot the scene with the unconscious Bhalchandra. As in the legends of Harishchandra, the King along with Taramati and Rohitashva visit Kashi. It was financially challenging for Phalke to go to Kashi and shoot scenes there. So, he took his unit to Trimbakeshwar, where they camped for about a month and filmed the required scenes. Phalke used to develop the film at night for the scenes that were shot throughout the day. He would re- shoot the scenes next day if they were not of the desired quality. Filming was completed in six months and twenty-seven days to produce a film of ; about four reels. Phalke used trick photography to shoot one of the scenes where the god appears and disappears from behind the smoke of sage Vishvamitra's Yajna- kund. The film negative stocks used were of limited spectral sensitivity with low sensitivity to the red band of the spectrum; thus, sets, costumes, and artists' make-up artists avoided the colour red. During the early nineteenth century, plays had an introductory episode, a compere or a person who introduces the performers in a show. Unit members suggested the film should also have similar introductory episode with Phalke and his wife playing the roles of Sutradhar and Nati. Phalke agreed to the idea but could not convince Saraswatibai to act in front of a camera. Finally, Padurang Gadhadhar Sane played the role of Nati.  Release  = Film premiere = Phalke had difficulties arranging a theatre for screening as criticism of his work had already started. He decided to show the film to a select audience and arranged for a premiere at the Olympia Theatre, Bombay on 21 April 1913 at 9:00 pm. The invitees included doctor and public worker Sir Bhalchandra Bhatavdekar, scholar R. G. Bhandarkar, a judge of Small Cause Court Justice Donald, newspaper editors and representatives along with some intellectuals and prominent personalities from Bombay. As Phalke's infant daughter, Mandakini, was ill with pneumonia, his elder brother, Shivrampant, advised him to postpone the premiere to another day. But, as the invitations had already been sent and the theatre was available only on 21 April, Phalke could not change his decision. Bhatavdekar introduced the premiere acknowledging Phalke for his \\"daring\\". Justice Donald noted that the film would help Europeans learn more about Hindu mythology. Anant Narayan Kowlgekar of Kesari in his review mentioned that \\"Phalke has grandly brought his skill to the notice of the world.\\" The Times of India in their review noted the scenes depicted in the film are \\"simply marvellous\\" and \\"[I]t is really a pleasure to see this piece of Indian workmanship\\". With the favourable reviews generated, Nanasaheb Chitre, Manager of the Coronation Cinematograph and Variety Hall, Girgaon, expressed his desire to screen the film. = Theatrical release = The film had its theatrical release on 3 May 1913 at the Coronation Cinematograph and Variety Hall. The show included a dance by Irene Delmar, a comic act by McClements, foot-juggling by Alexandroff, and Tip-Top comic items followed by the film. The show's duration was one-and-half hours with four shows scheduled a day at 6:00 pm, 8:00 pm, 10:00 pm, and 11:45 pm. An advertisement for the film published in The Bombay Chronicle had a note added at the end that the ticket rates would be double the usual rates. The film had a houseful run for a week, and it was extended for twelve more days. A special show was scheduled on 17 May for women and children only at half rates. Initially, 18 May was advertised as the last show, but the film continued its screening due to popular demand. It screened continuously for twenty-three days until 25 May and was screened at the Alexandra Theatre on 28 June. The Bombay Chronicle in its issue of 5 May 1913 mentioned that \\"this wonderful drama is splendidly represented by the company of actors\\" and praised the \\"beauty and ingenuity\\" with which Phalke succeeded in presenting the film scenes. News of the film's success in Bombay spread across India and there were demands to screen the film in various locations. As there were no film distributors in those days, Phalke had to move the film, the projector, an operator, and some assistants from place to place. When the film was screened for a week at the Nawabi Theatre in Surat, Phalke signed a temporary agreement for 50% partnership with the theatre owner. Despite advertising the film, at its first showing the film met with a lukewarm response. Disappointed by the earnings of only 3, the owner asked Phalke either to cancel the show, increase its length, or reduce ticket prices. Phalke politely rejected these suggestions. He issued an advertisement in the Gujarati language calling on people to see \\"57,000 photographs of three-quarters of an inch width and two miles length\\", for just one Indian anna. He also had his actors enact some of the film's scenes at the town's crossroads. The promotion had the desired effect and earnings increased to 300. Later, the film was also screened at Pune, Colombo, London, and Rangoon with Marathi and Hindi-language intertitles.  Legacy  Film historian Firoze Rangoonwalla feels that the film made \\"a wide impression and appealed to a large audience in difference places\\" and its box office success provided \\"the seal of acceptance and laid the foundation of the film industry\\" in the country. Director and cinematographer Govind Nihalani explains that the film was shot partly outdoors in direct sunlight and partly in outdoor studios with sunlight blocked by white muslin producing soft and diffused light. He appreciates the tonal gradation, lighting, and camera movements. He also notes the scene where the god appears and disappears from behind the smoke of sage Vishvamitra's Yajna-kund gives an impression that the scene was filmed in a single shot. Film critic Satish Bahadur points out that though the title cards in the film were in English and Hindi, \\"there was something unmistakably Maharashtrian\\" in the film. He also mentions that the interior architecture and dresses of countries in the film are more of a Deccan Peshwai style than North Indian. Ashish Rajadhyaksha in his The Phalke Era: Conflict of Traditional Form and Modern Technology (1993) mentions that the film's narrative style was borrowed from painting, theatre and traditional arts to attract the audience into cinema. Dilip Rajput of the National Film Archive of India notes that the film's scenes appear to run faster because of the current projector speed of 24-frames-per-second as compared to 16 to 18-frames-per- second speed of the projector that was used for the film. Directed by Paresh Mokashi, the 2009 Marathi film Harishchandrachi Factory (Harishchandra's Factory) depicts the making of Raja Harishchandra. The film won the National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Marathi at the 56th National Film Awards. It was selected as India's official entry to the 82nd Academy Awards in the Best Foreign Language Film category along with the 62nd British Academy Film Awards and the 66th Golden Globe Awards but was not listed among the final five nominations. = Extant prints = The original length of a film was , about four reels. In 1917, the film's last print caught fire due to the constant friction and the exposure to high temperatures while it was being transported from one theatre to another, by a bullock cart. Phalke readily re- shot the film to produce the version that exists today. However, only the first and last reels of the original film are preserved at the National Film Archive of India (NFAI) making it a partially lost film. Some film historians believe they actually belong to a 1917 remake of the film, titled Satyavadi Raja Harishchandra. NFAI duplicated the film but around twenty percent of the left side of the screen was lost in the transfer. It was believed the film's remaining reels were destroyed along with 1,700 nitrate-based films in the fire at the Film and Television Institute of India on 8 January 2002. The prints were later retrieved from the private collection of Phalke's children. The NFAI has restored and digitised the film. = Classification as first full-length Indian film = The status of Raja Harischandra as the first full- length Indian feature film has been argued over. Some film historians consider Dadasaheb Torne's silent film Shree Pundalik as the maiden Indian film. Torne's film was released on 18 May 1912 at the same theatre as Raja Harischandra. An argument has also been made in favour of Raja Harischandra that Shree Pundalik is a cinematographic recording of a play, using a single, fixed camera and it was filmed by a British cameraman with the film stock processed in London. The Government of India recognises Raja Harischandra as the first Indian feature film. In 1969, it introduced the Dadasaheb Phalke Award, the country's highest award in cinema, to commemorate Phalke's contribution to Indian cinema.

His scriptwriting work included BBC radio plays, and television scripts for the BBC and ITV, including Doctor Who, The Slide, Timeslip, Tightrope and The Adventures of Black Beauty. His television production work included the British version of Fraggle Rock (second series onwards), and several independent documentaries including the 1989 International Emmy Award-winning Gwen: A Juliet Remembered, about stage actress Gwen Ffrangcon-Davies. Early life Pemberton grew up in Islington, London, and lived for many years in Essex. In his earlier years, Pemberton had several small screen acting roles. In addition to novelisations, he wrote many nostalgic novels set in London, prompted by the success of his autobiographical radio drama series Our Family. Doctor Who Pemberton first worked on the programme in 1967 as Assistant Script Editor and was promoted to the role of Script Editor during the production of the story \\"The Tomb of the Cybermen\\". Pemberton wrote the 1968 Patrick Troughton story Fury from the Deep (which he subsequently novelised for Target Books). The story, now missing from the BBC archives, was based on an earlier stand-alone radio serial he had written called The Slide, starring future Master actor Roger Delgado. It introduced the Doctor's trademark sonic screwdriver. In 1976, Pemberton wrote the audio drama Doctor Who and the Pescatons for an experiment in Doctor Who on vinyl record and an early spin-off from the programme. The production was aimed at children and is heavily based on ideas Pemberton had used for Fury from the Deep. He later novelised The Pescatons, which was the final Doctor Who book published with the Target logo on the spine. He had previously appeared as an actor in the series, in a non-speaking role as a scientist in the 1967 story The Moonbase. Personal life In later life he lived in Spain, where he continued to write novels. Pemberton was the life partner of the British actor, producer and writer David Spenser. Death Pemberton's death was announced on 13 August 2017. He was 85.

Kowloon Park () is a large public park in Tsim Sha Tsui, Kowloon, Hong Kong. It has an area of and is managed by the Leisure and Cultural Services Department.Leisure and Cultural Services Department: Kowloon Park: Historical Background History The park was formerly the site of the Whitfield Barracks of the British Army, with a former battery (Kowloon West II Battery) in the northwestern part of the Park. The Urban Council redeveloped the site into the Kowloon Park in 1970.Brief Information on proposed Grade I Items . Items No. 43 and No. 44 More than 70 buildings were demolished to make way for the park. The first stage of the park was officially opened on 24 June 1970 by the then Governor of Hong Kong, Sir David Trench. The opening was celebrated by a lion dance as well as a folk dance by students of the Tai Hang Tung Primary School PM Session. Music was provided by the band of the First Battalion, the Royal Welsh Fusiliers. Sir David unveiled a commemorative plaque and declared Kowloon Park open. The first phase comprised 18 acres out of a planned 26 acres. It featured a floral clock as well as a Chinese garden set within an English landscape, which a government spokesman called \\"a reminder of Hongkong's cosmopolitan cultural heritage.\\" However, part of the site was occupied in the construction of an MTR rapid transit line‚Äîoriginally the Kwun Tong Line, now the Tsuen Wan Line‚Äîfrom 1975 to 1978, and this was cited as a reason for the slow progress in developing the remaining three stages of the park for recreational use. The Urban Council also placed some of the blame on the construction of Kowloon Park Drive, which cut through a corner of the park at the insistence of the government. The Government was criticised when the Executive Council approved plans in 1982 for a strip of retail premises fronting Nathan Road to be carved into the hill of Kowloon Park. The move was first proposed when the Barracks were converted into public open space in 1970, and ignited some controversy. It was opposed by the Urban Council, as well as the Muslim community, whose mosque was close by.Michael Chugani, Kowloon Park land sale plan tipped to spark row, South China Morning Post, 10 January 1982 The rights for the development of the 5,410 square metre strip were sold in February 1983 to a subsidiary of New World Development for $218 million.Jim Gilchrist, \\"'Bargain' $218m for park site\\", South China Morning Post, 6 February 1983. The commercial development is called \\"Park Lane Shopper's Boulevard\\". Owing to the grade change, the roofs of the shops are level with the ground of Kowloon Park, and so the gardens extend onto the building rooftops. An aviary was opened in 1980. From 1987 to 1989, the park was completed at a cost of $300 million, which was funded by the then Royal Hong Kong Jockey Club. The park was \\"doubled\\" in size, expanding to the north and south, and the sports centre and swimming pool complex was built. Facilities Pool Pavilion Bird Lake This ringed teal is among the numerous birds species in the park including swans, ducks, flamingoes, parrots and tropical pigeons. =Flora and gardens= There is a tree walk located next to the Rose Garden. There are also some stone wall trees growing on the walls adjacent to aviary pond in Kowloon Park. =Museums= One preserved historic barrack, Block S58, is used as a godown of Hong Kong Museum of History. Three other preserved buildings of the former barracks are used as museums: Hong Kong Heritage Discovery Centre Blocks S61 and S62 of former Whitfield Camp are \\"Grade III historical buildings\\" which were constructed in circa 1910. They are a pair of identical two storied colonial military barrack blocks. The roofs are pitched with Chinese tiles with tar finish. They housed the former Hong Kong Museum of History from 1983 to 1998 before the completion of the present Hong Kong Museum of History at Chatham Road South. An extension block linking the two historical barracks was constructed in the 1980s to provide more space for the museum facilities. It now houses the Hong Kong Heritage Discovery Centre.UNESCO Asia Pacific Heritage Awards: Whitfield Barracks Health Education Exhibition and Resource Centre Block S4 of former Whitfield Camp is a two-storied colonial military barrack building which is identical to Blocks S61 and S62.

The pool complex is the most heavily used in Hong Kong, serving over 2000 swimmers daily. It includes four indoor heated pools, including an Olympic sized 50-metre main pool, two 25-metre training pools, and a 20-metre diving pool. Outdoors, there are leisure pools of irregular shapes linked together by waterfalls, a circular paddling pool, and sunbathing areas. The swimming complex opened on 12 September 1989 and can accommodate a maximum of 1530 swimmers, and has an annual attendance of more than 1 million visitors. As one of the best equipped swimming pools in Hong Kong, it is the only venue on the Kowloon side suitable for staging major or international swimming events.Leisure and Cultural Services Department: Kowloon Park Swimming Pool Events of the Hong Kong Games are also held there regularly. =Other facilities= The former Kowloon West II Battery, which was graded as Grade I historic building, was converted into a children's adventure playground in Kowloon Park;Leisure and Cultural Services Department: Kowloon Park: Discovery Playground it is still recognisable for what it was, however.

He was also interested in decorative art, design, interior decoration and book illustration. In his lifetime, he produced more than 3,000 works of art.  Biography  = Early life = Bednarik was born in Orschowa (Or≈üova), at the time part of Austria-Hungary, to Czech parents; he was son of the second marriage of Adalbert Bednarik (originally from Moravia) and Genoveva Hauschka, followed by two sisters, Genoveva, and Maria. While a pupil at the Traian High School in Drobeta Turnu Severin, he won first prize for his works in drawing at the Tinerimea Rom√¢nƒÉ society. From 1898 to 1900, Bednarik studied at the Bucharest School of Fine Arts under the sculptor and water- colourist, Ion Georgescu. In 1901, he went to Vienna where he occasionally attended classes at the Academy of Fine Arts; Bednarik preferred instead to study masterpieces in the collections of the Kunsthistorisches Museum and the Albertina. In 1909, he married Elena Alexandrina Baraba≈ü, also a graduate of the Bucharest School of Fine Arts. Together they left for Munich to study at the Royal School of Applied Art, at a time when the city was a dynamic international cultural centre, brimming with new ideas, in particular the influence of the Jugendstil aesthetic. = Symbolism = The Bednariks made their debut in 1910, in Paris, at the Salon d'Automne held in the Grand Palais. They returned to Bucharest in the same year. Ignat Bednarik exhibited for the first time in Romania in 1913 with Associa≈£ia ArtisticƒÉ; he subsequently took part in official salons and opened his first individual exhibition in Bucharest in 1915.Gemaldeasstellung ‚ÄûBednarik - Sofronie‚Äù √Æn Rumanischer Lloyd, XXXII (1915), nr. 8507, decembrie 22, p. 2 His works of this period brought the influence of European symbolism to Romania at the same time as Alexandru Macedonski was exploring similar ideas in poetry.Olimp Grigore Ioan: ‚ÄûLe C√©nacle id√©aliste‚Äù/‚ÄûCenaclul Idealist‚Äù/‚ÄûIdealistic Literary Club‚Äù √Æn L‚ÄôIndep√©ndence Roumaine‚Äù, 38 (1915), nr. 12236, nov. 30/ dec. 13, p. 2. The longing for evasion, a favourite concern of symbolists, shows itself in a variety of ways in his work. A symbolic interpretation of reality, seen through the world of myths, is found in works like Saved, while the interdependence of heaven and earth is explored in When the Gods Came Down to Earth and a demythologising of fiction is attempted in End of the Legend (all 1915). The need for escape, the longing for the absolute and the desire to recreate reality in an ideal dimension can also be seen in Towards glory (1915), The Spirit Triumphs (1916), Excelsior, The Paths of Life (1922) and √Üternum Vale!. The escape into the world of legends and ancient ballads (for example, Me≈üterul Manole) demonstrates Bednarik's debt to Romanian folk-tales, seen particularly well in his series of illustrations for Petre Ispirescu's Tales of the Romanians (1925‚Äì1926). Notes of nostalgia and reverie also permeate his portrait-compositions Ioana (1920), The Letter (1921) and Portrait of Mrs. M. Tomescu (1923), while his treatment of philosophical subjects, such as Towards the Styx (1916), The Enigma of Life (1919), Chimera, or To Be or Not To Be (1922), is imbued with an air of symbolic mystery. Another kind of symbolic escape is found in the realm of fine sensations, of correspondences. The theme of music often appears in Bednarik's work, for example Young Girl Playing the Violin (1915), At the Piano (1922) and Playing the Violin (1922). Bednarik often associates music with flowers which decorate the interior where the former is being produced; at times they are so faintly sketched on the canvas as to be almost invisible (another symbolist trait). Flowers are often present in portraits of children (Mother's Birthday) and almost always in paintings of female figures (a favourite association of Art Nouveau artists), for example in Portrait of the Artist's Wife (1919), Portrait of a Young Girl (1925), or Portrait of Miss J.P. (1924). They are also seen in his interiors with nudes painted in 1921. The flower symbolism is enhanced by the choice of the blossom which accompanies the female figure. Mastering the delicate transparency of watercolour, Bednarik surrounds his sitters sometimes with lilies, but more often with roses or peonies. In his next period, from 1919 to 1928, the still life with flowers became one of his favourite subjects.Temele simboliste, p.10-13, Album Ignat Bednarik, Editura Meridiane, 1987, autor Beatrice Bednarik The novelty of his work lies in its symbolist conception as well as the atmosphere of deep philosophical contemplation, transposed through watercolour, which imbues his painting with such distinctive individuality. = Later work = The violence of World War I brought an abrupt halt to his heady and coloured symbolist compositions. As a member of the War Team of Artists and SculptorsPetru Comarnescu, ‚ÄûPictorul Bednarik‚Äù/‚ÄûPainter Bednarik‚Äù, Arta PlasticƒÉ IX (1962), nr/no.4, page.44. set up in Ia≈üi by Queen Marie, during the time when Bucharest was occupied by German forces, Bednarik employed all his graphic skill in vigorous depictions of conflict and hardships. Between 1915 and 1927, Bednarik held eight individual watercolour exhibitions in Bucharest and, in 1928, one in New York City.The Art Center 65-67 East 56th Street, An Exhibition of Paintings and Water Colors by Oscar Schmidt, Ignatz Bednarik and Edward Nagel. Shown under the patronage of the Royal Rumanian Legation. October 16 to November 6, 1928 He also executed a series of works which were designed as an overlook of typical scenes from Romanian daily life. Towards 1947, partially recovering his sight after a period of almost total blindness, he painted a number of canvases depicting characters from old Bucharest, or scenes from Romanian history (The Execution of Gheorghe Doja, 1954). In 1956, a retrospective of the work of Ignat Bednarik was organised in Bucharest by the Union of Artists.Catalogul Expozi»õiei retrospective de acuarelƒÉ »ôi desen I.

He died two years later.  Legacy  Today, his works can be seen in collections and museums both in Romania and abroad, such as in the National Museum of Art of Romania, Military Museum, and National Museum of Romanian History, the Bucharest City Museum of History and Art, the library of the Romanian Academy, the Brukenthal Museum in Sibiu; also in the Albertina Collection in Vienna and in private collections in Europe, the Americas and the Middle East.Beatrice Bednarik, Ignat Bednarik Album, Meridiane Publishing House, Bucharest 1987, p.5 Notes Bibliography  * Beatrice Bednarik, Ignat Bednarik Album, Meridiane Publishing House, Bucharest 1987 * Beatrice Bednarik - ‚ÄúIgnat Bednarik, pictor »ôi ilustrator al reginei Maria‚Äù - Revista Academica, Nr. 56-57 (193-194), Anul XVII, Noiembrie-Decembrie 2006 * Catalogul Expozi»õiei retrospective de acuarelƒÉ »ôi desen I.

Located in Concord, Massachusetts, the company was founded in 1997 and was purchased by Interland (now Web.com) in 2003. In March, 2004 Interland closed the Trellix subsidiary. Trellix Web Founded in 1995 by software pioneer Dan Bricklin, Trellix's first product was Trellix, a program designed to allow companies to develop and manage information on corporate intranets. Many users of the program desired to use this same idea to create personal websites. This led to the creation of Trellix Web (codenamed \\"Brooklyn\\"), a downloadable, client- based software tool. Trellix offered several versions of Trellix Web software: * Free versions (2.0‚Äì2.7) that would publish only to specific web publishers with which Trellix had arranged business deals, such as Fortune City and Tripod. Dozens of co-branded versions of the free Trellix Web software were released for various business partners, the most popular of which was included with Dell and HP computers and with Corel's WordPerfect with v 2.0. * Paid versions. The paid versions were available online sold directly by Trellix, and sold with a book: Trellix Web Site Creation Kit book (with CD-ROM) had two different versions. Though similar, the publishing options were completely different. ** Prentice Hall Edition of 2.7PA allowed the user to define a host (per page 121) ** Prentice Hall Edition of 2.7 version, like the free version of the software, was tied to only certain hosts. The only version of Trellix that was sold to consumers was 2.7 and only the Publish Anywhere (PA) version allowed the user to define the host. Version 2.7PA was not included in bundled software packages and it is the only version of Trellix that can still publish to new sites. Eventually, Trellix completely abandoned development of \\"Trellix Web\\" in favor of \\"Trellix Web Express\\", the online software, selling the rights to \\"Trellix Web\\" to GlobalSCAPE, Inc. so the product could be sold under the name CuteSITE Builder (CSB). This software was sold as version 3, 4 and 5, but was discontinued June 30, 2006 which ended the line of PC installed Trellix software. Support for the free and paid versions of the PC software is still available on free support sites and forums. Trellix Web Express In 2001, Trellix developed Trellix Web Express, a web-based version of the Trellix Web software, based in part on software purchased from Lycos' Tripod.com division. (This deal was structured such that Tripod, at the time one of the largest homepage providers online, would be the initial licensee of the new product.) Utilizing JavaScript and allowing published changes to be seen in real-time, Trellix Web Express was designed to be easy-to-use without having to download a fairly large client program. Some free Web portals still use Trellix Web Express, although it is often co-branded to remove the Trellix name from the product. At its peak, Trellix developed the Web Express product in English, Spanish, and Portuguese. However, work on the non-English versions was not profitable and was discontinued after the 3.x release. By 2003, EarthLink was offering use of Trellix Site Builder to its customers. In 2007 Trellix Web Express appeared as \\"Site Builder\\" or \\"Trellix Site Builder\\".

It was funded by Rob Theis, general partner, Doll Capital Management and Terry Garnett, general partner, Venrock Associates. The company owned the Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) software, which was originally developed by Phil Zimmermann (who had earlier started a company of a similar name). Originally written in 1991, PGP was one of the first freely and publicly available implementations of public-key cryptography. It was originally used to allow individuals to communicate securely through bulletin board systems. PGP later became standardized and supported by many other applications, including email. PGP Corporation acquired the code and rights to the name from Network Associates (NAI) in August 2002. The company released version 9 of the software in 2005. PGP Corporation's focus shifted towards the corporate market. In 2004, the company announced plans to integrate with Symantec anti-virus technology. In 2009, Callas left to be a security consultant. In February 2010, the company acquired certificate authority TC TrustCenter and its parent company, ChosenSecurity, to form its PGP TrustCenter division. On April 29, 2010, Symantec Corp. announced the acquisition of PGP Corporation for about $300 million cash. The merger was completed in June of that year.

The earliest part of the home may date to 1717. Later it successively became the home of the young Louisa May Alcott and her family, who named it Hillside, author Nathaniel Hawthorne and his family, and children's writer Margaret Sidney. It became the first site with literary associations acquired by the National Park Service and is now open to the public as part of Minute Man National Historical Park. Early history The first record of the Wayside property occurs in 1717. Minuteman Samuel Whitney was living in this house, which still retained most of its original appearance, on April 19, 1775, when British troops passed by on their way to the Battles of Lexington and Concord at Concord's Old North Bridge. During the years 1775 and 1776 the house was occupied by scientist John Winthrop during the nine months when Harvard College was moved to Concord. The Alcotts The Hillside in 1845 Shortly after the failure of the Fruitlands experiment, educator and philosopher Amos Bronson Alcott and his family moved to Concord.Felton, 133 Beginning in October 1844, the family first lived in the home of a friend named Edmund Hosmer. Alcott's wife Abby May had recently inherited about $2,000 and they intended to use the money to buy a home.Matteson, 173 Neighbor Ralph Waldo Emerson helped the family find the property to buy: a home most recently owned by a wheelwright named Horatio Cogswell.Matteson, 173‚Äì174 Emerson also loaned the family $500 for their purchase.Schreiner, 125 Bronson took no part in the transaction being, as his wife explained, \\"dissatisfied with the whole property arrangement\\" and did not believe he could own any part of the Earth.Saxton, 158 No one seemed to know much about the history of the home, though Henry David Thoreau told the story that one of its previous owners believed he would never die and his ghost was rumored to haunt it.Matteson, 174 The Alcotts moved in on April 1, 1845; they named the home \\"Hillside\\". The Alcotts immediately began renovating what was originally a colonial saltbox home. A shed on the property was cut in half and attached to either side of the main house. Outside the house, they added terraces, arbors, and pavilions.Felton, 68‚Äì69 Bronson had hoped his brother Junius and his family would move in with them and built additional rooms for that purpose. Instead, by that summer, Junius had a nervous breakdown and Bronson left to care for him.Saxton, 163 In March 1846, the family added a bedroom for their 13-year- old daughter Louisa May Alcott. It was the first room she had to herself. She wrote in her journal, \\"It does me very good to be alone, and Mother has made it very pretty and neat for me.\\" In this home, Louisa and her sisters lived many of the scenes that later appeared in her book Little Women (1868‚Äì69), including the amateur plays they performed.Wilson, 133 She also began writing what would become her first book, Flower Fables (1854).Felton, 69 A plaque recognizes the role the Alcott family played as part of the Underground Railroad while living in this house. Bronson opened the home to many people, including Sophia Foord, a teacher with whom he hoped to open a school.Saxton, 159 He also offered the home as a site for the Underground Railroad. The family likely hosted several escaped slaves; Louisa May, years later, referred to more than one, writing, \\"fugitive slaves were sheltered under our roof\\".Reisen, Harriet. Louisa May Alcott: The Woman Behind Little Women. New York: Henry Holt and Company, 2009: 163. Due to the requisite secrecy, however, few records of specific fugitives survive. Bronson referred to a 30-year-old man who was \\"athletic, dextrous, sagacious, and self-relying\\" who stayed there for a week in 1847 on his way to Canada. Bronson hoped the experience would serve as a lesson to his family.Matteson, 176 By 1848, the family debated about moving. Bronson liked Concord because of the neighbors he could converse with. Abby, however, saw the town as a symbol of their poverty and desired a move to the city of Boston to be closer to friends, relatives, and potential work. She won the debate and the family rented out the Hillside and moved to the South End by that winter.Saxton, 171 The Hawthornes This statue of Nathaniel Hawthorne once stood in the visitor center of The Wayside but has since been moved to his writing tower. After living for a time in a rented home in Lenox, Massachusetts, author Nathaniel Hawthorne considered purchasing a home for his family. He assured his wife Sophia Peabody that his publishers Ticknor & Fields \\"promise the most liberal advances of money, should we need it, towards buying the house.\\"Wineapple, 243 On March 8, 1852, Hawthorne finalized his purchase of the house for $1,500 from the Alcotts.Wright, 99 After buying the house, Hawthorne wrote, \\"Mr Alcott... had wasted a good deal of money in fitting it up to suit his own taste‚Äîall of which improvements I get for little or nothing. Having been much neglected, the place is the raggedest in the world but it will make, sooner or later, a comfortable and sufficiently pleasant home.\\"Corbett, William. Literary New England: A History and Guide. Boston: Faber & Faber, 1993: 116‚Äì117. The Hawthornes had previously lived in Concord at The Old Manse, which they moved to after their July 9, 1842, wedding.Wineapple, 160 Their new home was about two miles from there and the couple moved in with their three children in June. Nathaniel renamed it \\"The Wayside\\",McFarland, 130 noting that it stood so close to the road that it could have been mistaken for a coach stop.Levine, 94 He explained in a letter: \\"I think [it] a better name, and more morally suggestive than that which... Mr. Alcott... bestowed on it.\\"McFarland, 139 Bronson never accepted the name change and continued referring to it as \\"Hillside\\".Schreiner, 207 Some time in 1852, the Hawthornes hired Henry David Thoreau to survey the property. The young six-year old Julian Hawthorne, the second of the Hawthornes' three children, accompanied him in silence. Thoreau remarked to the boys father he was a \\"good boy! Sharp eyes, and no tongue\\".Walls, Laura Dassow. Henry David Thoreau: A Life. Chicago: The University of Illinois Press, 2017: 325. By October 1852, Hawthorne wrote to his friend Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, \\"I am beginning to take root here, and feel myself, for the first time in my life, really at home.\\"McFarland, 183 =European trips= The family moved to England when Nathaniel Hawthorne was appointed United States consul at Liverpool; he served in that role from August 1, 1853 to October 12, 1857.Wright, 100 Shortly before leaving, on June 14, 1853, friend and poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow held a farewell dinner party at his Cambridge home.McFarland, 198 The Hawthornes stayed in Europe until 1860 and, during that time, they leased The Wayside to family members including Sophia's sister, Mary Peabody, who later married Horace Mann. During her time in the house, Franklin Benjamin Sanborn stayed at The Wayside for a night while hiding his connection to John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry.Wineapple, 333 The Hawthornes' son Julian later went to Sanborn's school.Wineapple, 336 Before returning to the United States, the Hawthornes spent several months in Italy where, in April 1859, Nathaniel grew a mustache.Wright, 102 While the Hawthornes were overseas, the Alcotts had Henry David Thoreau survey the land next door to The Wayside.Schreiner, 195 The site was the former home of a man named John Moore and was surrounded by elms and butternut trees, and included an apple orchard. They purchased the home, which they named Orchard House, for $945 on September 22, 1857.Matteson, 231‚Äì232 The Hawthornes referred to it as \\"Apple Slump\\".Wineapple, 335 While the Orchard House was being renovated, the Alcott family rented a wing of The Wayside.Matteson, 238 Unlike Bronson Alcott, Nathaniel was not known for socializing with his neighbors. He often used the hilltop in his backyard as a means of escaping social interactions. As Bronson noted, \\"he feared his neighbor's eyes would catch him as he walked.\\"Miller, 489 The children of the respective families, however, became quite friendly. Bronson was disappointed in his inability to connect with Nathaniel and noted, \\"Nobody gets a chance to speak with him unless by accident.\\"Saxton, 237‚Äì238 Louisa was surprised the neighboring families did not become better friends. She wrote, \\"We did all we could to heal the breach between the families but they held off, so we let things rest.\\"Matteson, 299 =Return to the United States= Una, Julian and Rose Hawthorne, circa 1862 After the family returned to the United States in 1860, Nathaniel considered moving to Boston, noting, \\"I am really at a loss to imagine how we are to squeeze ourselves into that little old cottage of mine.\\" The income from his consulship did not bring as much money as he predicted and, to make matters worse, reception to his latest book, The Marble Faun, was not positive. Hoping to expand The Wayside rather than move, he wrote of his financial woes \\"with a wing of a house to build, and my girls to educate, and Julian to send to Cambridge [to study at Harvard College]\\".McFarland, 214 Nevertheless, the family made several changes to the home, most notably the three-story tower on the back of the house. The top room became Nathaniel's study‚Äîhe named it his \\"sky parlor\\"‚Äîthough the tin roof made the room very hot in summer and very cold in winter. During those months he used the front parlor for his writing.Felton, 70‚Äì71 Julian Hawthorne moved his bedroom to the first floor sitting room.Wright, 106 Next-door neighbor Bronson Alcott cut paths and planted gardens for the Hawthornes, which included fir trees and larches imported from England, and Thoreau surveyed the property for $10. The Hawthornes also added a second story over Alcott's west wing, enclosed the bay porch and moved the barn to the east side of the house. Nathaniel was not entirely pleased with the result: During these years, Nathaniel spurned invitations from James Russell Lowell to write for The Atlantic Monthly. When the journal was purchased by the publisher James Thomas Fields, he invited both Nathaniel and Sophia to write. He agreed but she declined, writing: \\"You forget that Mr. Hawthorne is the Belleslettres portion of my being, and besides that I have a repugnance to female authoresses in general. I have far more distaste for myself as a female authoress in particular.\\" =Civil War years and beyond= At the outset of the American Civil War, Nathaniel Hawthorne's spirits and health were fading.Wright, 103 Urged by his friend Horatio Bridge, he took a trip to Washington, D.C.,Miller, 469 where he met President Abraham Lincoln in the spring of 1862. Nathaniel noted he was \\"about the homeliest man I ever saw\\" but that he \\"liked this sallow, queer, sagacious visage\\".McFarland, 263 He visited several sites related to the War and the Army especially in Virginia, where he traveled for a time with writer Nathaniel Parker Willis. He returned to the Wayside on April 10, 1862, and less than a month later sent The Atlantic an essay titled \\"Chiefly About War Matters by a Peaceable Man\\".Wineapple, 348‚Äì349 Fields, editor of The Atlantic, had accompanied Nathaniel on the trip at Sophia's requestWineapple, 347 and insisted on changes to the essay. He and publishing partner William Ticknor agreed that comments about President Lincoln's odd features and references to \\"Uncle Abe\\" should be omitted.McFarland, 263‚Äì264 Nathaniel cut the entire section, though he considered it \\"the only part of the article really worth publishing\\" and lamented, \\"What a terrible thing it is to try to let off a little bit of truth into this miserable humbug of a world!\\"Miller, 472 The Atlantic received very \\"cruel and terrible notes\\", Fields claimed, after the article was published. In his later years, Nathaniel was especially concerned about the financial situation his family would face after his death. Living at The Wayside cost the family $2,500 a year, despite attempts to live frugally by refusing to hire help to take care of the house and grounds. He noted to his publisher Ticknor that he expected to \\"die in the alms-house\\".Miller, 501 In the late spring of 1864, Nathaniel took ill and traveled with his friend, the former President of the United States Franklin Pierce. It was on this trip that Nathaniel died on May 19, 1864.McFarland, 295 On hearing the news, Louisa May Alcott sent the family a bouquet of violets picked from Nathaniel's walking path by the Wayside. Annie Adams Fields, wife of the publisher, noted in her journal after a visit in April 1865, \\"What an altered household! She [Sophia] feels very lonely, and is like a reed. I fear the children will find small restraint from her... Will God spare her further trial?\\"Gollin, Rita K. Annie Adams Fields: Woman of Letters. Amherst, MA: University of Massachusetts Press, 2002: 101. Sophia and the three children moved to England shortly after; she sold The Wayside in 1870. The Lathrops and the Lothrops The home was purchased in Spring 1879 by George Parsons Lathrop, an author and husband of Hawthorne's daughter Rose. Rose and George Lathrop lived there with their son Francis. Rose, who had lived there twice before, hoped it would be a happy time for her young family, but it was not; their son contracted diphtheria. As she wrote to Lillian Aldrich, wife of author Thomas Bailey Aldrich, \\"Sitting here so much alone in this old house, The Wayside, as I have done of late, I see things between slumber and waking, a bright, queer time for insights, though they are always sad ones; and I wonder if all the saints about us avert anything except from themselves. Amelioration is sometimes quite another thing, and sometimes I detest.\\"Valenti, 64 The Lathrops moved out on February 6, 1881, the day young Francis died. In 1883, The Wayside was bought by Boston publisher Daniel Lothrop and his wife, Harriett. Harriett was the author of the Five Little Peppers series and other children's books using the pen name Margaret Sidney. The Lothrops added town water in 1883, central heating in 1888, and electric lighting in 1904, as well as a large piazza on the west side in 1887. The room that, after 1860, had served as Julian Hawthorne's bedroom became Mrs. Lothrop's dining room. The Lothrops helped oversee a several-day celebration in honor of Nathaniel Hawthorne's centennial in 1904. Speeches were given, letters were read in public, and a tablet was dedicated by Beatrix Hawthorne (daughter of Julian) marking the larch path where the author often walked. Hawthorne's daughter Rose, then known as Mother Mary Alphonsa and leading the Dominican Sisters of Hawthorne in New York, declined to attend. \\"I have no prospect whatever of being able to be present\\", she wrote, \\"I have tried very hard for a couple of years to leave my work among the poor, to go to Concord, or its neighborhood, but have been prevented very imperatively\\". She particularly noted her work caring for the sick and dying kept her occupied.Valenti, 161 Modern history Today, The Wayside is administered by the National Park Service and is open to the public. After Margaret Sidney's death in 1924, the home was inherited by her daughter; she opened the home to the public in 1927.Levine, 98 The home stayed in the family until 1965.Felton, 72 In 1963, The Wayside was designated a National Historic Landmark, and became part of Minute Man National Historical Park on June 15, 1965. This designation came with the aid of the Lothrops' daughter Margaret, and it became the first literary site to be acquired by the National Park Service.Wilson, 131 It was renovated in 1969 and 1970. For the decades following, the National Park Service offered only minor repairs until the building was closed in 2013 for major restoration. It reopened in June 2016.Lefferts, Jennifer Fenn. \\"Mr. Hawthorne will see you in his study now\\". The Boston Globe, June 30, 2016. The Wayside is open to the public seasonally for guided tours. Its address is 455 Lexington Road in Concord.

Early life Addams grew up in Nashville, Tennessee. She served as a Hospital Corpsman with the Navy and United States Marine Corps. During her last year in the military, she came out as a transgender woman. Addams chose the name \\"Calpernia\\" from the William Shakespeare play Julius Caesar (a variant spelling of Caesar's wife Calpurnia) and its appearance on a tombstone in the film The Addams Family. Career Addams and Andrea James at the Out and Equal Workplace Summit In 2002, she formed Deep Stealth Productions in Hollywood with Andrea James. Deep Stealth creates educational and entertainment material around gender-identification issues and the experiences of differently-gendered people. Addams and James coached Felicity Huffman for her Academy Award-nominated performance as a transgender woman in the film Transamerica. At the Sundance debut of Soldier's Girl, Addams met Jane Fonda, whose son Troy Garity had played Winchell. Fonda suggested Addams mount an all-transgender production of The Vagina Monologues. The production was to contribute funds and help raise awareness of violence against women; it became the subject of the 2006 documentary film Beautiful Daughters. A reality television series entitled Transamerican Love Story, featuring Addams choosing among eight suitors, debuted February 11, 2008 on Logo TV. In April 2008, Addams performed alongside Fonda, Glenn Close, Salma Hayek, Alicia Keys, and others in a tenth-anniversary production of The Vagina Monologues at the Louisiana Superdome. In May 2008, PFLAG (Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays) chose Addams as PFLAG's spokesperson for their educational campaign, This Is Our Love Story. Addams said, \\"I hope This Is Our Love Story will help young transgender people as they come out. By seeing the happy, confident woman I've become, I hope I can act as a role model for these young people at a critical moment in their development.\\" Addams writes a blog on gender issues for Psychology Today. Addams has released a single entitled \\"Stunning\\", available on iTunes. Addams co-produced the song \\"The Vagina Song\\" by Willam Belli, from his debut album The Wreckoning, and made a cameo in the song's music video. In 2015, Addams appeared in the international premiere of \\"Trans Scripts\\" a new play by Paul Lucas at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in Scotland. The production received 24 four- and five-star reviews, a Fringe First Award, a High Commendation from Amnesty International and was shortlisted for the Feminist Fest Award, the Best of Edinburgh Award, and the Holden Street Theater Award. Personal life In 1999, while working as a performer, Addams began dating PFC Barry Winchell. Word of the relationship spread at Winchell's Army base where he was harassed by fellow soldiers and ultimately murdered. Winchell's murder and the subsequent trial resulted in widespread press and a formal review of the U.S. \\"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\\" (DADT) military policy, ordered by President Bill Clinton.Black, Chris (December 13, 1999).

President Admits \\"Don't Ask\\" policy Has Been Failure. The New York Times The case became a prominent example used to illustrate the failure of DADT to protect LGBT service members. Addams' and Winchell's romance and the crimes of their abusers are depicted in the film Soldier's Girl, released in 2003. Addams was portrayed by Lee Pace. A subsequent The New York Times article, \\"An Inconvenient Woman\\", documented the marginalization and misrepresentation of transgender sexuality even by gay rights activists.

It claimed membership of 7,300 members in 2009. It originates from the Trotskyist tradition. Its founders were students in the Netherlands who came into contact with the Committee for a Workers' International and were recruited to that body in 1980. They returned to Pakistan in 1986 and began carrying out entry work in the Pakistan Peoples Party as The Struggle. From 1991 some members split from The Struggle and operated as an open group and in 1995 they became the Jeddojuh Inqilabi Tehrik (JIT) or Struggle Revolutionary Movement. This was in opposition to the advice of the CWI. This was with a membership of 70 militants which grew to 740 by 1997 when the LPP was launched. The LPP was expelled from the CWI after accepting funds from NGOs. The rest of The Struggle continued as a section of the International Marxist Tendency until Lal Khan was expelled in 2016 over differences on entryism inside PPP. The LPP is close to groupings such as the Scottish Socialist Party and the International Socialist Organisation in the United States. In March 2005, it obtained permanent observer status in the reunified Fourth International. The party is led by its 30-year-old chairman Nisar Shah. The General Secretary is Farooq Tariq. Supporters of the party publish a weekly paper in Urdu, Mazdoor Jeddojuhd. In November 2012, the LPP announced that it was to merge with two other left parties, the Awami Party Pakistan and the Workers Party Pakistan, forming a new Awami Workers Party. The new party's aims would include a break with multinational capital and imperialism, the end of feudalism, establishment of a democratic federal system and improving relations with neighbouring states. The LPP dissolved on 10 November 2012, and Farooq Tariq was elected general secretary of the AWP. In 2018, the party merged with the Communist Mazdoor Kissan Party and the National Workers Party to form the Awami Workers Party. In October 2019, the LPP announced its resignation from the AWP. Farooq Tariq alleged that the group was being \\"witch-hunted\\" in the party, and said that the party had been reluctant to work with farmers', workers' and democratic movements, or to campaign for the release of political prisoner Baba Jan, a leading AWP member.

The film score and soundtrack was composed by Harris Jayaraj; whilst the cinematography was handled R. D. Rajasekhar, and edited by Anthony. After two years of production delays, the film was released on 14 January 2008, to mixed reviews. The film was dubbed into Telugu under the same name, and later it was dubbed in Hindi as Vachanbadh in 2012. It was remade in Bengali as Vikram.  Plot  The movie revolves around two powerful gangs in Chennai, one led by Chinna (Prakash Raj) and the other by Periyavar (Raghuvaran). Enmity prevails between both gangs, with frequent clashes happening as one gang tries to overpower the other. One day, when Periyavar's gang tries to kill Chinna, he is saved by Sekar (Vikram). Chinna meets Sekar on a few more occasions and is impressed by his courage. Chinna feels Sekar to be his resemblance as he too possesses similar characteristics. Sekar reveals that he follows Chinna right from his childhood and adores him as a role model. Sekar joins Chinna's gang, and with his help, Chinna overpowers Periyavar in the city. Sekar wins Chinna's trust, and both get close to each other. This brings up jealousy to one of Chinna's gang men (Shafi), and he hates Sekar. Sekar arranges Chinna's wedding with Padma (Lakshmi Gopalaswamy), knowing that both were in love for each other. Chinna decided not to express his love after becoming a don, but they still get married. Meanwhile, Sekar befriends Shalini (Trisha), and love blossoms between them A new police commissioner (Ashish Vidyarthi) is appointed to control violence in the city, and his first targets are Chinna and Periyavar. Sekar gives the necessary courage to Chinna and asks him not to fear the commissioner as he will always be there for protection. One day, Sekar and Shalu decide to get married. Shalu's parents will not agree for this wedding, so Shalu decides to elope with Sekar. Meanwhile, the police department secretly plans to encounter both Chinna's and Periyavar's gangs. Shalu requests Sekar to come with her and lead a peaceful life, and he agrees. Sekar informs this decision to Chinna, to which he agrees immediately. Chinna gives money to Sekar and blesses him to start a new life. Sekar and Shalu get married and move to a new apartment. However, Chinna misses Sekar very much and keeps worrying, unable to bear his departure. Saamy (Thalaivasal Vijay), an ally of Chinna, suggests calling Sekar so that Chinna might feel better. Chinna gets cold feet at first but later decides to call Sekar. Chinna, Saamy and Shafi go to Sekar's apartment where Sekar stays with Shalu. Chinna feels bad calling Sekar back and sends Shafi to talk to him. Shafi, who already has a misunderstanding with Sekar, lies to him by saying that Chinna wanted him to join his gang again. Sekar does not believe this and refuses to go with Shafi. Suddenly, Shafi shoots and kills Shalu. Sekar kills Shafi and runs down to meet Chinna and Saamy. Sekar believes it was Chinna who had sent Shafi to bring him back. Suddenly, Chinna takes a gun and shoots Sekar, which shocks him. Sekar shoots Chinna dead, thinking Chinna has tried killing him. When Saamy tells Sekar to look back, he was shocked because he saw a policeman behind him being hit by the bullet fired from Chinna's gun. Sekar understands that Chinna has shot the policeman who tried to shoot Sekar. Sekar cries inconsolably, as he has killed Chinna. Also, Saamy is shot by someone. Police has surrounded them for encounter, and the commissioner instructs his team to catch Sekar. Sekar does not want to live, so the police shoot him.

After playing heavy roles in Arul and Anniyan, Vikram wanted to make a light hearted comedy film. Upon seeing the Malayamlam film Thommanum Makkalum starring Mammootty, Vikram approached the director of the film Shafi and expressed interest in remaking it in Tamil. The film was titled Majaa and the film shooting began. During the production of Majaa, Vikram met with actor Dileep who was then working on his film Chanthupottu. Chanthupottu had Dileep playing an effeminate character. When it was released, it was commercially successful and brought critical acclaim for Dileep's portrayal. Vikram, who saw the movie, was impressed and wanted to remake it in Tamil. Vikram approached producer Mohan Natarajan to buy the remake rights of the film. The remake was tentatively titled Bheemaa. When his film Majaa hit the screens, it had only average success, and Vikram was skeptical about remaking Chanthupottu. The film was first postponed but later shelved. The producer of the film, A. M. Rathnam, approached director Lingusamy to come up with a new script. After Ji, Lingusamy announced his next project, Bheemaa, in 2005. Vikram trained his body for three months with the help of former Mr. Tamil Nadu bodybuilding champion Rajendran for the part of Sekar so that he would look more like the physically strong character of Bheemaa. Vikram stated that he approached the film like an actor even though the film's script was written \\"for a star\\" and furthermore he said that it is one of the most powerful roles. = Casting = Katrina Kaif, and Deepika Padukone were considered to play heroine but replaced by Trisha. Simran was considered for the second lead opposite to Prakash Raj. There were rumours that Mammootty would act in the film but reports proved untrue. Nana Patekar was replaced by Prakash Raj to play villain. Raghuvaran was selected to play an important role. Sherin was selected to perform item number. = Filming = A song was shot with 3000 junior artistes flown in from Mumbai. The duet song was shot at Madurai Thirumalai Nayakar Mahal. The scenes were shot in Rameshwaram and Tuticorin. A song sequence with Vikram and Trisha was picturised for the last few days on a huge ship located in mid sea. A song was shot in Australia. Re- recording was completed in 30 days and the song \\"Oru Mugamo\\" was shot with 30 scenes. Since the film was in production for such a long time, Vikram had no releases in 2006 and 2007. The filming was finally completed in 2007.  Controversy  Vijaykanth has lodged a formal complaint at the Producers‚Äô Council and the Nadigar Sangam against producer A. M. Rathnam for settlement of dues amounting to . According to Vijayakanth's sources, the producer had promised the actor to pay the amount after the release of the movie Dharmapuri in which he had acted. However, the producer moved on to his next project, Bheemaa, starring Vikram, without keeping his promise. Perturbed by this, the actor has sought action against the producer and has requested Rama Narayanan, president of the Producers‚Äô Council, to intervene and stop the release of Bheemaa until his dues are settled. A petition was filed by a travels company alleging that Sri Surya Movies, who had produced Bheemaa, had card dues for air tickets bought from them to go abroad and shoot Bheemaa. Hence, the petitioners sought a stay on the movie's release. When the petition came up for hearing at the Madras High Court on Friday, the judges declined to grant the stay and they rather insisted the production house to pay dues from their property security amount.  Soundtrack  The music of the film is composed by Harris Jayaraj, which is his first and only collaboration with director N. Linguswamy. The lyrics are penned by Na. Muthukumar, Pa.Vijay, Thamarai and Yugabharathi. The soundtrack of the film features six tracks, which released on 23 December 2007. The album of the Telugu version was released on 10 January 2008. This soundtrack reuses the same set of singers, as the original Tamil version. = Critical reception = The soundtrack received tremendous response, both critically and commercially. Behindwoods rated the soundtrack 4 out of 5 and mentioned, \\"Overall the music is good and Harris has once again proved his mettle with six numbers which are sure to be lapped up by all the music lovers in the coming months.\\" Rediff rated the album 3 out of 5, with a statement: \\"Harris Jayaraj has created an enjoyable fare deploying an assortment of youthful vocals and a slew of instruments including sarangi, santoor and dilruba predominantly used in Hindustani music. Pa Vijay- Muthukumar-Yugabharathi-Thamarai team's evocative wordscape heightens the lilting quality of the numbers. All in all Harris Jayaraj offers a good fare despite adopting an orthodox style.\\" Release The satellite rights of the film were sold to Kalaignar. The film was given an \\"A\\" certificate by the Indian Censor Board. After three years of production, Bheemaa was finally released on 14 January 2008, on the evening of Pongal with premieres due to huge expectations, alongside other releases like Pazhani, Kaalai, Vaazhthugal, Pidichirukku and Pirivom Santhippom.  Reception  = Critical response = Nowrunning wrote: \\"Bheema is a mix of action, romance, thrill and sentiment, but fails to impress. The shoddy screenplay and jerky narration are more to blame than the lack of ingenuity on the part of the director, Bheema is a one- man show of Vikram\\". Sify wrote: \\"The film lacks a solid story with no twists, and instead it tests the patience of the viewers as it turns out to be a mix of fight followed by a song, and again breaking out into another well choreographed action scene that dissolves into yet another song in Switzerland and followed by more stunt scenes\\". Behindwoods wrote: \\"For pure lovers of action, Bheema might just be the Pongal movie they are looking for, but those expecting an action movie with a strong story will be disappointed\\". Rediff wrote: \\"A M Rathnam's flashy Tamil venture, produced with state-of-the-art techniques and freeze frames that promise to dazzle you. That promise, at least, they manage to deliver\\". = Box office = The film debuted in the number one position at the Chennai box office and grossed in the first four days of release, eventually grossing there. In the overseas market, the film grossed in United Kingdom and Malaysia. The film was considered Hit and Business wise good collection in Pongal Weekend.

Most of the neighborhood was developed from 1890 through the 1920s as a streetcar suburb, with all but six of its 24 subdivisions being developed by 1917, and the last laid out by 1935, although some development west of Norris Place continued after World War II. Deer Park's boundaries are Bardstown Road, Newburg Road, Eastern Parkway and Douglass Boulevard. Deer Park is considered a part of a larger area of Louisville called The Highlands. Historic Bullock Clifton house, built in 1834 Prior to subdivision, it was agricultural. The origin of the name is not entirely clear, although recent campaigns to \\"put the deer back in Deer Park\\" have seen colorful deer sculptures placed at local businesses, parodying a Louisville-wide campaign with larger horse sculptures placed similarly. Schools and landmarks The neighborhood is largely residential. Most businesses and other non-residential buildings are found along Norris Place, Bardstown Road, and Newburg Road. These facilities include Highland Middle School and the King's Daughters and Sons Home, an institute for the ill and disabled opened in 1909 and renamed Highlands Nursing Home in the early 2000s. Other schools in the neighborhood include the Catholic primary schools St. Francis and St. Agnes, and the DePaul School, a private school for students with dyslexia and other specific learning differences. Bellarmine University is located on the Belknap side of the boundary between that neighborhood and Deer Park; until the 21st century, Deer Park residents had little contact with the university other than its function as a polling place during the elections. As the university has sought to expand its student base and campus, residents residing the closest to the university met with Bellarmine representatives on an ad hoc basis to address areas of concern such as street, rather than campus parking, and the building of a stadium in close proximity to houses on an adjoining street. The ad hoc nature of meeting with Bellarmine ceased in 2005 when there was a push by the university to buy houses on the Bellarmine side of Richmond Drive west of Norris and use them as student housing. This was opposed by Belknap and Deer Park residents and brought before the zoning commission. From this effort, the Good Neighbor Working Group was formed with Bellarmine to ensure their expansion and plans for growth did not adversely affect the integrity of the neighborhood. A local landmark is the Bullock-Clifton House, also called the Yunker house, a former farmhouse built in 1834 and located at the corner of Richmond and Rosedale. The imposing structure was described in a 1980 study as \\"steamboat gothic,\\" and is on the National Register of Historic Places. Early landowners included the Norris, Duker and Stevens families, after whom streets in the neighborhood are named. Two other streets are named after locations in Virginia (Richmond and Roanoke), and Hartman Avenue is named after developer George Hartman, who developed the area in 1914 on what was family property. Housing A typical side-gabled bungalow in Louisville's Deer Park Neighborhood The area from Eastern Parkway to Speed Avenue and Fernwood to Bardstown Road is a National Register District, and is also one of the most densely populated areas in Louisville. Since the mid-1970s, all of the somewhat narrow east/west streets here have been one-way, an oddity for a neighborhood relatively far from downtown. Further contributing to the unusually high density for a neighborhood mostly of single family homes, Deer Park includes two pedestrian courts whose long rows of houses, with no conventional street, are accessible only by alleys and sidewalks running through the short front yards. Ivanhoe Court was built in 1914, and the slightly smaller Maplewood Place a year later in 1915. These types of developments, built during the streetcar suburb era, are apparently unique to Louisville. There are 11 in Old Louisville, but outside of Deer Park only a few others remain today. The neighborhood has long had more of a middle and working class reputation than surrounding Highlands neighborhoods, which range in character from upper-middle to outright upper class. The reason for this is primarily that Deer Park's housing stock is, other than the Yunker House, decidedly low-key. Due to the lack of geographical obstacles such as steep hills or creeks, the entire neighborhood was developed in a rather uniform and quick manner. Shotgun houses and 2¬Ω story Victorians, more modest than those on the east side of Bardstown Road, make up the majority of the stock in the oldest sections, while modest craftsmen-style houses dominate streets further out, and a few small ranch style homes can be found west of Norris Place. In the north end near Douglass Boulevard is Forest Park, the last of the pre- World War II subdivisions, and the largest of any single development in Deer Park. Larger houses can be found here, many in various historical revival styles. Demographics As of 2000, the population of Deer Park was 4,082, of which 93.7% are white, 3.6% are listed as other, 2% are black, and 0.7% are Hispanic. College graduates are 48.3% of the population, people without a high school degree are 8%. Females outnumber males 51.8% to 48.2%.

History  In the first century BC, the Chinese craftsman Ding Huan (‰∏ÅÁ∑©) invented a device \\"on which many strange birds and mysterious animals were attached\\" that were said to have \\"moved quite naturally\\", but it is unclear if this and the other devices historian Joseph Needham calls \\"a variety of zoetrope\\" involved any true illusion of animation or simply featured static or mechanized figures actually moving through space.Needham, Joseph (1962). Science and Civilization in China, vol. IV, part 1: Physics and Physical Technology. Cambridge University Press. p. 123-124. Modern animation in China began in 1918 when an animation piece from the United States titled Out of the Inkwell landed in Shanghai. Cartoon clips were first used in advertisements for domestic products. Though the animation industry did not begin until the arrival of the Wan brothers in 1926. The Wan brothers produced the first Chinese animated film with sound, The Camel's Dance, in 1935. The first animated film of notable length was Princess Iron Fan in 1941. Princess Iron Fan was the first animated feature film in Asia and it had great impact on wartime Japanese Momotaro animated feature films and later on Osamu Tezuka. China was relatively on pace with the rest of the world up to the mid-1960s, with the Wan's brothers Havoc in Heaven earning numerous international awards. China's golden age of animation would come to an end following the onset of the Cultural Revolution in 1966.Qing Yun. \\"Qing Yun .\\" Qing Yun.com. Retrieved 19 December 2006. Many animators were forced to quit. If not for harsh economic conditions, the mistreatment of the Red Guards would threaten their work. The surviving animations would lean closer to propaganda. By the 1980s, Japan would emerge as the animation powerhouse of Eastern Asia, leaving China's industry far behind in reputation and productivity. Though two major changes would occur in the 1990s, igniting some of the biggest changes since the exploration periods. The first is a political change. The implementation of a socialist market economy would push out traditional planned economy systems.Socialist Marketing Economy. \\"Socialist Marketing Economy.\\" \\"Socialist Marketing Economy.\\" Retrieved 20 December 2006. No longer would a single entity limit the industry's output and income. The second is a technological change with the arrival of the Internet. New opportunities would emerge from flash animations and the contents became more open. Today China is drastically reinventing itself in the animation industry with greater influences from Hong Kong and Taiwan. Terminology Monkey King, from the 1964 animation Havoc in Heaven Chinese animations today can best be described in two categories. The first type are \\"Conventional Animations\\" produced by corporations of well- financed entities. These content falls along the lines of traditional 2D cartoons or modern 3D CG animated films distributed via cinemas, DVD or broadcast on TV. This format can be summarized as a reviving industry coming together with advanced computer technology and low cost labor. The second type are \\"Webtoons\\" produced by corporations or sometimes just individuals. These contents are generally flash animations ranging anywhere from amateurish to high quality, hosted publicly on various websites. While the global community has always gauged industry success by box office sales. This format cannot be denied when measured in hits among a population of 1.3 billion in just mainland China alone. Most importantly it provides greater freedom of expression on top of potential advertising. Characteristics In the 1920s, the pioneering Wan brothers believed that animations should emphasize on a development style that was uniquely Chinese. This rigid philosophy stayed with the industry for decades. Animations were essentially an extension of other facets of Chinese arts and culture, drawing more contents from ancient folklores and manhua. An example of a traditional Chinese animation character would be Monkey King, a character transitioned from the classic literature Journey to the West to the 1964 animation Havoc in Heaven. Also drawing on tradition was the ink-wash animation developed by animators Te Wei and Qian Jiajun in the 1960s. Based on Chinese ink-wash painting, several films were produced in this style, starting with Where is Mama (1960). However, the technique was time-consuming and was gradually abandoned by animation studios. The concept of Chinese animations have begun loosening up in recent years without locking into any particular one style. One of the first revolutionary change was in the 1995 manhua animation adaptation Cyber Weapon Z. The style consist of characters that are practically indistinguishable from any typical anime, yet it is categorized as Chinese animation. It can be said that productions are not necessarily limited to any one technique; that water ink, puppetry, computer CG are all demonstrated in the art. Newer waves of animations since the 1990s, especially flash animations, are trying to break away from the tradition. In 2001 Time Magazine Asia Edition would rate the Taiwanese webtoon character A-kuei as one of the top 100 new figures in Asia.A-Kuei from Time magazine. \\"Time Magazine.\\" Akuei in Time Magazine. Retrieved 19 December 2006. The appearance of A-kuei with the large head, would probably lean much closer to children's material like Doraemon. So changes like this signify a welcoming transition, since folklore-like characters have always had a hard time gaining international appeal. GoGo Top magazine, the first weekly Chinese animation magazine, conducted a survey and proved that only 1 out of 20 favorite characters among children was actually created domestically in China.China Today. \\"China Today.\\" \\"Chinese Animation Market: Monkey King vs Mickey Mouse.\\" Retrieved 20 December 2006.

From the financial perspective, Quatech Market Research surveyed ages between 14 and 30 in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou and found that over 1.3 billion RMB (about US$163 million) was spent on cartoons every year, but more than 80% of the revenue flows straight out of the country. Further studies show that 60% still prefer Japanese anime, 29% prefer Americans, and just 11 percent favor those made by Chinese mainland, Taiwan or Hong Kong animators. From 2006 to present, the Chinese government has considered animation as a key sector for the birth of a new national identity and for the cultural development in China. The government has started to promote the development of cinema and TV series with the aim of reaching 1% of GDP in the next five years against an investment of around RMB250-350 million (‚Ç¨29-41 million). It supported the birth of about 6000 animation studios and 1300 universities which provide animation studies. In 2010, 220,000 minutes of animations were produced, making China the world's biggest producer of cartoons on TV. In 1999 Shanghai Animation Film Studio spent 21 million RMB (about US$2.6 million) producing the animation Lotus Lantern. The film earned a box office income of more than RMB 20 million (about US$2.5 million), but failed to capitalize on any related products. The same company shot a cartoon series Music Up in 2001, and although 66% of its profits came from selling related merchandise, it lagged far behind foreign animations. 2007 saw the debut of the popular Chinese Series, The Legend of Qin. It boasted impressive 3d graphics and an immersive storyline. Its third season was released on 23 June 2010. Its fourth season is under production. One of the most popular manhua in Hong Kong was Old Master Q. The characters were converted into cartoon forms as early as 1981, followed by numerous animation adaptations including a widescreen DVD release in 2003. While the publications remained legendary for decades, the animations have always been considered more of a fan tribute. And this is another sign that newer generations are further disconnected with older styled characters. Newer animations like My Life as McDull has also been introduced to expand on the modern trend. In 2005 the first 3D CG-animated movie from Shenzhen China, Thru the Moebius Strip was debuted.

The film borrows from a Japanese \\"hot-blooded\\" style, refreshing the audience's views on Chinese animation. Kuiba was critically acclaimed, however it commercially fell below expectations.

Criticism Statistics from China's State Administration of Radio, Film and Television (SARFT) indicate domestic cartoons aired 1hr 30 minutes each day from 1993 to 2002, and that by the end of 2004, it increased the airing time of domestic cartoons to 2hrs per day.People's Daily Online. \\"People's Daily Online.\\" \\"Cartoon Festival Launches Monkey King Award.\\" Retrieved 20 December 2006. The division requested a total of 2,000 provinces to devote a show time of 60,000 minutes to domestically- produced animations and comic works. But statistics show that domestic animators can only provide enough work for 20,000 minutes, leaving a gap of 40,000 minutes that can only be filled by foreign programs. Though insiders are allegedly criticizing domestic cartoons for its emphasis on education over entertainment. SARFT also have a history of taking protectionism actions such as banning foreign programming, such as the film Babe: Pig in the City. While statistics are proving there are not enough domestic materials available, the administration continues to ban foreign materials. On 15 February 2006 another notice is issued to ban cartoons that incorporated live actors. As reported by Xinhua News Agency, the commission did not want CGI and 2D characters alongside human actors.

The Megatherium Club was founded by William Stimpson. It was a group of Washington, D.C.-based scientists who were attracted to that city by the Smithsonian Institution's rapidly growing collection, from 1857 to 1866. Many of the members had no formal education, but came by their expertise through extensive direct observation. They spent their weekdays in the rigorous and exacting work of describing and classifying species. But their nights were spent in revelry. They particularly enjoyed partaking in ale, oysters, eggnog, and whatever other fineries their meager budgets could afford. On Sundays, however, they recuperated from the week's stresses and excesses with long nature hikes. The club was named for the Megatherium, an extinct genus of giant ground sloth. The leading spirit of the club was marine biologist William Stimpson, who hosted its earliest meetings in his home. Members dubbed the place \\"The Stimpsonian.\\" By 1863, though, Stimpson and others had taken up residence in the castle of the actual Smithsonian. Club members were encouraged by Spencer Fullerton Baird, the institution's assistant secretary. And they attracted a variety of learned speakers to their meetings, including Louis Agassiz, John Torrey, and John Cassin. But they were eventually thrown out of their castle suites by the institution's secretary, Joseph Henry, who disapproved of the way members held sack races in the Great Hall and periodically serenaded his daughters. Membership was transitory as individuals undertook independent studies abroad, sometimes for years at a time. Formal meetings ceased about the year 1866 when Stimpson moved to Chicago to oversee that city's Academy of Sciences.

Torn (born May 26, 1953) is an American guitarist, composer, and producer. He is known for combining electronic and acoustic instruments and for his use of looping.  Background  Torn has contributed to recordings by artists as diverse as David Bowie, k.d. lang, John Legend, Madonna, Tori Amos, Bill Bruford, Tony Levin, Mick Karn, David Sylvian, Chocolate Genius, Michael Shrieve, Steve Roach, Patrick O'Hearn, Andy Rinehart, Matt Chamberlain, Meshell Ndegeocello and Don Cherry. In addition to his composition work, Torn's music has been featured in a wide variety of films, including Friday Night Lights, Velvet Goldmine, Adaptation, The Big Lebowski, The Departed, Fur, The Hoax, Kalifornia, Traffic, Reversal of Fortune, Tibet, and Three Kings. He studied with Leonard Bernstein (within the \\"Music for Young Composers\\" series), as well as with guitarists John Abercrombie, Pat Martino, Paul Weiss and Arthur Basile. Torn works out of his personal studios, known as Cell Labs; occasionally, he uses the pseudonym \\"splattercell.\\" The New York Times described Torn's 2015 solo release, Only Sky, as \\"[an abstract landscape that is] both immersive and deftly disorienting.\\"  Biography  Torn was born in Amityville, New York, he is married to Linda B. Brecht-Torn (b. 1952), is the son of Lawrence J. Torn (b. 1926) and Rhoda G. Torn (1927-2010), the father of electronic musician Elijah B. Torn (b. 1979) and Cody M. Torn (b. 1983). He is the brother of Marsha Torn and Linda Torn, and he was a cousin of the late actor Rip Torn (1931-2019), Angelica Torn (b. 1964)], and Ina Garten (The Barefoot Contessa). Torn began his career with the Ithaca-based jam band Zobo Funn Band in the 1970s, and rose to prominence as a member of The Everyman Band and Jan Garbarek's quartet in the mid-1980s. He has recorded solo and group recordings for the ECM, Windham Hill, CMP and 75 Ark labels. In the 1990s, Torn was diagnosed with an acoustic neuroma, in his case, a life- threatening form of brain tumor. The surgery that followed left him deaf in the right ear but he remains able to compose, record, and play. He even mixes many widely available recordings himself, although according to him this requires sitting sideways to the studio speakers and \\"visualising the stereo aspects of sound\\" in his head rather than experimenting with them by ear. In 2006, Torn's film score for Believe in Me won the Best Score-award at the Jackson Hole Film Festival. In 2003, his score for the film The Order was nominated for a Grammy Award. In 2007, Torn released Prezens with Tim Berne. Jazzwise called the album \\"a vibrating collage full of shimmering sonic shapes, a dark, urban electronic soundscape ‚Äì a potent mix of jazz, free-form rock and technology that is both demanding and rewarding.\\" In 2013, Torn performed as a guitarist on David Bowie's penultimate album, The Next Day‚Äîhis third collaboration with the artist. The same year, Torn delivered a solo guitar performance and talk at TEDx Caltech 2013: The Brain. The presentation examined his brain tumor diagnosis and recovery.  Instruments and effects  As a session artist, composer, and producer, David Torn has experimented with many effects boxes, amplifiers, and instruments, and he has spoken with amplifier designers and pedal builders about their craft. In an interview with Premier Guitar magazine following the release of his solo album Only Sky, he shared an extensive list of the instruments and effects he uses. He plays a Ronin Mirari guitar with Foilbucker pickups and also lists a large number of amplifiers such as a Fryette Aether amplifier, and many guitar effects pedals including the TC Electronic Classic TC XII Phaser, Catalinbread Antichthon, DigiTech Whammy DT, and the Neunaber Stereo Wet Reverb.

History The Panzerkorps was formed in August 1943 in Poitiers, France. The formation was originally to be a skeleton formation to supervise those SS divisions that were being reformed as SS Panzer divisions. On 30 June 1944, the formation absorbed the VII SS Panzer Corps and was reformed as a headquarters for the SS Division Totenkopf and SS Division Wiking. The Corps was placed under the control of former Wiking commander SS-Obergruppenf√ºhrer Herbert Otto Gille. The corps was placed into the line around Warsaw, Poland, where it saw action against the Red Army as a part of the 9th Army. In August, 1944, elements of the corps took part in the suppression of the Warsaw Uprising. After holding the line near Warsaw, the corps was pushed back to the area near Modlin, where it saw heavy fighting until December. When SS- Obergruppenf√ºhrer Karl Pfeffer Wildenbruch's IX SS Mountain Corps and large numbers of Hungarian troops were encircled in Budapest in December 1944, the corps was shifted south from Army Group A to join 6th Army and to take part in the relief efforts. The operations were named Konrad. In Operation Konrad III, the largest of the relief operations, IV SS Panzer Corps destroyed all the tanks of the Soviet 3rd Ukrainian Front in an intense two-week battle in Transdanubia but could not relieve the city. After the failure of Operation Konrad III, the corps was moved west to the area around Lake Balaton, where it was responsible for defending the left flank of the Operation Spring Awakening (Fr√ºhlingserwachen), near Stuhlweissenberg. After the failure of this operation, the Soviet Vienna Offensive tore a gap between the IV SS- Panzerkorps and the neighboring Third Hungarian Army. After escaping an encirclement thanks to the efforts of the 9th SS Panzer Division Hohenstaufen, the corps withdrew towards Vienna. The remnants of the corps surrendered to the Americans on 9 May 1945.

He is regarded as the last major artist in the Bunjinga tradition and one of the first major artists of the Nihonga style. His real name was Yusuke, which he later changed to Hyakuren. Biography Tessai was born in either 1836 or 1837 in Kyoto, as the second son of Tomioka Korenobu, who sold sacerdotal robes. Because his hearing was not good his parents decided he should be a scholar, rather than a merchant. He was educated as a scholar in classical Chinese philosophy and literature and the ancient Japanese classics under noted kokugaku scholar Okuni Tadamasa. Tessai's father died in 1843, when he was only seven. The family fortunes declined, and young Tessai became a page at a Shinto shrine. Twelve years later, he came to be lodged with the now- famous Buddhist poet and nun ≈åtagaki Rengetsu, who would become his greatest scholarly mentor and supporter. He developed his own style over the next decade or so, studying under a number of accomplished painters. In 1861, Tessai opened a private school in Rengetsu's house to teach painting; he went on to become a teacher at the newly inaugurated Ritsumeikan University in 1868. He also did some work for the new Meiji government, contributing maps and topographical charts he created. Throughout the Meiji period, Tessai traveled extensively, visiting famous and scenic places that would later become subjects of his paintings. He was able to see many different sides of the country all the way from Nagasaki to Hokkaid≈ç. He also served as a Shinto priest at a number of different shrines, but ultimately resigned from his final post when his brother died, so that he could look after his mother. After Tessai settled back in Kyoto in 1882, he championed the old styles of Japanese traditional painting against the new influences of western art (y≈çga), then becoming more and more popular, and was thus a participant in the early nihonga movement. Tessai's early works followed the bunjinga styles of the early 19th century, although he also worked in almost all of the styles associated with Kyoto: Rimpa, Yamato-e, Otsu-e, etc. However, his mature style concentrated on Nanga, or Chinese style paintings based on the late Ming dynasty artists from Suzhou and Jiangsu Provinces, which had been introduced to Japan by Sakaki Hyakusen. Tessai tended towards use of rich colors to portray scenes of people in landscapes, with a composition intended to evoke or illustrate a historical or literary episode. He also sometimes made use of religious imagery, combining depictions of Buddhist bodhisattva with Daoist or Confucian figures to symbolize the unity of Asian religious traditions. Tessai's final works either use very brilliant colors, or else were monochrome ink with dense, rough brushwork and occasional slight jarring touches of bright pigments. In the 1890s, he was appointed a judge of the Young Men's Society of Painting, and became a professor at the Kyoto Fine Arts School soon afterwards. He also took part in the founding of several other art associations, including the Nanga Association of Japan. His mother died in 1895, but Tessai continued to have close relations with his family and gained a granddaughter several years later. In 1907, he was appointed official painter to Emperor Meiji, who so liked his works that his commission was extended to cover the Imperial Household Agency as a court painter in 1917. He was also appointed a member of the Imperial Fine Arts Academy (Teikoku Bijutsu-in) in 1919. Throughout his life, Tessai served as a Shinto priest and a scholar. He was an extremely prolific painter, and it is estimated that he painted approximately 20,000 paintings in the course of his career. On one occasion he completed 70 paintings in a single day. Tessai's best works were created in the last years of his life, from age 80 to his death in 1924 at age 88. The largest collection of Tessai's works is at the Tessai Memorial Museum, a private art museum within the grounds of the Kiyoshikojin Seicho-ji, a Buddhist temple in Takarazuka, Hyogo.

This population was hunted to extinction and its natural habitat converted for human use. It was one of the three tiger populations in the Sunda Islands. Formerly, it was regarded as a distinct tiger subspecies, which had been assessed as extinct on the IUCN Red List in 2008. In 2017, felid taxonomy was revised and the Javan tiger subordinated to P. t. sondaica, which also includes the Sumatran tiger. Results of mitochondrial DNA analysis of 23 tiger samples from museum collections indicate that tigers colonized the Sunda Islands throughout the last glacial period 11,000‚Äì12,000 years ago. Taxonomy Felis tigris sondaicus was proposed by Coenraad Jacob Temminck in 1844 as scientific name for the Javan tiger. In 1929, the British taxonomist Reginald Innes Pocock subordinated the tiger under the genus Panthera using the scientific name Panthera tigris. In 2017, the Cat Classification Task Force of the Cat Specialist Group revised felid taxonomy and now recognizes the living and extinct tiger populations in Indonesia as P. t. sondaica. Characteristics The Javan tiger was small compared to other subspecies of the Asian mainland, but larger than the Bali tiger, and similar in size to the Sumatran tiger. It usually had long and thin stripes, which were slightly more numerous than those of the Sumatran tiger. Its nose was long and narrow, occipital plane remarkably narrow and carnassials relatively long. Based on these cranial differences, the Javan tiger was proposed to be assigned to a distinct species, with the taxonomic name Panthera sondaica. Males had a mean body length of and weighed between . Females were smaller than males and weighed between . The smaller body size of the Javan tiger is attributed to Bergmann‚Äôs rule and the size of the available prey species in Java, which are smaller than the cervid and bovid species on the Asian mainland. However, the diameter of its tracks are larger than those of Bengal tiger in Bangladesh, India, and Nepal. Javan tigers were said to be strong enough to break legs of horses or water buffaloes with their paws. Habitat and ecology At the end of the 19th century, the Javan tiger inhabited most of Java. Around 1850, people living in rural areas still considered it a plague. By 1940, tigers had retreated to remote mountainous and forested areas. Around 1970, the only known tigers lived in the region of Mount Betiri, with an elevation of , the highest mountain in Java's southeast, which had not been settled because of the rugged and sloping terrain. In 1972, the area was gazetted as wildlife reserve. The last tigers were sighted there in 1976. Javan tigers preyed on rusa deer, banteng, and wild boar, less often on waterfowl and reptiles. Nothing is known about their gestation period or life span in the wild or captivity. Up to World War II, Javan tigers were kept in some Indonesian zoos, but these were closed during the war. After the war, they were so rare that it was easier to instead obtain Sumatran tigers. Extirpation At the beginning of the 20th century, 28 million people lived on the island of Java. The annual production of rice was insufficient to adequately supply the growing human population, so that within 15 years, 150% more land was cleared for rice fields. In 1938, natural forest covered 23% of the island. By 1975, only 8% of the forest remained, and the human population had increased to 85 million people. In this human-dominated landscape, the extirpation of the Javan tiger was intensified by the conjunction of several circumstances and events: * Tigers and their prey were poisoned in many places during the period when their habitat was rapidly being reduced. * Natural forests were increasingly fragmented after World War II for plantations of teak, coffee, and rubber, which were unsuitable habitat for wildlife. * Rusa deer, the tiger's most important prey species, was lost to disease in several reserves and forests during the 1960s. * During the period of civil unrest after 1965, armed groups retreated to reserves, where they killed the remaining tigers. =Last efforts= Until the mid-1960s, tigers survived in three protected areas that had been established during the 1920s‚Äì1930s: Leuweng Sancang Nature Reserve and Ujung Kulon and Baluran National Parks. Following the period of civil unrest, however, no tigers were sighted there. In 1971, an older female was shot in a plantation near Mount Betiri in Java's southeast. The area was upgraded to a wildlife reserve in 1972, at which time a small guard force was established and four habitat management projects were initiated. The reserve was severely disrupted by two large plantations in the major river valleys, occupying the most suitable habitat for the tiger and its prey. In 1976, tracks were found in the eastern part of the reserve, suggesting the presence of three to five tigers. Only a few banteng survived close to the plantations, but tracks of rusa deer were not sighted. After 1979, there were no more confirmed sightings of tigers in Meru Betiri National Park. In 1980, it was recommended to extend the wildlife reserve and completely eliminate the disruptive influence of humans on the fragile ecosystem. The Indonesian Nature Conservation Authority implemented these recommendations in 1982 by gazetting the reserve as a national park. These measures were too late to save the few remaining tigers in the region. In 1987, a group of 30 students of Bogor Agricultural University (Institut Pertanian Bogor) conducted an expedition to Meru Betiri. In groups of five, they searched the area and found tiger scat and tracks. In the west of Java lies the Halimun Reserve, today integrated into the Mount Halimun Salak National Park. In 1984, a tiger was killed there; and in 1989, pugmarks were found that were the size of a tiger's. However, an expedition of six biologists conducted in 1990 did not yield any definite, direct evidence for the existence of tigers. A subsequent survey was planned in the Meru Betiri National Park in autumn 1992 with the support of WWF Indonesia, deploying camera traps for the first time. From March 1993 to March 1994, cameras were positioned at nineteen sites, but the cameras did not yield a picture of a tiger. During this period, no tracks indicating the presence of tigers were discovered. After the final report of this survey had been published, the Javan tiger was declared extinct. Rumours and indications of the possible presence of tigers in the Meru Betiri National Park prompted the park's Chief Warden Indra Arinal to initiate another search. With support of the Sumatran Tiger Project, twelve members of the park staff were trained in autumn 1999 to set up camera traps and map their observations. The Canadian The Tiger Foundation provided infrared cameras. Despite a year of work, they photographed no tigers, few prey, and many poachers. Cultural significance Drawing by artist O. Fienzel, 1892 In 1890, Dutch author Jan Gerhard ten Bokkel noted how the fear of tigers brought the people to use superstitious language: \\"A Javan will never speak about a tiger without calling him 'Mister', it's always: Mr. Tiger. The beast might hear him once, and take revenge at him for merely saying tiger in a familiar way!\\" Alleged sightings Occasional, unofficial reports of Javan tigers surface from enthusiasts who believe the tiger still exists in Java.Bambang M. (2002). In search of 'extinct' Javan tiger. The Jakarta Post, October 30, 2002. In November 2008, an unidentified body of a female mountain hiker was found in Mount Merbabu National Park, Central Java, who allegedly died from a tiger attack. Villagers who discovered the body have also claimed some tiger sightings in the vicinity.DetikNews Nov 17, 2008: Pendaki Wanita Tewas di Gunung Merbabu, Diduga Diterkam Harimau Another alleged sighting occurred in Magetan Regency, East Java, in January 2009. Some villagers claimed to have seen a tigress with two cubs wandering near a village adjacent to Lawu Mountain. This news triggered mass panic. Local authorities found several fresh tracks in the location. However, by that time, those animals had already vanished.JawaPos 24 Januari 2009: Harimau Teror Warga Ringin Agung Following the October 2010 eruption of Mount Merapi, two Indonesian villagers claimed sightings of a big cat paw print in the residual ash, which sparked rumours that a tiger or leopard was roaming abandoned farms in search of food.

Minute Man National Historical Park commemorates the opening battle in the American Revolutionary War. It also includes the Wayside, home in turn to three noted American authors. The National Historical Park is under the jurisdiction of the National Park Service and protects in and around the Massachusetts towns of Lexington, Lincoln, and Concord. Sites These sites include: * Concord's North Bridge, where on April 19, 1775, colonial commanders ordered militia men to fire back at British troops for the first time. British colonial militia and minutemen killed two regular army soldiers and wounded eight more, one mortally, at the North Bridge Fight. This was the second battle of the day, after the brief fight at dawn on Lexington Common. In his 1837 poem, \\"Concord Hymn\\", thinker and author Ralph Waldo Emerson immortalized the North Bridge Fight as \\"the shot heard round the world\\". At this site also stands Daniel Chester French's well-known The Minute Man statue of 1874. Across the North Bridge, opposite The Minute Man statue is the Obelisk Monument. The Obelisk is believed to be the country's first memorial to its war casualties. Close by is the grave of the two regular army soldiers killed at the bridge and the Old Manse. * The five-mile (8 km) \\"Battle Road Trail\\" between Lexington and Concord, which includes a restored colonial landscape approximating the path of the running skirmishes between British troops and Colonial militia, a monument at the site where Paul Revere was captured during his midnight ride, and the Hartwell Tavern, a restored 18th-century inn and house on the Battle Road, where living history programs are presented from May through October. The Battle Road Trail winds through fields and forests and is accessible from several different parking areas. * The Wayside, a National Historic Landmark, was home to Concord muster-master Samuel Whitney on April 19, 1775, and then, in turn, to authors Amos Bronson Alcott and his daughter Louisa May Alcott, Nathaniel Hawthorne, and Margaret Sidney. The Alcotts called the home \\"Hillside;\\" Hawthorne renamed it \\"Wayside.\\" The house is also part of the National Underground Railroad Network to Freedom. * Barrett's Farm, about 1.5 miles west of North Bridge on Barrett's Farm Road, is the newest addition to Minute Man National Historical Park. The home of Colonel James Barrett, it was the destination of British regulars who crossed North Bridge intent on searching the farm for artillery and ammunition they thought was hidden there. The house and 3.4 acres of land were purchased and restored by Save Our Heritage, a Concord non-profit that transferred ownership to the National Park Service in 2012. * Park visitor centers are located at the hill overlooking the North Bridge and along Battle Road. The main visitor center, on Route 2A/Battle Road, features a 25-minute multi-media show, \\"Road to Revolution\\" that gives a good introduction to the Lexington-Concord events. An eight-minute film at the North Bridge Visitor Center provides a comprehensive account of events leading to the encounter at North Bridge. * Lexington Battle Green, formerly known as Lexington Common, site of the first action on April 19, 1775 is part of the park's story, but the Town of Lexington owns and maintains it. The Green is also where the Captain Parker Statue by Henry Hudson Kitson is located.

During the American Civil War, Baylor led Texas Confederate forces into New Mexico, and declared himself the 1st Governor of the Arizona Territory. He was confirmed by Confederate President Jefferson Davis. In an altercation, Baylor killed an editor of a rival newspaper. Davis disapproved of orders Baylor gave to his regiment to exterminate the Apache in his territory, and removed him from office as governor, stripping him of his Texas commission.[ULQ5NdjkvbiYBCZIfGOa124LEuz8d6ibeOrGKkls5hdw2R2m01p3g1s8uioBWhFwm88gkchQik9l30AhXt6bX Baylor-Carrington Family Papers] #170, The Texas Collection Later Baylor recovered, settling in San Antonio. He was elected to state government as a legislator and became a rancher. In 1881 he killed another man in an argument, when he was about 59, but was acquitted at trial. He died years later at his ranch. Early life John R. Baylor was born in Paris, Kentucky in 1822, the son of a United States Army surgeon and his wife. He had a brother, George Wythe Baylor, who followed their father into military service, later achieving the rank of colonel. The boys grew up with their family on the various military posts where their father was posted as an assistant surgeon in the Seventh Infantry. Their uncle, R.E.B. Baylor, became an associate judge on the Texas Supreme Court and co-founder of Baylor University. A great-uncle was Col. George R. Baylor, who had served in the American Revolution. Move to Texas John Baylor moved to Fayette County, Texas at the age of 18, and made his life there. In 1840 he joined a Texas volunteer army to fight against the Comanche Indians. In 1844 he married Emily Hanna in Marshall, Texas, and the couple had seven sons and three daughters. His brother George also ended up in Texas. While living as a rancher in Texas Baylor decided to try his hand at politics, and was elected to the Texas state legislature in 1851, serving from 1852-1854. In 1853 he was admitted to the bar. He was appointed as the agent to the Comanches in 1855, and held that position until his dismissal in 1857. After his dismissal, he began to travel around the state condemning the Comanches and addressing anti-Indian meetings. During this time he edited an anti-Indian newspaper, The White Man, and organized a vigilante force of around 1,000 men to campaign against the Comanches. John Baylor was appointed as a US Indian agent in Jack County, serving from 1856 to March 1857, when he was dismissed. He became a critic of Governor Sam Houston, saying he was not doing enough to defend settlers in North Texas from the Comanche and Lipan Apache. He was elected to the state legislature, and, by 1860, became a co- founding publisher and editor of a local newspaper called The White Man, which advocated the expulsion of Indians from North Texas. Based in Jacksboro, it had the advantage of being in a town that was a stop on the Butterfield Overland Mail Route, and was estimated to reach 1,000 readers. American Civil War After Texas's secession from the Union, Baylor was commissioned as a Confederate lieutenant colonel in command of the 2nd Texas Cavalry Regiment (also known as the 2nd Texas Mounted Rifles). His force pushed to the southwest into New Mexico Territory and occupied Fort Bliss. =Governor of Arizona Territory (1861‚Äì1862)= Following his victory at the First Battle of Mesilla (July 25, 1861), and the surrender of U.S. forces in the area, Baylor proclaimed himself as the Governor of Arizona Territory, a region encompassing the southern half of contemporary New Mexico and Arizona. His position was confirmed by the Confederate Congress, and he was promoted to colonel in 1861. On January 18, 1862, the fledgling territory was formally organized by the Confederate States. Soon, a disagreement over critical articles in the Mesilla Times led to a fight between Baylor and the editor, Robert P. Kelly, whom he killed. Attorney General Marcus H. MacWillie, a member of Baylor's state cabinet, officially pardoned him for the homicide. MacWillie was later rewarded when Baylor orchestrated the former AG's election to the 1st Confederate States Congress. Baylor became known for ordering his cavalry regiment to exterminate the Apache, with whom the encroaching settlers were in conflict. He issued the following order to his men: When news of this order reached Confederate President Jefferson Davis, he relieved Baylor as governor and revoked his commission as colonel. Davis's March 23, 1863 note to the Secretary of War was: =C.S.

He regained his commission as colonel and was raising a new force to recapture the Arizona Territory when the American Civil War ended two weeks later. Later life In the postwar years, Baylor settled in San Antonio, Texas. In 1873, he unsuccessfully campaigned for the Democratic party's nomination for Governor of Texas, losing to Richard Coke. In 1876, during the height of the Black Hills War, Baylor offered his services to the U.S. Army against the Lakota Sioux. In 1878, he established a sizable ranch in Uvalde County and prospered, but he continued to be involved in violent confrontations and reputedly killed a man in the early 1880s in a feud over livestock. This killing happened in Uvalde County; the victim was named Gilchrist. Baylor was never charged for the crime. He died at his ranch on February 6, 1894, aged 71. He was buried in the Church of the Ascension cemetery. right Notes References * Allardice, Bruce S., Confederate Colonels, University of Missouri Press, 2008. * Allardice, Bruce S., More Generals in Gray, Louisiana State University Press, 1995, . * Katheder, Thomas, The Baylors of Newmarket: The Decline and Fall of a Virginia Planter Family.

Synthetic fuel or synfuel is a liquid fuel, or sometimes gaseous fuel, obtained from syngas, a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen, in which the syngas was derived from gasification of solid feedstocks such as coal or biomass or by reforming of natural gas. Common ways for refining synthetic fuels include the Fischer‚ÄìTropsch conversion, methanol to gasoline conversion, or direct coal liquefaction. As of July 2019, worldwide commercial synthetic fuels production capacity was over , with numerous new projects in construction or development, such as Carbon Engineering. Classification and principles The term 'synthetic fuel' or 'synfuel' has several different meanings and it may include different types of fuels. More traditional definitions, such as the definition given by the International Energy Agency, define 'synthetic fuel' or 'synfuel' as any liquid fuel obtained from coal or natural gas. In its Annual Energy Outlook 2006, the Energy Information Administration defines synthetic fuels as fuels produced from coal, natural gas, or biomass feedstocks through chemical conversion into synthetic crude and/or synthetic liquid products. A number of synthetic fuel's definitions include fuels produced from biomass, and industrial and municipal waste. The definition of synthetic fuel also allows oil sands and oil shale as synthetic fuel sources, and in addition to liquid fuels, synthesized gaseous fuels are also considered to be synthetic fuels: in his 'Synthetic fuels handbook' petrochemist James G. Speight included liquid and gaseous fuels as well as clean solid fuels produced by conversion of coal, oil shale or tar sands, and various forms of biomass, although he admits that in the context of substitutes for petroleum-based fuels it has even wider meaning. Depending on the context, methanol, ethanol and hydrogen may also be included. Synthetic fuels are produced by the chemical process of conversion. Conversion methods could be direct conversion into liquid transportation fuels, or indirect conversion, in which the source substance is converted initially into syngas which then goes through additional conversion process to become liquid fuels. Basic conversion methods include carbonization and pyrolysis, hydrogenation, and thermal dissolution. History AG) in Police, Poland Direct conversion of coal to synthetic fuel was originally developed in Germany. The Bergius process was developed by Friedrich Bergius, yielding a patent in 1913. Karl Goldschmidt invited him to build an industrial plant at his factory the Th. Goldschmidt AG (now known as Evonik Industries) in 1914.According to the Degussa biography of Hans Goldschmidt at , Karl Goldschmidt had invited Bergius to become director of research at Chemische Fabrik Th. Goldschmidt. Production began in 1919. Indirect coal conversion (where coal is gasified and then converted to synthetic fuels) was also developed in Germany by Franz Fischer and Hans Tropsch in 1923. During World War II, Germany used synthetic oil manufacturing () to produce substitute (Ersatz) oil products by using the Bergius process (from coal), the Fischer‚ÄìTropsch process (water gas), and other methods (Zeitz used the TTH and MTH processes). In 1931, the British Department of Scientific and Industrial Research located in Greenwich, England, set up a small facility where hydrogen gas was combined with coal at extremely high pressures to make a synthetic fuel. The Bergius process plants were Nazi Germany's primary source of high-grade aviation gasoline, synthetic oil, synthetic rubber, synthetic methanol, synthetic ammonia, and nitric acid. Nearly one third of the Bergius production was produced by plants in P√∂litz () and Leuna, with 1/3 more in five other plants (Ludwigshafen had a much smaller Bergius plant which improved \\"gasoline quality by dehydrogenation\\" using the DHD process). Synthetic fuel grades included \\"T.L. [jet] fuel\\", \\"first quality aviation gasoline\\", \\"aviation base gasoline\\", and \\"gasoline - middle oil\\"; and \\"producer gas\\" and diesel were synthesized for fuel as well (e.g., converted armored tanks used producer gas). By early 1944, German synthetic fuel production had reached more than from 25 plants, including 10 in the Ruhr Area. In 1937, the four central Germany lignite coal plants at B√∂hlen, Leuna, Magdeburg/Rothensee, and Zeitz, along with the Ruhr Area bituminous coal plant at Scholven/Buer, had produced of fuel. Four new hydrogenation plants () were subsequently erected at Bottrop-Welheim (which used \\"Bituminous coal tar pitch\\"), Gelsenkirchen (Nordstern), P√∂litz, and, at 200,000 tons/yr Wesseling. Nordstern and P√∂litz/Stettin used bituminous coal, as did the new Blechhammer plants. Heydebreck synthesized food oil, which was tested on concentration camp prisoners. The Geilenberg Special Staff was using 350,000 mostly foreign forced laborers to reconstruct the bombed synthetic oil plants, and, in an emergency decentralization program, to build 7 underground hydrogenation plants for bombing protection (none were completed). (Planners had rejected an earlier such proposal because the war was to be won before the bunkers would be completed.) In July 1944, the 'Cuckoo' project underground synthetic oil plant (800,000 m2) was being \\"carved out of the Himmelsburg\\" North of the Mittelwerk, but the plant was unfinished at the end of WWII. Indirect Fischer‚ÄìTropsch (\\"FT\\") technologies were brought to the US after World War 2, and a plant was designed by HRI, and built in Brownsville Texas. The plant represented the first commercial use of high-temperature Fischer‚ÄìTropsch conversion. It operated from 1950 to 1955, when it was shut down when the price of oil dropped due to enhanced production and huge discoveries in the Middle East. In 1949, a demonstration plant for converting coal to gasoline was built and operated by the U.S. Bureau of Mines in Louisiana, Missouri. Direct coal conversion plants were also developed in the US after World War II, including a 3 TPD plant in Lawrenceville, New Jersey, and a 250-600 TPD Plant in Catlettsburg, Kentucky. In later decades the Republic of South Africa established a state oil company including a large synthetic fuel establishment. Processes The numerous processes that can be used to produce synthetic fuels broadly fall into three categories: Indirect, Direct, and Biofuel processes. This is a listing of many of the different technologies used in 2009 for synthetic fuel production. Please note that although this list was compiled for coal to liquids technologies, many of the same processes can also be used with biomass or natural gas feedstocks. =Indirect conversion= Indirect conversion has the widest deployment worldwide, with global production totaling around , and many additional projects under active development. Indirect conversion broadly refers to a process in which biomass, coal, or natural gas is converted to a mix of hydrogen and carbon monoxide known as syngas either through gasification or steam methane reforming, and that syngas is processed into a liquid transportation fuel using one of a number of different conversion techniques depending on the desired end product. File:Indirect conversion synthetic fuels processes.jpg The primary technologies that produce synthetic fuel from syngas are Fischer‚ÄìTropsch synthesis and the Mobil process (also known as Methanol- To-Gasoline, or MTG). In the Fischer‚ÄìTropsch process syngas reacts in the presence of a catalyst, transforming into liquid products (primarily diesel fuel and jet fuel) and potentially waxes (depending on the FT process employed). The process of producing synfuels through indirect conversion is often referred to as coal-to-liquids (CTL), gas-to-liquids (GTL) or biomass- to-liquids (BTL), depending on the initial feedstock. At least three projects (Ohio River Clean Fuels, Illinois Clean Fuels, and Rentech Natchez) are combining coal and biomass feedstocks, creating hybrid-feedstock synthetic fuels known as Coal and Biomass To Liquids (CBTL). Indirect conversion process technologies can also be used to produce hydrogen, potentially for use in fuel cell vehicles, either as slipstream co-product, or as a primary output. =Direct conversion= Direct conversion refers to processes in which coal or biomass feedstocks are converted directly into intermediate or final products, avoiding the conversion to syngas via gasification. Direct conversion processes can be broadly broken up into two different methods: Pyrolysis and carbonization, and hydrogenation. Hydrogenation processes One of the main methods of direct conversion of coal to liquids by hydrogenation process is the Bergius process.Robert Haul: Friedrich Bergius (1884-1949), p. 62 in 'Chemie in unserer Zeit', VCH-Verlagsgesellschaft mbH, 19. Jahrgang, April 1985, Weinheim Germany In this process, coal is liquefied by heating in the presence of hydrogen gas (hydrogenation). Dry coal is mixed with heavy oil recycled from the process. Catalysts are typically added to the mixture. The reaction occurs at between to and 20 to 70 MPa hydrogen pressure. The reaction can be summarized as follows: n{\\\\rm C} + (n+1){\\\\rm H}_2 \\\\rarr {\\\\rm C}_n{\\\\rm H}_{2n+2} After World War I several plants were built in Germany; these plants were extensively used during World War II to supply Germany with fuel and lubricants. The Kohleoel Process, developed in Germany by Ruhrkohle and VEBA, was used in the demonstration plant with the capacity of 200 ton of lignite per day, built in Bottrop, Germany. This plant operated from 1981 to 1987. In this process, coal is mixed with a recycle solvent and iron catalyst. After preheating and pressurizing, H2 is added. The process takes place in tubular reactor at the pressure of 300 bar and at the temperature of . This process was also explored by SASOL in South Africa. In 1970-1980s, Japanese companies Nippon Kokan, Sumitomo Metal Industries and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries developed the NEDOL process. In this process, a mixture of coal and recycled solvent is heated in the presence of iron-based catalyst and H2. The reaction takes place in tubular reactor at temperature between and at the pressure 150-200 bar. The produced oil has low quality and requires intensive upgrading. H-Coal process, developed by Hydrocarbon Research, Inc., in 1963, mixes pulverized coal with recycled liquids, hydrogen and catalyst in the ebullated bed reactor. Advantages of this process are that dissolution and oil upgrading are taking place in the single reactor, products have high H:C ratio, and a fast reaction time, while the main disadvantages are high gas yield, high hydrogen consumption, and limitation of oil usage only as a boiler oil because of impurities. The SRC-I and SRC-II (Solvent Refined Coal) processes were developed by Gulf Oil and implemented as pilot plants in the United States in the 1960s and 1970s. The Nuclear Utility Services Corporation developed hydrogenation process which was patented by Wilburn C. Schroeder in 1976. The process involved dried, pulverized coal mixed with roughly 1wt% molybdenum catalysts. Hydrogenation occurred by use of high temperature and pressure syngas produced in a separate gasifier. The process ultimately yielded a synthetic crude product, Naphtha, a limited amount of C3/C4 gas, light-medium weight liquids (C5-C10) suitable for use as fuels, small amounts of NH3 and significant amounts of CO2. Other single-stage hydrogenation processes are the Exxon donor solvent process, the Imhausen High-pressure Process, and the Conoco Zinc Chloride Process. A number of two-stage direct liquefaction processes have been developed. After the 1980s only the Catalytic Two-stage Liquefaction Process, modified from the H-Coal Process; the Liquid Solvent Extraction Process by British Coal; and the Brown Coal Liquefaction Process of Japan have been developed. Chevron Corporation developed a process invented by Joel W. Rosenthal called the Chevron Coal Liquefaction Process (CCLP). It is unique due to the close-coupling of the non-catalytic dissolver and the catalytic hydroprocessing unit. The oil produced had properties that were unique when compared to other coal oils; it was lighter and had far fewer heteroatom impurities. The process was scaled-up to the 6 ton per day level, but not proven commercially. Pyrolysis and carbonization processes There are a number of different carbonization processes. The carbonization conversion occurs through pyrolysis or destructive distillation, and it produces condensable coal tar, oil and water vapor, non-condensable synthetic gas, and a solid residue-char. The condensed coal tar and oil are then further processed by hydrogenation to remove sulfur and nitrogen species, after which they are processed into fuels. The typical example of carbonization is the Karrick process. The process was invented by Lewis Cass Karrick in the 1920s. The Karrick process is a low-temperature carbonization process, where coal is heated at to in the absence of air. These temperatures optimize the production of coal tars richer in lighter hydrocarbons than normal coal tar. However, the produced liquids are mostly a by-product and the main product is semi-coke, a solid and smokeless fuel. The COED Process, developed by FMC Corporation, uses a fluidized bed for processing, in combination with increasing temperature, through four stages of pyrolysis. Heat is transferred by hot gases produced by combustion of part of the produced char. A modification of this process, the COGAS Process, involves the addition of gasification of char. The TOSCOAL Process, an analogue to the TOSCO II oil shale retorting process and Lurgi- Ruhrgas process, which is also used for the shale oil extraction, uses hot recycled solids for the heat transfer. Liquid yields of pyrolysis and Karrick processes are generally low for practical use for synthetic liquid fuel production. Furthermore, the resulting liquids are of low quality and require further treatment before they can be used as motor fuels. In summary, there is little possibility that this process will yield economically viable volumes of liquid fuel. =Biofuels processes= One example of a Biofuel-based synthetic fuel process is Hydrotreated Renewable Jet (HRJ) fuel. There are a number of variants of these processes under development, and the testing and certification process for HRJ aviation fuels is beginning. There are two such process under development by UOP. One using solid biomass feedstocks, and one using bio-oil and fats. The process using solid second-generation biomass sources such as switchgrass or woody biomass uses pyrolysis to produce a bio- oil, which is then catalytically stabilized and deoxygenated to produce a jet- range fuel. The process using natural oils and fats goes through a deoxygenation process, followed by hydrocracking and isomerization to produce a renewable Synthetic Paraffinic Kerosene jet fuel. =Oil sand and oil shale processes= Synthetic crude may also be created by upgrading bitumen (a tar like substance found in oil sands), or synthesizing liquid hydrocarbons from oil shale. There are a number of processes extracting shale oil (synthetic crude oil) from oil shale by pyrolysis, hydrogenation, or thermal dissolution. Commercialization Worldwide commercial synthetic fuels plant capacity is over , including indirect conversion Fischer‚ÄìTropsch plants in South Africa (Mossgas, Secunda CTL), Qatar {Oryx GTL}, and Malaysia (Shell Bintulu), and a Mobil process (Methanol to Gasoline) plant in New Zealand.Motor-fuel production at the New Zealand Synfuel site has been shut down since the mid nineties, although production of methanol for export continues. This site ran on the Mobil process converting gas to methanol and methanol to gasoline.http://www.techhistory.co.nz/ThinkBig/Petrochemical%20Decisions.htm Sasol, a company based in South Africa operates the world's only commercial Fischer‚ÄìTropsch coal-to-liquids facility at Secunda, with a capacity of . Economics The economics of synthetic fuel manufacture vary greatly depending the feedstock used, the precise process employed, site characteristics such as feedstock and transportation costs, and the cost of additional equipment required to control emissions. The examples described below indicate a wide range of production costs between $20/BBL for large- scale gas-to-liquids, to as much as $240/BBL for small-scale biomass-to- liquids + Carbon Capture and Sequestration. In order to be economically viable, projects must do much better than just being competitive head-to-head with oil. They must also generate a sufficient return on investment to justify the capital investment in the project. =CTL/CBTL/BTL economics= According to a December 2007 study, a medium scale (30,000 BPD) coal-to-liquids plant (CTL) sited in the US using bituminous coal, is expected to be competitive with oil down to roughly $52‚Äì56/bbl crude-oil equivalent. Adding carbon capture and sequestration to the project was expected to add an additional $10/BBL to the required selling price, though this may be offset by revenues from enhanced oil recovery, or by tax credits, or the eventual sale of carbon credits. A recent NETL study examined the relative economics of a number of different process configurations for the production of indirect FT fuels using biomass, coal, and CCS.

These economics can change in the event that plentiful low-cost biomass sources can be found, lowing the cost of biomass inputs, and improving economies of scale. Economics for solid feedstock indirect FT process plants are further confused by carbon regulation. Generally, since permitting a CTL plant without CCS will likely be impossible, and CTL+CCS plants have a lower carbon footprint than conventional fuels, carbon regulation is expected to be balance-positive for synthetic fuel production. But it impacts the economics of different process configurations in different ways. The NETL study picked a blended CBTL process using 5-15% biomass alongside coal as the most economical in a range of carbon price and probable future regulation scenarios. Because of scale and cost constraints, pure BTL processes did not score well until high carbon prices were assumed, though again this may improve with better feedstocks and more efficient larger scale projects. Chinese direct coal liquefaction economics Shenhua Group recently reported that their direct coal liquefaction process is competitive with oil prices above $60 per barrel.< Previous reports have indicated an anticipated cost of production of less than $30 per barrel, based on a direct coal liquefaction process, and a coal mining cost of under $10/ton. In October 2011, actual price of coal in China was as high as $135/ton. Security considerations A central consideration for the development of synthetic fuel is the security factor of securing domestic fuel supply from domestic biomass and coal. Nations that are rich in biomass and coal can use synthetic fuel to off-set their use of petroleum derived fuels and foreign oil. Environmental considerations The environmental footprint of a given synthetic fuel varies greatly depending on which process is employed, what feedstock is used, what pollution controls are employed, and what the transportation distance and method are for both feedstock procurement and end-product distribution. In many locations, project development will not be possible due to permitting restrictions if a process design is chosen that does not meet local requirements for clean air, water, and increasingly, lifecycle carbon emissions.examples of such restrictions include the US Clean Air Act and clean air mercury rule , and the recent limits imposed on new coal-to-liquids projects in China by the National Development and Reform CommissionAn excessive carbon footprint can prevent the United States federal government from being able to purchase fuel. Section 526 of the Energy Independence And Security Act prohibits Federal agencies, including the Department of Defense, from purchasing alternative synfuels unless the alternative fuels have lower GHG emissions than refined petroleum based fuels. =Lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions= Among different indirect FT synthetic fuels production technologies, potential emissions of greenhouse gasses vary greatly. Coal to liquids (\\"CTL\\") without carbon capture and sequestration (\\"CCS\\") is expected to result in a significantly higher carbon footprint than conventional petroleum-derived fuels (+147%). On the other hand, biomass-to-liquids with CCS could deliver a 358% reduction in lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions. Both of these plants fundamentally use gasification and FT conversion synthetic fuels technology, but they deliver wildly divergent environmental footprints. Lifecycle carbon emissions profiles of various fuels, including many synthetic fuels. Coal and biomass co- conversion to transportation fuels, Michael E. Reed, DOE NETL Office of Fossil Energy, Oct 17 2007 Generally, CTL without CCS has a higher greenhouse gas footprint. CTL with CCS has a 9-15% reduction in lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions compared to that of petroleum derived diesel. CBTL+CCS plants that blend biomass alongside coal while sequestering carbon do progressively better the more biomass is added. Depending on the type of biomass, the assumptions about root storage, and the transportation logistics, at conservatively 40% biomass alongside coal, CBTL+CCS plants achieve a neutral lifecycle greenhouse gas footprint. At more than 40% biomass, they begin to go lifecycle negative, and effectively store carbon in the ground for every gallon of fuels that they produce. Ultimately BTL plants employing CCS could store massive amounts of carbon while producing transportation fuels from sustainably produced biomass feedstocks, although there are a number of significant economic hurdles, and a few technical hurdles that would have to be overcome to enable the development of such facilities. Serious consideration must also be given to the type and method of feedstock procurement for either the coal or biomass used in such facilities, as reckless development could exacerbate environmental problems caused by mountaintop removal mining, land use change, fertilizer runoff, food vs. fuels concerns, or many other potential factors. Or they could not, depending entirely on project-specific factors on a plant-by-plant basis. A study from U.S. Department of Energy National Energy Technology Laboratory with much more in-depth information of CBTL life-cycle emissions \\"Affordable Low Carbon Diesel from Domestic Coal and Biomass\\". Hybrid hydrogen-carbon processes have also been proposed recently as another closed-carbon cycle alternative, combining 'clean' electricity, recycled CO, H2 and captured CO2 with biomass as inputs as a way of reducing the biomass needed. =Fuels emissions= The fuels produced by the various synthetic fuels process also have a wide range of potential environmental performance, though they tend to be very uniform based on the type of synthetic fuels process used (i.e. the tailpipe emissions characteristics of Fischer‚ÄìTropsch diesel tend to be the same, though their lifecycle greenhouse gas footprint can vary substantially based on which plant produced the fuel, depending on feedstock and plant level sequestration considerations.) In particular, Fischer‚ÄìTropsch diesel and jet fuels deliver dramatic across-the-board reductions in all major criteria pollutants such as SOx, NOx, Particulate Matter, and Hydrocarbon emissions.Per the work of NREL , , and various other DOE/DOD studies These fuels, because of their high level of purity and lack of contaminants, further enable the use of advanced emissions control equipment that has been shown to virtually eliminate HC, CO, and PM emissions from diesel vehicles.see Yosemite Waters study In testimony before the Subcommittee on Energy and Environment of the U.S. House of Representatives the following statement was made by a senior scientist from Rentech: > F-T fuels offer numerous benefits to aviation users. The first is an > immediate reduction in particulate emissions. F-T jet fuel has been shown in > laboratory combusters and engines to reduce PM emissions by 96% at idle and > 78% under cruise operation.

F-T fuels inherently reduce > emissions because they have higher energy content per carbon content of the > fuel, and the fuel is less dense than conventional jet fuel allowing > aircraft to fly further on the same load of fuel. The \\"cleanness\\" of these FT synthetic fuels is further demonstrated by the fact that they are sufficiently non-toxic and environmentally benign as to be considered biodegradable. This owes primarily to the near-absence of sulfur and extremely low level of aromatics present in the fuel. Image:OSD Clean Fuel Initiative FT Diesel Emissions Presentation Slide.jpgUsing Fischer‚ÄìTropsch diesel results in dramatic across the board tailpipe emissions reductions relative to conventional fuels Image:OSD Clean Fuel Initiative FT Jet Emissions Presentation Slide.jpgUsing Fischer‚ÄìTropsch jet fuels have been proven to dramatically reduce particulate and other aircraft emissions Sustainability One concern commonly raised about the development of synthetic fuels plants is sustainability. Fundamentally, transitioning from oil to coal or natural gas for transportation fuels production is a transition from one inherently depletable geologically limited resource to another. One of the positive defining characteristics of synthetic fuels production is the ability to use multiple feedstocks (coal, gas, or biomass) to produce the same product from the same plant. In the case of hybrid BCTL plants, some facilities are already planning to use a significant biomass component alongside coal. Ultimately, given the right location with good biomass availability, and sufficiently high oil prices, synthetic fuels plants can be transitioned from coal or gas, over to a 100% biomass feedstock. This provides a path forward towards a renewable fuel source and possibly more sustainable, even if the plant originally produced fuels solely from coal, making the infrastructure forwards-compatible even if the original fossil feedstock runs out. Some synthetic fuels processes can be converted to sustainable production practices more easily than others, depending on the process equipment selected. This is an important design consideration as these facilities are planned and implemented, as additional room must be left in the plant layout to accommodate whatever future plant change requirements in terms of materials handling and gasification might be necessary to accommodate a future change in production profile.

The former refuge of reformator Martin Luther was considered a national symbol and the assembly a protest against reactionary politics and Kleinstaaterei. History After the German \\"Wars of Liberation\\" against Napoleon and the French occupation, many people were bitter about dreams of German national unity shattered after the 1815 Congress of Vienna. Democratic reforms were stalled, and governments had cracked down on press freedom and rights of association. On 12 June 1815 several corporated students at the University of Jena founded the Urburschenschaft organization in order to encourage German unity at the university. Many of them had participated as voluntary soldiers on the fields against Napoleon, e.g. in the L√ºtzow Free Corps, the black-red-gold colour scheme of which was adopted for the Flag of Germany. The German students demonstrated for a national state and a liberal constitution condemning the \\"reactionary\\" forces in the newly recreated states of the German Confederation. At least, a constitution for the German state of Saxe-Weimar- Eisenach including articles on freedom of speech, press and assembly was amended by Grand Duke Karl August in 1816. On the occasion of the three- hundredth anniversary of Martin Luther's nailing of his ninety-five theses on 31 October 1517 and to commemorate the fourth anniversary of the bloody Battle of Nations at Leipzig, the Burschenschaft student fraternities from the Jena and Halle universities agreed to organize a \\"national festival\\" at the Wartburg. The castle was chosen as a meeting place as it had been a refuge for Luther after he had been banned and was declared vogelfrei by Emperor Charles V in 1521. Inasmuch as he had translated the Bible there and thus set a standard for the German language, it became a symbol of German nationalism. Hundreds of students from Berlin, Breslau, Erlangen, Gie√üen, G√∂ttingen, Greifswald, Heidelberg, Kiel, K√∂nigsberg, Leipzig, Marburg, Rostock und T√ºbingen joined the festivities. Jena professors such as Dietrich Georg von Kieser, Lorenz Oken, Heinrich Luden, and Jakob Friedrich Fries were also among the participants. At the meeting in the Wartburg knights' hall, speeches were held about Martin Luther as a freedom fighter and the way to national unity. Followed by the Christian hymn Now Thank We All Our God as sung by the victorious Prussian troops after the 1757 Battle of Leuthen and a final blessing, the convention resembled a Protestant church service. The men eventually gathered for a festive meal and gave several toasts to the fallens of the Liberation Wars, Scharnhorst, Schill and K√∂rner. Invitations to Austrian universities had been blocked by the government of State Chancellor Metternich; the event itself was also used as a justification for further suppression of liberal forces, such as the Carlsbad Decrees of 1819. In 1832, the Hambacher Fest was held in similar manner. A second festival at the Wartburg was held during the Revolutions of 1848 in the German states.  Book burning  Book burning after the Wartburg festival Contemporary report with a list of the burnt things After the end of the official festivities and referring to Martin Luther's burning of the papal bull Exsurge domine in 1520, followers of \\"Turnvater\\" Friedrich Ludwig Jahn arranged a book burning with the burning of mocked books symbolizing a number of reactionary literary works, and symbols of Napoleon's foreign rule like a corporal's cane.Gerd Fesser: \\"Von der Napoleonzeit zum Bismarckreich: Streiflichter zur deutschen Geschichte im 19.

She is best known as co-founder and lead singer of the '80s new wave band Missing Persons and for her work with Frank Zappa. While with Zappa, she performed significant roles in two of his major works, Joe's Garage (1979) and Thing-Fish (1984). In her solo career, Bozzio has released four albums and one EP. Bozzio co-founded Missing Persons in 1980 with former Zappa musicians Warren Cuccurullo and Terry Bozzio (her husband from 1979 to 1986). In addition to being the band's lead vocalist, she also contributed lyrics. Missing Persons released one EP and six albums, including Spring Session M (1982), which achieved gold record status. After Missing Persons disbanded in 1986, Bozzio was signed to Prince's Paisley Park label which released her first solo album, Riot in English (1988). Bozzio subsequently reformed Missing Persons and continues to perform the band's repertoire at venues across the United States. She has also participated periodically in reunions of the original band and has continued her work as a solo artist. In 2014, Bozzio was signed to Cleopatra Records and released a new studio album titled Missing in Action. During the summer of 2014, she signed with GRA Records for a new album to be produced by Stephan DeReine. Early life Bozzio was born Dale Frances Consalvi in Medford, Massachusetts. From the age of 16, she studied drama at Emerson College and worked as a Bunny at the Playboy Club in Boston.Deirdre Donahue \\"They May Be Missing Persons, but Terry and Dale Bozzio Have Found Each Other\\" People Magazine Vol. 22 No. 22 November 26, 1984 She was named Boston Playboy Club Bunny of the Year in 1975. In 1976, Bozzio traveled to Playboy Mansion West in Los Angeles at the request of Hugh Hefner, to interview for a position as a Valentine party hostess.Chris Cordani \\"Interview with Dale Bozzio\\" Revenge of the 80s Radio June 27, 2008. The opportunity provided for both a continuing relationship with Playboy and for living arrangements in Los Angeles, from which she could pursue an acting career. But Bozzio rejected Hefner's offer and thus failed to secure living arrangements. However, shortly thereafter, she chanced upon musician and composer Frank Zappa, whom she had met previously at one of his concerts in Boston. That encounter led to her employment with Zappa. Bozzio posed nude for Hustler, being featured in an edition published in February 1980.Patrick Goldstein,A Missing Person Is Found In The Nude, LA Times, January 6, 1985 With Frank Zappa Zappa hired Bozzio to voice the part of Mary in his rock opera Joe's Garage (1979) which was under development at the time. In that role she sang about issues such as the Roman Catholic Church, sexuality, and the culture of rock bands. In \\"Packard Goose\\", Bozzio, again as the voice of Mary, gave a brief monologue concerning how information, knowledge, wisdom, truth, beauty, love, and music relate to each other, with music as the best. Bozzio's voice can also be heard in the 1979 film Baby Snakes and in the single \\"I Don't Wanna Get Drafted\\" (1980), a criticism of the U.S. military draft policy at that time. \\"I Don't Wanna Get Drafted\\" was also included on the album The Lost Episodes (1996).\\"Review, Lost Episodes\\" The AllMusic Guide In 1984, Bozzio was cast in Zappa's musical, Thing-Fish. In voicing the part of Rhonda, she played opposite her real-life husband at the time, Terry Bozzio, who voiced the character Harry, Rhonda's husband. In Thing-Fish, Bozzio articulated some of the album's topics such as feminism, female sexuality, young urban professionals, and the state of Broadway musical theater. In November 1991, participating along with other alumni in Zappa's fiftieth birthday tribute concert, Zappa's Universe, Dale revised the words in her recitation of her lines in \\"Packard Goose\\" to, \\"Music...and Frank Zappa...are the best.\\"\\"Frank Zappa\\" classicbands.com para 20 Missing Persons Bozzio, along with Zappa touring guitarist Warren Cuccurullo and Terry Bozzio who had been one of Zappa's drummers, founded Missing Persons in 1980. Missing Persons had multiple hits during the first half of the 1980s and disbanded in 1986, shortly after the release of their third album titled Color in Your Life (1986). Bozzio continued to record and perform after the breakup of the original Missing Persons band. During the early 1990s, she toured with her own group using the band name and performing Missing Persons songs. In June 2005, Missing Persons featuring Dale Bozzio appeared on week five of the NBC show Hit Me Baby One More Time.\\"Episode Detail: Hit Me Baby One More Time - Hit Me Baby One More Time\\" Hit Me Baby One More Time 2005 Season 1 Episode 5, TV Guide retrieved November 22, 2012 Dale and Missing Persons were referenced in season 2 of the CW TV network show iZombie in 2015. A recurring character played by Jessica Harmon is FBI agent Dale Bozzio, who works on missing persons cases. Solo career Bozzio's solo album Riot in English was released in 1988 on Prince's Paisley Park Records, under the mononym \\"Dale\\". The lead single \\"Simon Simon\\" reached #33 on the Billboard dance chart. New Wave Sessions was released on October 9, 2007, on compact disc by Cleopatra Records. The album included new versions of the Missing Persons hits \\"Words\\" and \\"Destination Unknown\\", and covers of the 1980s songs \\"Funkytown\\", \\"Der Kommissar\\", \\"Turning Japanese\\", \\"I Know What Boys Like\\", and \\"Girls Just Wanna Have Fun\\". In 2010, Bozzio's Make Love Not War album and Talk Talk EP was released on Electrik Blue Records. In 2014, Bozzio's Missing in Action was released on Cleopatra Records. In 2020, she released her second solo album as Missing Persons titled Dreaming. It contains mostly covers of some classic rock / pop songs from 1960s, 1970s and 1980s decades. Influences and influence upon other artists Bozzio was influenced by black and white film era stars including Jean Harlow and Marlene Dietrich. She was also influenced by Judy Garland, and Frank Zappa. For her work with Missing Persons, Bozzio drew inspiration from the screen images of black and white era actresses; however, she incorporated color into her presentation. Her influence was behind Gelvin Guitars SSM guitar they made specifically for her with a Spring Session M theme to it. Personal life During her work with Zappa, she met drummer Terry Bozzio in 1976. They married in 1979 after Terry had become a member of the band U.K.. They divorced in 1986 with Dale retaining her married name. She has two children. In 2009, she was convicted on animal cruelty charges after unsuccessfully trying to rescue sick and feral stray cats.

The group released a series of extended plays, including the acclaimed 1983 12\\" EP Optimo. In 2008, the band reformed and have played in multiple countries. History Liquid Liquid emerged from downtown New York's no wave scene. The group's original records were pressed in very limited quantities on 99 Records, and can now fetch high prices. \\"Cavern\\" originally appeared on the EP, Optimo, recorded by Don Hunerberg. Though the pressings were small, the music has had a lasting and far reaching impact. A music video for \\"Cavern\\" was produced by Michael Sporn. After \\"Cavern\\" was sampled for Grandmaster + Melle Mel's old school rap classic, \\"White Lines (Don't Do It),\\" 99 Records took Sugarhill to court over its unauthorized use, and after an expensive court battle, won compensation. Before they could collect, however, Sugarhill went into receivership. 2000 The song was also included on the Disco Not Disco compilation album. The first three EPs, plus live material, were reissued in 1997 by Grand Royal (US) and Mo' Wax (UK). After the collapse of both these labels as well as their entire lives, Domino Records released the music from all three original 12\\"s plus extra tracks and early live recordings as Slip In And Out Of Phenomenon in 2008. In October 2008 the band returned to the UK after a prolonged hiatus, playing at London's Barbican Theatre alongside the Glasgow-based DJ duo Optimo, who named themselves after the eponymous Liquid Liquid song and EP. Liquid Liquid performed in 2009 at the Villette Sonique Festival in Paris, as well as in Lincoln Center, where they followed the 200 Guitar Orchestra. On April 2, 2010, the band performed \\"Cavern\\" with The Roots on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon and announced they were to play more shows in Britain, at the Offset Festival and ATP Release The Bats in London. On April 2, 2011, LCD Soundsystem played their farewell gig at Madison Square Garden in New York City with Liquid Liquid as supporting act.

It is a close relative of the Del Norte salamander, and some herpetologists believe it may be a subspecies of that animal. Description The Siskiyou Mountains salamander is rich brown in color with white speckles. It is about long, not counting the tail, which is variable in length. Like all of the plethodontids, it lacks lungs and respires through its moist skin. It is nocturnal, prefers cool, moist environments, and is most active during rainfall or high humidity. It stays underground during hot periods and freezes. Conservation Plethodon stormi is an IUCN Red List endangered species in California. Logging and damming have reduced its habitat. Other local amphibians In 2005, researchers discovered through genetic analysis that a larger, darker variant of this salamander is in fact a separate species. It has been named the Scott Bar salamander (Plethodon asupak). Other prominent amphibians within the range of P. stormi include the rough-skinned newt, Taricha granulosa.C.

He was interested particularly in marine biology. Stimpson became an important early contributor to the work of the Smithsonian Institution and later, director of the Chicago Academy of Sciences.  Biography  Stimpson was born in Boston, Massachusetts to Herbert Hathorne Stimpson and Mary Ann Devereau Brewer. The Stimpsons were of the colonial stock of Massachusetts, the earliest known member of the family being James Stimpson, who was married in 1661, in Milton. His mother died at an early age. William Stimpson's father was an ingenious inventor, and a leading merchant of Boston in the mid decades of the nineteenth century, trading as \\"H. & F. Stimpson, stoves and furnaces, corner of Congress and Water Streets.Historic New England: billhead, dated 1850 It was he who invented the \\"Stimpson range\\", the first sheet-iron cooking stove, famous in its day throughout New England. He also made improvements in rifles, and suggested the placing of the flange on the inside of railway car wheels instead of on the outside, as had been the custom. His son was to inherit his energy, love of social life, enthusiasm, and brilliant wit. Stimpson's father moved from Roxbury and built a house in the village of Cambridge. When fourteen years of age he read with delight Edwin Swett's work on geology, and soon after this a copy of Augustus Addison Gould's Report on the Invertebrata of Massachusetts filled him with exultant enthusiasm. He graduated from the Cambridge high school in 1848, winning the gold medal, the highest prize of the school. In September 1848 he entered the Cambridge Latin School, absorbing the mastery he displayed in the use of Latin in the description of marine animals in his Prodromus of 1857‚Äì60. He studied under the great naturalist Louis Agassiz. He focused most of his studies on marine biology, particularly invertebrates. Starting when he was 21 years old, from 1853 to 1856, he collected various specimens in the Pacific Northwest. He then settled in Washington, D.C., where he founded the Megatherium Club at the Smithsonian Institution. At the Smithsonian, he was named the director of the department of invertebrates. When fellow club member Robert Kennicott left his post as director of the Academy of Science in Chicago, Stimpson went to that city to take his place. There he gathered one of the most extensive natural history collections in the United States. The academy was destroyed in the Great Chicago Fire of 1871 (later rebuilt), and almost all of Stimpson's works and specimens were lost.

The Theban Cycle () is a collection of four lost epics of ancient Greek literature which related the mythical history of the Boeotian city of Thebes.. They were composed in dactylic hexameter verse and were probably written down between 750 and 500 BC. The 9th-century AD scholar and clergyman Photius, in his Bibliotheca, considered the Theban Cycle part of the Epic Cycle; however, modern scholars normally do not. The stories in the Theban Cycle were traditional ones: the two Homeric epics, the Iliad and Odyssey, display knowledge of many of them. The most famous stories in the Cycle were those of Oedipus and of the Seven against Thebes, both of which were heavily drawn on by later writers of Greek tragedy. The epics of the Theban Cycle were as follows: * The Oedipodea, attributed to Cinaethon: told the story of Oedipus' solution to the Sphinx's riddle, and presumably of his incestuous marriage to his mother Epicaste or Jocasta. * The Thebaid, of uncertain authorship but sometimes attributed in antiquity to Homer: told the story of the war between Oedipus' two sons Eteocles and Polynices, and of Polynices' unsuccessful expedition against the city of Thebes with six other commanders (the Seven against Thebes), in which both Eteocles and Polynices were killed. * The Epigoni, attributed in antiquity to either Antimachus of Teos or Homer: a continuation of the Thebaid, which told the story of the next generation of heroes who attacked Thebes, this time successfully. * The Alcmeonis, of unknown authorship: told the story of Alcmaeon's murder of his mother Eriphyle for having arranged the death of his father Amphiaraus (told in the Thebaid).

Several were High Kings of Ireland. After the collapse of the kingdom in the 12th century its dynasty, the Ua Mael Sechlainn or √ì Melaghlins, were forced west and settled on the east bank of the Shannon. Bearers of the name were still noted as among the Gaelic nobility until as late as the 1690s, though they had lost any real power long before. The coat of arms of Meath The Kingdom of Mide itself seems to have existed as a kingdom (though of varying sizes) since at least the early historic era. Its name means \\"middle\\", denoting the fact that it was situated in the very centre of Ireland in what is now County Westmeath, parts of north County Offaly, south County Longford and western County Meath. Its early kings may have been of the D√°l Messin Corb - whose sept, the U√≠ Garrchon, were Kings of Leinster. However, from the late 400's onwards they were driven away from their original homeland in northern Leinster and over the Wicklow Mountains by the Ui N√©ill, whose sept, the Clann Cholm√°in, took their place.

It is considered a part of a larger area of Louisville called The Highlands. Near the middle of the neighborhood is a city park of the same name, and many houses in the neighborhood feature park views. The neighborhood boundaries are St Louis Cemetery to the north, Bardstown Road to the east, Eastern Parkway to the south and Beargrass Creek to the west. History The first subdivision was laid out in 1873 by John H. Tucker between Baxter Avenue, Bardstown Road, Edenside Avenue, and about where Windsor Place would later be. However, because of its relatively remote location from downtown, development did not pick up until the 1880s. All early subdivisions were in the eastern section of the area, near Bardstown Road and away from the steep hills to the west. The extension of a streetcar line down Bardstown Road to Bonnycastle Avenue and the establishment of nearby Cherokee Park created demand around this time for housing in the area. The last subdivision built in this part was Windsor Place in 1910, which was unusually strict, requiring all houses built there to sell for over $8,000 and have exteriors only of brick, stucco or stone. Utilities and wires were located in the alleys, to allow for an unobstructed view along the maple-lined street. Further west, the sections between St. Louis and Calvary cemeteries were developed starting in 1907. The upper section was done by Edward A. Goddard, who lent his name to a street. The lower hilly section was developed by John Breckinridge Castleman, a former Confederate army major and leader in creating Louisville's park system. He began purchasing the area, known as Schwartz's Woods, in the 1870s, intending to build a personal estate there, but realized this would be impractical as the city expanded around the land. He saw that there were relatively strict deed restrictions on the lots, including setbacks, prohibition of wood fences, a minimum cost of $6,000 for houses, and all structures on lots had to be built under one roof. =Tyler Park and Bridge= A city park was opened in 1910, named Tyler Park after mayor Henry S. Tyler who died during his term in 1896. This park would in turn lend its name to the surrounding neighborhood. One of the defining features of both the park and the neighborhood is the , built in 1904 (renamed after the opening of the park). Built of Indiana limestone, the bridge allowed Baxter Avenue to span the valley north of Eastern Parkway that would become Tyler Park. The design is attributed to John Olmsted (son of Frederick Law Olmsted) and incorporates a large arch that allows pedestrians to freely walk from one part of the park to the other without crossing the busy street that bisects Tyler Park. Demographics As of 2000, the population of Tyler Park was 2,867, of whom 91.9% are white, 3.9% are black, 3% are listed as other, and 1.2% are Hispanic. College graduates comprise 51.4% of the population, while people without a high school diploma make up 10.6%. Females outnumber males 52.2% to 47.8%.

Canadian Ass'n of Internet Providers 2 S.C.R. 427, - also known as the Tariff 22 case - is a leading decision by the Supreme Court of Canada on ISP liability for copyright infringement. The Court found that there is no liability for information found in caches. An ISP's liability depends on whether it limits itself to \\"a conduit\\" or a content-neutral function and is not dependent on where the ISP is located. Background In 1995 the Society of Composers, Authors, and Music Publishers of Canada (\\"SOCAN\\") applied for a royalty tariff to the Copyright Board of Canada that would allow them to collect royalties for copyrighted materials transferred over the internet. In rebuttal, the Canadian Association of Internet Providers (CAIP) claimed that they served only as intermediaries and could not be held liable. In 2002, the Federal Court of Appeal held that an ISP could rely on the \\"intermediary exception\\" found in section 2.4(1)(b) that absolved carriers who only pass information through their system from liability. However, this exception did not apply for caching of information as doing so was considered more than just relaying information. Thus an ISP who refuses to remove copyrighted material from its servers after given reasonable opportunity to do so could be held liable. Lastly, the Court of Appeal found that the tariff should not be limited to material originating from Canada alone. Reasons of the court The Court's opinion was written by Binnie J. with McLachlin C.J., Iacobucci, Major, Bastarache, Arbour, Deschamps and Fish JJ. concurring. A minority opinion was given by LeBel J. =Binnie= To begin, Binnie notes the huge capacity of the internet to disseminate knowledge and it should be encouraged; however, a balance is difficult to find. Binnie first examined the applicability of the Copyright Act. It depends on whether there is a \\"real and substantial connection\\" between Canada and the transmission source, Binnie claims. This would mean that the Act applies to communications received in or originating from Canada. Turning to the liability of the ISPs, Binnie examined the policy reason behind section 2.4(1)(b) of the Copyright Act (\\"intermediary exception\\"). He notes that its purpose is to encourage intermediaries to improve their operations without fear of infringement. Thus ISPs can benefit from the intermediary exception if they limit their role to one of \\"conduit\\" and do not perform any acts related to content. Moreover, an ISP must only provide \\"means\\" to communicate that are \\"necessary\\". Binnie adopted the Board's broad meaning of the word \\"means\\" as including routers and the accompanying software, hosting, and connectivity services. Binnie examines the meaning of \\"necessary\\" as it applies to a provider's cache. He finds that a cache copy of a communication is content- neutral and is dictated by the technical requirements of the technology. Thus so long as it is for the purposes of \\"economy and efficiency\\" it does not make the role of the provider less of an intermediary. Therefore, an ISP can seek protection under section 2.4(1)(b) (\\"intermediary exception\\"). In concluding, Binnie notes that it is impossible to impute actual knowledge on an ISP of a copyright violation, and thus cannot impose liability. If an ISP received notice that :someone might be using neutral technology to violate copyright (as with the photocopier in the CCH case) is not necessarily sufficient to constitute authorization, which requires a demonstration that the defendant did \\"(g)ive approval to; sanction, permit; favour, encourage\\" (CCH, at para. 38) the infringing conduct. However, in obiter Binnie further suggested :I agree that notice of infringing content, and a failure to respond by \\"taking it down\\" may in some circumstances lead to a finding of \\"authorization\\"... An overly quick inference of \\"authorization\\" would put the Internet Service Provider in the difficult position of judging whether the copyright objection is well founded, and to choose between contesting a copyright action or potentially breaching its contract with the content provider. A more effective remedy to address this potential issue would be the enactment by Parliament of a statutory \\"notice and take down\\" procedure as has been done in the European Community and the United States. LeBel LeBel J. agreed with Binnie's conclusion but took issue with the test for determining the location of an internet communication under the Copyright Act (the \\"real and substantial connection\\" test). Rather, he agrees with the Copyright Board's decision to only apply to providers located in Canada. He finds the board's test to be more in-line with international treaties and diminishes privacy concerns.

History The neighborhood was built on land surveyed in 1774 and granted to Colonial William Preston, surveyor of Fincastle County, Virginia. He died in 1781, and eventually his son, Major William Preston, and wife moved onto the land in 1814 and established a plantation called the \\"Briar Patch\\". The 1819 construction of the Louisville and Bardstown Turnpike (now Bardstown Road) would eventually lead to many people moving to the area. Before the American Civil War the area was agricultural and attracted many German immigrants, and was known as New Hamburg. Formal subdivision began after the land was inherited by Preston's daughter, Susan Preston Christy (after whom Christy Avenue is named). In 1869, Sydney J. Rogers subdivided Hepburn Avenue between Barrett and Baxter. Interest in the neighborhood picked up with the extension of a horse-drawn streetcar line to Highland Avenue in 1871. The next subdivision was Hughes Addition, starting in 1875. Much of the rest of the land was subdivided by William Preston Johnson by 1891. The last was the Barr Subdivision in 1896. Rubel Ave in the Original Highlands Popularity was further increased by the establishment of Cherokee Park in 1891. Almost all of the land was developed by 1895. The vast majority of houses in the Original Highlands were constructed between 1860 and 1895, especially in the last 11 years of that period, during which 600 were built. The dwellings from before 1884 were mostly located along Breckinridge (formerly Howard), Christy, Baxter and Barret. The area was simply called the Highlands because it sits on a ridge between the middle and south forks of Beargrass Creek, above the Ohio River flood plain. Today eight other neighborhoods in the area on the same ridge are also collectively called The Highlands. The Original Highlands name has developed to distinguish it from these neighborhoods; the Highlands sometimes specifically refers to this neighborhood. Architecture The architecture of the neighborhood is a mixture of large, wood framed and brick Victorian houses and working class shotgun houses, which often sit right next to each other. Contemporary history In recent years the area has attracted many professionals because of its proximity to downtown and the Baxter Avenue/Bardstown Road and Barret Avenue commercial corridors which include arts galleries, eclectic shopping, and night life. National Products, a small factory at the corner of Breckinridge Street and Baxter Avenue, produces more disco balls than any other factory in the world. The stretch of Baxter Avenue between Highland Avenue and Broadway is known as one of Louisville's most popular destinations with its mix of bars, restaurants, galleries and shops. The Barret Avenue commercial corridor is an emerging art zone due to the large number of galleries. The neighborhood is home to the Original Highlands Art and Music Festival. Held on Baxter Avenue each September, the festival features local and national music acts along with art and vendor booths. The neighborhood is also host to the annual Highlands Louisville Halloween Parade, Louisville Zombie Attack and Ancient Order of Hibernians St. Patrick's Day Parade. The area is also well known for its numerous dining establishments, giving it the nickname \\"Restaurant Row\\". The 2006 Original Highlands Art & Music Festival Poster The Original Highlands' boundaries are East Broadway on the north, Bardstown Road/Baxter Avenue on the east, Rufer Avenue on the south and Barret Avenue on the west. The Original Highlands Neighborhood Association also works closely with residents on Ellwood Avenue, located just to the south of Winter Avenue. Demographics Highland Ave in the Original Highlands As of 2000, the population of the Original Highlands was 1,580 , of which 89.4% are white, 6.8% are listed as other, 2.7% are black, and 1.1% are Hispanic. College graduates are of the 34.3% population, people without a high school degree are 12.6%. Males outnumber females 53.7% to 46.3%.

A commercial artery and cultural heritage site, the street runs north-south through the near-centre of city and is nicknamed The Main () which is the abbreviation for \\"Main Street\\". The Main Schwartz's Delicatessen Beginning at De la Commune Street at the edge of the Saint Lawrence River, it transects the Island of Montreal, passing through the boroughs of Ville-Marie, Le Plateau-Mont-Royal, Rosemont‚ÄîLa Petite-Patrie, Villeray‚ÄìSaint-Michel‚ÄìParc-Extension, and Ahuntsic- Cartierville to Rue Somerville at the edge of the Rivi√®re des Prairies ‚Äì a total length of about 11.25 km. Saint Laurent Boulevard's cardinal direction, on a pseudo north-south axis strongly deported to the west, and aligned with the summer solstice's setting sun, was outlined by the Sulpicians towards the end of the XVII century. The first post-colonial landowners of the island, then preoccupied to develop a genuine urban cadastre on the Coteau Saint- Louis, built a small street, which they named Saint-Lambert, perpendicularly to Notre-Dame Street. Saint-Lambert Street is clearly identified on a plan drawn by Fran√ßois Dollier de Casson in 1672. In the early XVIII century, when the lords of Montreal decided to develop agricultural land further north on the island, they prolonged this little street to build a King's Way exactly along the same axis and named it Chemin Saint-Laurent. Chemin Saint-Laurent became a boulevard in 1905 and is often referred to as The Main. It serves as the city's physical division of east and west (in Montreal parlance; in reality east is more like north-northeast and west is south-southwest). Street numbers begin at Saint Lawrence and continue outward, with street names being suffixed by Ouest (West) or Est (East), depending on their orientation. Entrance to Montreal's Chinatown, St. Lawrence at Ren√© L√©vesque Boulevard. The boulevard traditionally divides Montreal by language, ethnicity, and class. Saint Laurent Boulevard was for generations the symbolic dividing line for the city, with the predominantly English-speaking population to the west, French- speaking population to the east, and immigrant communities in between along the Main and Park Avenue. The Main runs through many of Montreal's ethnic communities, a first stop for immigrant communities for over 100 years ‚Äî initially Jewish, Chinese and Italian, and later Portuguese, Greek, Arab, Haitian and others. National Historic Site In 2002 the Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada named Saint Lawrence Boulevard as The Main National Historic Site of Canada.The Main National Historic Site of Canada Then Minister of Heritage, Sheila Copps, speaking at the ceremony, said: \\"our country does not belong to just two founding peoples. It belongs to all Canadians. [This is] a first step toward a new story of Canada that includes all of our partners as equals.\\" Hamilton, Graeme. \\"'The Main' Acknowledged as Historic Site.\\" National Post. 28 September 2002, page A5. Historic Jewish Quarter Saint Lawrence and Saint Catherine streets, 1905. The Jewish community on the Main sprang up after the heavy immigration of the early to mid-1900s. Jewish settlement occurred first on the lower Main, in a section that now is part of Montreal's Chinatown. By 1871 a Jewish enclave numbering just over 400 people had formed by the corner of St. Lawrence and Dorchester Street, with the first Jewish educational institution, the Talmud Torah, located at the corner of Saint Urbain Street and De la Gaucheti√®re Street. Middle-class members of the community were already beginning to move up the Main towards Sherbrooke and Prince Arthur Streets, while further west, a small number of well-off Jews lived near McGill University. The main axes of the Jewish quarter were Saint Laurent Boulevard, Clark Street, Saint Urbain Street, Esplanade Street and Park Avenue, Montreal. By the 1930s dozens of synagogues were in the area. Culinary landmarks on Saint Laurent that bear witness to this historic community include Schwartz's and Moishes Steakhouse. Yiddish was the common language in the Jewish district on Saint Laurent Boulevard, with many Jewish immigrants working in clothing factories, once the street's main industry. Overall, Montreal was the main destination for the 125,000 Jews who settled in Canada between 1905 and 1920, making the area a centre of Yiddish language and culture (e.g. theater in that language). Despite Canada's poor record of Jewish immigration between 1933 and 1948, Montreal became home to the world‚Äôs third-largest concentration of Holocaust survivors, most of them Yiddish speakers. Other cultural institutions such as the Jewish Public Library operated in more than one language. =Culture= √âdifice Robillard seen in 2014, was the first cinema in North America. It burned down in 2016. Montreal featured the fifth-largest population of Yiddish speakers in the Americas, after New York City, Philadelphia, Chicago, and Buenos Aires; by 1930, 60,000 Yiddish speakers lived on or around The Main. The district was home to the second-largest Yiddish theatre in North America from 1896 to the 1940s, with shows at vaudeville houses along the Main as well as the Monument-National, now a National Historic Site and part of the National Theatre School of Canada. The Main was also a centre of Jewish publishing. In 1907 a young Polish Jewish immigrant, Hirsch Wolofsky, started the Yiddish-language daily newspaper Keneder Adler (English: Canadian Eagle). The paper was initially published from an office on St. Lawrence near Ontario Street. However, when the Adler became successful, Wolofsky moved the paper to its own building at 4075 St. Lawrence, near Duluth Street. The paper would publish for more than 80 years. Today Wolofsky is remembered with a small park in his honour on Rue Coloniale, between Prince-Arthur and Sherbrooke. =Politics= Fred Rose The poor Jewish quarter had a distinctly left-wing slant. Fred Rose represented the Main‚Äôs Cartier riding until 1947, when he was expelled from the House of Commons after a controversial conviction on charges of spying for the Soviet Union. To this day the Main remains the only part of Canada ever represented in Parliament by an openly Communist MP. Area city councillor Joseph Schubert, a Romanian Jew, was a socialist and admirer of Karl Marx. Elected to Montreal City Council in 1924, he was the council‚Äôs most prominent advocate of worker‚Äôs rights for 15 years. In 1931, he built a public bathhouse at the corner of Bagg and St. Lawrence, which still stands today as the Schubert Bath (official French name: Bain Schubert). =Decline= By the 1950s many Jews had moved to other communities, and most synagogues were demolished or converted to other uses. The Bagg Street Shul is the only synagogue still remaining. Former prominent Jewish-run businesses on the street included Ida Steinberg‚Äôs grocery store, founded in 1917 on St. Lawrence near Mount Royal, which went on to become Steinberg's, Quebec‚Äôs largest supermarket chain. Another supermarket, Warshaw's, was the subject of controversy when the city of Montreal was forced to pay damages after first approving and then rejecting changes to its iconic storefront. The exterior signage for Warshaw's is on permanent display as part of the Montreal Signs Project at Concordia University's Loyola campus. As of 2003 fewer than 10 Jewish-owned and family-run businesses remained on the Main between Sherbrooke Street and Mount Royal Avenue. Neighbourhoods Part of the street's vanishing red-light district. Today, the stretch of Saint Laurent boulevard is home to, from south to north: *Old Montreal (south of Viger Street to the shores of the St. Lawrence River) *Montreal's Chinatown (between Viger Street and Ren√© L√©vesque Boulevard) *A small red-light district surviving between Ren√© L√©vesque Boulevard and Saint Catherine Street, in the area of the Monument National *The Main bar district (roughly between Sherbrooke and Duluth streets), *Montreal's Little Portugal, clustered around Duluth and Rachel Streets *Mile End between Mount Royal and Van Horne Avenues *Little Italy between Saint Zotique and Jean-Talon streets *Quartier de la Mode, formerly the centre of Canada's clothing manufacturing, around the corner of Chabanel Street in the borough of Ahuntsic Famous residents The Main has produced many of Canada's most prolific individuals in the arts and has acted as a memory space. Novelists Mordecai Richler, Rejean Ducharme and Michel Tremblay and poets Irving Layton, A. M. Klein and Leonard Cohen were all influenced by this area. Canada's most prestigious award for fiction, the Scotiabank Giller Prize, was named after journalist Doris Giller, a native to the area. Depictions in popular culture Sass Jordan's 1992 hit single \\"Going Back Again\\" also depicts Saint Lawrence Boulevard as the dividing line between Montreal's English and French cultures, expressing the hope that \\"Someday we will come together Lord/Reach across this great divide\\". Trevanian's 1976 novel The Main is set in the more run-down district of the sixties, before the modern renaissance. Montreal singer C≈ìur de pirate's 2011 album Blonde includes a song entitled \\"Saint-Laurent\\" that refers to the street. Saint Laurent Boulevard is also mentioned in The Blacklist (2013), as the location where Raymond 'Red' Reddington (played by James Spader) takes Agent Elizabeth 'Lizzy' Keen (Megan Boone) to meet his liaison for the next attack, within the second episode of the first season, entitled \\"The Freelancer\\". Businesses and attractions Numerous art galleries and other cultural organisations make their home on the Main, including La Centrale gallerie Powerhouse, Th√©√¢tre Espace Go, the Festival du Nouveau Cin√©ma, the Festival International Nuits d'Afrique, the Montreal Fringe Festival, Image & Nation Festival, the Society for Arts and Technology, and the Native Friendship Centre of Montreal. Many well-known music venues can also be found on the Main, including Casa del Popolo, Sala Rosa, Club Soda, Barfly, Jupiter Room, Club Lambi, The Academy Club and Divan Orange. Gastronomic highlights include Schwartz's deli and the nearby Main Deli Steak House, both serving Montreal-style smoked meat, as well as the Montreal Pool Room, serving Montreal hot dogs since 1912. The first movies in North America were screened at the √âdifice Robillard on 27 June 1896, making this venue the first cinema in both Canada and the United-States.

Other noteworthy and now defunct ventures include the original Cin√©ma Parall√®le, Dummies Theatre, Lux, Excentris and Softimage. In early June, Saint-Laurent Boulevard becomes the host of the MURAL Festival, an international public art event that attracts artists from all over the world. MURAL celebrates creativity in a street context. For the occasion, the street is closed to car traffic between Sherbrooke Street and Mount Royal Avenue. The festival attracts around 800,000 visitors each year and won Montreal's Grand Prize of tourism for its first edition in 2013. Since 2003, Montreal bike couriers organise an illegal time trial race named Beat the Main where dozen of cyclists dash the entire 11.5 km stretch between rue de la Commune and boulevard Gouin, mostly ignoring traffic lights and regulations. The Soci√©t√© de d√©veloppement du boulevard Saint-Laurent (SDBSL) is a merchant's association promoting the economic, social and cultural development of Saint-Laurent Boulevard between Sherbrooke Street and Mont-Royal Avenue. Redevelopment and construction The corner of Saint Lawrence and Saint Catherine streets is still known as a red-light district, although its days appear numbered as a proposed $167-million development is slated to transform the area, now part of the city's new Quartier des Spectacles. In 2007 and 2008, a section of the street between Sherbrooke street and Mont-Royal avenue underwent extensive construction work, which forced some businesses to close.

The corridor is considered one of the region's largest transportation projects when it was constructed. Description Compton. Aerial view showing Alameda Corridor trench in South Los Angeles. The project includes the Mid-Corridor Trench, a below-ground, triple-tracked rail line that is long, deep, and wide, shared by the BNSF Railway and Union Pacific Railroad (UP) via trackage rights. One important use of the corridor is to carry cargo containers to and from the ports. Fifteen percent of the nation‚Äôs container traffic travels through the corridor according to the Transit Authority. The corridor has a maximum speed of . The Alameda Corridor allows trains to bypass of early 20th- century branch lines and the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railway's historic Harbor Subdivision along a high-speed grade-separated corridor, built mainly on the alignment of a former Southern Pacific Railroad (SP) line, avoiding more than 200 street-level railroad crossings where automobiles previously had to wait for lengthy freight trains to pass. Many of those same rail lines were inadequately protected with little more than ‚Äúwigwag‚Äù crossing signals dating from the original construction of the lines. The Alameda Corridor was built in a way to permit electrification with the use of electric catenary wires, which would increase the environmental benefit by displacing the use of diesel fuel; but the electrification has not happened as of yet. Governance The Alameda Corridor Transit Authority maintains more than of freight rail track, with 125 turnouts, 10 rail bridges, signals at 48 locations, 7 grade crossings, and several storm water pump stations. History The Ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles completed the purchase of SP's Alameda Corridor line for $235 million in December 1994 ($ adjusted for inflation). The line began operation on April 15, 2002, and reached a peak of 60 train movements per day by October 2006. It is credited with significantly relieving congestion on the Long Beach Freeway (I-710) and elsewhere in the region. In 2007 the line carried 17,824 trains carrying 4.7 million TEUs (20-foot equivalent units) of containers. Future development =Alameda Corridor East= The Alameda Corridor‚ÄìEast project, currently under construction, will grade-separate many of the crossings along UP's Alhambra Subdivision and the Los Angeles Subdivision. Many crossings, which are currently at grade, tie up traffic on north‚Äìsouth streets for long periods multiple times a day as long freight trains pass en route to and from the UP yards in Vernon and Commerce. The project includes 19 grade separations and elimination of 23 grade crossings. Included as part of the Alameda Corridor‚ÄìEast project is the $336.9 million San Gabriel Trench, which will submerge the track between Ramona street and San Gabriel Boulevard in San Gabriel. Construction began in 2012 and was completed in 2017. Along with federal and state funding, the project is funded in part by the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority.

Early life and education Rall was born as a so-called \\"soldier child\\" in about 1726. He was a son of Captain Joachim Rall from Stralsund, who served in the regiment of Major General Donop. The first mention of Johann Rall was as a new cadet of the same regiment on March 1, 1740, commanded at this time by Colonel Prince Casimir von Isenburg of Isenburg-Birstein. Career In the service of the Landgraf of Hesse-Cassel, he was promoted to ensign on July 25, 1741; to lieutenant on August 28, 1745; and to captain on May 10, 1753. Rall was promoted to major on May 7, 1760, under Major General Bischhausen and transferred in January 1763 to the Stein garrison regiment, where he was appointed lieutenant colonel. On April 22, 1771, he was transferred to the Mansbach Infantry Regiment as a colonel. He became commander of the regiment in January 1772. During this time, Rall fought in the War of the Austrian Succession and participated in campaigns in Bavaria, on the Rhine, in the Netherlands, and served in Scotland during the Jacobite rising of 1745. He fought in the Seven Years' War (the phase in North America be known as the French and Indian War) and was involved in many battles. From September 1771 until August 1772, he was in Russia and fought for Catherine the Great under Count Orlov in the Fourth Russo-Turkish War. The Capture of the Hessians at Trenton, December 26, 1776 by John Trumbull, showing George Washington and Johann Rall =American Revolutionary War= By 1776, Rall belonged to the infantry regiment of the 1st Division under General Phillip Leopold von Heister and commanded a Hessian Brigade of approximately 1,200 men fighting for Great Britain in the American War of Independence. He was at the Battle of Brooklyn at Flatbush, the Battle of White Plains, Battle of Long Island, and figured prominently in the Battle of Trenton. On the night of December 25‚Äì26, 1776 General George Washington crossed the Delaware River with his troops on the way to Trenton, New Jersey. The Hessian regiments, camped in and around Trenton commanded by Rall, were attacked and decisively defeated by the American Continental Army. The Hessians had supposedly let their guard down to celebrate the Christmas holiday, and (legend has it) Rall himself was misled by John Honeyman, a spy of Washington who convincingly posed as a loyalist. According to one account, Rall was busy playing chess or cards the night before the attack at the home of Trenton merchant Abraham Hunt when he was handed a note from a local Loyalist who had seen Washington's forces gathering. Because he was paying such careful attention to the game, upon receiving the message, he placed it in his coat pocket without reading it. While leading his troops during the battle, Rall was mortally wounded. He was shot twice in the side and needed to be carried back to his headquarters set up in the house of Stacy Potts (a distinguished member of the Trenton community) where he died that night. Before his death he requested a formal surrender to Washington. The note informing the colonel of the attack was later found in his coat pocket. According to local tradition, Rall is buried in an unidentified grave in the churchyard of the First Presbyterian Church on East State Street in Trenton, where an inscription is dedicated to his memory.

Production Created, produced, and directed by radio actor and director Elliott Lewis, the program was a historical true crime series, examining crimes and murders from the past. It grew out of Lewis' personal interest in famous murder cases and took a documentary-like approach to the subject, carefully recreating the facts, personages and feel of the time period. Comparatively little dramatic license was taken with the facts and events, but the tragedy was leavened with humor, expressed largely through the narration. The crimes dramatized generally covered a broad time and place frame from ancient Greece to late 19th-century America. Each episode in the series was co-written by Morton Fine and David Friedkin, in consultation with Lewis, although the scripting process was more a matter of research, as the stories were \\"adapted from the original court reports and newspaper accounts\\" or from the works of historians. The cases ranged from famous assassinations (of Abraham Lincoln, Leon Trotsky, and Julius Caesar) and the lives (and often deaths) of the likes of Cesare Borgia and Blackbeard to more obscure cases, such as Bathsheba Spooner, who killed her husband Joshua Spooner in 1778 and became the first woman tried and executed in America. The only continuing character was the host/narrator, Thomas Hyland, played by Lou Merrill. Hyland was introduced by the announcer as a \\"connoisseur of crime, student of violence, and teller of murders.\\" Merrill's deadpan portrayal of Hyland provided the welcome note of tongue-in- cheek humor to the proceedings. Unlike the ghoulish weird storytellers of The Whistler and The Mysterious Traveler, Hyland was an ordinary fellow who, in a dry, droll manner, would present a tale from his files, his wry comments interspersed between dramatized scenes. The episodes would typically begin with Hyland inviting the audience to listen to a sound, from drops of rain to horses' hooves, and then introducing the main players and events of his report. The titles also contributed to the series' light tone, as they were intentionally pompous and usually laced with irony. Typical titles included \\"Your Loving Son, Nero,\\" \\"If a Body Needs a Body, Just Call Burke and Hare,\\" and \\"The Axe and the Droot Family... How They Fared\\". A roster of Hollywood radio actors filled the various historical roles. William Conrad was one of the more frequently heard performers, in such diverse parts as Nero, Blackbeard, Pat Garrett and King Arthur.

Composer Bernard Herrmann returned to radio to score all but one of the series episodes (with Wilbur Hatch substituting for that entry), capturing the sound and feel of the various time periods simply but elegantly, often with the use of only two or three instruments per episode. During the fall of 1953, the show was scheduled back to back with On Stage, another dramatic anthology created by Lewis. He decided to connect the two by presenting \\"The Assassination of Abraham Lincoln\\" on Crime Classics while On Stage featured Our American Cousin, the play Lincoln had attended the night of his death. The experiment was unsuccessful, and according to radio historian John Dunning, earned Lewis a rebuke from network head William S. Paley, who advised him to never attempt anything like it again.

P. Putnam's sons, 1895, p. 328. The tradition was forming in the context of Puranic Vaisnavism evolving in the process of revitalizing religion of Brahmanism, of which Vishnuism is believed to be a part, through assimilating a number of orthodox, non-conformist and tribal elements; the absorption of mother goddess worship, into what now known a Vaishnava sampradayas. It is a tradition of the historical Vedic religion and is distinguished from other historic schools later forming the Vaishnavism by its primary worship of Vishnu, later identified as the source of all Avatars. A number of separate sects or traditions merged with each representing the names of god of Vaishnavism. In contemporary Vaishnavism God is also known as Narayana, Vasudeva and Krishna and behind each of those names is a divine figure with attributed supremacy in Vaishnavism, that relates to historic traditions that some scholars theorize to be separate and distinct historically. p. 4 It is distinct from Krishnaism, as in the revival of Bhakti, found in the Bhagavata it is referred as Vishnuism.Review: by Kenneth Scott Latourette India and Christendom: The Historical Connections between Their Religions. by Richard Garbe; Lydia Gillingham Robinson Pacific Affairs, Vol. 34, No. 3 (Autumn, 1961), pp. 317-318. 314x314px The followers of Vaishnavism are referred to as Vaishnava(s) or Vaishnavites. According to recent statistics, a majority of Hindus are Vaishnavas,Major Branches - Hinduism from adherents.com with the vast majority living in India. The name Vaishnavite is a direct translation of Vishnite and often lead to confusion. Some sources identify Visnuism with Vaishnavism, while others prefer to distinguish Vishnuism from Krishnaism and Ramaism. In his The Religions of India, Edward Washburn Hopkins presents an accepted distinction as to the assumption that Vishnuism is associated with Vedic brahmanism, and was part of brahmanism. Krishnaism was adopted much later, and it is for this reason, amongst others, that despite its modern iniquities Siva has appealed more to the brahmanas than Krishna. Its only later that Vishnuism merged with Krishnaism.Hopkins,The Religions of India, p. 530: \\"When, however, pantheism, nay, even Vishnuism, or still more, Krishnaism, was an accepted fact upon what, then, was the wisdom of the priest expended?\\" Etymology The term Vaishnavism and Vishnuism, entered the English language in the 19th century, and was formed by attaching the suffix -ism to Sanskrit Vaishnava or Vishnu (IAST: or ), where first is the vriddhi form of the second meaning \\"relating, belonging, or sacred to Vishnu\\" or \\"a worshiper or follower of Vishnu\\".Vaishnavism in However Vaishnava may also refer to worshiper of Rama, Nrisimha or Krishna, whereas Vishnuite more often refers to one who primarily worships Vishnu. Principal beliefs =Vishnu: The Supreme= Vishnu, as commonly depicted in his four-armed form The principal belief of Vishnuism is the identification of Vishnu as supreme or principal worship of him as was the case in the Historical Vedic times. Hopkins writes: there is a passage like the great Ka hymn of the Rig Veda, 'whom as god shall one worship?' The sages say to Vishnu: \\"All men worship thee;\\"Edward Washburn Hopkins, The Religions of India p. 581 In the Rig Veda he is referred by his name of trivikrama (who took three strides) and is believed by some scholars as the starting point of the evidence of such worship. History of Vishnu-centered Vaishnavism Temple dedicated to the worship of Vishnu as Venkateswara. Number of stages to the history of Vaishnavism place worship of Vishnu in different perspective according to the different theories by different authors. On the first stage, in its twofold aspect - historic and philosophical, is referred as by some as Bhagavata and is believed to be founded by Krishna-Vasudeva, of Yadava tribe.Grierson, George, \\"Narayani and the Bhagavatas\\" in Indian Antiquary, 37 (1908), p. 3Ramkrishna Gopal. Report On The Search For Sanskrit Manuscripts In The Bombay Presidency During The Year 1882-83, 1884, pp. 72-74.Grieson, George Abraham. The monotheistic religion of ancient India, and its descendant, the modern Hindu doctrine of faith. Yorktown: A. Bradford, 1908, p. 6. The philosophical basis of this stage was that supreme being is eternal, infinite and full of grace, and that liberation consisted in a life of perpetual bliss near the Lord.Encyclopaedia of Hinduism, (ed) N.K. Singh, p.1076 During this stage some believe that Pancaratra entered into alliance with ancient Samkhya yogic system, in line with tendency to combine philosophy with religion.Garbe, Bhagavad Gita, p. 28 It is this period that is described as the stage when the sect of Narayana was absorbed into temple of Krishna-Vasudeva. According to Grierson's views at this stage Bhagavatism became a sect of Brahmanised anti- Brahmanists.Grierson, George, \\"Narayani and the Bhagavatas\\" in Indian Antiquary, 37 (1908), p. 7 Hopkins often remarked on the often expressed view, that Bhagavad Gita bears witness to the compromise thus arrived at between Brahmanism and Bhagavatism - \\"it is a Krishnaite version of a Vishnuite poem.Hopkins, Edward Washburn. The religions of India. Boston, London, Ginn & Company, 1895, p. 389 For this reason Krishna, the personal name of Vasudeva, was given admission into the circle of Brahminical gods as an avatar of Vishnu. Adoption of Buddha as one of the avatars of Vishnu under Bhagavatism believed to be similarly a canalizing factor in assimilation in relationships during Gupta period 330-550 CE. Thus Mahayana Buddhism is sometimes called Buddha-Bhagavatism. It is in this period that it is commonly accepted among academics that the concept of avatar of Vishnu was fully developed. Thus complex religion of Vaishnavism is often viewed as a synthesis of the worship of gods Vishnu, Narayana, Vasudeva and Krishna which is achieved by the time of Bhagavad Gita (c. 4th century BCE to 3rd century CE). Worship of Vishnu is called Vishnuism and the monotheistic worship of Vishnu was already well developed in the period of the Itihasas.britannica.com This form of Vaishnavism flourished in South India and it is still commonplace, especially in present-day Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, as a result of the twelve Alvars, saints who spread the sect to the common people with their devotional hymns. The temples which the Alvars visited or founded are now known as Divya Desams. Their poems in praise of Vishnu and Krishna in Tamil language are collectively known as Naalaayira Divya Prabandham (alternatively called as Dravida Vedas).

Nara-Narayana is the twin-brother avatar of the God Vishnu on earth, working for the preservation of dharma or righteousness. Nara narayana are two bodies one soul.They are Avyaktha vishnu bagawan's vyakta roopa. The Hindu epic Mahabharata identifies the God Krishna (an avatar of Vishnu) with Narayana and Arjuna - the chief hero of the epic - with Nara. The legend of Nara-Narayana is also told in the scripture Bhagavata Purana. Hindus believe that the pair dwells at Badrinath, where their most important temple stands. The Nara-Narayana pair is frequently worshipped in temples of the Swaminarayan Faith, as the followers of the sect believe that their founder Swaminarayan resides in the murti of Naranarayan Dev in Kalupur Mandir. Etymology Narayana on the left and Nara on the right, Deogarh, Uttar Pradesh, ca. 5th century AD The name \\"Nara-Narayana\\" can be broken into two Sanskrit terms, Nara and Narayana. Nara means Human, and Narayana refers to the name of the deity. Monier-Williams dictionary says Nara is \\"the primeval Man or eternal Spirit pervading the universe always associated with Narayana, \\"son of the primeval man\\"; both are considered either as gods or sages and accordingly called ‡§¶‡•á‡§µ‡•å, ‡§ã‡§∑‡•Ä, ‡§§‡§æ‡§™‡§∏‡•å. In epic poetry, they are the sons of Dharma by Murti or Ahimsa and emanations of Vishnu, Arjuna being identified with Nara, and Krishna with Narayana.- Mahabharata, Harivamsa and Purana\\". Narayana and Nara both are forms of Vishnu. Depiction Nara-Narayana are depicted jointly or separately in images. When depicted separately, Nara is portrayed with two hands and wearing deer skin while Narayana is shown on the right in the usual form of Vishnu. Sometimes, both of them are depicted identical to each other. They are depicted four-armed holding a mace, a discus, a conch and a lotus, resembling Vishnu. Legends Krishna, Arjuna at Kurukshetra. Krishna gives the discourse of the Bhagavad Gita. 18-19th century painting. Freer Sackler Gallery. Arjuna and Krishna are often referred to as Nara-Narayana in the Mahabharata and are considered part incarnations of Nara and Narayana respectively, according to the Bhagavata Purana. In a previous life, the duo were born as the sages Nara and Narayana, and who performed great penances at the holy spot of Badrinath. Nara and Narayana were the Fourth Avatar of Vishnu. The twins were sons of Dharma, the son of Brahma and his wife Murti (Daughter Of Daksha) or Ahimsa.According to Vamana Purana, Chapter 6 - Bhandarkar p.46 They live at Badrika performing severe austerities and meditation for the welfare of the world. These two inseparable sages took avatars on earth for the welfare of mankind. Legend has it that once Shiva tried to bring the fame of Nara and Narayana before the entire world. To do that, he hurled his own potent weapon Paashupathastra at the meditating rishis. The power of their meditation was so intense that the astra lost its power before them. Shiva stated that this happened since the duo were jnanis of the first order constantly in the state of Nirvikalpa Samadhi. =Birth of Urvashi= The Bhagavata Purana tells the story of the birth of Urvashi from the sages Nara-Narayana.The Goddess in India: The Five Faces of the Eternal Feminine By Devdutt Pattanaik, Published 2000, Inner Traditions / Bear & Company, 176 pages, p.66 Once, sages Nara-Narayana were meditating in the holy shrine of Badrinath situated in the Himalayas. Their penances and austerities alarmed the gods, so Indra, the King of Devas, sent Kamadeva, Vasanta (spring) and apsaras (nymphs) to inspire them with passion and disturb their devotions. The sage Narayana took a flower and placed it on his thigh. Immediately there sprung from it a beautiful nymph whose charms far excelled those of the celestial nymphs, and made them return to heaven filled with shame and vexation. Narayana sent this nymph to Indra with them, and from her having been produced from the thigh (uru in Sanskrit) of the sage, she was called Urvashi. Having sent back the nymphs back, the divine sages continued to meditate. Tales from the Puranas By Mahesh Sharma, pp.60-62, Diamond Pocket Books (P) Ltd., Badrinath Badrinath temple According to the Bhagavata purana, \\"There in Badrikashram (Badrinath) the Personality of Godhead (Vishnu), in his incarnation as the sages Nara and Narayana, had been undergoing great penance since time immemorial for the welfare of all living entities.\\" (3.4.22) In Badrinath Temple's sanctorium, to the far right side of the stone image of Badri-Vishala (or Badri-Narayana), are the images of Nara and Narayana. Also, the Nara and Narayana peaks tower over Badrinath. Mahabharata Nara Narayana as per Mahabharata According to Bhandarkar, the gods Nara-Narayana must have been very popular at the time of the composition of the Mahabharata, since in the opening stanzas of various parvas (constituent books) of the epic, obeisance is made to these two gods. In Vanaparvan (12. 46, 47), Krishna says to Arjuna,\\"O invincible one, you are Nara and I am Hari Narayana, and we, the sages Nara-Narayana, have come to this world at the proper time..\\" In the same Parva, chapter 40 (verse 1); Shiva says to Arjuna ‚Äî \\"In former birth you were Nara and with Narayana as your companion, performed austerities for thousands of years at Badari\\". Swaminarayan sect In the Swaminarayan sect, Nara and Narayana, are called Nara-Narayana Deva. They are believed to reside at Badrikashram and to be the prime controllers of the destiny of all beings, depending on their karma. Nara-Narayana Deva are believed to have manifested at Narayana Ghat on the banks of river Sabarmati at Ahmedabad. Therefore, their images were installed by Swaminarayan at the first Swaminarayan temple, Swaminarayan Mandir, Ahmedabad (India). Members of this group interpret the events that took place at Badarikashram, the abode of Nara Narayana, that led to the incarnation of Swaminarayan. They believe that Narayana took birth as Swaminarayan due to a curse of sage Durvasa which he accepted at his own will. The curse led to Narayana taking the form of an avatar on Earth to destroy evil and establish ekantik-dharma, religion based on morality, knowledge, detachment and devotion.

Licensed to Newton, Massachusetts, United States, the station serves Boston and its western suburbs. The station is currently owned by Boston College. While the station is run solely by students, much of the on-air staff is made up of members of the surrounding Boston community. The station broadcasts alternative and indie rock during the day, and then branches out to more diverse styles (ranging from funk to lounge to Middle Eastern) in the early evening. At night, the station focuses on experimental music, which it calls No Commercial Potential. WZBC is located in Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts at the corner of Beacon and Hammond on Boston College's main campus. WZBC also broadcasts sports for the Boston College Eagles, including basketball, football, hockey, baseball, and softball. There are also a few public affairs and news shows, including the syndicated Democracy Now! at noon weekdays and several hours of WZBC produced shows on the weekends. History Founded as WVBC, \\"The Voice of Boston College\\", the radio station began in 1960 as a carrier-current AM station, broadcasting solely to the university community through the electrical wiring of on-campus buildings and dormitories. After operating in this capacity for 13 years, Boston College applied for and was granted a license to operate WZBC, a 17-watt station which aired a wide range of music, from folk to country to rock. With the advent of WZBC, the radio station expanded its listenership and began serving school's neighboring community. WZBC has seen tremendous growth since its inception in 1974. The station was granted a power increase in 1975, bringing the station's output to 1,000 watts, allowing for further expansion of its listenership. Another important change took place in 1979, when the station started broadcasting in stereo. The first stereo broadcast was officially marked by a guest appearance by British radio DJ John Peel. Perhaps the most important change in WZBC history occurred shortly after the switch to stereo, when the station narrowed its rock format to the genre known as modern rock, playing new bands which, for the most part, commercial radio would not touch, often because they were unmarketable. At approximately the same time, WZBC also began broadcasting more experimental music under the moniker No Commercial Potential. In addition to the FM station, there is also WVBC-AMWzbc - Wvbc Am‚Äîstaffed solely by students. The current WVBC can be streamed online. Additionally, the signal is broadcast over the BC cable television system, Channel 47. In 1990, WZBC was profiled in Rolling Stone magazine and was named one of the country's top 10 college radio stations that year. When rock band Nirvana released its breakthrough album Nevermind on Tuesday, September 24, 1991, the group was in Boston that day. Band members Dave Grohl and Krist Novoselic stopped by WZBC and were interviewed on the air. Tracks from the new album were played and tickets were given away to listeners for a newly announced all-ages show that night at the since-closed Axis nightclub. Although WZBC is best known for its music programming, a number of its former sports announcers have gone on to have successful professional careers in sportscasting.

It is situated along a bend of the Ohio River just below the Falls of the Ohio, where the river curves to the north and then to the south, thus placing Portland at the northern tip of urban Louisville. In its early days it was the largest of the six major settlements at the falls, the others being Shippingport and Louisville in Kentucky and New Albany, Clarksville, and Jeffersonville on the Indiana side. Its modern boundaries are the Ohio River along the northwest, north, and northeast, 10th Street at the far east, Market Street on the south, and the Shawnee Golf Course at the far west. History Completed in 1812, the Squire Earick House is the oldest known wood framed structure in Louisville Gen. William Lytle II, the founder of Cincinnati, Ohio, owned a large amount of land just below the Falls of the Ohio and in 1811 laid out the settlement of Portland. He planned to sell the lots to finance his plan to build a canal around the Falls. Lytle authorized Joshua Barclay and Alexander Ralston to design the town, which featured a Northeast to Southwest street grid. The original settlement was between what is now 36th and 33rd Street along the Ohio River, which included a large wharf. The settlement quickly grew to the east in a Northwest to Southeast street grid, which noticeably contrasts to the East-West grid of adjacent areas of Louisville. The advent of steamboats on the Mississippi occurred simultaneously with Portland's development, allowing the Ohio River to be used as a major freight shipping route in what was then the American Frontier. Portland was located just downstream from the only natural obstacle on the Ohio River, so all large boats traveling on the Ohio had to stop to move their freight by land around the Falls and reload them on another boat. With a captive audience and a need for freight hauling, Portland's Wharf flourished as numerous taverns, warehouses, and shipyards were built. By 1814 French immigrants from Alsace began populating the town. An 1863 mansion built for Enoch Lockhart, the first superintendent of the Louisville and Portland Canal. It was later used at the corporate offices of the Ky. & Ind. Terminal Railroad Co. By 1817 the original street grid had run out of room and was expanded to 40th Street on the west and 13th Street on the east in 1817 to facilitate the additional growth. It quickly became a rival of Louisville and the nearer-by settlement of Shippingport. The three were first connected by road in 1818. This road, initially called the Louisville & Portland Turnpike, became Portland Avenue. An important early home was the Squire Earick house (719 N. 34th Street), which was home of the first magistrate, and also used as the settlement's courthouse and jail. Another landmark was the Church of Our Lady now Good Shepherd Catholic Church, started in 1839 and the third building, built in 1873, still standing in 2010. From 1826 to 1833, the Louisville and Portland Canal was built around the Falls, causing many of the warehouses and shipyards to close and shifting economic power on the Falls to nearby Louisville, although Portland would continue to grow as many French and Irish immigrants moved there. (The demonym \\"Hoosier\\" given to residents of Indiana since the early 1830s has been linked to the construction of the canal, allegedly because a contractor named Samuel Hoosier preferred Indiana workers over those from Kentucky, and they were therefore dubbed as \\"Hoosier's Men.\\") It was incorporated in 1834, but then annexed by Louisville in 1837 after a compromise by which the canal would be widened to handle larger ships but the new rail line going from Lexington to the Ohio River would go to Portland's wharf instead of Louisville's. However, after the new line collapsed into bankruptcy in 1840 having only reached as far as Louisville, Portlanders voted in 1842 to become independent again, although ten years later the area was annexed a second time. The original route of the Louisville and Portland Canal, prior to widenings in 1872, 1928, 1962, and 2008. Although now just a neighborhood of the much larger Louisville, Portland would continue to flourish as a working class community through the 1930s, with residents working in many of the nearby factories. The largest Ohio River flood in recorded history occurred in 1937 and inundated all of Portland, with areas closest to the river nearly being wiped out. Plans began immediately to protect the area with a flood wall, but World War II occupied the priority of the government's engineers. Just eight years later in 1945 the second largest flood in Louisville's history occurred. In its aftermath all areas of Portland nearest to the river were razed, including the Portland Wharf, and a gigantic flood wall was built to a height three feet above the level of the 1937 flood. Both floods had driven many middle-class families from the area. Despite the loss of many of area's oldest buildings, portions of the neighborhood away from the flood wall were largely untouched by urban renewal, and retain a great number of pre-Civil War buildings. Although many older mansions exist in Portland, the vast majority of homes built in the area were shotgun houses. Portland today Historic homes on Northwestern Parkway As of 2015, the estimated population of Portland is 11,810. Portland has historically been home to a diverse population, including one of the earliest settlements of free, property-holding black people who co-existed as 10-15% of Portland's resident population (according to Louisville historian Rick Bell). Archives of this community are part of the collection at Portland Museum, (2308 Portland Ave), though the museum is undergoing a massive effort to make these resources readily available to the public. Changes over time in the neighborhood are largely attributed to white flight and the devastating Ohio River floods of 1937 and 1945. The Kentucky Lottery Headquarters in Portland In 2006, Portland was named by First Lady Laura Bush to be a Preserve America community. Communities designated through the program are allowed to use the Preserve America logo on signs and promotional materials and are eligible to apply for grants that will be administered by the U.S. Department of the Interior. There are several futures plans to help revive parts of Portland, including the creation of a museum and arts district in the Portland Warehouse District (which sits just 2 blocks from Louisville's Museum Row), and opening several historic buildings to the public. There are also plans for the creation of several large parks along the Portland Waterfront. When complete, the Portland Wharf Park will bear a striking resemblance to Downtown Louisville's Waterfront Park. There are also plans to great a \\"Great Lawn West\\" just west of the 9th Street/I-64 interchange. Attractions and historic sites The Portland Museum details the area's history Portland is home to a large number of Louisville's most prominent historic landmarks and a large percent of the city's pre Civil War buildings. Although currently not open to the public, the United States Marine Hospital of Louisville is considered one of the most architecturally important historic sites in the US. Completed in 1847, it is widely considered the best remaining antebellum era hospital in the US and is the only remaining of the seven original hospitals built in the mid-19th century by the Marine Hospital Service. After sitting abandoned for several decades, the building's exterior has been fully restored to match its appearance in 1899, with the inside still being restored. Portland is also home to the world's largest 'bat' There are many other 19th century landmarks in Portland, including the Notre Dame du Port Church (1841) (now Good Shepherd Church), the Montgomery Street School (1852) and numerous privately owned mansion houses, many of which were built by steamboat captains. The entire Portland Historic District is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. In 1996 Louisville's first bike trail was opened along Portland's waterfront. The seven mile long River Walk has since been extending 20 miles to the Farnsley Morman Landing near Valley Station and is going to be part of a 110-mile long bike trail encircling Louisville. The River Walk also links Portland directly to Downtown Louisville and Shawnee Park. The Portland Library serves the neighborhood area. In an attempt to revitalize the community, the Table, a pay-what-you-can restaurant, was started November 2015. The Table since then has exploded and was featured on food networks Diners Drive in and Dives show. The Table has provided gourmet, nourishing food for homeless people and encourages working instead of handouts. Demographics As of 2000, the population of Portland was 11,811, of which 71.7% are white, 24.5% are black, 3.1% are listed as other, and 0.8% are Hispanic. College graduates are 3.3%, people without a high school degree are 46.3%. Females are 51.9% of the population, males are 48.1%. Households making less than $15,000 a year are 38.7%. Originally settled by French and Irish immigrants, since WWII most of the original immigrant families left for the South End of Louisville, and Portland is now mostly populated by displaced rural Kentuckians of British Isles heritage. In 2000 less than 1% of Portlanders claimed French ancestry and only 10% claimed Irish ancestry. Over 20% of Portlanders claimed 'American' ancestry, which is the most common ancestry in the rural South. Education Portland has a lending library, a branch of the Louisville Free Public Library.

Gorton's also has a North American food service business which sells to fast-food restaurants such as McDonald's, and an industrial coating ingredients operation. It has been headquartered in Gloucester, Massachusetts, since 1849. History The company traces its roots to a fishery called John Pew & Sons. William Pew, son of John Pew, picked up fishing after serving as a Colonial soldier in the French and Indian War. While most people moved West after the war, Pew turned eastward and arrived in Gloucester, Massachusetts, in 1755. The father-and-son fishery business emerged as an official commercial company, John Pew & Sons, in 1849. When nearby Rockport's chief industry, the Annisquam Cotton Mill, burned down, Slade Gorton, the mill's superintendent, was out of a job. At his wife's urging, he began a fishing business in 1874 known as Slade Gorton & Company, and began to pack and sell salt codfish and mackerel in small kegs. This company was the first to package salt-dried fish in barrels. In 1899, the company patented the \\"Original Gorton Fish Cake\\". In 1905, the Slade Gorton Company adopted the fisherman at the helm of a schooner (the \\"Man at the Wheel\\") as the company trademark. Today, he is known as the Gorton's Fisherman. In 1906, Slade Gorton & Company, John Pew & Sons, and two other Gloucester fisheries merged into the Gorton-Pew Fisheries. They made Gorton's codfish cakes a household name in New England. The company went into the fish-freezing business in the early 1930s. In 1949, Gorton-Pew made headlines when it drove the first refrigerator trailer truck shipment of frozen fish from Gloucester to San Francisco‚Äîa trip that took eight days. In 1953, the company was the first to introduce a frozen ready-to-cook fish stick, which won the Parents magazine Seal of Approval. In 1957, Gorton-Pew Fisheries name was changed to Gorton's of Gloucester; in 1965, it became The Gorton Corporation, and it is now known as Gorton's. In 1968, Gorton's merged with General Mills, Inc., as a wholly owned subsidiary. In May 1995, Unilever bought Gorton's from General Mills. In August 2001, Unilever sold Gorton's and BlueWater Seafoods to Nippon Suisan (USA), Inc., a subsidiary of Nippon Suisan Kaisha, Ltd., for $175 million in cash. Gorton's came under attack from three environmentalist and animal-rights groups ‚Äî the Environmental Investigation Agency, The Humane Society of the United States (HSUS) and Greenpeace ‚Äî due to its parent company's involvement in whaling in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary. These groups hoped that international companies owned by Nippon Suisan Kaisha would persuade their parent company to stop supporting whaling if they were put under enough pressure. Eventually, Nippon Suisan Kaisha agreed to divest its ownership in the company that owned the whaling fleet. Greenpeace hailed this as a victory, and the boycott of Gorton's ended.

It is centred on Saint Laurent Boulevard between Jean Talon Street and St. Zotique Street in the borough of Rosemont‚ÄìLa Petite-Patrie, south of Villeray and Jarry Park. Little Italy is home to Italian Canadian-owned shops and restaurants, the Jean-Talon Market, as well as the Church of the Madonna della Difesa, built by Italian immigrants from the Campobasso area in Molise to commemorate the apparition of the Virgin Mary in La Difesa, an area of Campobasso. Montreal has the second largest Italian population in Canada after Toronto. There are 260,345 people of Italian ancestry living within the Greater Montreal Area. History A grocery store in Little Italy, 1910s Saint Laurent Boulevard in Little Italy. Sign of Mirador, a restaurant in Montreal owned by an Italian immigrant, July 1948 The Italian presence in Quebec dates to the seventeenth century, when Italians from the Piedmont region served in the Carignan-Sali√®res Regiment. There were also a few traders and artisans who came mainly from northern Italy. In the nineteenth century, larger scale Italian immigration began to develop. These immigrants were predominantly male farmers from the southern regions. These immigrants, mostly temporary, worked in railways, mines and lumber camps. In the early twentieth century, the composition of immigrants began to change. It was then characterized by permanent immigrants and family reunification. The majority of immigrants worked in the construction and maintenance of railways (Canadian Pacific Railway and Grand Trunk Railway). Soon they built their own churches and institutions such as the magnificent Church of the Madonna della Difesa. The largest wave of Italian immigrants arrived with the end of World War II. Between 1946 and 1960, thousands of Italian workers and peasants landed in the Port of Montreal or in the Port of Halifax (famously Pier 21) and proceeded on to Montreal by train (with a majority admitted under the family reunification). A large part of them settled around the Jean Talon Market and the Church of Madonna della Difesa, giving birth to Little Italy. From 1961 to 1975, immigration had diversified and was characterized by a high proportion of workers in manufacturing and construction. It was after the 1970s that a sharp decline in immigration from Italy occurred. Church of the Madonna della Difesa Church of the Madonna della Difesa, a National Historic Site. The Church of the Madonna della Difesa () was designated as a National Historic Site of Canada in 2002. Since its construction in 1918, this church has been closely associated with the Italian community in Montreal. The parish was established in the 1860s. The building and its interior decoration, were made in stages by artist Guido Nincheri, whose work was influenced by the structure of a typical Italian parish church from the Renaissance era. The walls and ceilings are painted in bright coloured frescos. Parks * Dante Park is a park in Little Italy, bordered by Dante Street to the north, de Gaspe Street to the west, and Alma Street to the east. The park was inaugurated on June 26, 1963 to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the predominantly Italian Canadian parish of the Church of the Madonna della Difesa. It is located opposite the church. Jean-Talon Market The Jean- Talon Market (known locally as the Mercato) is a public market located in the heart of the Little Italy. This market opened in 1933 and was named after Jean Talon, the second Intendant of New France. It went through numerous renovations in the early 2000s, resulting in most of the market being sheltered, and there is also underground parking. The main entrance was opened in the summer of 2005.

The entrance and the grounds run along a part of C√¥te-des- Neiges Road and up the slopes of Mount Royal. Notre Dame des Neiges Cemetery is the largest cemetery in Canada and the third-largest in North America. History and description Created on property purchased from Dr. Pierre Beaubien, the new cemetery was a response to growing demand at a time when the old Saint-Antoine Cemetery (near present-day Dorchester Square) had become too small to serve Montreal's rapidly increasing population. Founded in 1854 as a garden cemetery in the French style, it was designed by landscape architect Henri-Maurice Perreault, who studied rural cemeteries in Boston and New York. On May 29, 1855, thirty-five-year-old Jane Gilroy McCready, wife of Thomas McCready, then a Montreal municipal councillor, was the first person to be buried in the new cemetery. Notre Dame des Neiges is the largest cemetery in Canada with more than 55 kilometres of lanes and one million people interred.ArcUser Magazine, \\"Navigating Canada's Largest Cemetery\\", Summer 2009, p. 27 The Notre Dame des Neiges Cemetery site has more than 65,000 monuments and 71 family vaults. The cemetery originally served Roman Catholics and rural French Canadians. Italian, Portuguese, Japanese, Orthodox Greek, Polish, Ukrainian and Huron are also represented, indicated in many instances by ethnic motifs on gravestones. The cemetery is adjacent to the Mount Royal Cemetery, a predominantly English-speaking and originally Protestant adjacent burial ground, the Shaar Hashomayim Cemetery, an Ashkenazi Jewish burial ground and Temple Emanu-El Cemetery a Reform Judaism burial ground. These four abutting cemeteries on the slopes of Mount Royal contain a total of 1.5 million burials. \\"La Piet√† Mausoleum\\" contains a life-sized marble reproduction of Michelangelo's Piet√† sculpture (original located in St. Peter's Basilica at the Vatican). Notre Dame des Neiges Cemetery was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1998 and plaqued in 2004. No burials or cremations took place between May 16, 2007, and September 11, 2007, because of a labour strike. The interments of more than 300 bodies were affected.CBC, story about labour dispute In addition, its uncut, unkempt grass became a symbol of the labour dispute. Due to its vast size, locating a specific grave can be difficult. As a result, the cemetery now offers a computerized mapping service that allows visitors to quickly and accurately locate graves. It can be accessed at the cemetery using a touch screen display or via the Internet. War graves The only opening in the fence between the Notre Dame des Neiges and Mount Royal cemeteries is where two adjoining military sections are. Shortly after World War I, to emphasize the comradeship and uniformity of sacrifice of Protestant and Catholic soldiers, the Imperial War Graves Commission insisted on an open passage between the two plots and the Cross of Sacrifice was erected. There are 445 identified Commonwealth service war grave burials commemorated here, 252 from World War I and 215 from World War II. Those whose graves could not be individually marked are named on bronze plaques attached to the Cross of Sacrifice. The Quebec Memorial on the National Field of Honour at Pointe-Claire lists 24 servicemen buried here, whose graves could no longer be marked or maintained, as alternative commemorations. New mausoleums Every mausoleum in Notre Dame des Neiges Cemetery contains multiple crypts, clearly identified, as well as columbaria with glass or marble niches for one or more urns. The first mausoleum, Notre Dame, dedicated to the Blessed Virgin Mary, was built in 1978. The others were added gradually in the years that followed: John-Paul II (1980), Saint-Francis (1982), Marguerite-Bourgeoys (1983), The Piet√† (1985), Saints Peter and Paul (1989), Sainte Clare of Assisi (1994), the two-storey Saint Marguerite d‚ÄôYouville (1996) and most recently, Esther-Blondin (2007).

Cross-priming, the result of this process, describes the stimulation of naive cytotoxic CD8+ T cells into activated cytotoxic CD8+ T cells. This process is necessary for immunity against most tumors and viruses that do not readily infect antigen-presenting cells, but rather intracellular tumors and viruses that infect peripheral tissue cells. Cross presentation is also required for the induction of cytotoxic immunity by vaccination with protein antigens, for example, tumour vaccination. Cross- presentation is of particular importance, because it permits the presentation of exogenous antigens, which are normally presented by MHC II on the surface of dendritic cells, to also be presented through the MHC I pathway. The MHC I pathway is normally used to present endogenous antigens that have infected a particular cell. However, cross presenting cells are able to utilize the MHC I pathway in order to remain uninfected, while still triggering an adaptive immune response of activated cytotoxic CD8+ T cells against infected peripheral tissue cells. History The first evidence of cross-presentation was reported in 1976 by Michael J. Bevan after injection of grafted cells carrying foreign minor histocompatibility (MHC) molecules. This resulted in a CD8+ T cell response induced by antigen-presenting cells of the recipient against the foreign MHC cells. Because of this, Bevan implied that these antigen presenting cells must have engulfed and cross presented these foreign MHC cells to host cytotoxic CD8+ cells, thus triggering an adaptive immune response against the grafted tissue. This observation was termed \\"cross- priming\\". Later, there had been much controversy about cross-presentation, which now is believed to have been due to particularities and limitations of some experimental systems used. Cross-presenting cells The primary and most efficient cross-presenting cells are dendritic cells, though macrophages, B lymphocytes and sinusoidal endothelial cells have also been observed to cross present antigens in vivo and in vitro. However, in vivo dendritic cells have been found to be the most efficient and common antigen presenting cells to cross present antigens in MHC I molecules. There are two dendritic cells subtypes; plasmacytoid (pDC) and myeloid (mDC) dendritic cells. pDCs are found within the blood and are able to cross present antigens directly or from neighboring apoptotic cells, but the main physiological significance of pDCs is the secretion of type I IFN in response to bacterial infections. mDCs are categorized as migratory DCs, resident DCs, Langerhans cells, and inflammatory dendritic cells. All mDCs have specialized functions and secretory factors, but they are all still able to cross present antigens in order to activate cytotoxic CD8+ T cells. There are many factors that determine cross presentation function such as antigen uptake and processing mechanism, as well as environmental signals and activation of cross presenting dendritic cells. The activation of cross presenting dendritic cells is dependent on stimulation by CD4+ T helper cells. The co-stimulatory molecule CD40/CD40L along with the danger presence of an exogenous antigen are catalysts for dendritic cell licensing, and thus the cross presentation and activation of naive CD8+ cytotoxic T cells. Vacuolar and cytosolic diversion In addition to solid structure uptake, dendritic cell phagocytosis simultaneously modifies the kinetics of endosomal trafficking and maturation. As a consequence, external soluble antigens are targeted into the MHC class I cross-presentation pathway instead of the MHC Class II pathway.[18]However, there is still uncertainty in regard to a mechanistic pathway for cross presentation within an antigen presenting cell. Currently, there are two main pathways proposed, cytosolic and vacuolar. The vacuolar pathway is initiated through the endocytosis of an extracellular antigen by a dendritic cell. Endocytosis results in the formation of a phagocytic vesicle, where an increasingly acidic environment along with the activation of enzymes such as lysosomal proteases triggers the degradation of antigen into peptides. The peptides can then be loaded onto MHC I binding grooves within the phagosome. It is unclear whether the MHC I molecule is being exported from the endoplasmic reticulum before peptide loading, or is being recycled from the cell membrane prior to peptide loading. Once the exogenous antigen peptide is loaded onto the MHC class I molecule, the complex is exported to the cell surface for antigen cross presentation presentation. There is also evidence that suggest that cross-presentation requires a separate pathway in a proportion of CD8(+) dendritic cells that are able to cross-present.[20] This pathway is called the cytosolic diversion pathway. Similarly to the vacuolar pathway, antigens are taken into the cell through endocytosis. Antigen proteins are transported out of this compartment into the cytoplasm by unknown mechanisms. Within the cytoplasm, exogenous antigens are processed by the proteasome and degraded into peptides. These processed peptides can either be transported by the TAP transporter into the endoplasmic reticulum,[14][16] or back into the same endosome for loading onto MHC class I complexes,[17]. It is believed that MHC I loading occurs both in the ER as well as phagocytic vesicles such as an endosome in the cytosolic pathway. For MHC class I loading within the Endoplasmic Reticulum, exogenous antigen peptides are loaded onto MHC class I molecules with the help of the peptide loading complex and chaperone proteins such as beta-2 microglobulin, ERAP, tapapsin, and calreticulin. After antigen peptide loading, the MHC molecule is transported out of the ER, through the Golgi complex, and then onto the cell surface for cross presentation. It appears that both pathways are able to occur within an antigen presenting cell, and may be influenced by environmental factors such as proteasome and phagocytic inhibitors.  Relevance for immunity  Cross-presentation has been shown to play a role in the immune defense against many viruses (herpesvirus, influenzavirus, CMV, EBV, SIV, papillomavirus, and others), bacteria (listeria, salmonella, E. coli, M. tuberculosis, and others) and tumors (brain, pancreas, melanoma, leukemia, and others). Even though many viruses can inhibit and degrade dendritic cell activity, cross-presenting dendritic cells that are unaffected by the virus are able to intake the infected peripheral cell and still cross present the exogenous antigen to cytotoxic T cells. The action of cross priming can bolster immunity against antigens that target intracellular peripheral tissues that are unable to be mediated by antibodies produced through B cells. Also, cross-priming avoids viral immune evasion strategies, such as suppression of antigen processing. Consequently, immune responses against viruses that are able to do so, such as herpes viruses, are largely dependent on cross-presentation for a successful immune response. Overall, cross presentation aids in facilitating an adaptive immune response against intracellular viruses and tumor cells. Dendritic cell-dependent cross- presentation also has implications for cancer immunotherapy vaccines. The injection of anti-tumor specific vaccines can be targeted to specific dendritic cell subsets within peripheral skin tissues, such a migratory dendritic cells and langerin cells. After vaccine induced activation, dendritic cells are able to migrate to lymph nodes and activate CD4+ T helper cells as well as cross prime CD8+ T cytotoxic cells. This mass generation of activated tumor specific CD8+ T cells increases anti-tumor immunity, and is also able to overcome many of the immune suppressive effects of tumor cells. Relevance for immune tolerance Cross-presenting dendritic cells have a significant impact on the promotion of central and peripheral immune tolerance. In central tolerance, dendritic cells are present within the thymus, or the location of T cell development and maturation. Thymic dendritic cells can intake dead medullary thymic epithelial cells, and cross present \\"self\\" peptides on MHC class I as a negative selection check on cytotoxic T cells that have a high affinity for self peptides. Presentation of tissue specific antigens is initiated by medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTEC), but is reinforced by thymic dendritic cells after expression of AIRE and engulfment of mTECs. Although the function of dendritic cells in central tolerance is still relatively unknown, it appears that thymic dendritic cells act as a complement to mTECs during negative selection of T cells. In regard to peripheral tolerance, peripheral tissue resting dendritic cells are able to promote self tolerance against cytotoxic T cells that have an affinity for self peptides. They can present tissue specific antigens within the lymph node in order to regulate T cytotoxic cells from initiating an adaptive immune response, as well as regulate T cytotoxic cells that have a high affinity for self tissues, but were still able to escape central tolerance. Cross- presenting DCs are able to induce anergy, apoptosis, or T regulatory states for high self affinity T cytotoxic cells. This has large implications for defense against auto immune disorders and regulation of self specific cytotoxic T cells.

It operated from Chicago to Los Angeles as a section of the California Zephyr, serving Los Angeles via Salt Lake City; Ogden, Utah; and Las Vegas. History UP #932, an EMD E8, leading the City of Los Angeles into Union Station in Los Angeles in March 1971, just prior to discontinuation Two Desert Wind trains meet on the east side of Cajon Pass in 1981 In the late 1960s, prior to the creation of Amtrak, the Union Pacific Railroad combined its long-distance streamliners between Chicago, Kansas City, and the West Coast into a single massive train dubbed by critics the \\"City of Everywhere\\". This train included the Challenger, the City of Denver, the City of Kansas City, the City of Los Angeles, the City of Portland, and the City of San Francisco. At one point, it ran up to 27 cars. The City of Los Angeles separated from this behemoth at Ogden, Utah, to serve Los Angeles via Las Vegas. Of these, Amtrak retained portions of the City of Kansas City and the City of San Francisco for its Chicago ‚Äì San Francisco service, which it named the San Francisco Zephyr. Regular service to Las Vegas ended in the early morning hours of May 2, 1971, when the westbound City of Los Angeles made its last station stop on its final trip to its namesake city. Throughout the 1970s, there were brief attempts to revive service to Las Vegas in the form of charters and excursions, plus one regularly scheduled weekend-only train called the Las Vegas Limited, which ran for four months in 1976. Matters came to a head in 1979, as Amtrak faced significant political pressure to cut costs and reduce the size of its national network. Senator Howard Cannon (D-Nevada) pushed Amtrak hard to create a train which served Las Vegas, and Amtrak considered replacing the Southwest Limited, its existing Chicago ‚Äì Los Angeles train, with such a service. In the end, the Southwest Limited remained and Amtrak introduced the Desert Wind, which made its first run on October 28, 1979. The original Desert Wind was a day train with Amfleet equipment. The northbound train left Los Angeles mid-day and arrived in Ogden the following morning to connect with the eastbound San Francisco Zephyr. The southbound departed Ogden in the middle of the night after the arrival of the westbound San Francisco Zephyr from Chicago and arrived in Los Angeles in late afternoon. The journey took eighteen hours. Beginning in 1980, the Desert Wind exchanged a Chicago ‚Äì Los Angeles through coach with the San Francisco Zephyr at Ogden; this service expanded in 1982 to include a sleeping car. After the renamed and rerouted California Zephyr began using the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad main line in 1983, the Desert Wind began connecting with the Zephyr at Salt Lake City. Later, the Desert Wind and the Seattle-bound Pioneer would operate together with the California Zephyr from Chicago to Salt Lake City, where the trains separated. This created a train of 16 Superliner cars running from Chicago to Utah, the longest that Amtrak had ever operated aside from the Auto Train. With Amtrak needing at least four locomotives to pull this massive train through the Rockies, the Pioneer began splitting off at Denver in 1991, while the Desert Wind continued to split from the Zephyr at Salt Lake City. The Desert Wind was discontinued on May 12, 1997, a victim of Amtrak's recurring budget cuts that also eliminated the Pioneer days earlier. Train service was replaced with a Los Angeles ‚Äì Las Vegas Thruway Motorcoach service. At that time, rail service between Los Angeles and Las Vegas took 7 hours 15 minutes. =Proposed restoration= There are several private, competing plans to restore rail service from Los Angeles to Las Vegas, including the high-speed Brightline West and the more conventional X Train and Z-Train. A Los Angeles ‚Äì Las Vegas route run by Amtrak nearly entered service in 2000. A Talgo VII trainset was bought for the service in 1999; when it was not implemented, the trainset was later used on the Amtrak Cascades service. Also, as of 2011, new routes were being considered, including routes using the same track as the original Desert Wind, and routes using the Metrolink San Bernardino Line. Lack of funding and congestion through the Cajon Pass remained significant obstacles. More recent proposals using high-speed rail have suggested routing through Victorville and connecting with California's high-speed rail project in Palmdale,Las Vegas rail service plans have seen starts, stops assuming the California project can secure funding for a connection from Bakersfield to Los Angeles. The route has some merit for Amtrak, as the July 2010 issue of Trains listed the route as one to be restored in conjunction with upgrading the equipment on the California Zephyr.

He was a member of the Significs Group.  Biography  Beth was born in Almelo, a small town in the eastern Netherlands. His father had studied mathematics and physics at the University of Amsterdam, where he had been awarded a Ph.D. Evert Beth studied the same subjects at Utrecht University, but then also studied philosophy and psychology. His 1935 Ph.D. was in philosophy. In 1946, he became professor of logic and the foundations of mathematics in Amsterdam. Apart from two brief interruptions - a stint in 1951 as a research assistant to Alfred Tarski, and in 1957 as a visiting professor at Johns Hopkins University - he held the post in Amsterdam continuously until his death in 1964. His was the first academic post in his country in logic and the foundations of mathematics, and during this time he contributed actively to international cooperation in establishing logic as an academic discipline. In 1953 he became member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences. He died in Amsterdam.

Gentzen's natural deduction and sequent calculus, or even J. Alan Robinson's resolution and Hilbert's axiomatic systems. It is considered by many to be intuitively simple, particularly for students not acquainted with the study of logic (Wilfrid Hodges for example presents semantic tableaux in his introductory textbook, Logic, and Melvin Fitting does the same in his presentation of first-order logic for computer scientists, First-order logic and automated theorem proving). One starts out with the intention of proving that a certain set \\\\Gamma \\\\, of formulae imply another formula \\\\varphi\\\\, , given a set of rules determined by the semantics of the formulae's connectives (and quantifiers, in first-order logic). The method is to assume the concurrent truth of every member of \\\\Gamma \\\\, and of eg \\\\varphi (the negation of \\\\varphi\\\\, ), and then to apply the rules to branch this list into a tree-like structure of (simpler) formulae until every possible branch contains a contradiction. At this point it will have been established that \\\\Gamma \\\\cup \\\\\\\\{ eg \\\\varphi \\\\\\\\} is inconsistent, and thus that the formulae of \\\\Gamma\\\\, together imply \\\\varphi \\\\,. = Beth models = These are a class of relational models for non-classical logic (cf.

A longtime advocate of replacing the internal combustion engine, in 1979 Ballard founded what would become Ballard Power Systems to develop commercial applications of the proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEM). Acknowledged worldwide as the father of the fuel cell industry, Time named him a \\"Hero for the Planet\\" in 1999.Margot Hornblower, \\"Geoffrey Ballard: In a Hurry to Prove the \\"Pistonheads\\" Wrong\\" , Time Magazine, 8 March 1999 Early life and education Ballard was born in Niagara Falls, Ontario, to Jessie Marguerite Mildred of the Rowntree's family in York and Archibald Hall Ballard of Staten Island, New York. His father studied electrochemical engineering at the University of Toronto and later specialized in the area of radiation. He was working at Carborundum Corporation when the lab director fell overboard from a boat during a party and was washed over Niagara Falls, so Archibald Ballard was promoted to lab director at a relatively young age in his mid-40s. He spent most of World War II at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, working on the atomic bomb.Koppel, pp. 3-4 After high school in Niagara Falls, Ballard attended Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario, studying geological engineering. Here he met his future wife, Shelagh, and they married and graduated the same year, in 1956. Ballard secured a position at Shell Oil in Alberta, leading exploration teams on horseback. He left Shell for Mobil Oil and travelled around the world on exploration trips. During these trips his advice was often ignored as he was \\"only\\" a BSc (difficult enough in 1950s), and after several such incidents he decided to leave industry and pursue a doctorate in earth and planetary sciences from Washington University in St. Louis.Patricia Sullivan, \\"Obituaries: Geoffrey Ballard, 76; Developed Hydrogen Fuel Cells\\", Washington Post, 7 August 2008, p. B05 After earning his PhD in 1963, Ballard worked as a civilian for the U.S. Army, specializing in microwave communications and studying how to hide refueling tanks under the ice in Greenland. Ballard was working for the Army at Fort Huachuca in Arizona in 1973 when the oil crisis hit. The U.S. government responded by establishing the U.S. Federal Energy Conservation Research office, and started looking for someone to run it. Given his background running projects, the Army seconded him to become the office's director, initially for six months.Koppel, p. 7 He quickly grew disillusioned with the political system. \\"Energy systems are notorious for their long gestation periods, often twenty years or longer, [but] there had to be a pay- off in a product within five to seven years in order to justify the public money being put in. There are political cycles involving re-election, so the politicians didn't want to put money into systems that were going to come to fruition in some other generation. You sent out the plans, and they hacked and cut at them.\\"Koppel, p. 8 When the contract ran out, he decided to quit and strike out on his own. American Energizer One of the studies he had been involved in at the Conservation Research office was on electric cars powered by conventional lead-acid batteries. None of these struck him as practical, but he was convinced that electric traction was the future. He told Discover Magazine in a 2002 interview that \\"My goal from the very beginning was replacing the internal combustion engine -- just getting that off the streets.\\" Ballard had earlier met Ralph Schwartz in Arizona, who introduced him to the idea of using lithium batteries in place of lead-acid, as they would be much lighter. However, at the time, lithium batteries were not able to be recharged. Schwartz convinced Ballard that they should study the problem, and Ballard cashed in his pension to buy a portion of their new joint venture, American Energizer.Koppel, p. 14 Schwartz and Ballard were introduced to Keith Prater at the University of Texas chemistry department, and sold him on the idea of developing a new rechargeable lithium battery technology with them. Prater was able to quickly determine that no one knew what the product of the lithium-salt reactions in existing batteries were, and guessed that it was lithium dithionite, which he was able to synthesize. Working in a trailer, Ballard and Schwartz built a simple battery and Prater brought a sample of the lithium dithionite, and when they were placed together and charged, a weak current was produced. After further development the system was able to be recharged about a dozen times. With the technology looking like it could be made into a commercial enterprise, Ballard contacted an acquaintance, John Horton, to provide further backing. Horton was in the process of re-fitting the Ben Franklin (PX-15) in North Vancouver for oil exploration, and Ballard convinced him that their new battery would be a perfect fit.Koppel, p. 17 Horton agreed to provide several thousand dollars a month in funding. With this in place, Ballard purchased an abandoned motel in Arizona for $2,000 and set about turning it into a lab. By 1977 the batteries were coming along, and Ballard and Prater were shuttling back and forth between Arizona and Vancouver. Ballard had always wanted to return to Canada, so Schwartz sold his interest in the battery technology to Ballard for $1, while Ballard sold his interest in Schwartz's latest venture, a mechanical anti-lock braking system for the same $1. In 1979 Ballard moved to Vancouver and became president and CEO of Ultra Energy.Koppel, p. 23 In Canada, Ultra Energy operated out of the same hangar where Horton was re-fitting his submarine. By the mid-1970s the refit was complete, with no battery in site, and Horton dropped his support for the battery project. After obtaining some private bridge financing, they won a contract for a non-rechargeable lithium battery with a shelf life of 10 years for the fire detector company, Firenetics.Koppel, p. 28 After about a year the battery was ready and production was going to be started in Hong Kong, when, to Ultra's surprise, Firenetics filed for bankruptcy after a long lawsuit with General Electric. Ultra Energy was insolvent. Ballard Power Systems The main Ultra Energy team immediately re-formed as Ballard Research, taking over offices directly across the street from the Ultra ones. Ballard started calling old contacts in the oil industry, looking for companies that might be interested in diversifying their energy holdings. Shell was interested and kept the company afloat for a time, but dropped their interest when one of the minority shareholders held out. In mid-1981, Amoco decided to take over the rechargeable side of the company, and paid off most of the company's local debts.Koppel, p. 24 Now solvent, the company quickly started looking for applications for their technology, and won contracts with the Canadian Forces to further develop their single-use long-life battery. This led to a successful production line producing thousands of cells for the U.S. and Canadian militaries. While the single-use design was successful, the rechargeable version never matured. In 1983, Ballard, Prater and Paul Howard started looking for new ideas for their development side to work on as the funds for the battery project dried up. Among a variety of ideas were a number of attempts to find government funding, which eventually led them to a Department of National Defense (DND) request for proposals for bids to produce a low-cost solid polymer fuel cell. Now known as PEM's, these cells had only been used commercially in Project Gemini and a few other space probes, and General Electric gave up on the technology when NASA moved onto other fuel cell designs for Project Apollo and the Space Shuttle. Although a number of attempts had been made to lower the high cost of PEM cells since then, none had been commercially successful. At the time, no one in the company had any direct experience with fuel cells, and Ballard himself reputedly stated \\"What's a fuel cell?\\" when the topic was first brought up.Innovation, \\"Improving the Mousetrap\\" Prater, with an extensive electrochemical background, flew to the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, where limited PEM research was still being carried out. He managed to gather a small number of parts from test cells that would provide an early start. Meanwhile, Ballard sent teams to Ottawa to better understand the contract. Armed with this information from both sources, they won the $500,000 contract, which called for them to provide three prototype cells that produced between 50 and 150 watts and be ready in 28 months. After meeting the requirements, they won a follow-up contract, and it was during this project, in 1986, when they reached a milestone of producing four times as much energy per unit volume as any previous fuel cell.Innovation, \\"The Miracle\\" In 1987 Ballard won a contract with Perry Oceanographics to provide fuel cells for their small submersibles. After some difficulties in developing a stack of the required 2 kW size using their then-current\\" Mark IV\\" cell design, the system was successfully installed and became one of the first commercial fuel cell system since the 1960s. An upgrade to the \\"Mark V\\" cell design dramatically improved performance, providing 4.1 kW from a stack the same size as the original 2 kW model. A contract with the Royal Navy soon followed, and although the resulting cells were not used as the Royal Navy decided to go all-nuclear, a research contract allowed the company to continue improving the cells. Development from these engineering samples to real-world products was going to be long and expensive. Although the battery line continued to do well, the profits it generated were not enough to run the company as a whole. Ballard started looking for new capital, and found Mike Brown, a founder of the Vancouver-based Ventures West venture capital company. Ventures West provided several rounds of funding, and Brown suggested that if the company wanted to be successful it was going to need new leadership who was familiar with dealing with large companies. Although the founders found it difficult to accept a stranger into their midst, they were eventually won over and Firoz Rasul became the new CEO. Rasul immediately instituted a development plan with a timeline of goals that had to be met and go/no-go milestones.Innovation, \\"Preparing Ballard for Commercialization of its Fuel Cell Technology\\" The company was re-organized, spinning off the battery side to BTC Engineering, while the fuel cell side became Ballard Technologies Corp. Feeling the technology was ready for commercial use, in 1989 Ballard raised $4 million in public money from the British Columbia government to build a fuel cell powered bus, introducing it at Science World in 1993. He took the bus to energy fairs around the world, and Daimler-Chrysler and Ford invested $750 million to buy a one-third stake in the newly public Ballard Power Systems. Ballard told Time in 1999 that the fuel-cell cars should become economical by 2010 and \\"the internal combustion engine will go the way of the horse. It will be a curiosity to my grandchildren.\\" Taking the technology from laboratory to the road proved very difficult, and after years of development and many rounds of additional funding, Ballard left active management in 1998. The automotive power division was sold to Daimler-Chrysler and Ford in 2008 for $96.6 million, and Daimler currently operates a small number of fuel cell busses in Hamburg, United States, Japan and Singapore. Ballard Power Systems continues its work on PEMFC's for stationary power use and backup systems. After Ballard After leaving full-time management at Ballard Power Systems, in 2000 Ballard formed General Hydrogen,Canadian Press newswire, \\"Geoffrey Ballard, founder of fuel-cell firm Ballard Power Systems, dies\\", CBC.ca, 6 August 2008 which worked on the problems of generating and distributing hydrogen. In 2007, the company was sold to Plug Power for $10 million. In 1999 he was named by Time as 'Hero of the Planet'. In 2002 he was named 'Business Leader of the Year' from Scientific American.Tariq Malik, Fuel Cell Pioneer: An Interview with Geoffrey Ballard, Scientific American, 18 November 2002 He received the World Technology Network Award in Energy in 1999, and in Environment in 2000. He also received the Gutenberg International Environment prize in Sweden in 2000. He served as chair of the Canadian Hydrogen Association and as an Advisory Board member for the Institute of Transportation Studies, University of California. He died of complications from liver disease at Lions Gate Hospital in North Vancouver.

Life Koyr√© was born in the city of Taganrog, Russia on 29 August 1892 into a Jewish family. His original name was Alexandr Vladimirovich Koyre (–ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–∞–Ω–¥—Ä –í–ª–∞–¥–∏–º–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∏—á (–í–æ–ª—å—Ñ–æ–≤–∏—á) –ö–æ–π—Ä–µ). In Russia he studied in Tiflis, Rostov-on-Don and Odessa, before pursuing his studies abroad. At G√∂ttingen, Germany (1908‚Äì1911) he studied under Edmund Husserl and David Hilbert. Husserl did not approve of Koyr√©'s dissertation, whereupon Koyr√© left for Paris, to study at the Coll√®ge de France and the Sorbonne during the period 1912‚Äì1913 under Bergson, Brunschvicg, Lalande, Delbos and Picavet. Following Husserl's Cartesian Meditations, a series of lectures given in Paris in February 1929 (and one of the more important of Husserl's later works),These lectures were first published in a 1931 French translation by Gabrielle Peiffer and Emmanuel Levinas with advice from Koyr√©. Koyr√© met again with Husserl repeatedly. In 1914 he joined the French Foreign Legion as soon as the war broke out. In 1916 he volunteered for a Russian regiment fighting on the Russian front, following a cooperation agreement between the French and Russian governments. In 1922 Koyr√© completed his two State doctorate (then called Doctorat √®s lettres) theses.He had already earned a Doctorat d'universit√© from the Sorbonne.Alan D. Schrift (2006), Twentieth- Century French Philosophy: Key Themes And Thinkers, Blackwell Publishing, p. 146. The same year he started teaching in Paris at the √âcole pratique des hautes √©tudes (EPHE), and became a colleague of Alexandre Koj√®ve, who eventually replaced him as lecturer on Hegel. In 1932 the EPHE created a Department of History of Religious Thought in Modern Europe for him to chair. He retained this position until his death. During the years 1932‚Äì34, 1936‚Äì38, and 1940‚Äì41, Koyr√© taught in Fuad University (later Cairo University) where, along with Andr√© Lalande and others, he introduced the study of modern philosophy to Egyptian academia. His most important student in Cairo was Abdel Rahman Badawi (1917‚Äì2002) who is considered the first systematic modern Arab philosopher. Koyr√© later joined the Egyptian National Committee of the Free French. During World War II, Koyr√© lived in New York City, and taught at the New School for Social Research. After World War II, he was a frequent visitor to the United States, spending half a year at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton each year from 1955 to 1962 and also teaching as a visiting professor at Harvard, Yale, the University of Chicago, the University of Wisconsin, and Johns Hopkins. His lectures at Johns Hopkins would form the nucleus of one of his best known publications, From the Closed World to the Infinite Universe (1957). Koyr√© was general secretary and Vice President of the Institut International de Philosophie, a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, a recipient of the George Sarton Medal of the History of Science Society, and of the Silver Medal of the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique. He died in Paris on 28 April 1964. Work Though best known as a philosopher of science, Koyr√© started out as a historian of religion. Much of his originality for the period rests on his ability to ground his studies of modern science on the history of religion and metaphysics. Koyr√© focused on Galileo, Plato and Isaac Newton. His most famous work is From the Closed World to the Infinite Universe, a series of lectures given at The Johns Hopkins University in 1959 on the rise of early modern science and the change of scientists' perception of the world during the period from Nicholas of Cusa and Giordano Bruno through Newton. Though the book has been widely heralded, it was a summation of Koyr√©'s perspective rather than an original new work. Koyr√© was suspicious of scientists' claims to prove natural or fundamental truths through experiments. He argued these experiments were based on complicated premises, and that they tended to prove the outlook behind these premises, rather than any real truth. He repeatedly critiqued Galileo's experiments, claiming that some of them could not have taken place, and disputed the results Galileo claimed and which modern historians of science had hitherto accepted. According to Koyr√©, it was not the experimental or empirical nature of Galileo's and Newton's discoveries that carried the Scientific Revolution of the 16th and 17th centuries, but a shift in perspective, a change in theoretical outlook toward the world. Koyr√© strongly criticized what he called the \\"positivist\\" notion that science should only discover given phenomena, the relations between them and certain laws that would help to describe or predict them. To Koyr√© science was, at its heart, theory: an aspiration to know the truth of the world, of uncovering the essential structures from which phenomena, and the basic laws that relate them, spring. Koyr√© was also interested in the correlations between scientific discoveries and religious or philosophical worldviews. Like Husserl in his later studies, Koyr√© claimed that modern science had succeeded in overcoming the split, inherent in traditional Aristotelian science, between Earth and Space, since these were now both seen as governed by the same laws. On the other hand, another split had now been created, between the phenomenal world inhabited by man and the purely abstract, mathematical world of science. Koyr√© aimed to show how this \\"first world\\", the world of human dwelling (personal and historical), apparently irrelevant to modern naturalistic research, was by no means irrelevant for the very constitution and development of this research. Koyr√© consistently sought to show how scientific truth is always discovered in correlation with specific historical, even purely personal, circumstances. Koyr√©'s work can be seen as a systematic analysis of the constitutive achievements that resulted in scientific knowledge, but with particular emphasis on the historical, and specifically human, circumstances that generate the scientists' phenomenal world and serve as foundation for all scientific constitutions of meaning. Koyr√© influenced major European and American philosophers of science, most significantly Thomas Kuhn, Imre Lakatos and Paul Feyerabend. In 1961 he was awarded the Sarton Medal by the History of Science Society. = Criticism = In the course of his studies of Galileo, Koyr√© famously claimed that the experiments with weights falling and rolling on inclined planes that Galileo described in his writings probably had not been carried out in practice, but were instead thought experiments intended to illustrate his deductions. Koyr√© argued that the precision of the results reported by Galileo was not possible with the technology available to him and quoted the contemporary judgement of Marin Mersenne, who had questioned the feasibility of reproducing Galileo's results. Furthermore, according to Koyr√©, Galileo's science was largely a product of his Platonist philosophy and did not really derive from experimental observations. Koyr√©'s conclusions were first challenged in 1961 by Thomas B. Settle, who as a graduate student at Cornell University succeeded in reproducing Galileo's experiments with inclined planes using the methods and technologies described in Galileo's writing. Later, Stillman Drake and others worked through Galileo's notes and demonstrated that Galileo was a careful experimentalist whose observations did play a pivotal role in the development of his scientific system that he later claimed in his published work.\\"Experiment - Galileo Galilei\\" Koyr√© has been further criticised for his claim about Galileo's Platonism, which he saw as a synonym with mathematics and mathematization of nature. As the Italian scholar Lodovico Geymonat has proved, in fact, Platonism as a tradition does not helpfully illuminate the development of Galileo's mathematical studies which are mostly concerned with applied mathematics, engineering and mechanics fields that neither Plato nor Platonist authors were much interested in.

A variety of dwarf or gnome, a barbegazi resembles a small white-furred man with a long beard and enormous feet. They travel in the mountains that are their home by skiing with their massive feet, or using them as snowshoes. In the summer they aestivate in caves and tunnels and do not come out until the first snowfall. The word barbegazi comes from the French barbe-glac√©e, meaning \\"frozen beard\\". Because of their penchant for high altitudes and low temperatures, they are rarely sighted by humans, but sometimes help shepherds round up lost sheep. Their greatest known excitement is surfing on avalanches with their remarkably large feet, but they are said to give low whistling cries to warn humans of the danger above, sometimes they will give their best effort to dig humans out from the snow. A modern addition to this myth is the rumored migration of the Barbegazi to North America, predominantly to a locale of French origin in northwest Minnesota named Roseau County. Numerous sightings have been reported along the Roseau River, in the depths of the often frigid northern Minnesota winters.

Common names include saw-wort and snow lotus, the latter used for a number of high altitude species in East Asia. They are perennial herbaceous plants, ranging in height from dwarf alpine species 5‚Äì10 cm tall, to tall thistle-like plants up to 3 m tall. The leaves are produced in a dense basal rosette, and then spirally up the flowering stem. The flowers form in a dense head of small capitula, often surrounded by dense white to purple woolly hairs; the individual florets are also white to purple. The wool is densest in the high altitude species, and aid in thermoregulation of the flowers, minimising frost damage at night, and also preventing ultraviolet light damage from the intense high altitude sunlight. De Candolle named the genus after Horace-B√©n√©dict de Saussure (1740-1799) and Nicolas-Th√©odore de Saussure (1767‚Äì1845).Candolle, A.P. de, in Annales du Mus√©um National d'Histoire Naturelle. 16:197-198 Uses A number of the high alpine Himalayan species are grown as ornamental plants for their decorative dense woolly flowerheads; they are among the most challenging plants to grow, being adapted to harsh climates from 3500‚Äì5000 m altitude, demanding cool temperatures, a very long (up to 8‚Äì10 months) winter rest period, and very good soil drainage in humus-rich gravel soils. =Traditional uses = Costi amari radix or costus root was an important item of Roman trade with India, and is believed to have been the dried root of Saussurea lappa. Several varieties of snow lotus are used in traditional Tibetan medicine. Saussurea lappa is used a component of the traditional Tibetan medicine Padma 28. Research conducted on the Himalayan medicinal plants by C.P. Kala reveals that the practitioners of Tibetan medicine living in the Pin Valley of Himachal Pradesh use its root for curing dysentery and ulcer. Saussurea laniceps , Saussurea involucrata and Saussurea medusa flowers and stems have long been used in traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, cough with cold, stomachache, dysmenorrhea, and altitude sickness, and has been found to have antiinflammatory and analgesic effects, as well as cardiotonic, abortifacient, anticancer, and antifatigue actions. Saussurea laniceps have been proven to be more effective than Saussurea involucrata and Saussurea Medusa. Saussurea obvallata, known as \\"brahmakamala\\" in India is one of the most sacred species, and it has been used for offerings to goddess Nanda Devi for time immemorial. Pharmacology Saussurea lappa and has been shown to inhibit the mRNA expression of iNOS by lipopolysaccharide stimulated macrophages, thus reducing nitric oxide production. In rats, high doses of 50-200 milligrams per kilogram of crude ethanolic extract reduced observed inflammation in standard laboratory tests, and 25-100 milligrams per kilogram of the sesquiterpene fraction of the extract reduced several molecular markers of inflammation. Ethanol extracts were shown to have analgesic and antiinflammatory effects at high doses of 75-300 milligrams per kilogram. As the slow-growing wild plant is endangered by collections, a substitute grown in tissue culture has been suggested, which is mostly equivalent. Generally the analgesic and antiinflammatory effects of the plant are much inferior to those of indometacin. =Literature and culture= In most Chinese martial arts literature, the snow Lotus was classified a rare herb as precious as lingzhi mushroom, and old ginseng.

Many science fiction writers have imagined what extraterrestrial life on Venus might be like. Etymology The word Venusian ‚Äì sometimes spelled Venutian ‚Äì is a simple combination of the name of the planet Venus and the suffix -ian, formed by analogy to Martian and other similar demonyms. The classically derived demonym would be Venerean or Venerian (cf. \\"belonging to the goddess Venus\\"), but these forms have been used by only a few authors (e.g. Robert A. Heinlein). Scientists sometimes use the adjective Cytherean for things related to Venus, from the goddess' epithet Cytherea. The similarly derived Venereal is not used due to its association with venereal diseases, i.e. sexually transmitted diseases.Dave Hanes, The Appearance of Venus: Its Importance. Accessed Oct. 7, 2006 In fiction Venusians appearing in works of fiction are usually fanciful, rather than plausible inhabitants of the planet. Before the mid 20th century, little was generally known about the planet except that it was solid and comparable in size to Earth; its cloud cover obscured remote observation of its environment. This allowed writers to speculate that Venusians might be similar to humans or other Earth species, much as they did for fictional Martians. As more was learned about Venus and the implausibility of humanoid or other life on it, Venusians became increasingly uncommon in science fiction. = In comics and manga = Cover of 1950 Avon comic adaptation of The Radio Man * In early Captain Marvel stories, Venusians are giant frog-like amphibians which are ruled over by the evil mad scientist Doctor Sivana and his family. They are used to the tropical jungles of Venus and find Earth cold, and are quite savage. Venus is inhabited by other savage creatures, some which resemble prehistoric beasts, such as the centaur-like Gorillalion (which is half- gorilla half-lion). * The Hydrads of Venus, who resemble huge animated sponges, appear in Planet Comics, in the Lost World section. If hurt, water can restore them to health. Though opposed to the Voltamen who have invaded Earth, they are also enemies to Hunt Bowman. * In the Superman story which had the first appearance of the Legion of Super-Villains, one of the members was Cosmic King, a scientist who worked on transmuting elements, but when he was struck by the ray he gained the power to send those beams from his eyes. However, he was exiled from Venus for these experiments. * In DC Comics' All- Star Comics #13 the JSA are gassed by Nazis and rocketed to different planets. Wonder Woman is sent to Venus and finds it to be inhabited by fairies led by Queen Desira, who worship Aphrodite, and claim to have been at peace for \\"a million years\\". She helps them in a war against the Meteor Men, large brutal males. * In Showcase #23, Hal Jordan Green Lantern is sent by the Guardians, operating through the power battery to Venus where he meets blue-skinned primitive humanoids who are being attacked by pterosaur-like creatures. He seals the monsters in a cave, and leaves the world, saying the cavemen will one day be a great civilization. * In the British comic Dan Dare (1950‚Äì1967), Venus is inhabited by green-skinned Treens and Therons, who are separated by a fire wall running across Venus. The Mekon, the Super-intelligent Treen leader is a primary villain. Most Treens are emotionless. The Therons are more friendly to Earth. * Minako Aino of Sailor Moon is the reincarnation of the Princess of Venus. The Sailor V Manga shows a diamond shaped structure that is her castle. =In prose= * In the \\"Venus series\\" of Edgar Rice Burroughs, Burroughs created a fictitious 'Venusian' alphabet supposedly used by the Venusians (or \\"Amtorians\\" - as \\"Amtor\\" is what the natives call their planet). His artificial Amtor letters flow nicely together like cursive writing. * In Olaf Stapledon's 1930 novel Last and First Men, when the Moon threatens to slowly spiral down to crash into Earth, humans leave Earth and colonize Venus; in the process of doing so, humans totally exterminate Venus' native inhabitants, a semi-intelligent deep ocean marine species. The descendants of the invaders, Sixth to Eighth Men, can be considered Venerians themselves. * In Charles R. Tanner's \\"Tumithak of the Corridors\\" (1932) and its sequels, Venus is the homeworld of the shelks, spider-like aliens who have conquered Earth and forced most of the few surviving humans underground. * In William Lumley and H. P. Lovecraft's \\"The Diary of Alonzo Typer\\" (written in 1935 and published in 1938), part of the Cthulhu Mythos, there are mentions of the \\"Lords of Venus\\", and conflicting indications that the Serpent People originated there. The story was followed by \\"In the Walls of Eryx,\\" co-written by Lovecraft and Kenneth J. Sterling, in which a prospector is trapped in a maze on Venus, apparently constructed by lizardmen. * In C. S. Lewis' book Perelandra (1943), Professor Elwin Ransom travels to Venus (the title is the name of the planet in the Old Solar language), a planet mostly covered by water with floating islands on it, in order to fight a possessed Professor Weston and prevent the \\"Adam and Eve\\" of this young planet from bringing about the same fate that befell Earth (Thulcandra). In the book, Lewis depicts a wide variety of flora and fauna, with some animals close to being sentient. The King and Queen of the planet are humanoid, but green, and their commandment is for them not to sleep on the fixed land, a still island. When this happens, the Oyarsa of this world, a type of angel-like being who seems feminine like the classical goddess, tells Ransom that this will be the start of a new age. * Before Eden, by Arthur C. Clarke, is about a manned expedition to Venus which discovers an animated form of plant life. However, after the humans leave, the creature eats their abandoned garbage and other things left behind and this contamination eventually wipes out all native life on the planet. * The Space Merchants is a science fiction novel, written by Frederik Pohl and Cyril M. Kornbluth in 1952, about the campaign by advertising agencies on an overpopulated Earth to convince humans to colonize Venus, which is depicted as having a harsh and stormy tropical climate. * \\"I Am the Doorway\\", a short story in Stephen King's 1971 collection Night Shift, concerns an astronaut who returns from a tragic mission to Venus to find himself possessed by a murderously terrified alien entity. * In Roald Dahl's Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator (1972), Willy Wonka says that Venus used to be home to an alien race before they were \\"gobbled up\\" by Vermicious Knids. * In Jacqueline Susann's romance Yargo (1979), Venus is said to be inhabited by bees that are as big as horses. * In the self-help book by John Gray, Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus, women are occasionally (metaphorically) referred to as Venusians, while men are referred to as Martians. * In the book Venus by Ben Bova, the inhabitants of Venus are strange snake-like creatures that use molten sulfur for blood. They are not sapient. There are also micro- organisms in the clouds that break down ceramics and metals. * In Heinlein's story \\"Logic of Empire\\", the Venusians are an intelligent but primitive race of amphibians who trade valuable swamp roots to the human colonists in return for tobacco. In the novel Podkayne of Mars (depicting a fairly different Venus) Venusians are humanoids of great physical strength but also very primitive. * The Gobsmacking Galaxy, an entry in the children's non-fiction series The Knowledge written by Kjartan Poskitt, humorously describes hypothetical alien life forms which might evolve on planets in the solar system; the Venusian creatures are small, squat and round to cope with Venus's atmospheric pressures and make their living selling life insurance to visiting astronauts (before they succumb to the planet's extreme heat and pressure). * In Frederik Pohl's \\"Gateway\\", humans travel across the Galaxy using spaceships found on planet Venus, left there by its ancient civilization. =In film= * The creature in It Conquered the World (1956) was from Venus. It resembled a cone with a nasty grin. It Conquered the World was remade as Zontar, the Thing from Venus (1966), whose villain was also an alien from Venus. * 20 Million Miles to Earth (1957) deals with the crash-landing on Sicily of a spaceship returning from an expedition to Venus and the resulting rampage by a creature which it brought back. The creature (called in production, but not in the film, a \\"Ymir\\") is a reptilian humanoid with perhaps the intelligence of a chimpanzee, which under Terran conditions grows to roughly 20 feet tall. The film was animated by Ray Harryhausen. * Queen of Outer Space is a science fiction movie filmed in 1958 starring Zsa Zsa Gabor as Talleah, the Venusian leader of the resistance to overthrow cruel Queen Yllana. * In the film Easy Rider, Jack Nicholson's character speaks of Venusians around a campfire after smoking marijuana. * Venus Wars is a 1989 science fiction anime film about life on the planet Venus in the year 2089 after it has been colonized by humans. * In the original Japanese version of Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster, Princess Selina Salno of the fictional country of Selginia claims to be a survivor of the destruction of Venus by King Ghidorah. =In television= * Venusian visitors sometimes appeared on The Twilight Zone, (including the episodes \\"Mr. Dingle, the Strong\\" and \\"Will the Real Martian Please Stand Up?\\"), as a means of further twisting stories already featuring Martian visitors with similar goals. In \\"Will the Real Martian Please Stand Up?,\\" a Venusian appears disguised as a human chef with three eyes where the third eye is under his hat. * Although never seen or actually discussed in Doctor Who, the Third Doctor was a master of a martial art known as Venusian Aikido (or Karate). Also, the Doctor spoke the words of a Venusian lullaby in \\"The D√¶mons\\", sang the lullaby (to the tune of \\"God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen\\") in The Curse of Peladon, and was shown to carry a toothbrush containing \\"Venusian spearmint\\" in \\"The Shakespeare Code.\\" In the spin-off novel Venusian Lullaby, the Venusians are revealed to be from our Solar System's distant past, before Venus had become the hellish world of today. * Venusians work as members of the united galactic organisation in the 1962 television series Space Patrol. * In the first episode of the show Futurama, graffiti written in \\"Alien Language 1\\" is translated \\"Go Home Venusians\\". In Season 5 Episode 4 a truck shows the words Earth Flag Company in English and then Venusian Corporation in Alien 2. * In the second episode of Challenge of the Super Friends, Venus is shown to be inhabited by an advanced civilization called the Fearians. The Fearians are depicted as having three-heads with green skin and red eyes. The Fearian Leader (voiced by Michael Bell) form an alliance with the Legion of Doom, who trick the Super Friends into changing the world so it can support Fearian life. This will allow the Fearians to form a colony and the Legion will rule the world. The Super Friends are trapped by the Fearian Leader in a force field. However, Green Lantern makes them invisible, causing the Leader to think they have escaped and turn off the field. He is defeated by Black Lightning and Green Lantern sends him back to Venus. The Super Friends then restore the world. * In National Kid, the Inca Venusians are an alien race who National Kid defends the Earth from. In ufology In the 1950s, a group of contactees told stories in which they claimed to be in contact with friendly, light-haired, light-skinned humans from the planet Venus, as well as other planets in Earth's solar system.(Peebles, pp. 113-119) The first contactee, and the most famous, was George Adamski of Palomar Mountain, California. He claimed that on November 20, 1952 he met a Venusian named Orthon in a California desert. Adamski said that Orthon had communicated with him via telepathy about the dangers of nuclear war and that he left behind footprints with mysterious symbols on them.(Peebles, pp. 113-115) Adamski also displayed numerous photographs that he claimed showed the Venusian UFOs, and he said some of the photos had been given to him by Orthon. Copies of these photos were sold to visitors at Adamski's campground and restaurant at Palomar Mountain, but later studies by UFO investigators indicated that the photos were fakes; one scientist who analyzed the photos of a Venusian \\"scout ship\\" said the UFO's \\"landing struts\\" were General Electric light bulbs. Adamski wrote or co-wrote three books in the 1950s and early 1960s about his meetings with Orthon and travels in a Venusian UFO through Earth's solar system; the first two books, Flying Saucers Have Landed (1953), and Inside the Space Ships (1955), were both bestsellers.The Report on Unidentified Flying Objects. Edward J. Ruppelt Following Adamski's story, others, such as Howard Menger, George Hunt Williamson, Truman Bethurum, George Van Tassel, and Daniel Fry, also wrote books and gave lectures in which they claimed to have met similar friendly, light-skinned humanoids from Venus and other planets in Earth's solar system, and to have taken trips with them in their spaceships. These humanoids were later called Nordic aliens. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, the contactee movement garnered some popular interest through books, lectures, and conventions, such as the annual Giant Rock UFO conventions in California. In May 1959, Adamski had a private audience with Queen Juliana of the Netherlands to discuss his claimed UFO experiences, which caused some controversy in the Netherlands. https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=PYNWAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=6uQDAAAAIBAJ&pg;=1129,3236964&dq;=1959+george- adamski&hl;=en However, numerous investigations of the contactee movement revealed many flaws and inaccuracies in the contactees' claims that led most researchers to conclude that their stories were hoaxes. Among the pieces of evidence noted by critics was that Venus has an environment that is extremely hostile to human life, and that none of the other planets in Earth's solar system are capable of supporting humanoid life. Also, investigators such as USAF Captain Edward J. Ruppelt, the head of the Air Force's Project Blue Book, and ufologist James W. Moseley conducted extensive investigations into the claims and backgrounds of Adamski, Williamson, and other contactees, and concluded that they were either con artists or simply not being truthful in their stories and claims.(Peebles, pp. 118-\`20) In religion * In the teachings of the UFO religion the Unarius Academy of Science, the capital of Venus, which, like the Venusians themselves, is said to exist on a higher vibratory plane, is called Azure.Norman, Ernst and Ruth The Voice of Venus 1954 Unarius Academy of Science * Theosophical guru Benjamin Creme subscribes to the Theosophical view that the Nordic aliens (like those seen by George Adamski‚ÄîCreme accepts Adamski's UFO sightings as valid) pilot flying saucers from a civilization on Venus that exists on the etheric plane (Theosophists believe that since the Venusians' civilization is on the etheric plane, the heat does not affect them) and are capable of stepping down the level of vibration of themselves and their craft to the slower level of vibration of the atoms of the physical plane.Creme, Benjamin The Reappearance of the Christ and the Masters of the Wisdom London:1980 Tara Press Page 205 It is also believed in Theosophy that the governing deity of Earth, Sanat Kumara ,Image of Sanat Kumara from Luis Prada‚Äôs \\"Brother Veritus'\\" Ascended Master Teachings website: is a Nordic alien originally from Venus.Creme, Benjamin The Reappearance of the Christ and the Masters of the Wisdom London:1980 Tara Press Page 117 Sanat Kumara is said to live in a palace in a mythical city on the etheric plane of Earth called Shamballa, which is said by Theosophists to be located above the Gobi Desert.

Etymology The term is first attested in the 16th century referring both to a kind of pie containing meat and pasta (see pastitsio) and to a literary mixture; for music, the earliest attestation is 1795 in Italian and 1742 in English. It derives from the post-classical Latin pasticium (13th century), a pie or pasty.Oxford English Dictionary, March 2008 revision, s.v. pasticcio In opera In the 18th century, opera pasticcios were frequently made by composers such as Handel, for example Oreste (1734), Alessandro Severo (1738) and Giove in Argo (1739), as well as Gluck, and Johann Christian Bach. These composite works would consist mainly of portions of other composers' work, although they could also include original composition. The portions borrowed from other composers would be more or less freely adapted, especially in the case of arias in pasticcio operas by substituting a new text for the original one. In late 18th-century English pasticcios, for instance by Samuel Arnold or William Shield, the \\"borrowed\\" music could be Irish or British folksongs. In instrumental music Instrumental works would also sometimes be assembled from pre-existing compositions, a notable instance of this being the first four piano concertos of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. These concertos (K. 37, 39‚Äì41) were assembled almost entirely from keyboard sonata movements by contemporary composers, to which the boy Mozart added orchestral parts supporting the keyboard soloist.

On April 14, 1863 she was in company with the steamer Mary T. and ram when they were taken under attack on the Atchafalaya River by Union vessels , , and . Her speed, turning power, and superior piloting allowed Grand Duke to escape up river.

Grand Duke was ordered to Shreveport, Louisiana where she burned late in 1863.

Tortona is sited on the right bank of the Scrivia between the plain of Marengo and the foothills of the Ligurian Apennines. History Tortona Cathedral (postcard from c. 1890) Piazza Duomo, with the cathedral and on the right the bishops' palace Known in ancient times as Dertona, the city was probably the oldest colony under Roman rule in the westernmost section of the Valley of the Po, on the road leading from Genua (Genoa) to Placentia (Piacenza). The city was founded c. 123-118 BC at the junction of the great roads; the Via Postumia and the Via Aemilia Scauri which merged to become the Via Julia Augusta. The site made Dertona an important military station under the Romans. Strabo speaks of it as one of the most considerable towns in this part of Italy, and from Pliny wrote that it was a Roman colony. Velleius mentions it among those founded under the Republic, it appears to have been recolonised under Augustus, from whence we find it bearing in inscriptions the title of Julia Dertona.Smith, William, ed. (1854‚Äì1857). \\"Dertona\\". Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography. London: John Murray; Vell. Pat., Historiae, i. 15; Plin., H.N., iii. 5. s. 7. The assassin of Caesar, Brutus, encamped at Dertona on his march in pursuit of Mark Antony, after the Battle of Mutina,Cic. ad Fam. xi. 1. 0 and it was one of the places where a body of troops was usually stationed during the later ages of the empire.Not. Dign. ii. p. 121. A bishopric was founded at Tortona early, but its first bishops are purely legendary, like Saint Marcianus of Tortona, called the first bishop of Piedmont and a disciple of Barnabas, the companion of Paul. Until the 9th century, the city was under the rule of its bishop; in 1090 it became a free commune with the name of Terdona. In 1133 the diocese was separated from the archbishopric of Milan to the new archdiocese of Genoa (CE \\"Lombardy\\"). In 1155 Frederick Barbarossa besieged, captured and leveled Tortona to the ground, leaving not one stone upon another.Norwich, John Julius. Byzantium: The Decline and Fall (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1996) p. 108 During the Middle Ages, Tortona was a faithful ally of the Guelphs and was destroyed several times. From 1260 to 1347 the city was dominated by a series of different Italian noble families and adventurers like Facino Cane, who in the unsettled affairs of Lombardy had assembled a string of lordships and great wealth which he bequeathed to his wife, Beatrice, and arranged with his friends that a marriage should be effected between her and Filippo Maria Visconti. According to MachiavelliHistory of Florence, ch. 7 \\"By this union Filippo became powerful, and reacquired Milan and the whole of Lombardy. By way of being grateful for these numerous favors, as princes commonly are, he accused Beatrice of adultery and caused her to be put to death\\". In this way, in 1347, Tortona was decisively incorporated into the territories of the Duchy of Milan, under which remained until 1735. Then following the vicissitudes of the War of the Polish Succession, the city was occupied by the King of Sardinia, and \\"count of Tortona\\" was added to the titles of the House of Savoy.

Publication history Gygax had originally devised Lejendary Adventure as a role-playing video game using a simple and rules- light system based on skill-bundles, but he subsequently decided to develop the game as a printed fantasy RPG. Lejendary Adventure products were published by both Hekaforge Productions and Troll Lord Games. Three months after Gygax's death in 2008, his widow Gail withdrew all of the licenses from Troll Lord, and also from Hekaforge. The game has been out of print since that time. Gameplay Like other role-playing games, Lejendary Adventure is played using polyhedral dice, pencils, paper, and sometimes miniatures. Unlike Dungeons & Dragons, Lejendary Adventure has a player character creation system that is skill-based, resulting in very flexible character creation to allow role-playing of almost any kind of character. Lejendary Adventures still provide Archetypes using \\"Orders.\\" Orders are guild-like organizations in the world that provide benefits to the characters. Players can also choose to be unordered. Your Order is determined by your first chosen ability. Some orders include the Noble, Rogue, Elementalist, and of course, Unordered. Unordered characters still advance, but do so without the benefit of a guild. Various races are also available, with definitions somewhat different from other RPGs, as well as completely new races; races in Lejendary Adventure include Dwarves, Ilves, Wylves (Ilves and Wylves are two of many Fair Alfar, i.e. what are usually called elves in other RPGs), Gnomes, Kobolds, and Veshoge. As for character advancement, instead of levels, Lejendary Adventure characters receive Merits - points that can be used to increase their Abilities or Base Ratings, as well as buy new Abilities. The standard campaign setting is Lejendary Earth or Learth. Learth is described in several books. Also, Lejendary Adventure uses some unique terms such as Lejend Master [LM] (Game Master [GM]) and Avatar (Player Character [PC]).

Early career Born in Condino (County of Tyrol, now Trentino), Baratieri began his career as a volunteer for Giuseppe Garibaldi's Redshirts, where he served during the Sicilian-Neapolitan campaign from 11 May 1860 to 13 February 1861. Following the unification of Italy, Baratieri pursued a military career joining the regular Italian Army and fighting at the Battle of Custoza on 24 June 1866. Rising to the rank of general by 1891, Baratieri was appointed commander of Italian forces in colonial Africa and the following year became governor of Eritrea. Baratieri would spend several years fighting with local Ethiopian forces along the border from 1893 to 1895, winning several victories over the Mahdists, particularly at the Battle of Kassala on 17 July 1894. Italo- Ethiopian War Following Ethiopian emperor Menelik II and Italy's dispute over the Treaty of Wuchale, Italy launched an invasion of the Ethiopian empire. Returning briefly to Italy, Baratieri reportedly promised crowds to bring back Menelik in a cage. In late 1895 Baratieri led a force of 20,000 Italian troops and Eritrean Ascari into Ethiopia. However, Menelik had spent several years re-equipping his soldiers with modern arms and ammunition for such a conflict‚Äîat times with Italian help‚Äîand called up an army that vastly outnumbered the Italian forces. Baratieri spent nearly a year of the First Italo‚ÄìEthiopian War evading a decisive confrontation. In February 1896, however, the impatient Italian government of Francesco Crispi ordered Baratieri to engage the Ethiopians. Unknown to Baratieri, a confidential Cabinet decision had been made to replace him, and his successor General Baldissera was already on his way to Eritrea. On the evening of 28 February 1896 Baratieri met in conference with his four Brigade commanders at Sauria. The general himself favored a partial withdrawal, noting that the Ethiopian forces under Menelik were believed to be short of supplies and would be obliged soon to disperse. However both his brigadiers and his orders from Rome insisted on an advance into mountainous territory. On 29 February Baratieri marched in four separate columns on the Ethiopians at Adowa, where they outnumbered his immediate command of 9,894 men by more than ten to one.Raffaeli Ruggeri, p. 83 \\"Italian Colonial Wars 1885/1900\\", Editrice Militare Italiana 1988David Levering Lewis, The Race for Fashoda (New York: Weidenfeld and Nicolson, 1987), p. 116. The fighting began soon after 5:30 am on 1 March, when a horseman entered the Ethiopian camp with news of the Italian advance. Ethiopian forces were well positioned to receive the Italians in a crossfire, and by noon the battle was effectively over. Though the two sides suffered nearly equal casualties‚Äî6,589 Italian regulars and Eritrean Ascaris dead; and an estimated 7,000 EthiopiansRaffaeli Ruggeri, p. 84 \\"Italian Colonial Wars 1885/1900\\", Editrice Militare Italiana 1988‚ÄîBaratieri's casualties accounted for two-thirds of his force. As a result of the disaster, Italy was forced to sign the Treaty of Addis Ababa guaranteeing Ethiopian sovereignty. Baratieri was court-martialed at Asmara; though he was acquitted, he was forced to resign his post the following year. He spent the remainder of his life living in retirement in the Austrian Tyrol until his death on 7 August 1901 at Sterzing.

His reflexive poetry, reaching its zenith in the 1890s, was a turning point that ushered modern themes in Croatian poetry. Early life Kranjƒçeviƒá was born in Senj. Rebellious as a teenager, he completed his secondary education in a Gymnasium, but did not graduate from it. Soon after joining the elite Germanico-Hungaricum Institute in Rome, where he was supposed to become a priest, he changed his mind and left. The short stay in the Eternal City would show through in his poetry years later. He attended the one-year course for language and history teachers in Zagreb. With the diploma for a teacher in ‚Äúcitizen schools‚Äù, he left to work in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Mostar, Livno, Bijeljina, Sarajevo: those were the cities where he taught and wrote poetry. Kranjƒçeviƒá made contributions to Albanian culture: while Albanian writer Gjergj Fishta attended Franciscan schools in Bosnia, he met Bosnian Croat Grga Martiƒá and Silvije Strahimir Kranjƒçeviƒá who at that time lived in Bosnia. Martiƒá and Kranjƒçeviƒá awakened literary instinct in Fishta.Pater Gjergj Fishta (1871-1940) He published his first poem, Zavjet (The Pledge) in 1883, a couple of months before leaving for Rome. The magazine where it was published, Hrvatska vila, was led by Eugen Kumiƒçiƒá, a famous writer and politician of the time, who enthusiastically welcomed the fighting spirit in the verses of the unknown young poet. Kranjƒçeviƒá sent another two poems from Rome in 1884, Pozdrav (Salute) and Senju-gradu (Poem for Senj), to Sloboda, a magazine in Su≈°ak. When he came back from Rome, he published Noƒá na Foru (A Night at the Forum) in Vijenac. Politically, he was a follower of Starƒçeviƒá and the Croatian Party of Rights. The dark moods of his poems are related to the Hungarian oppression of Croatia. Bugarkinje His first poetry book, Bugarkinje (1885), was published in his native Senj. It already announced his three main themes: Homeland, Man and Universe. Kranjƒçeviƒá would never change them, just make them deeper. Bugarkinje is a traditional name given to elegiac folk songs in the Balkans. The first criticism on the book was written by the classical philologist and literary critic in Vijenac. ≈†repel noted Kranjƒçeviƒá's \\"vivid imagination\\" and \\"true poetic enthusiasm\\", but deplored the uneven quality of his poems. Nevertheless, he concluded that \\"a new and talented hand has appeared in the Croatian Parnassus\\"., cited in Later literary figures heaped even more praise on Bugarkinje. The great writer Miroslav Krle≈æa said they presented Kranjƒçeviƒá as a genuine \\"standard-bearer of freedom\\". More recently, the literary historian said that the prophetic and bitter energy of its poems, although occasionally falling into pathos and rhetoric, embraced universal and cosmic themes, which made the young Kranjƒçeviƒá stand out among his contemporaries, such as August Haramba≈°iƒá, whose main themes were declamatory patriotism or romantic love. Bugarkinje tried to formulate a poetic and political program, with the dedicatory poem to August ≈†enoa expressing the poetic credo of Kranjƒçeviƒá, while the poems to Croatia, the People and the Worker stood as three pillars of the poet's national and political beliefs. Kranjƒçeviƒá used Biblical and classical parables, as well as symbols from the history of Christianity and Judaism; their allegorical nature suited his poems about the fundamental human issues. Later life His next poetry book, Selected Poems, came more than a decade later, in 1898. The 1890s marked the zenith of his poetic work. It would be followed by two more books: Trzaji (Quivers) in 1902 and Poems in 1908. In Sarajevo, he was the editor of Nada, a literary magazine published by the Bosnian government, for eight years (1895‚Äì1903). The nominal editor was the government adviser , a man of wide horizons and the benefactor of Antun Gustav Mato≈°, but he trusted Kranjƒçeviƒá with the editorial policy. Because of such freedom, \\"Nada\\" attracted the greatest Croatian writers of the time, becoming the most important literary magazine of the Croatian pre-modernist movement, Moderna. It was there that Kranjƒçeviƒá published most of his literary essays and criticisms.

It is best known for its early production of glass jars, lids, and related products used for home canning. Since its founding in Buffalo, New York in 1880, when it was known as the Wooden Jacket Can Company, the Ball company has expanded and diversified into other business ventures, including aerospace technology. It eventually became the world's largest manufacturer of recyclable metal beverage and food containers. The Ball brothers renamed their business the Ball Brothers Glass Manufacturing Company, incorporated in 1886. Its headquarters, as well as its glass and metal manufacturing operations, were relocated to Muncie, Indiana, by 1889. The business was renamed the Ball Brothers Company in 1922 and the Ball Corporation in 1969. It became a publicly traded stock company on the New York Stock Exchange in 1973. Ball left the home canning business in 1993 by spinning off a former subsidiary (Alltrista) into a free-standing company, which renamed itself Jarden Corporation. As part of the spin-off, Jarden is licensed to use the Ball registered trademark on its line of home-canning products. Today, the Ball brand mason jars and home canning supplies belongs to Newell Brands. History =Early years= In 1880, Frank C. and Edmund B. Ball, two of the five Ball brothers, borrowed $200 from their uncle, George Harvey Ball, founder and first president of Keuka College, to buy the Wooden Jacket Can Company, a small manufacturing business in Buffalo, New York. Soon, the three other brothers (William, Lucius, and George) joined Frank and Edmund in Buffalo.Barbara Quigley, \\"The Ball Brothers\\" in (Years later, the brothers reciprocated their uncle's early assistance by providing financial support to Keuka College.) The Ball brothers' company made tin cans encased in wooden jackets to hold kerosene, paints, or varnishes. Because the acid used to refine kerosene caused corrosion in tin, the brothers decided to use glass for the inserts of the wood-jacketed cans. Initially, they bought the glass containers from a factory in Poughkeepsie, New York. Around 1885 a group of Belgian glassblowers who were passing through Buffalo encouraged the Ball brothers to build their own factory. The Ball brothers purchased land in East Buffalo, where they built a two-story brick building for the stamping works and a one-story frame factory for the glass works. Although a fire destroyed an early glass factory in Buffalo, the brothers rebuilt and expanded the business. To keep the new factory's furnace operating at full capacity, the company introduced new products and made improvements to its glass and metal manufacturing processes.Ball, Memoirs of Frank Clayton Ball, pp. 63‚Äì64. Around 1884, when the brothers discovered that the patent covering the Mason Improved fruit jar had expired, their company began manufacturing canning jars in their glassworks. The Ball brothers' \\"Buffalo\\" jars, which were made in such sizes as half-gallon, pint, and midget, were manufactured during a part of 1884, 1885, and 1886. Jar lids were produced in their metal fabricating factory. The Ball Company's logo was embossed onto the surface of the jars, which were made of either amber or aqua (blue-green) glass.Birmingham, pp. 56‚Äì58. On February 13, 1886, the company incorporated as Ball Brothers Manufacturing Company.Birmingham, p. 56. About the same time the factory in Buffalo was destroyed by fire in 1886, the brothers began to consider moving their business closer to natural gas supplies.Ball, Memoirs of Frank Clayton Ball, pp. 70‚Äì72. While on a business trip in Cleveland, Ohio, Frank heard about the natural gas boom in Findlay, Ohio. After visiting the town, he told Edmund about the economic advantages of using natural gas instead of coal for manufacturing glass. Edmund visited several towns in the gas fields, including Muncie, Indiana. The two brothers decided to make a more extensive trip to investigate the possibility of establishing a glass factory closer to an abundant supply of natural gas. They briefly had doubts about extending beyond Buffalo, but decided to explore the use of natural gas as a means of expanding their glass-making business.Ball, Memoirs of Frank Clayton Ball, p. 72. Frank and Edmund first visited in Fostoria, Ohio, where they were enthusiastically welcomed. The next stop was Bowling Green, Ohio. After a night in town, Edmund returned to Buffalo, but Frank remained. After Frank had been in Bowling Green for about a week, he received a telegram from James Boyce, a Muncie businessman. Frank, who had become weary of Bowling Green, was ready for a change and \\"decided to run down to Muncie and see what they had to offer.\\"Ball, Memoirs of Frank Clayton Ball, p. 76. As Frank recalled his early discussions with Muncie's town leaders, \\"There was nothing about the town that particularly appealed to me, but the men were all courteous, kind, and businesslike.\\"Ball, Memoirs of Frank Clayton Ball, p. 77. Frank agreed to a proposal that offered the Ball brothers of land for a factory site, a gas well, and $5,000 in cash to encourage the move to Muncie. In addition, city officials agreed to provide a railroad connection to the brothers' new facilities. By September 1887 construction had begun on the Muncie factory and the Ball brothers began plans to move their glass manufacturing operations from New York. Frank remained in Muncie to get the factory up and running, while Edmund closed the glass factory in Buffalo, then moved to Muncie to join Frank. Their brothers, William and George, remained in Buffalo to operate the stamping works and a factory in Bath, New York.Ball, Memoirs of Frank Clayton Ball, pp. 78‚Äì79.Edmonds and Geelhoed, pp. 48‚Äì49. In 1888 the company opened its first glass manufacturing facility in Muncie. On February 18 fires were started in the new factory's furnace; on March 1 its first glass products were made.Birmingham, p. 70. The first products to be manufactured in the new factory in Muncie were oil containers and lamp chimneys, not fruit jars. By 1889 the Ball company's headquarters and its glass and metal manufacturing operations had moved to Muncie. The other Ball brothers moved to Indiana in the 1890s. George moved to Muncie in 1893, William arrived in 1897, and Lucius, a company shareholder and a physician, moved to Muncie in 1894.Quigley, p. 15. In the late nineteenth century, the company continued to grow and prosper, but not without experiencing some challenges. Fires at its Muncie factories and warehouses in 1891 and 1898 damaged its facilities, but they were rebuilt. Despite the economic panic of 1893, the company was able to produce 22 million fruit jars for the year beginning in September 1894, and 37 million jars by 1897. When natural gas supplies in the area began to diminish, the Ball brothers installed gas converters to use Indiana coal in their factories and continued manufacturing operations. The company's F. C. Ball machine, patented in 1898, introduced mass production into its glass-blowing process and gave it a competitive market advantage. By 1905 the company was producing 60 million canning jars per year and had acquired other glass manufacturers, expanding its operations to include seven factories in addition to its main facilities at Muncie.Edmonds and Geelhoed, pp. 49‚Äì50.Birmingham, pp. 80‚Äì81. In a continuation of the company's difficulties in Muncie, workers organized with Local 200 (Glass Workers) of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) at the main facility, went on strike in March 1910, with the strikers demanding wage increases. A settlement was quickly reached on March 29, but company management reneged on the agreement and threatened to declare a lockout. The strike continued, but was weakened by the refusal of machinists affiliated with the American Federation of Labor to join the strike. By the end of April, the strike was lost. =Diversification= Ball remained a family-owned business for over 90 years. Renamed the Ball Brothers Company in 1922, it is best known for manufacturing fruit jars, lids, and related products for home canning. The company also entered into other business ventures. Because the four main components of their core product line of canning jars included glass, zinc, rubber, and paper, the Ball company acquired a zinc strip rolling mill to produce metal lids for their glass jars, manufactured rubber sealing rings for the jars, and acquired a paper mill to fabricate the packaging used in shipping their products. The company also acquired tin, steel, and later, plastic companies.Quigley, pp. 14‚Äì15. The Ball company faced additional challenges and opportunities during the Great Depression and World War II. Prior to 1933, Ball was the largest domestic manufacturer of home canning jars. In 1939 it manufactured 54% of all the canning jars made in the US. A drop in demand for the jars during the 1930s led the Ball brothers to begin manufacturing other types of jars and bottles for commercial use, and expand into other lines of business. During World War II the company's operations were converted to produce shells and machine parts for the military.Birmingham, pp. 139‚Äì40. After the war, Ball's glass-making business was hindered by an antitrust case in which the company was one of several defendants. The legal case was appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. The final decision, which was handed down in 1947, restricted Ball's ability to acquire other glass manufacturers and other businesses producing glass-making machinery without prior court approval. In 1949 decreasing demand for canning jars caused the company to suffer its first net operating loss. With legal restrictions on the company's ability to expand its glass-making business and declining demand for its canning jars, Ball company executives decided that in order to grow it had to further diversity its holdings.Birmingham, pp. 113‚Äì16. In the 1950s the Ball company entered the aerospace industry. Laboratories for the Ball Brothers Research Corporation were established at Boulder, Colorado, and in Muncie. The company began manufacturing aerospace equipment in 1959. Its OSO-1 (Orbiting Solar Observatory) satellite, designed and built for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) with $1.4 million in grants, launched into space on March 7, 1962, at Cape Canaveral, Florida. Its success led to additional contracts to build more satellites, a total of seven, but not without some losses. An explosion killed three workers and damaged the company's OSO-2 satellite in 1964.Birmingham, pp. 171‚Äì72. The company continued to expand into other areas such as avionics, aerospace systems, and metal beverage and food containers. Renamed the Ball Corporation in 1969, it acquired Jeffco Manufacturing Company, a maker of recyclable aluminum beverage cans, and became the largest producer of recyclable beverage cans in the world.Birmingham, p. 176. Although glass production in Muncie ceased in 1962, it continued at other Ball plants until its final glass manufacturing operations were sold in 1996. Ball Corporation's stock went public on July 13, 1972. It became a publicly traded stock company on the New York Stock Exchange in 1973. The stock began trading at $26 per share on the NYSE on December 17, 1973, using the trading symbol BLL. Ball no longer produces its glass canning jars. In the early 1990s Ball exited the home- canning business, when it established a subsidiary named Alltrista, which consisted of seven smaller Ball subsidiaries that included the Ball jar and other canning-related products. When Altrista Corporation became a separate company in April 1993, Ball shareholders received one share of Alltrista stock for every four shares of Ball stock. Altrista was renamed Jarden Corporation in 2001. Jarden retains the license to use the Ball registered trademark on its line of home-canning products, a part of Jarden's branded consumables business. (Jarden produces lids for several brands of fruit jars at its Muncie plant and its jars are made by a variety of glass producers.) In 1998 the Ball Corporation moved its corporate headquarters from Muncie to Westminster, Colorado, where its oversees global operations as a manufacturer of plastic and metal food and beverage containers, as well as a manufacturer of equipment and supplier of services to the aerospace industry.

The entire Village is bordered approximately by St. Hubert Street to the west, De Lorimier Avenue to the east, Sherbrooke Street to the north and Ren√© L√©vesque Boulevard to the south, making it the largest gay village in North America in terms of area. It is served by the Beaudry and Papineau metro stations. Originally a poor working- class area, the Centre-Sud neighbourhood became increasingly attractive to the gay and lesbian community after the migration of many gay businesses from other parts of the city. The area has become considerably gentrified, due in part to significant investment from the various levels of all governments. All three levels of government are aggressively promoting Montreal's gay life as a tourist attraction. In recognition of the Village's importance to the city, the Ville-Marie borough has displayed a rainbow flag in its council chambers and redecorated the entrance to the Beaudry Metro station with rainbow pillars. The Village is specifically marked on official city maps as \\"Le Village\\". History The first recorded gay establishment in North America was Montrealer Moise Tellier‚Äôs apple and cake shop on Craig Street (now Saint Antoine Street) in 1869. Originally named after a little wrestler named Dave who used to wrestle outside the pubs during the summer months. In addition to a small scene in Old Montreal, there were traditionally two concentrations of establishments where gays were welcomed (by the 1970s, these had become openly gay businesses), which mirrored Montreal's more language-segregated culture. These were Downtown Montreal (mixed, but mostly anglophone) and The Main (mixed, but mostly francophone): =Downtown Montreal= The west end of Montreal's downtown had bars on Stanley Street and Drummond Street, with Shaughnessy Village west of Guy Street as a gay residential neighbourhood. By the 1950s, Dominion Square (now Dorchester Square) was seen as an area where men could meet and cruise and the centrally located Dominion Square Tavern was known as a place where gays could meet (it still exists today, but has lost its gay clientele). By the late 1960s and early 1970s, many gay-owned or gay- open businesses existed and it became the city's main gay concentration, though it was still relatively marginal and kept discreet. The businesses consisted mainly of clubs where men could dance. =The Main= The Main, the strip of businesses on Saint-Laurent Boulevard and east along Saint Catherine Street East, an area which was known as the Red-light district of sexual services and businesses. The east had a more francophone clientele. Here, the businesses consisted mainly of taverns, often featuring drag shows. =Closure of gay businesses in the past= The businesses in these two areas came under regular repression, particularly before Montreal's Expo 67 World's Fair and the Olympic Games in 1976. The Aquarius Sauna on Crescent Street was raided in February 1975, followed by six gay and lesbian bars in October 1975, the \\"Les Bains Clubs\\" on January 23, 1976 and the Cristal Sauna on February 11, 1976. Because of the increased police repression, the Gay Coalition Against Repression was formed and hosted what was then the largest gay demonstration in Canada on July 19, 1976. In mid-March 1987, the 456 Sauna (formerly the historical Neptune Sauna), the \\"Taureau d'Or\\", \\"Studio 1\\", \\"Club Stork\\", \\"le Jilly's\\" and many other businesses were raided and a number of owners had to shut down after dubious accusations that led to a number of owners and clients being arrested.Fiert√© Montr√©al site History page =Development of the Gay Village= Originally, there were only a handful of establishments located in what is now the Gay Village. In the early 1980s, some bars opened along Saint- Catherine Street East, between Berri Street and Papineau Avenue, in Montreal's Centre-Sud area. Eventually, a new generation of gays also moved into the neighbourhood, both anglophone and francophone, including many came from other parts of Quebec. This was encouraged by the creation of a \\"Latin Quarter\\" in the vicinity of the Universit√© du Qu√©bec √† Montr√©al campus. The name Le Village de l'Est (\\"the East Village\\") was coined in an advertisement by one of the owners of K.O.X., a very popular bar/club at the time. After having lived in New York City, it was his intention to create a strong vibrant gay community similar to the East Village in Manhattan. The name was created to differentiate itself from the traditional downtown scene. Eventually, the name became known simply as \\"The Village\\" and it became Montreal's main gay residential and commercial district. However, its success also caused the near-disappearance of gay businesses from other areas of the city. By the 1990s, the Village began expanding along Amherst (now Atateken) Street, with the departure of many antique shops and the emergence of more gay-owned and gay-operated businesses. By this time, the Village had become well established, gaining political recognition and acceptance by the LGBT community as well as by heterosexuals. By gaining popularity, the area has generally thrived, having been beautified and having housing renovated. Almost all gay businesses in Montreal are now located in this area. Librairie L'Androgyne, the city's main LGBT-oriented bookstore, moved to the village in 2001, from its prior location on Saint-Laurent, but closed in 2002 due to declining sales.\\"L‚ÄôAndrogyne ferme ses portes\\". Fugues, July 25, 2002. Although many LGBTs reside and are very present in other parts of Montreal, the Gay Village remains the heart of Montreal's LGBT community. Every summer, St. Catherine Street becomes a pedestrian mall that is decked out with many pink balls strung overhead.Aires Libres (Sainte-Catherine Street for pedestrians Many bars and restaurants provide outdoor terraces for their patrons at this time.

Early on the floor of the mouth is raised and there is difficulty swallowing saliva, which may run from the person's mouth. As the condition worsens, the airway may be compromised with hardening of the spaces on both sides of the tongue. This condition has a rapid onset over hours. The majority of cases follow a dental infection. Other causes include a parapharyngeal abscess, mandibular fracture, cut or piercing inside the mouth, or submandibular salivary stones. It is a spreading infection of connective tissue through tissue spaces, normally with virulent and invasive organisms. It specifically involves the submandibular, submental, and sublingual spaces. Prevention is by appropriate dental care including management of dental infections. Initial treatment is generally with broad- spectrum antibiotics and corticosteroids. In more advanced cases endotracheal intubation or tracheostomy may be required. With the advent of antibiotics in 1940s, improved oral and dental hygiene, and more aggressive surgical approach, the rates and risk of death among those infected has significantly reduced. It is named after a German physician, Wilhelm Frederick von Ludwig, who first described this condition in 1836.  Signs and symptoms  Ludwig's angina is a form of severe diffuse cellulitis with bilateral involvement, primarily of the submandibular space with the sublingual and submental spaces also being involved. It presents with an acute onset and spreads very rapidly meaning early diagnosis and immediate treatment planning is key to saving lives. The external signs may include bilateral lower facial swelling around the mandible and upper neck. Signs inside the mouth may include elevation of the floor of mouth due to sublingual space involvement and posterior displacement of the tongue, creating the potential for a compromised airway. Additional symptoms may include painful neck swelling, tooth pain, dysphagia, shortness of breath, fever, and general malaise. Stridor, trismus, and cyanosis may also be seen when an impending airway crisis is nearing.  Cause  The most prevalent cause of Ludwig's angina is odontogenic, accounting for approximately 75% to 90% of cases. Infections of the lower second and third molars are usually implicated due to their roots extending inferiorly below the mylohyoid muscle. Periapical abscesses of these teeth also result in lingual cortical penetration, leading to submandibular infection. However, oral ulcerations, infections of oral malignancy, mandible fracture, bilateral sialolithiasis-related submandibular gland infection, and penetrating injuries of the mouth floor have also been reported as potential causes of Ludwig's angina. In fact, the same microorganisms responsible for less morbid head and neck infections are found in causing extensive infection throughout the floor of mouth and neck when Ludwig's angina is critically reviewed. Patient with systemic illness, such as diabetes mellitus, malnutrition, compromised immune system, and organ transplantation are also commonly predisposed to Ludwig's angina. It is found that one third of the cases of Ludwig's angina are associated with systemic illness. A review reporting the incidence of illnesses associated with Ludwig angina found that 18% of cases involved diabetes mellitus, 9% involved acquired immune deficiency syndrome, and another 5% were human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive.  Diagnosis  Infections originating in the roots of teeth can be identified with a dental X-ray. A CT scan of the neck with contrast material is used to identify deep neck space infections. If there is suspicion of the infection of the chest cavity, a chest scan is sometimes done. Angioneurotic oedema, lingual carcinoma and sublingual haematoma formation following anticoagulation should be ruled out as possible diagnoses. = Microbiology = There are a few methods that can be used for determining the microbiology of Ludwig's angina. One of the traditionally used methods is taking culture samples although it has some limitations. By taking pus samples from a patient with Ludwig's angina, the microbiology were found to be commonly polymicrobial and anaerobic. Some of the commonly found microbes are Viridans Streptococci, Staphylococci, Peptostreptococci, Prevotella, Porphyromonas and Fusobacterium.  Treatment  For each patient, the treatment plan should be done with consideration of each of the individual patient's differing factors. They are namely the stage of the disease and co-morbid conditions at the time of presentation, physician experience, available resources, and personnel are critical factors in formulation of a treatment plan. There are four principles that guide the treatment of Ludwig's Angina: Sufficient airway management, early and aggressive antibiotic therapy, incision and drainage for any who fail medical management or form localized abscesses, and adequate nutrition and hydration support. Each will be explained in detail below. = Airway management = Placement of an endotracheal tube to aid breathing. Airway management has been found to be the most important factor in treating patients with Ludwig's Angina, i.e. it is the ‚Äúprimary therapeutic concern‚Äù. Airway compromise is known to be the leading cause of death from Ludwig's Angina. * The basic method to achieve this is to allow the patient to sit in an upright position, with supplemental oxygen provided by masks or nasal prongs. Patients should never be left unattended, particularly if there is an absence of intubation or a surgical airway in place. * Methods of airway management range from conservative airway management ‚Äì consisting of close observation and intravenous antibiotics, to airway intervention with endotracheal intubation or tracheostomy. * If the oxygen saturation levels are adequate and antimicrobials have been given, simple airway observation can be done. This is a suitable method to adopt in the management of children, as a retrospective study described that only 10% of children required airway control. However, a tracheostomy was performed on 52% of those affected with Ludwig's Angina over 15 years old. * Airway control is compulsory if a surgical procedure is required. ** Flexible nasotracheal intubation require skills and experience. ** If nasotracheal intubation is not possible, cricothyrotomy and tracheostomy under local anaesthetic can be done. This procedure is carried out on patients with advanced stage of Ludwig's Angina. ** Endotracheal intubation has been found to be in association with high failure rate with acute deterioration in respiratory status. ** Elective tracheostomy is described as a safer and more logical method of airway management in patients with fully developed Ludwig's Angina. ** Fibre-optic nasoendoscopy can also be used, especially for patients with floor of mouth swellings. * It is important that incision and drainage are preceded by consulting the anaesthesiologist about possible airway problems at intubation. A tracheostomy set should always be present in the operating room in case there is requirement for local tracheostomy or an emergency cricothyrotomy. = Antibiotics = * Antibiotic therapy is empirical, it is given until culture and sensitivity results are obtained. The empirical therapy should be effective against both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria species commonly involved in Ludwig's Angina. Only when culture and sensitivity results return should therapy be tailored to the specific requirements of the patient. ** Empirical coverage should consist of either a penicillin with a B-lactamase inhibitor such as amoxicillin/ticarcillin with clavulanic acid or a Beta-lactamase resistant antibiotic such as cefoxitin, cefuroxime, imipenem or meropenem. This should be given in combination with a drug effective against anaerobes such as clindamycin or metronidazole. * Parenteral antibiotics are suggested until the patient is no longer febrile for at least 48 hours. Oral therapy can then commence to last for 2 weeks, with amoxicillin with clavulanic acid, clindamycin, ciprofloxacin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, or metronidazole. = Incision and drainage = * Surgical incision and drainage are the main methods in managing severe and complicated deep neck infections that fail to respond to medical management within 48 hours. * It is indicated in cases of: ** Airway compromise ** Septicaemia ** Deteriorating condition ** Descending infection ** Diabetes mellitus ** Palpable or radiographic evidence of abscess formation * Bilateral submandibular incisions should be carried out in addition to a midline submental incision. Access to the supramylohyoid spaces can be gained by blunt dissection through the mylohyoid muscle from below. * Penrose drains are recommended in both supramylohyoid and inframylohyoid spaces bilaterally. In addition, through and through drains from the submandibular space to the submental space on both sides should be placed as well. * The incision and drainage process is completed with the debridement of necrotic tissue and thorough irrigation. * It is necessary to mark drains in order to identify their location. They should be sutured with loops as well so it will be possible to advance them without re-anaesthetizing the patient while drains are re-sutured to the skin. * An absorbent dressing is then applied. A bandnet dressing retainer can be constructed so as to prevent the use of tape. = Nutritional support = Adequate nutrition and hydration support is essential in deciding the outcomes in any patient following surgery, particularly young children. In this case, pain and swelling in the neck region would usually cause difficulties in eating or swallowing, hence reducing patient's food and fluid intake. As a result, patients suffer from weight loss due to loss of fat, muscle and skin initially, followed by bone and internal organs in the late phase. Meanwhile, at the cellular level, the cells would be less able to maintain homeostasis in the presence of stressors such as infection and surgery. Patients must therefore be well-nourished and hydrated to promote wound healing and to fight off infection. = Post-operative care = Extubation, which is the removal of endotracheal tube to liberate the patient from mechanical ventilation, should only be done when the patient's airway is proved to be patent, allowing adequate breathing. This is indicated by a decrease in swelling and patient's capability of breathing adequately around an uncuffed endotracheal tube with the lumen blocked. During the hospital stay, patient's condition will be closely monitored by: * carrying out cultures and sensitivity tests to decide if any changes need to be made to patient's antibiotic course * observing patient's body temperature - a rise implies further infection * monitoring patient's white blood cell count - a decrease implies effective and sufficient drainage * repeating CT scans to prove patient's restored health status or if infection extends, the anatomical areas that are affected. Moreover, it is advised to never leave young children with significant neck swelling unattended and they should always be seated to prevent suffocation. Etymology The term ‚Äúangina‚Äù, is derived from the Latin word ‚Äúangere‚Äù, which means ‚Äúchoke‚Äù; and the Greek word ‚Äúankhone‚Äù, which means ‚Äústrangle‚Äù. Placing it into context, Ludwig's angina refers to the feeling of strangling and choking, secondary to obstruction of the airway, which is the most serious potential complication of this condition.

The VT420 was an ANSI standard computer terminal introduced in 1990 by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC). The 420 was the only model in the 400 series, replacing the VT320. There were no color or graphics-capable 400 series terminals; the VT340 remained in production for those requiring ReGIS and Sixel graphics and color support. The entire lineup of VT300s and VT420 was eventually replaced by the relatively unknown VT500 series starting in 1993. Description The VT420 was essentially an updated VT320, adding the multi-session capabilities originally introduced on the VT330 and VT340. Those two models had included a system known as TD/SMP which allowed two sessions to be multiplexed over a single serial connection to a compatible terminal server. Alternately, the two sessions could be supported by separate serial connections on those models with multiple MMJ ports. Using either method, the VT330/340/420 could either show the two sessions behind each other, using a key sequence to flip back and forth, or split the screen horizontally to display the sessions one above the other, or vertically side-by-side. The VT420 also added a number of more minor features. One was to add a number of PC character sets, allowing the terminal to be used with a variety of PC programs. Another allowed the terminal to generate the proper character sequences to produce rectangular-area commands. For instance, one could select a rectangular area and fill it with a particular character, or blank it out. This was in addition to the terminal-side editing system introduced on the VT300s. The VT420 had a total of 5 sets of 94 characters for normal VT operation, another 3 sets of 128 PC characters, and 1 set of 96 characters containing various graphics and math symbols. Like all models since the VT200 series, the user could also upload a custom character set of their own design using the Sixel system. Likewise, it also supported the National Replacement Character Set system, which swapped out single characters in 7-bit modes to allow basic changes like swapping the for the for use on UK systems. All DEC terminals that came after the VT100, including the VT420, are able to emulate their ancestors. The VT420 had VT100 and VT52 emulating modes. The screen itself was a 14\\" flat CRT with a resolution of 800 (horizontal) by 400 (vertical) pixels. A variety of glyphs were available that provided 80 or 132 characters across, and 24, 36 or 48 lines of text vertically. The screen had room for 25 lines at normal font sizes, but the last line was normally used for status indications, like . The MMJ ports could operate at speeds up to 38,400 bit/s, double that of the VT300s maximum 19,200 bit/s.

It crosses the central business district from west to east, beginning at the corner of Claremont Avenue and de Maisonneuve Boulevard in the city of Westmount, traversing the borough of Ville-Marie, and ending on Notre-Dame Street just east of Viau Street in the borough of Mercier‚ÄìHochelaga-Maisonneuve, where it ends at the Grace Dart Extended Care Centre, a nursing home near Cadillac metro station. The street runs parallel to the largest segments of Montreal's underground city. The series of interconnected office tower basements and shopping complexes that make up this main thoroughfare lie immediately north of the street. Educational institutions located on or near the street include Concordia University, McGill University, Universit√© du Qu√©bec √† Montr√©al, Dawson College and LaSalle College.  History  In its early years Sainte- Catherine Street was known as Sainte-Genevieve or Saint-Gabriel; according to Paul-Andr√© Linteau, during that time it was commonplace for street names to change frequently. It is not known exactly where the name Saint Catherine Street originated, but there are three prevalent theories on how it came about. According to the first theory, put forward by Cl√©phas Saint-Aubin, the name was meant to honor Catherine de Bourbonnais, the suspected illegitimate child of King Louis XV. Another theory, possibly the most obvious, it was named for the Catholic saint Catherine of Alexandria. The final theory is that the street was named by Jacques Viger for one of his daughters-in-law, Catherine Elizabeth. It is not known exactly when Sainte-Catherine Street was built as it wasn't part of any city plan; it just happened to be one of the streets that many people frequented. The street began to grow in 1736, in the Saint-Laurent Borough on either side of Saint Laurent Boulevard, which is located close to the centre of Montreal and runs from north to south. Saint Catherine runs from east to west. In the 18th century, Montreal had no municipal council. All administrative issues pertaining to roads fell to justices of the peace. The Roads Act of 1796 allowed the justices to oversee approval and denial of road construction and funding for roads. Landowners and farmers were often pressured to pay for the construction of streets. Road inspectors like Montreal's first mayor Jacques Viger were appointed: their responsibilities were to make sure that roads like Sainte-Catherine Street were draining properly, the roads were level, aligned properly and were adequately paved.  Construction and Development  Because Sainte-Catherine Street wasn't planned, it grew in sections at a time during different periods, as confirmed by historian Alan Stewart. There were four distinct stages of development. The first section, from Saint-Alexandre Street to Sanguinet Road, grew from 1758 to 1788. The street was 24 feet wide at this time. The second stage started in 1820 and ended in 1860. The eastern part of the street extended past Sanguinet to Panet. The western part of the street extended from Saint-Alexandre Street to McGill College Avenue in 1840. In the 1850s it passed McGill College Avenue past De la Montagne and Guy Street until it reached Atwater Avenue. The third stage took up from where the second stage left off in 1860 and lasted until 1890. In 1872, Sainte-Catherine advanced west to Greene Avenue, then moved past Victoria Avenue in the 1880s. In the east the street extended to De Lorimier Avenue and Fullum Road by 1863 and in the next couple of years it stretched to Du Havre. The fourth and final stage of development occurred from 1890 to 1910. By 1890 there had been sections that had been built in the neighborhoods of Hochelaga and Maisonneuve. In 1910 the street stretched to Vimont Street. In the 1950s, in order to complete this monster of a street, segments were added on either end of the street. In the east it hooked into Notre-Dame Street and in the west, it hooked into De Maisonneauve Boulevard. The street is now 11.2 km long and is considered the backbone of Downtown Montreal.  Growing Popularity  By the end of the 19th century, Sainte-Catherine was becoming known as the entertainment hub of Montreal. By 1850, horse-drawn streetcars began to run along the street and in 1864 the first electric-powered tramway, provided by the Montreal City Passenger Railway, was introduced on Sainte-Catherine Street. This allowed workers to get to and from their jobs in other parts of the city, as well as transporting many housewives to the many department stores that had started to appear on Sainte-Catherine after World War I, like Scoggie's, Goodwin's, Morgan's, Eaton's, Simpson's, Ogilvy's and Dupuis as well as jewelry stores like Birks. In 1890, there was also evening entertainment with both English and French theatres and the Academy of Music lining the street near the intersection with Victoria Avenue. This helped usher in a new way of city life that evolved into how Montrealers now live. Retailers Morgan's on Sainte- Catherine St., 1890. The Bay on St. Catherine Street, with KPMG Tower in the background The entrance to the Eaton Centre on St. Catherine St., Montreal, Quebec, Canada Former Eaton's store, now Complexe Les Ailes St. Catherine Street has been home to many of Montreal's prominent department stores, including such former retailers as Eaton's, Morgan's, Simpson's and Dupuis Fr√®res. Today, the Henry Morgan Building is home to Hudson's Bay Company, which acquired Morgan's in 1960. The Simpson's building is now shared by the Simons department store and a multiplex cinema, while Eaton's was converted to the Complexe Les Ailes. Dupuis Fr√®res, located further east at St. Catherine and St. Hubert, is now a shopping mall and office complex. The Ogilvy's department store remains a fixture on St. Catherine Street, although it is now a collection of boutiques rather than a single store. Other major retailers along the street including an Apple Store, AVEDA Experience Centre, Indigo Books and Music, Archambault, La Senza, Best Buy, Roots, Adidas, Puma, Guess, Parasuco, Zara, Mango and an H&M; flagship store at the corner of Peel and St. Catherine. Additionally, many of Montreal's most prominent shopping complexes, including the Eaton Centre, Complexe Les Ailes, Place Montreal Trust, Promenades Cath√©drale, les Cours Mont-Royal (a high fashion shopping mall), the Complexe Desjardins, Place Dupuis, Place Alexis Nihon, the Faubourg Sainte-Catherine and Westmount Square are all located along the street. The Montreal Forum, once home to the Montreal Canadiens, is also located on St. Catherine Street at Atwater Street. It has since been turned into a shopping and movie theatre complex called the Pepsi Forum. Due to the Forum's presence on this street, St. Catherine was used as the parade route whenever the Canadiens won the Stanley Cup. This was once referred to as \\"the usual route\\" by Mayor Jean Drapeau, during the Canadiens' dynasties of the mid-century, when a win would occur quite frequently. The segment in the district of Hochelaga-Maisonneuve is also an important commercial area in that neighbourhood. File:banamtl2.jpgBanana Republic store at the corner of McGill College Avenue.

Street closures For one weekend in July every year, Saint Catherine Street hosts Canada's largest open-air sidewalk sale. of the street between Jeanne-Mance Street and St. Mark is closed to traffic, and vendors from nearby shopping centers bring out their sale merchandise. There is also live entertainment along the street. It is estimated that over 300,000 people visit the downtown during this event.La grande braderie estivale (in French) Transit The Green line of the Montreal Metro was built to serve Sainte-Catherine Street; however, to avoid disrupting traffic on the street, it was built one block to the north, under parts of Burnside Place, which once joined together, later became de Maisonneuve Boulevard. Bus service is provided by the STM's 15 Sainte- Catherine and 34 Sainte-Catherine which both operate 7 days a week. Culture Saint Catherine Street at Phillips Square, 1937 Former Capitol Theatre, 1925 Montreal's Place des Arts, the city's primary concert venue, is located on Saint Catherine Jeanne-Mance and Saint-Urbain streets, in the city's Quartier des Spectacles entertainment district. The street was once home to many now-abandoned cinemas such as the Loews, Palace, Capitol, Cin√©ma de Paris, York, Ouimetoscope and the Seville Theatre as well as the demolished Montreal Spectrum music venue. Places of worship The street is also home to Christ Church Cathedral, the only church in Canada that sits atop a shopping mall, Promenades Cath√©drale; another important church, Saint James United Church, has recently had its concealing fa√ßade of commercial buildings removed. Other churches on the street include St. James the Apostle Anglican Church. Gay Village A partial view of Montr√©al's Gay Village, with M√©tro Beaudry (subway) station at left long St. Catherine East Montreal's Gay Village () extends along Sainte-Catherine Street in the east end of downtown, between Saint-Hubert and Papineau. Beaudry Metro station, on the Green Line, provides the most convenient access to the Village and sports a permanent rainbow decoration on its fa√ßade. For most of the summer, from mid-May till mid-September, Sainte-Catherine Street is completely closed to vehicular traffic through the Gay Village, making it one large pedestrian area, allowing all the stores to sell outside and all the restaurants and bars to serve on large, open-air terrasses. Summer is also punctuated with special events and festivals such as the art festival FIMA, Festival International Montr√©al en arts, Pride Celebrations and Divers/Cit√©. Night life The strip clubs which made their home on Saint Catherine have now declined in number, though a few prominent clubs, such as Super Contact, remain.

Inaugural season (2005‚Äì06) The Express ended the regular season on March 5, 2006, after losing an away game to the Buffalo Rapids. Their record for the regular season was 14-16 and they finished third in the Roger Brown Division behind the Harlem Strong Dogs and the Strong Island Sound. They had a bye week for the first round of the playoffs. They played on March 17, 2006, in Atlanta against their second round opponent, the Atlanta Vision. The Express started the season with star players Aswan Morris, Rasheed Sparks, Jamie Sowers and Derek Washington and Marcus Toney-El from the Jersey SkyCats. The head coach of the team in their first season was Darryl Dawkins. Former Newark Mayor, Sharpe James, and the city council gave money to the team and became an official sponsor during their inaugural season. Newark Express Game The Newark Express had a small number (100-250 fans on average) at their games, but there was more loyalty and noise among the fans toward the end of the season. The team had mentioned the possibility of moving to a larger arena in the future. Although the Prudential Center was completed in 2007, the low attendance prevented the team from using the arena. The Newark Express season ended with a loss against the top ranked Rochester Razorsharks 126-98 on March 19, 2006 in the second round of the playoffs. The Razorsharks went on to win the 2005-2006 ABA Championship.

Painting Ella Guru. The Queen's Speech. Guru has stated her concern for ability and technique, and her admiration for the work of Old Masters, although they are not necessarily her model for painting: she also appreciates untrained artists who show invention in their work. She spent three years painting life models at art college, which gave her much of the grounding for her approach to art. Her paintings take anywhere between two days and two years to complete, and usually start by her \\"going out and getting pissed with my friends\\", when she takes the photographs which provide the initial ideas, although the images she works from are often \\"very bad, dark, fuzzy photos\\", necessitating subsequent real life studies as well as imaginative interpretation. The initial layout is done with a line drawing, but the aim is to achieve a finished result where the subject appears three- dimensional. She has talked about an irrational obsession with shapes, such as those of wigs, which have always fascinated her. Her painting The Queen's Speech had its origin in Pennsylvania in the house of a friend, with whom Guru has collaborated for a number of years in setting up suitable scenes for photographs by dressing people in costume. This particular scene, showing Guru's husband, Sexton Ming, was the friend's idea. A photograph was the starting point for the painting, which was not started until Guru's return to London, but it was augmented by life studies and also the addition of extra items, such as the bottle of absinthe.

Godhuli, Mewar, ca. 1813 Rajput painting, also called Rajasthani painting, evolved and flourished in the royal courts of Rajputana in northern India, mainly during the 17th and 18th centuries. Artists trained in the tradition of the Mughal miniature were dispersed from the imperial Mughal court, and developed styles also drawing from local traditions of painting, especially those illustrating the Hindu religious epics, the Mahabharata and Ramayana. Each Rajputana kingdom evolved a distinct style, but with certain common features. Miniatures in manuscripts or single sheets to be kept in albums were the preferred medium of Rajput painting, but many paintings were done on the walls of palaces, inner chambers of the forts, havelis, particularly, the havelis of Shekhawati, the forts and palaces built by Shekhawat Rajputs. Subjects varied, but portraits of the ruling family, often engaged in hunting or their daily activities, were generally popular, as were narrative scenes from the epics or Hindu mythology, as well as some genre scenes of unnamed people. The colours were extracted from certain minerals, plant sources, conch shells, and were even derived by processing precious stones. Gold and silver were used. The preparation of desired colours was a lengthy process, sometimes taking 2 weeks. Brushes used were very fine.  Content  While there exist a plethora of themes in Rajput paintings, a common motif found throughout Rajput works is the purposeful manipulation of space. In particular, the inclusion of fuller spaces is meant to emphasize the lack of boundaries and inseparability of characters and landscapes. In this way, the individuality of physical characters is almost rejected, allowing both the depicted backgrounds and human figures to be equally expressive. Outside of a purely artistic standpoint, Rajput paintings were often politically charged and commented on social values of the time. Mewar's rulers wanted these painting to portray their ambitions and establish their legacy. Therefore, paintings were often indicative of a ruler's legacy or their changes made to better society. Both of these factors clearly distinguish Rajput paintings from Mughal works. While, from a chronological standpoint, both of these cultures clashed with one another, Rajput paintings only superficially adopted Mughal fashion and cultural standards. Elements, such as precise likenesses in portraiture, utilized by popular Mughal artists (Govardhan, Hashim, etc.) are not found in Rajput works. Likewise, Rajput techniques are not predominantly seen in Mughal paintings: \\"At the opening of the eighteenth century, therefore, Rajput painting remains recognizably different in intent from traditional Mughal attitudes\\"Beach, 175  Schools  Krishna and Radha, might be the work of Nih√¢l Chand, a master of the Kishangarh school trained at the imperial court in Delhi. In the late 16th Century, Rajput art schools began to develop distinctive styles, combining indigenous as well as foreign influences such as Persian, Mughal, Chinese and European. Rajasthani painting consists of four principal schools that have within them several artistic styles and substyles that can be traced to the various princely states that patronised these artists. The four principal schools are: # The Mewar school that contains the Chavand, Nathdwara, Devgarh, Udaipur and Sawar styles of painting # The Marwar school comprising the Kishangarh, Bikaner style of painting from Bikaner, Jodhpur, Nagaur, Pali and Ghanerao styles # The Hadoti school with the Kota, Bundi and Jhalawar styles and # The Dhundar school of Amber, Jaipur, Shekhawati painting and Uniara styles of painting. The Kangra and Kullu schools of art are also part of Rajput painting. Nainsukh is a famous artist of Pahari painting, working for Rajput princes who then ruled that far north. Economic prosperity of commercial community and revival of ‚ÄúVaisnavism‚Äù and the growth of Bhakti Cult were the major factors that contributed greatly to the development of Rajasthani paintings. In the beginning this style was greatly influenced by religious followers like Ramanuja, Meerabai, Tulsidas, Sri Chaitanya, Kabir and Ramanand. All of Rajputana was affected by the attack of the Mughals but Mewar did not come under their control till the last. This was the reason that Rajasthani school flourished first in Mewar, (the purest form and later on in), Jaipur, Jodhpur, Bundi, Kota- Kalam, Kishangarh, Bikaner and other places of Rajasthan.

He played first-class cricket for Bombay and Gujarat, and Test cricket in the Indian cricket team, mainly as a middle-order batsman but also bowling occasional medium pace and off spin. He captained the Indian team in eight Test matches from 1955 to 1958. When he retired in 1962, he had played in more Tests (59), scored more Test runs (3,631), and recorded more Test centuries (12), than any other Indian player. He scored the first double century by an Indian in Test cricket against New Zealand in Hyderabad. Early life Polly Umrigar was probably born in Bombay but his place of birth is often cited as Solapur, Maharashtra (see A majority of the references cite S(h)olapur as Umrigar's place of birth. But in the interview A chat with midwicket explorer in Sportstar, 14 October 1989, p.49, Umrigar said : \\"Let me correct the notion that I was born in Sholapur and not in Bombay. The fact is I was born in Bombay, but learnt my cricket in Sholapur till pre-metric days\\". Another dissenter is Richard Cashman, Patrons, Players and the Crowd, p.76 : \\"For years Polly Umrigar was listed as 'born in Sholapur' whereas it is now known that he was born in Bombay.\\" ). His father ran a clothing company. He grew up in Solapur and his family moved to Bombay when he was at school.

He made his first class debut for Parsis at the age of 18 in the Bombay Pentangular in 1944, and studied for a BSc at St Xavier's College. He captained the Bombay University team. He also played hockey and football competitively. As a cricketer =Early Test career= He scored 115* for Combined UniversitiesPartab Ramchand, Great Indian batsmen, p.63 against the touring West Indians in October 1948. This performance brought him to national attention, and earned him a single appearance in the 2nd Test against the same team in Bombay seven weeks later. By the time two Commonwealth teams visited India in 1949‚Äì50 and 1950‚Äì51, Umrigar had become a regular in the team. He scored 276 runs in the unofficial Tests against the first team and 562 runs against the second. In the Madras Test, he moved from 90 to 102 with two successive sixes off Frank Worrell.Great Indian batsmen, p. 104. Vijay Hazare, in his autobiography My story states that the sixes took Umrigar from 88 to 100. He scored only 113 runs in the first four Tests against a weak England side at home a year later. He was dropped from the fifth Test but was included in the last minute due to an injury to Hemu Adhikari. Going in at No.7, he made 130 not out as India won their first ever Test match. Though the bowling was not of a very high quality, Umrigar considered it the best innings of his life.Polly Umrigar, \\"Oh, the first sight of clear skies\\", Outlook Special issue on the 75 years of Indian cricket (2005), p.69 : \\"This innings ranks as the best of my life, though the 170-odd that I got in the Caribbean in 1961‚Äì62 was perhaps my best in terms of quality.\\"In its December 2004 issue, Wisden Asia Cricket conducted a poll among cricketers and cricket writers to select the best innings by an Indian. The 130* was ranked 29th while Umrigar's 172* at Port of Spain in 1961‚Äì62 came 45th =England in 1952= In England in 1952, Umrigar scored heavily outside Test matches, but in Tests he was a complete failure. His aggregate of 1,688 was the highest in the season for the Indian team. He made more than 800 runs in May and double hundreds against Oxford University, Lancashire and Kent, but seemed to struggle against the fast bowler Cuan McCarthy Partab Ramchand, Great Feats of Indian Cricket, p.102 of Cambridge. However, he made only 43 runs in seven Test innings, at an average of 6.14. But more than the lack of runs, it was the way that he batted that was disturbing. While facing Fred Trueman, time and again he backed away towards square leg and \\"(held) the bat out to each ball, missing it like a beginner\\".Great Feats of Indian Cricket, p.101, quoting S. K. Gurunathan's report from Manchester Bedser dismissed him twice; Trueman dismissed him four times, and on three occasions he was bowled backing away.John Arlott in his biography of Fred Trueman tells of Umrigar \\"who at one point retreated so far back that (Tony) Lock, at backward short-leg, said \\"I say, Polly, do you mind going back. I can't see the bowler when you stand there\\" \\". More has perhaps been written about this series than any other phase of Umrigar's career.Some writers have gone further on the impact of Umrigar's failures and attributed the bad reputation that Indian batsmen once had against fast bowlers to it : \\" .. but it was the deeper wound that Trueman had inflicted on Indian cricket that could never be healed. Trueman became an ogre India could not cope with and a whole generation of Indian batsmen were branded as cowards, men who ran away to square-leg at the first sight of a fast bowler. Not all Indian batsman ran away from Trueman and it is a canard to suggest that. However, one man did. \\" etc. (Mihir Bose, A History of Indian Cricket, p.181) Umrigar had far more success in his other encounters with fast bowlers. He scored a hundred at Manchester in his next meeting with Trueman in 1959; he topped the aggregate for India in all his three series against West Indies who at various times had Frank King, Wes Hall, Roy Gilchrist and Charlie Stayers. It was off the bowling of Hall and Stayers that he played one of the finest innings of his career. He returned to form against Pakistan at home in 1952‚Äì53, and scored 560 runs in West Indies in early 1953 with two hundreds and four fifties. Umrigar's 560 runs in the 1952‚Äì53 series equalled Rusi Modi's identical tally against West Indies at home in 1948‚Äì49. This stood as an Indian record till Vijay Manjrekar scored 586 runs against England in 1961‚Äì62, and the highest abroad till Dilip Sardesai and Sunil Gavaskar made 642 and 774 runs in West Indies in 1970‚Äì71. He reached his hundred at Port of Spain with a six off Sonny Ramadhin.Umrigar was the first Indian batsman to reach a century with a six, a feat that has since been emulated by Kapil Dev, Sachin Tendulkar, Mohammad Azharuddin, Rahul Dravid and Virender Sehwag. His innings of 223 against New Zealand at Hyderabad in 1955‚Äì56 was the first double century scored for India. =Test captain= Umrigar had led India in two unofficial Tests against the Commonwealth XI in 1953‚Äì54 winning one of them. From the second Test match against New Zealand in 1955‚Äì56 till the first Test against the West Indies three years later, he captained the side in eight successive Test matches. India won two of the New Zealand Tests by an innings. After one Test against the West Indies in 1958‚Äì59, he was replaced as captain by Ghulam Ahmed who then announced his retirement from Test cricket after two successive defeats. Umrigar was again picked as captain for the fourth Test at Madras, but a confusion developed about the replacements for Ghulam Ahmed and Vijay Manjrekar, who was injured. Umrigar wanted another batsman, Manohar Hardikar, to replace Manjrekar, but Ratibhai Patel, the President of BCCI insisted on the off-spinner Jasu Patel to play in his place.While the BCCI President certainly went beyond his brief in insisting for Patel, Rajan Bala in The Covers are Off places some part of the blame in Umrigar's insistence on a Bombay man (Hardikar) as the replacement for Manjrekar. Umrigar resigned the captaincy on the night before the Test.Most sources agree that Umrigar resigned that night but Rajan Bala quotes Umrigar (The Covers are Off, p.71) as saying that he does not remember whether the decision to quit was taken during the night or in the morning after discussion with the selection committee chairman Lala Amarnath. He represented India for three more years but never again captained the country. His 337 runs in the five Tests of the series was the highest for India. =Late Test career= During the tour of England in 1959, he again scored heavily outside Test matches, but struggled in the Tests again Trueman and Brian Statham until the fourth Test. He scored three double hundreds in tour matches, the 252* against Cambridge University was then the highest by an Indian abroad.Excepting Duleepsinhji and Ranjitsinhji who are English for cricketing purposes. Duleep scored 333 for Sussex against Northamptonshire in 1930 while Ranji's highest was 285* for Sussex v Somerset in 1901. Umrigar's score was the highest by an Indian abroad till Navjot Sidhu made 286 against Jamaica at Kingston in 1988‚Äì89. As of 2015, it is still the highest by an Indian in England. He made 230 runs in four Test matches, including 118 in the Old Trafford Test in his last meeting with Trueman. Umrigar's off-spin played a significant supporting role to Jasu Patel in India's first win over Australia at Kanpur in 1959‚Äì60, but his batting remained below par, and he missed the last two Tests in the series with a back injury. He scored three hundreds in the series against Pakistan in 1960‚Äì61 and another against England at home in 1961‚Äì62 (his third century in as many Test innings). Polly Umrigar's career performance graph.A few weeks later, India lost every match in a five Test series in West Indies. In the fourth Test at Port of Spain, Umrigar scored 56 and 172 not out and took 5 for 107 in the West Indian first innings.The only other Indian cricketer to score a century and take five wickets in an innings was Vinoo Mankad who scored 72 & 184 and took 5 for 196 against England at Lord's in 1952. In 2011/12 v West Indies at Mumbai, Ravichandran Ashwin scored 103 and took 5/156 to become the third. His fifty in the first innings came after India had lost their first five wickets for 30. India followed on and Umrigar reached his hundred in 156 minutes and 150 in 203. When Wes Hall took the second new ball, Umrigar hit him for four fours in an over.Great Feats of Indian Cricket, p.117 The last two Indian wickets added 144. Umrigar's 172* in 248 minutes were scored off India's last 230 runs. He finished the series with 445 runs and nine wickets. His chronic back trouble made him announce his retirement from Test cricket after he returned home. Umrigar continued to play first-class cricket for Bombay for another season and played his last first class match in 1967‚Äì68. =Analysis of cricket career= Umrigar was a powerfully built man who stood just under six feet.Cashman, p.84, quotes The Sunday Times, 30 April 1978, which in turn quotes Umrigar as stating that he was 5' 11¬Ω\\" but six feet in cricket boots An attacking player especially strong in front of the wicket, he was capable of destroying anything short of extreme pace.The opinion of Christopher Martin- Jenkins, Who's who of Test Cricketers (1986), p.481. In this attitude towards the bowling, he was different from most of his contemporaries. \\"He was a link between two generations\\", wrote K. N. Prabhu. \\"Theoretically he belonged to that assembly of cricketers of the thirties, but in practice his cricket was conditioned by the hard, professional approach of the immediate post- independence years\\".K. N. Prabhu, in Mid-day. From the early 1940s, Indian cricket had been dominated by the Merchant-Hazare school of batsmanship which put stress on preserving one's wicket. Umrigar's batting combined the tall scores of this era with the adventurous spirit of the thirties. Umrigar's bowling improved over the course of his career. He bowled off-cutters, hardly flighted the ball and moved it in off the seam.Sujit Mukherjee, Playing for India, p.156 Occasionally he used to bowl medium pace and open the bowling, as at Bahawalpur in 1954‚Äì55 when he took his career-best 6 for 74 against Pakistan. Umrigar rarely bowled for long spells at medium pace. At Bahawalpur he only bowled about six overs \\"at the maximum pace that he was capable of, which would be about Ramchand's\\" (the wickets were taken in later spells), according to Sujit Mukherjee. (See the article on G. S. Ramchand for Mukherjee's opinion about Ramchand's bowling.) Umrigar's aggregate of 3,631 Test runs and 12 Test centuries were India's best until bettered by Sunil Gavaskar in the late seventies. He led the victorious Bombay sides in Ranji Trophy in 1959‚Äì60, 1960‚Äì61 and 1962‚Äì63. In 59 Ranji matches, for Bombay and Gujarat, he scored 4102 runs with fifteen hundreds at an average of 70.72 and 140 wickets.140 wickets as per Indian Cricket 2004 p.461 and 138 according to Christopher Martin-Jenkins, Who's Who of Test Cricketers (1986) p.482, but a manual count of his wickets shows the Indian Cricket's tally to be correct. 134 of the wickets were for Bombay, 6 for Gujarat. His highest Ranji score of 245 was made against Saurashtra in 1957‚Äì58. He twice scored 1,000 runs in an Indian domestic season. He also spent a few years for Church in the Lancashire League. Later life Umrigar was the manager of Indian touring sides to New Zealand, West Indies and Australia in the late 1970s. He was the chairman of the national selection committee between 1978 and 1982, Executive secretary of the BCCI and the Mumbai Cricket Association Secretary. He wrote a book on cricket coaching and, for a time, he was the curator of the pitch at the Wankhede Stadium. He was awarded the Padma Shri in 1962 and the C.K. Nayudu Trophy in 1998‚Äì99 for his contributions to the game. The national Under-15 championship is contested for the Polly Umrigar Trophy.

The army was formed at Khabarovsk in the Soviet Far East in 1938 as the 2nd Army. After the Far Eastern Front was split in September that year it became the 2nd Independent Red Banner Army. When the front was reformed in June 1940, the army was redesignated as the 2nd Red Banner Army, stationed in the Blagoveshchensk area. It spent the bulk of World War II guarding the border in that area, sending formations to the Eastern Front while undergoing several reorganizations. In August 1945, the army fought in the Soviet invasion of Manchuria, capturing the Japanese fortified regions of Aihun and Sunwu adjacent to its sector of the border, and advancing into Manchuria to Qiqihar. The army was disbanded after the war in late 1945.  History  = Before 1941 = Ivan Konev, who commanded the army between 1938 and 1940 Owing to increased tensions with Japan, the 2nd Army was created in July 1938 on the Far Eastern frontiers of the Soviet Union from the 18th Rifle Corps as part of the Far Eastern Red Banner Front. It was commanded by then-Komkor (Corps commander) Ivan Konev. In September, the front was dissolved and its troops were split into two independent armies, which both inherited the Order of the Red Banner previously awarded to the front. The army, redesignated as the 2nd Independent Red Banner Army (2nd OKA), still under Konev's command, was headquartered at Khabarovsk and controlled troops in the oblasts of the Lower Amur, Khabarovsk, Primorsky, Sakhalin, and Kamchatka, the Jewish Autonomous Oblast, and the okrugs of Koryak and Chukotka. It was directly subordinate to the People's Commissariat of Defense and operationally controlled the Amur Red Banner Flotilla. The 2nd OKA included the 3rd, 12th, 34th, 35th, 69th, and 78th Rifle Divisions during its existence, as well as the fortified regions of De-Kastri, Lower Amur, Ust- Sungari and Blagoveshchensk. Elements of the army fought in the Battles of Khalkhin Gol, a series of border clashes between the Soviet Union and Japan, in mid-1939 under the control of other formations. On 4October 1939, the Northern Army Group was established at Nikolayevsk-on-Amur, controlling troops in the fortified regions of Nikolayevsk-on-Amur and De-Kastri, Kamchatka and Sakhalin. Subordinated to the 2nd OKA, the group operationally controlled the Northern Pacific Flotilla. By an order dated 21 June 1940, the Far Eastern Front was recreated and the headquarters of the 2nd Independent Red Banner Army was abolished and used to form the headquarters of the 2nd and 15th Armies. The 2nd (Blagoveshchensk) Red Banner Army (2nd KA) was headquartered at Kuibyshevka. It included the 3rd and 12th Rifle Divisions and the 69th Motorized Division (the former 69th Rifle Division, stationed in the Blagoveshchensk area). The 34th, 35th, and 78th Rifle Divisions became part of the 15th Army. Lieutenant General Vsevolod Sergeyev became army commander on 22 June. On 27 August, the 31st Mixed Aviation Division (SmAD) was formed from its 26th Mixed Aviation Brigade. In March 1941, the 59th Tank Division was formed in the Khabarovsk area as part of the army. Lieutenant General Makar Teryokhin replaced Sergeyev on 11 March. By 22 June the army also included the 101st Blagoveshchensk and the Ust-Bureysk Fortified Regions. = World War II =  Garrison duty in the Far East  During World War II, the army covered the border around Blagoveshchensk and sent reinforcements to the active forces fighting on the Eastern Front. Following the beginning of Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the Soviet Union, on 22 June 1941, a directive dated 25 June transferred the 59th Tank and 69th Motorized Divisions by rail to the Eastern Front. On 28 June the 31st SmAD departed for the Eastern Front, and remaining units, including the 3rd Fighter Aviation Regiment, were made directly subordinate to the Air Force (VVS) of the 2nd KA. In August the 95th Mixed Aviation Division was formed in the VVS of the 2nd KA; it became the 95th Fighter Aviation Division (IAD) by 1September. By 1September, the army included the Svobodny Rifle Division, and the 82nd Bomber Aviation Division (BAD) had been added to the VVS of the 2nd KA. By 1October the Svobodny Rifle Division had been replaced by the 204th Rifle Division, the 95th IAD had become the 95th SmAD, and the 96th SmAD had been created. By 1November, the 1st and 2nd Rifle Brigades and the Zeya and Blagoveshchensk separate rifle regiments had been formed in the army. The 95th SmAD had again been redesignated as the 95th IAD by 1December, and a separate cavalry regiment and the 73rd and 74th Tank Brigades had been formed. As of 1December the two separate rifle regiments had disappeared from the order of battle and the 1st and 2nd Rifle Brigades were shown as being part of the 101st Fortified Region. The Ust-Bureysk Fortified Region was likely disbanded in December, as it does not appear in the order of battle for 1January 1942. The 95th IAD became an SmAD again in December. In January the 82nd BAD briefly transferred to the VVS of the Far Eastern Front, but transferred back to the army's VVS in February. Around the same time the 96th Rifle Division and 258th and 259th Rifle Brigades became part of the army. In March the 95th SmAD was disbanded and its units directly subordinated to the army's VVS. The 96th SmAD was converted into an IAD in May. In July, the 96th and 204th Rifle Divisions were shipped to the Eastern Front and the 17th and 41st Rifle Brigades were formed. The VVS of the army became a separate unit, the 11th Air Army, in August. In April 1943, the 1st and 2nd Amur Tank Brigades were formed in the army from its separate tank battalions; in June, the 1st was merged into the 2nd, becoming the 258th Tank Brigade in July. The army's composition remained constant for most of 1944; the 342nd and 355th Rifle Divisions were formed in the army in late November and December, respectively, from its four rifle brigades. The 345th and the 396th Rifle Divisions were formed in the army in March 1945. In July, the 342nd and the 345th Divisions transferred out of the army to the 87th Rifle Corps and the 355th Division joined the Chuguyevka Operational Group, an independent unit directly controlled by the Far Eastern Front headquarters.  Soviet invasion of Manchuria  Operations of the 2nd Red Banner Army in the Soviet invasion of Manchuria, 8‚Äì15 August 1945 In preparation for the Soviet invasion of Manchuria, the army became part of the 2nd Far Eastern Front after the Far Eastern Front was split on 5August. For the invasion, the army had a strength of 240 tanks and self-propelled guns and 1,270 guns and mortars, and occupied a sector. It numbered 54,000 men out of a nominal strength of 59,000. The army's three rifle divisions were at around 90% of their nominal strength, with around 9,000 to 10,000 men each; the 3rd and 12th Divisions were slightly larger than the 396th. The 101st Fortified Region numbered 6,000 men and was almost at full strength. The army included three tank brigades (the 73rd, 74th, and 258th) and three self-propelled artillery battalions. Front commander Army General Maxim Purkayev initially tasked the army with defending the Blagoveshchensk area from Japanese attack, in cooperation with the Amur Flotilla's Zee-Bureysk Brigade and separate battalions of river ships. When the main Soviet attacks achieved success, the army was to launch an assault crossing of the Amur River, reduce or isolate the Japanese Sakhalian, Aihun, and Holomoching fortified regions and defenses around Sunwu, and advance south through the Lesser Khingan Mountains to Qiqihar and Harbin. The front's offensive operations were later known in Soviet historiography as the Sungari Offensive. An operational group consisting of the 3rd and 12th Rifle Divisions, and the 73rd and 74th Tank Brigades, was positioned in the army's center and on its left flank. It was to attack south across the Amur from Konstantinovka to capture Sunwu and its fortifications, then advance south through Peian to Harbin. Another group with the 396th Rifle Division, the 368th Mountain Rifle Regiment, and the 258th Tank Brigade was to launch a supporting drive across the Amur from the Blagoveshchensk area, take the fortified regions of Sakhalian and Aihun, and advance south to Nencheng, Noho, and Qiqihar. The army's 101st Fortified Area, with artillery and machine gun battalions, was positioned on the Amur between the two groups to conduct supporting attacks. Soviet troops crossing the Sungari aboard a monitor of the Amur Flotilla during the Sungari Offensive The main offensive began on 9August, but the army remained in its positions until 11 August. During this time, it conducted reconnaissance and harassing attacks across the Amur, capturing several of the river's islands. The main bodies of the operational groups were placed in concentration areas, located in the army's rear. Due to the rapid advance of the other Soviet forces, Purkayev ordered the army late on 10 August to begin its attack early on the following morning. Aihun, Sunwu, and Hsunho were scheduled to be captured by the end of 11 August. That night, the operational groups moved forward to their attack starting positions. The attack began early in the morning under the cover of an artillery bombardment, as reconnaissance and assault detachments from the first echelons of the operational groups crossed the Amur, capturing bridgeheads near Sakhalian, Aihun, and Holomoching, coming into contact with Japanese outposts and covering forces. The 3rd and 12th Rifle Divisions commenced crossing the river shortly afterwards, less one regiment, east and west of Konstantinovka; the 396th Division and 368th Regiment near Blagoveshchensk and the 101st Fortified Region crossed south of Blagoveshchensk. Due to bridging equipment shortages, the army was not fully across the river until 16 August, forcing the piecemeal commitment of forces. Forward units continued to engage Japanese advanced positions south of Holomoching and north of Aihun on 12 August, as reinforcements landed. Sufficient troops to intensify the attack had arrived on the other bank of the Amur by 13 August, allowing the 3rd Rifle Division and 74th Tank Brigade to penetrate the Japanese defenses held by the 123rd Infantry Division's 269th Infantry Regiment on the heights northeast of Sunwu. A regiment from the 12th Division crossed the Amur east of Sunwu and advanced west along the Sunwu road, attacking the Japanese left flank. The 396th Division, 258th Tank Brigade and 368th Regiment pushed the 135th Independent Mixed Brigade back towards the main fortified region at Aihun, while small Japanese forces were destroyed by troops crossing the river father north at Huma and Santaoka. Fierce fighting took place on 14 and 15 August for the main fortified regions east and north of Sunwu. Supported by the 73rd Tank Brigade, the 3rd and 12th Divisions broke through Japanese defenses at Shenwutan, scattering a detachment from the 269th Regiment, and driving another back towards Nanyang Hill, just east of Sunwu, and attacking the 123rd Division's main forces in the Sunwu Fortified Region. Meanwhile, the 74th Tank Brigade, reinforced by a rifle company, artillery battalion, and an antitank regiment, moved south and bypassed Sunwu, advancing to cut the Sunwu‚ÄìPeian road. Taking advantage of the tank attack, the 396th Division and 368th Regiment advanced on Sunwu from the north, surrounding most of the 135th Brigade in the Aihun Fortified Region. A forward detachment was formed around the 74th Brigade to pursue the Japanese remnants southwest along the Nencheng road. The 369th Rifle Division's second echelon 614th Rifle Regiment and the 101st Fortified Region were tasked with reducing the Aihun and Sunwu fortified regions, as the operational groups marched in two routes towards Nencheng and Peian, more than 93 miles (150 kilometers) apart. The advance was slowed by bad weather and muddy and rutted roads, and two engineer sapper battalions were attached to the lead detachments of the operational groups to speed up the advance. For the next several days, the bypassed Japanese troops continued to defend the Sakhalian, Aihun and Sunwu fortified regions, launching frequent attacks against the Soviet troops. After further heavy artillery and bombing from the Soviet 18th Mixed Aviation Corps of the 10th Air Army, Japanese resistance slackened on 17 and 18 August, and many defenders surrendered or were destroyed. Around Sunwu, a total of 17,061 Japanese military personnel were captured, while 4,520 soldiers at Aihun did not surrender until 20 August. The Kwantung Army formally surrendered on 18 August, while the operational groups slowly advanced south, capturing Nencheng and Peian on 20 and 21 August, before moving towards Qiqihar and Harbin. The army reached Qiqihar on 21 August, where it linked up with troops from the 36th Army. The Japanese around the fortified regions were the most formidable faced by Soviet troops in the campaign, according to renowned historian David Glantz . The level of resistance and road conditions slowed the army's advance to an average of 20 kilometers a day, one of the lowest speeds of Soviet forces during the invasion; it advanced a depth of 200 kilometers into Manchuria. During the campaign, the army lost 645 killed, 1,817 wounded, and 74 missing. = Postwar = The 390th Rifle Division of the 5th Separate Rifle Corps was transferred to the army by 3September 1945, along with the 32nd Guards Tank Brigade. After the war, the army briefly became part of the Far Eastern Military District, formed from the 2nd Far Eastern Front on 10 September. It was disbanded there in November 1945, the headquarters officially dissolving on 15 December. The 390th and 396th Divisions were disbanded with the army, while the 3rd and 12th Divisions transferred to the 26th Rifle Corps of the 1st Red Banner Army in the Transbaikal-Amur Military District.

Trivia buffs often were when the writer of the show, Sherwood Schwartz threw out information on interview shows that was never mentioned in the series. Two prime examples were that Gilligan's first name being Willie and Mrs. Howell's first name being Eunice. Bob Denver, himself found that out during a Tonight Show interview almost twenty years later. Not much information was revealed about her life before being marooned with her fellow castaways, but she introduced herself in episode 6 of season 2 (\\"Quick Before It Sinks\\") as \\"Mrs. Thurston Howell III, from New York, Palm Beach and of course, Paris, mon cher\\". She also mentions in episode 17 of season 2: \\"You've Been Disconnected\\" that she spoke fluent French and Italian, hinting at a classical education. In episode 9 of season 3 (\\"Ring Around Gilligan\\"), Mr. Howell mentions her having studied at Vassar, saying \\"Mommy warned me about you Vassar girls and your long gym classes\\". During episode 4 of season 2: \\"Smile, You're on Mars Camera\\" Thurston Howell indicates that Lovey, or at least her family, had money of their own; Mr. Howell describes her as being an heiress who is \\"loaded\\". It is also revealed that Mrs. Howell's father gave them an oil company (apparently dry) in \\"Dustbowl, Oklahoma\\" as a wedding gift, which she claims he thought was a football stadium (episode 13 of season 1:\\"Three Million Dollars More or Less\\"). Two members of her family Mr. Howell cannot stand are her mother (Mr. Howell describes her as sounding like a screech owl and having fangs for teeth and claws for hands) and her brother. Mrs. Howell claims she was a member of the Daughters of the American Revolution (episode 30 of season 2, \\"'V' for Vitamins\\"), to have been presented at the Court of St. James, and to have been selected the \\"Queen of the Prune-Bowl Parade\\" (episode 30 of season 3, \\"Gilligan, the Goddess\\"). A favorite movie star of hers is silent movie star Mary Pickford (\\"Castaways Pictures Presents\\") Although spoiled and preoccupied with social status, Mrs. Howell was also kind and genuinely cared about the well-being of her fellow castaways. She frequently served as something of a mother figure to the two younger female castaways, Ginger Grant and Mary Ann Summers, offering advice (though she sometimes also displays jealousy toward the two younger women). One of the Island \\"visitors\\" she can't stand is socialite Erika-Tiffany Smith (played by Zsa Zsa Gabor) because her name appears before the Howells in the \\"Social Register\\". She also claims to be close friends with \\"Grace and Prince Rainier\\" on several episodes. Several times she acted as a motherly figure to Gilligan, such as psychoanalyzing him, adopting him, and praising him for his accomplishments when no one else did. She plotted with her husband several times to steal/access/manipulate things from the other survivors. She once tried to get Gilligan and Mary Ann to wed, kept a gold mine secret from the rest of the group, divulged secrets about stolen jewelry from a parrot, schemed to convince a burnt-out artist to leave the island, and got through to an uncivilized jungle boy played by Kurt Russell. Although she gives the impression of being physically frail, in one episode [\\"The Big Gold Strike\\"] she actually resorts to physical manual labor in order to extract gold from a mine; in another [\\"Ring Around Gilligan\\"], under the influence of Mad Dr. Balinkoff's ring, she executes a judo flip on her husband She adores dogs but is allergic to cats. It was said by Thurston Howell that their brilliance together was exceeded only by their greed. They also had a house in each state and several staffs of servants, including an upstairs maid, a downstairs maid and a butler who served him breakfast in bed. Thurston once said that the neighborhood of one million dollars apiece was considered a slum area where they resided. Although the Howells were portrayed as childless in the original series, their son Thurston Howell IV (portrayed by David Ruprecht) was introduced in the reunion movie The Harlem Globetrotters on Gilligan's Island.

Following completion of officer training, he saw duty in Korea and then in Washington, D.C., before being inactivated. Publisher of The New York Times Sulzberger became publisher of The New York Times in 1963, after the death of his sister Marian's husband, Orvil Dryfoos, who had been publisher for less than two years. Sulzberger was 37 at the time, the youngest publisher in Times history. Prior to Dryfoos, Sulzberger's father, Arthur Hays Sulzberger, and maternal grandfather, Adolph Ochs, were the publishers, and also the chairs of the board of The New York Times Company. In the 1960s Sulzberger built a large news-gathering staff at The Times. He was its publisher when the newspaper won a Pulitzer Prize in 1972 for publishing The Pentagon Papers.

In an attempt to maintain equality between Christians and Muslims, Article 24 of the constitution mandates the distribution of offices on the basis of Confessionalism as an interim measure, but does not specify how they are to be allocated. (See National Pact.) It does, nevertheless, specify that half the seats shall be given to Christians and half to Muslims. Article 24 in its entirety reads as follows. The constitution describes the flag of Lebanon. The original version of Article 5 read \\"The Lebanese flag is blue, white, red with a cedar in the white part\\". A change made on 7 December 1943 indicated that \\"The Lebanese flag is made of red, white and red horizontal stripes, with the cedar in green in the centre of the white stripe\\".

Naldi's birthname in this reference is also incorrectly cited as ‚ÄúDonna‚Äù. November 13, 1894 - February 17, 1961) was an American stage performer and silent film actress. She was often cast in theatrical and screen productions as a vamp, a persona first popularized by actress Theda Bara. Early life Nita Naldi was born in New York City to working class Irish parents, Julia (n√©e Cronin) and Patrick Dooley, in 1894.‚ÄúNina Naldi‚Äù, 23 Sahara Knights: Rudolf Valentino Film Festival, Rudolf Valentino Society and Publishing, LLC. Retrieved November 6, 2018. Known in her youth as Nonna, she was named in honor of her great aunt, Mary Nonna Dunphy, a nun who in 1879 had founded Academy of the Holy Angels in Fort Lee, New Jersey. Later, in 1910, young Nonna herself attended the Catholic school, the same year her father ‚Äú'left the family'‚Äù. Her mother's death in 1915 required Nonna to care for her two younger siblings. To support them and herself she took several jobs, including work as an artist's model and a cloak model. She soon entered vaudeville with her brother Frank, and by 1918 she was performing as a chorus girl at the Winter Garden Theatre in The Passing Show of 1918. Her appearance in that Broadway production led to more stage jobs, and soon Naldi found herself in the Ziegfeld Follies of 1918 and 1919. It was at this time when Nonna Dooley changed her name to \\"Nita Naldi,\\" which she adapted from the name of a childhood friend, Florence Rinaldi. Working under her new name, Naldi continued acting on Broadway; and after her well-received performance in The Bonehead, producer William A. Brady in 1920 offered her a role in his play Opportunity. Film career Naldi was asked to perform in a short film with Johnny Dooley, a Scottish comedian who, despite his last name, was unrelated to her. She soon quit the film, however, after realizing that Dooley had romantic intentions with another woman. Naldi was then offered a role in A Divorce of Convenience with Owen Moore. Following those two films, she had small roles in several independent films before being cast as the exotic character Gina in Paramount Pictures's 1920 release Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde starring John Barrymore. Barrymore himself reportedly recommended her for the role after he ‚Äúspotted‚Äù her dancing at the Winter Garden.‚ÄúNita Naldi of Silent Films Dies; Won Fame Opposite Valentino‚Äú, obituary, The New York Times, February 18, 1961, [unspecified page]. Obituary linked through ‚ÄúThe Hitchcock Zone‚Äù online collections. Retrieved November 5, 2018. Her noted performance in that film subsequently afforded Naldi more career opportunities. It also established her long-term friendship with Barrymore, who affectionately nicknamed her his ‚ÄúDumb Duse‚Äù. Naldi and Valentino in Blood and Sand, 1922Naldi was selected by Spanish author Vicente Blasco Ib√°√±ez for the role of Do√±a Sol in film version of his novel, Blood and Sand (1922). Naldi was signed by Famous Players-Lasky for the role, and it became her first pairing with screen idol Rudolph Valentino; the film was a major success, for it gave Naldi the image of a vamp, which would follow her for the rest of her life. Naldi and Valentino were never romantic, and she would be one of the few to befriend his wife Natacha Rambova though that friendship would sour when the Valentinos divorced. Naldi during this time posed for famous Peruvian artist Alberto Vargas, who painted her embracing a bust of a satyr. In Vargas's original ‚Äúpin-up‚Äù painting, Naldi is depicted topless, although copies of the portrait that were published and widely distributed in the 1920s, such as in the art and entertainment magazine Shadowland, were ‚Äúmodified‚Äù by the addition of clothing to cover her partially visible left breast.Nita Naldi by Alberto Vargas, image and information about painting. San Francisco Art Exchange, San Francisco, California. Retrieved November 5, 2018. While Valentino went on his one-man strike, which prevented him from appearing on film, Naldi took on several Famous Players-Lasky roles with growing importance including The Ten Commandments (1923), directed by Cecil B. DeMille. When Valentino returned and fixed his contract woes, she joined him for his final Famous Players-Lasky film, the now lost A Sainted Devil (1924). Naldi left the company soon after. Naldi featured in the August 1924 issue of Photoplay, where she is described as ‚ÄúSloe-eyed, and darkly beautiful‚Äù.‚ÄúNew Pictures‚Äù, portrait of Naldi by Edward Thayer Monroe with caption, Photoplay, August 1924, page 19. Internet Archive, San Francisco, California. Retrieved November 2, 2018.In 1924 the Valentinos and Naldi traveled to France in order to do research for the film The Hooded Falcon which was never made. Upon returning to California, the duo made Cobra. The film was not well received, and Cobra became the last film in which Naldi and Valentino starred together. The Valentinos' marriage was ending around this time. After Valentino signed a contract with United Artists, he banned Rambova from the set. She was given her own film as a consolation. Naldi starred in Rambova's 1925 production What Price Beauty? The film suffered distribution problems, was barely noted at the time, but is noteworthy for being actress Myrna Loy's first screen appearance. After finishing the Dorothy Gish film Clothes Make the Pirate, Naldi left for France for a short vacation, where she married J. Searle Barclay during this time. Despite multiple rumors that she had retired, Naldi began work on several films, including Alfred Hitchcock's second directorial effort, 1926's The Mountain Eagle. She is often mistakenly credited for appearing in Hitchcock's The Pleasure Garden. Naldi made two films in France and one in Italy before retiring. Despite having an acceptable voice, Naldi never made a ‚Äútalkie‚Äù. Later life Due to the financial reversals caused by her retirement from films, as well as the Great Depression, Naldi filed for bankruptcy in 1932. She went back to the stage with Queer People and The Firebird in 1933. The press had been critical of her weight since 1924, but reviews of her appearances in both plays were especially harsh this time around ‚Äî so harsh in fact that Naldi filed suit against one paper in 1934 for $500,000. The suit was dismissed in 1938. In 1942, Naldi was considered for For Whom the Bell Tolls but did not receive the part. She never made another film. That same year she began appearing in a revue in New York with Mae Murray reciting the 1897 poem \\"A Fool There Was\\" in full kitsch. In 1952, she had a notable role in the play In Any Language, co-starring the legendary stage actress Uta Hagen. In 1955, she coached Carol Channing how to vamp, for Channing's new musical The Vamp. Channing would be nominated for a Tony award for Best Actress in a Musical for that role. During the 1952 presidential election, she supported Adlai Stevenson in his campaignMotion Picture and Television Magazine, November 1952, page 33, Ideal Publishers. Also in the 1950s, Naldi appeared on the television series Omnibus. Personal life \\"Nita Naldi with a statue of a faun\\", by Alberto Vargas, 1923. In 1929, seven years after the success of Blood and Sand, Naldi was named as a party in the divorce proceedings between 54-year-old millionaire J. Searle Barclay from his wife of 16 years. Barclay and Naldi had met during her stage career a decade earlier and had lived together with her sister in New York since 1920. The pair married in France in August 1929. Naldi, alone, returned to the United States two years later and then filed for bankruptcy in 1934. Naldi did not speak publicly about Barclay until after his death in 1945. He died penniless. Despite Hollywood gossip and published rumors, Naldi denied ever being romantically involved with either Valentino or Barrymore. In 1956 she was also rumored to be engaged to a Park Avenue man named Larry Hall, but no union took place. Naldi had no children. Death Naldi spent her final years in New York City, where she died of a heart attack in her hotel room at the Wentworth Hotel on West 46th Street on February 19, 1961, about three months after her 66th birthday. She was buried in the family plot at Calvary Cemetery in Queens, New York.

The speculation has largely centered on the familial incidence of hereditary diseases and circumstantial evidence, and is not widely believed. Succession crisis Princess Charlotte Augusta of Wales Princess Charlotte of Wales was the only daughter and heiress presumptive of the Prince Regent (later King George IV). Her death in childbirth in 1817 set off a race between the Prince Regent's brothers, the six surviving younger sons of King George III, to see who could father a legitimate heir. Some of the brothers had been previously involved in scandals. Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany, the second in line to the throne, was amicably separated from his wife, Princess Frederica Charlotte of Prussia. The sixth son, Prince Augustus Frederick, Duke of Sussex, had contracted two marriages in contravention of the Royal Marriages Act 1772 (as had the Prince Regent before his marriage to Charlotte's mother). Three brothers, the third, fourth and seventh in line to the throne, married in 1818: Prince William, Duke of Clarence; Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn; and Prince Adolphus, Duke of Cambridge. The fifth son, Prince Ernest Augustus, Duke of Cumberland, was already married. The Duke of Clarence married Princess Adelaide of Saxe-Meiningen. Though he had been able to father ten illegitimate children with an earlier mistress, none of his children by his wife survived childhood. The second daughter, Elizabeth, lived the longest, being born on 10 December 1820 and dying on 4 March 1821. The next son to produce an heir was the Duke of Cambridge, whose son George was born on 26 March 1819. He would be displaced two months later by the birth of a daughter to the Duke of Kent and his wife. Their first and only child was Princess Victoria. She was born on 24 May 1819, just three days before the son of the Duke of Cumberland, also called George. Both George III and the Duke of Kent died in January 1820. The Prince Regent became George IV and Victoria was third in line to the throne after her uncles, the Duke of York and Duke of Clarence (the future William IV). She would ultimately take the throne as Queen Victoria in 1837. A pedigree showing the succession of Victoria to the throne Controversy Sir John Conroy in an 1837 painting by Henry William Pickersgill Rumours about Victoria's parentage centred on a controversial Irish soldier and adventurer called Sir John Conroy who was her mother's private secretary and the comptroller of her household. The Duchess of Kent was the same age as Conroy, whereas she was nineteen years younger than her husband; the court gossiped openly about their relationship. After the Duke's death Conroy assumed a parental role towards Victoria that she bitterly resented. This caused a near permanent rift between Victoria and her mother, as well as between the Duchess and her brother-in-law, William IV. Conroy expected that when Victoria became queen he would be made her private secretary, but instead one of her first acts as monarch was to dismiss him from her household. The belief that the Duchess and Conroy were lovers was widespread. When asked by Charles Greville whether he believed they were lovers, the Duke of Wellington replied that he \\"supposed so\\". The Duke later recounted a story that when Victoria was young she had caught Conroy and the Duchess engaged in what were diplomatically called \\"some familiarities\\".. Wellington reported that she told Baroness Louise Lehzen, who told her close ally, Madame de Sp√§th, who confronted the Duchess about her behaviour. According to Wellington, the Duchess of Kent was furious and promptly dismissed de Sp√§th. Victoria, when queen, appears to have disputed the story, stating that her mother's piety would have prevented any undue familiarity with Conroy.. Genetics A. N. Wilson suggested that Victoria's father could not have been the Duke of Kent for two reasons: * The sudden appearance of h√¶mophilia in the descendants of Victoria. The illness did not exist in the royal family before. * The supposed disappearance of porphyria from the descendants of Victoria. According to Wilson, the disease was prevalent in the royal family before Victoria but not afterwards. Both arguments can be countered. Since h√¶mophilia is X-linked, in order for a father to transmit the condition he must have it himself, but Conroy was healthy. H√¶mophiliacs were unlikely to survive in the early nineteenth century, given the poor state of medicine at the time. Indeed, life expectancy was 11 years or younger, even into the later half of the twentieth century, and is still as low in developing countries. Nor is there evidence of h√¶mophilia in either Conroy's ancestors or descendants, or any mention of any h√¶mophiliacs in any document associated with the Kents. It is likely that the mutation arose spontaneously because the Duke of Kent was in his 50s when Victoria was conceived; h√¶mophilia-causing mutations arise more frequently in the children of older fathers, and spontaneous mutations account for about 30% of cases. With regard to porphyria (which famously George III may have had), there is no genetic evidence that the royal family even had the disease and its diagnosis in George III's case (and others) has been questioned. If the diagnosis of hereditary porphyria is correct, it may have continued among descendants of Victoria. At least two of her descendants, Charlotte, Duchess of Saxe- Meiningen, and Prince William of Gloucester are suspected of having suffered from it. Concrete evidence on the origins of the h√¶mophilia disease and paternity of Victoria could be achieved with a DNA test of her or her parents' remains, but no such study has been sanctioned by the Royal Family.

An intern need not have attained a professional degree in architecture to begin accruing experience hours, but said degree is a prerequisite for licensure. In the United States, Canada, and other countries, an intern architect is enrolled in a regulated program, such as the Intern Development Program (IDP) in the United States or the Intern Architect Program (IAP) in Canada, while working under the supervision of a licensed architect and preparing for professional registration exams. The use of the title \\"architect\\" (or any derivation thereof) is legally protected in the United States, Canada, and other countries. Most U.S. states and all Canadian provinces, however, allow the use of the terms \\"intern architect\\" or \\"architectural intern\\" for a person enrolled in an architectural internship program. Intern Development Program (United States) The Intern Development Program (IDP) is a national program, developed and administered by NCARB, in the United States designed to provide structured training for Intern Architects to ensure that they are exposed to most aspects of the architectural profession prior to attaining professional licensure. A candidate works under the tutelage of one or more architects as mentor(s) on a regular basis. Additionally, the intern architect selects a sponsor, who is an architect who does not work for the firm where the intern is employed. Together, the mentor and the sponsor work with the intern to make sure that the intern is actively working towards satisfying the requirements of the IDP program. The program prescribes the minimum experience hours required in various activities pertaining to practice in architecture before attaining professional licensure. Interns track these hours using experience reports that are verified and confirmed by their mentor. These activities fall into four categories: Pre-Design, Design, Project Management, and Practice Management, each of which includes tasks that architects will perform as part of their professional responsibilities. In total, interns must complete 5600 hours of reported experience before attaining professional licensure. In most states Interns may begin taking the Architect Registration Examination (ARE) while they are participating in the Intern Development Program, but will not attain professional licensure before successful completion of both the ARE and IDP. =History= The IDP was created jointly in the 1970s by the National Council of Architectural Registration Boards (NCARB) and the American Institute of Architects (AIA) and is administered by NCARB.IDP Overview Intern Architect Program (Canada) The Intern Architect Program (IAP) is a national program in Canada that documents and evaluates internship activities, provides structure to the transition between education and registration, and encourages involvement of practitioners in the development of new architects. The IAP was established by the Committee of Canadian Architectural Councils (CCAC), which has representatives from each of the ten provincial associations of architects.

During that time, daily circulation rose from 465,000 to 713,000 and Sunday circulation from 745,000 to 1.4 million; the staff more than doubled, reaching 5,200; advertising linage grew from 19 million to 62 million column inches per year; and gross income increased almost sevenfold, reaching 117 million dollars. Life Sulzberger was born in New York City on September 12, 1891. His parents were Cyrus Leopold Sulzberger, a cotton-goods merchant, and Rachel Peixotto Hays. They came from old Jewish families, Ashkenazi and Sephardic, respectively. His great-great-grandfather, Benjamin Seixas, brother of the famous rabbi and American Revolutionary Gershom Mendes Seixas of Congregation Shearith Israel, was one of the founders of the New York Stock Exchange. His great-grandfather, Dr. Daniel Levy Maduro Peixotto, was a prominent physician, director of Columbia University's Medical College and a member of the Philolexian Society. His great-granduncle was Jacob Hays, the High Constable of New York from 1801 to 1850. Sulzberger graduated from the Horace Mann School in 1909 and graduated from Columbia College in 1913, and married Iphigene Bertha Ochs in 1917. In 1918 he began working at the Times, and became publisher when his father-in-law, Adolph Ochs, the previous Times publisher, died in 1935. In 1929, he founded Columbia's original Jewish Advisory Board and served on the board of what became Columbia-Barnard Hillel for many years. He served as a University trustee from 1944 to 1959 and is honored with a floor at the journalism school. He also served as a trustee of the Rockefeller Foundation from 1939 to 1957. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1950. In 1954, Sulzberger received The Hundred Year Association of New York's Gold Medal Award \\"in recognition of outstanding contributions to the City of New York.\\" In 1956 Sulzberger received the Elijah Parish Lovejoy Award as well as an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from Colby College. In 1961, he was succeeded as publisher first by son-in-law Orvil Dryfoos, then, two years later in 1963, by his son Arthur Ochs \\"Punch\\" Sulzberger. Sulzberger broadened the Times‚Äô use of background reporting, pictures, and feature articles, and expanded its sections. He supervised the development of facsimile transmission for photographs and built the Times radio station, WQXR, into a leading vehicle for news and music. Under Sulzberger the Times began to publish editions in Paris and Los Angeles with remote-control typesetting machines. He once stated \\"...I certainly do not advocate that the mind should be so open that the brains fall out\\". Sulzberger is also credited with the quote: \\"We journalists tell the public which way the cat is jumping. The public will take care of the cat.\\" He died December 11, 1968 in New York City. Political commitments A practicing Reform Jew, Sulzberger was an enthusiastic supporter of the American Council for Judaism, founded in June 1942 to oppose Zionism, giving it prominent coverage in his newspaper. In a 1946 speech, Sulzberger claimed that Zionism was to blame for some of the Jewish deaths in the Holocaust, and that the refugee crisis during the war had been ‚Äúa manageable, social and economic problem‚Äù until ‚Äúthe clamor for statehood introduced an political element‚Äù into the issue. ‚ÄúIt is my judgment that thousands dead might now be alive‚Äù if ‚Äúthe Zionists‚Äù had put ‚Äúless emphasis on statehood‚Äù. His stand against Zionism and a Jewish state of Israel on principle has been accused by Laurel Leff in her 2005 book Buried by the Times of deliberately burying accounts of Nazi atrocities against Jews in the back pages of the Times. She alleges that Sulzberger went out of his way to play down the special victimhood of Jews and withheld support for specific rescue programs for European Jews. Personal life In 1917, he married Iphigene Bertha Ochs, the daughter of Adolph Ochs and Effie Wise (a daughter of Rabbi Isaac Mayer Wise). They had four children: Marian Sulzberger Heiskell (1918‚Äì2019), widow first of Times publisher Orvil Dryfoos and then of Time Inc. chairman Andrew Heiskell; Ruth Sulzberger Holmberg (1921‚Äì2017), publisher of the Chattanooga Times, married and divorced from Ben Hale Golden; Judith Sulzberger Rosenschein Cohen Levinson (1923‚Äì2011), physician, married Matthew Rosenschein Jr. (divorced), Dick Cohen (divorced), and Budd Levinson; and Arthur Ochs Sulzberger (1926‚Äì2012).New York Magazine: \\"Children of the Times - Who's who in the Ochs-Sulzberger clan\\" retrieved September 27, 2015 References *The Trust: The Private and Powerful Family Behind The New York Times, Susan E.

It was named for renowned African American educator and Bloomfield, Kentucky native Harvey Clarence Russell Sr. Its boundaries are West Market Street, 9th Street, West Broadway and I-264. History Development began in the 1870s as street car lines were extended to the area. The area was considered one of Louisville's most fashionable in its early years with many affluent white families building elegant mansion homes on Walnut, Chestnut Street, and Jefferson Streets, while working class blacks and whites lived in shotgun houses on adjacent streets. By the 1890s many white families began leaving the area for what would become Old Louisville and the east end, and both middle and working class blacks quickly moved into the area. By the 1940s Russell had become \\"Louisville's Harlem\\" as African American theaters, restaurants, and night clubs lined area streets. However, in the years following World War II many of the middle class blacks left for newly integrated neighborhoods on the south and east ends. Urban renewal efforts in the 1960s had the area's business districts razed and many public housing units built. America's first public library open to African-Americans is in Russell. The Western Branch of the Louisville Free Public Library, on 10th Street off Chestnut, opened in 1908. Demographics As of 2000, the population of Russell was 9,060 .

Its body is in length ‚Äì slightly larger than a house fly ‚Äì and has brilliant, metallic, blue-green or golden coloration with black markings. It has short, sparse black bristles (setae) and three cross-grooves on the thorax. The wings are clear with light brown veins, and the legs and antennae are black. The larvae of the fly may be used for maggot therapy, are commonly used in forensic entomology, and can be the cause of myiasis in livestock and pets. Description 152x152px Macro image of the head The defining characteristic of L. sericata and the one most used when identifying the adult fly is the presence of three bristles on the dorsal mesothorax, located on the middle of the back of the fly. L. sericata is almost identical to its sister species, L. cuprina, and identification between them requires microscopic examination of two main distinguishing characteristics. L. sericata is blue- black, as opposed to L. cuprina, which has a metallic green femoral joint in the first pair of legs. Also, when looking at the occipital setae, L. sericata has one to nine bristles on each side, while L. cuprina has three or less. Distribution and habitat 182x182px Lucilia sericata is common all over the temperate and tropical regions of the planet, including Europe, Africa and Australia. It prefers warm and moist climates and accordingly is especially common in coastal regions, but can also be found in arid areas. The female lays her eggs in carrion of all kinds, sometimes in the skin or hair of live animals, causing myiasis. The larvae feed on decaying organic tissue. The fly favours host species of the genus Ovis, domestic sheep in particular, and sometimes lays eggs in the wet wool of living sheep. This can lead to blowfly strike, causing problems for sheep farmers. L. sericata has been known to prefer lower elevations relative to other Calliphoridae species, such as Calliphora vomitoria. Life history Green bottle fly found in Lodi, California. The life cycle of Lucilia sericata is typical of flies in the family Calliphoridae. After the female deposits the egg, it hatches into a larva that passes through three instars as it grows, then enters prepupal and pupal stages (which can eclose quickly or overwinter depending on temperature) before emerging into the adult stage or imago. To start, the female lays a mass of eggs in carrion. The eggs hatch between nine hours and three days after being deposited on the host, with eggs laid in warmer weather hatching more quickly than those in cooler weather. In this, they differ from the more opportunistic Sarcophagidae, which lay hatching eggs or completely hatched larvae into carrion and cut out the time it takes the eggs to hatch. The flies are extremely prolific; a single female L. sericata typically lays 150‚àí200 eggs per clutch and may produce 2,000 to 3,000 eggs in her lifetime. The pale yellow or grayish conical larvae, like those of most blow flies, have two posterior spiracles through which they respire. The larvae are moderately sized, ranging from 10 to 14 millimeters long. The larva feeds on dead or necrotic tissue for 3 to 10 days, depending on temperature and the quality of the food. During this period the larva passes through three larval instars. At a temperature of 16 ¬∞C, the first larval instar lasts about 53 hours, the second about 42 hours and the third about 98 hours. At higher temperatures (27 ¬∞C) the first larval instar lasts about 31 hours, the second about 12 hours, and the third about 40 hours. Third-instar larvae enter a \\"wandering\\" stage and drop off the host to find an appropriate location with soft enough soil, where they bury themselves to enter a pupal stage, which usually lasts from 6 to 14 days. Burial allows the pupa to more reliably avoid desiccation or predation. The larger the larva, the farther it will be able to travel to find a suitable location to pupate; L. sericata are noted to be remarkably active and can travel over 100 feet before pupating. However, if the temperature is suitably low, a pupa might overwinter in the soil until the temperature rises. After emerging from the pupa, the adult feeds opportunistically on nectar, pollen, feces, or carrion while it matures. Adults usually lay eggs about 2 weeks after they emerge. Their complete life cycle typically ranges from 2 to 3 weeks, but this varies with seasonal and other environmental circumstances. L. sericata usually completes three or four generations each year in cold, temperate climates, and more in warmer regions.  Food resources  Adult L. sericata feeding on nectar The larvae of L. sericata feed exclusively on dead organic tissue; as the eggs are laid directly into carrion, they are able to feed on the corpse they hatch into until they are ready to pupate. The adults are more varied in their diets, eating carrion and feces as well as pollen and nectar, meaning that they are important pollinators in their native range as well as important agents of decomposition. The pollen (which the flies are capable of digesting, perhaps with the assistance of bacteria in their digestive tracts) may be used as an alternative protein source, especially for gravid females who need large amounts of protein and cannot reliably find carrion. Notably, gravid flies are particularly attracted to sapromyophilous flowers that exude a carrion-like odor, such as the dead horse arum lily. These flowers are tricking the flies into pollinating them by mimicking the scent of a corpse. However, the flies also frequently visit myophilous flowers such as the oxeye daisy, and are attracted to the color yellow as well as to the scent of flowers. This indicates that the flies are attracted to flowers not only because they smell like carrion (in the case of the arum lily), but specifically for the pollen offered by the flower (in the case of myophilous flowers).  Parental care  L. sericata females lay their eggs on fresh carrion, avoiding older carrion because it can be detrimental to offspring (possibly due to bacterial activity or other factors). Like many blowflies, female L. sericata perform aggregated oviposition, laying their egg masses in carcasses that other flies are also ovipositing in. The presence of female flies eating or ovipositing on a carcass may attract other female flies to do the same, perhaps through chemical cues. Females exhibit preference for certain oviposition conditions over others; they attempt to maximize the survival potential of their offspring by laying eggs in only the best places. They often select natural orifices or wet fur, though they do not tend to oviposit in wounds, as is mistakenly thought by many. Gravid L. sericata prefer warm temperatures for their offspring, since this will decrease development time and therefore increase survival, and they will oviposit faster and with more eggs in warmer carrion. Egg load peaks at 30 degrees C. Research also suggests that sulfur compounds and indole are the major factors attracting gravid flies to carrion, raising the possibility that these compounds could be used to attract flies to traps in order to control them in agricultural settings.  Social behavior  = Mating = L. sericata mating The courtship process of L. sericata is complex and consists of several stages of display on the part of the male. First, the male identifies a potential mate and pushes her with his head; he then taps her with his foreleg multiple times. The male then mounts the female and attempts copulation, continuing to tap his foreleg on her body. If the female is receptive the copulation proceeds, genital contact is achieved, and when the process is over both individuals move away. If she is not receptive, the female will kick at the male with her hind legs, but this is not usually successful at dismounting the male and the mating proceeds nevertheless. Some males are left-biased and some males are right-biased in their foreleg tapping, but this bias does not appear to have an effect on their mating success.  Mate detection  Males are able to recognize potential mates by the frequency at which the light from their iridescent bodies glints through their wings, using the fast and precise visual processing that many flies rely upon for their manoeuverability and agility in flight. They interpret these flashes to assess the age and sex of a potential mate. Under direct sunlight there is a reflected flash at each wingbeat. Males recognise fertile females by light flashing at the frequency at which they flap their wings - slower than young males or old flies of either sex. Eichorn et al. (2017) showed that male L. sericata show a strong preference for a diode flashing alternately on and off at 178 Hz over an immobilized female, 178 Hz being the characteristic wing-beat frequency of a young female L. sericata, over constant light on the same female. This shows that, close-up, sexually active males recognize a flash frequency rather than an attraction by sight or smell. Males preferred a diode flashing at 178 Hz to a diode flashing at other frequencies. L. sericata mate less frequently on cloudy days, suggesting that they rely on direct sunlight flashing through or off or between their wings to recognize potential mates. = Grouping = The larvae of L. sericata are highly gregarious, to the point that their survival depends upon grouping. The aggregated oviposition behavior of gravid L. sericata females leads to large aggregates of same-age larvae, which have been shown to experience faster development and lower predation as opposed to smaller aggregates or aggregates of variously-aged larvae. The resulting larval masses are able to thermoregulate, raising their own temperature and therefore decreasing their development time, leading to better survival. This thermoregulation may result from the way larvae forage; they are constantly moving and turning over, which could at least in part lead to the temperature rise experienced in larval masses. They also benefit from the digestive power of multiple other larvae. Each larva secretes digestive enzymes and then consumes the resulting dissolved meat around it. If more larvae are present they secrete more digestive enzymes, which dissolve more meat and make food more accessible for the whole group. This easy access to food also contributes to a shorter development time. These benefits are present not only in single- species masses of larvae, but also in mixed-species groupings. Both single- species and mixed groups of larvae have also been shown to have the ability to make collective decisions, perhaps by using signals that are shared between species. In this manner, groups of larvae are able to collectively choose a preferred feeding spot, allowing them all to benefit from their collective digestive abilities and thermoregulation. Similarly, if a group of larvae becomes too large and overcrowding begins to cut into the benefits of heat and collective digestion, larval masses can \\"decide\\" to split in two and move to separate areas of a cadaver. These collective larval decisions (and indeed the formation of larval masses themselves) are the result of chemical cues that larvae leave behind them as they crawl along the carrion, which other larvae are predisposed to follow; the result is that the more larvae are in a particular area, the more other larvae will join them.  Importance to humans  =Forensic importance= L. sericata is an important species to forensic entomologists. Like most calliphorids, L. sericata has been heavily studied and its life cycle and habits are well documented. Accordingly, the stage of its development on a corpse is used to calculate a minimum post mortem interval, so that it can be used to aid in determining the time of death of the victim. The presence or absence of L. sericata can provide information about the conditions of the corpse. If the insects seem to be on the path of their normal development, the corpse likely has been undisturbed. If, however, the insect shows signs of a disturbed life cycle, or is absent from a decaying body, this suggests post mortem tampering with the body. Because L. sericata is one of the first insects to colonize a corpse, it is preferred to many other species in determining an approximate time of colonization, and thus time of death of the victim. Developmental progress is determined with relative accuracy by measuring the length and weight of larvae at various instars while taking into account the temperature, which can affect development time to a large extent. =Veterinary importance= Many blow flies have an impact in veterinary science, and L. sericata is no exception. In places such as the UK and Australia, L. sericata is commonly referred to as the \\"sheep blowfly\\" since sheep are its primary host in those regions. Although it affects mainly sheep, L. sericata is not host-specific. Sheep, common to Northern Europe In northern Europe, the fly often lays its eggs in sheep wool. The larvae then migrate down the wool where they feed directly on the skin surface in a process called myiasis. This can cause massive lesions and secondary bacterial infections, causing serious problems for sheep farmers. In the UK, blowfly strike affects an estimated 1 million sheep, as well as 80% of sheep farms each year. This causes a huge economic impact in regions affected by blowfly strike. Not only does it cost money to treat infected animals, but measures also must be taken to control L. sericata. A simple and effective way to reduce the incidence of such infection is to shear ewes regularly and to dock their tails, removing areas where thick wool can stay damp for long periods of time. Enacting simple sanitary measures can reduce blowfly strike. For example, timely and proper disposal of carcasses and proper removal of feces are effective measures. Moving sheep from warm, humid, and sheltered areas to more open areas can also help to reduce blowfly strike, for this eliminates conditions conducive to fly development. Trapping systems such as sticky paper may be used to control fly numbers. Treating a flock with chemical agents can be costly, but can aid greatly in maintaining the resistance of the flock to L. sericata. For instance, plunge dipping in diazinon can directly kill the fly on contact. This method works from 3 to 8 weeks in controlling the fly. An alternative chemical method is a pyrethroid pour-on, which lasts 6 to 10 weeks depending on the type of pyrethroid used. Cryomazine and dicylanil, which are insect growth regulators, are also effective and last from 10 to 16 weeks. However, chemical treatment is not ideal, though it can be very effective, because it is costly, tedious, and takes up a lot of time. =Medical importance= L. sericata has been of medical importance since 1826, when Meigen removed larvae from the eyes and facial cavities of a human patient. L. sericata has shown promise in three separate clinical approaches. First, larvae have been shown to debride wounds with extremely low probability of myiasis upon clinical application. Larval secretions have been shown to help in tissue regeneration. L. sericata has also been shown to lower bacteremia levels in patients infected with MRSA. Essentially, L. sericata larvae can be used as biosurgery agents in cases where antibiotics and surgery are impractical. Larval secretions in vitro enhance fibroblast migration to the wound site, improving wound closure. Larval therapy of L. sericata is highly recommended for the treatment of wounds infected with Gram-positive bacteria, yet is not as effective for wounds infected with Gram-negative bacteria. Also, bacteria from the genus Vagococcus were resistant to the maggot excreta/secreta. Attempts are currently ongoing to extract or synthesize the chymotrypsins found in larval secretions to destroy MRSA without application of the larvae. Myiasis by L. sericata has been reported, including a case of a dual genital infestation of a married couple wherein the larvae were transmitted from the wife's vagina to the husband's penis through sexual intercourse. Continuing research Due to this species' high forensic interest, extensive research on its life cycle has been conducted. The ongoing medical research, however, centered around the secretions produced by L. sericata as an agent against MRSA and VRSA, and the larval applications for maggot therapy. A new antimicrobial agent was isolated from L. sericata secretions and patented under the name Seraticin. Efforts are geared toward making medical professionals more familiar to the current techniques. Like many other ectoparasites, L. sericata has a huge economic impact on farmers, so many studies and research projects have been put in place since the late 1980s to help farmers reduce their impact. Research is also being conducted on less chemical-intensive measures to combat blowfly strike, since chemical dipping and pouring is not only expensive and time- consuming but also toxic.

The exam is also accepted by 11 provincial and territorial architectural associations for architectural registration in Canada. The ARE assesses candidates on the knowledge, skills, and abilities required for providing services in the practice of architecture. The ARE is developed and maintained by the National Council of Architectural Registration Boards (NCARB). NCARB currently offers ARE 5.0, which features six divisions that align to the experience areas of the Architectural Experience Program (AXP). Both versions are administered in Prometric test centers across the United States and Canada, as well as many international locations. History The earliest examinations were written and scored by each individual state board. Practicing architects, educators, and specialists in other disciplines were organized to prepare and score these tests. Since each state prepared its own test specifications, test questions, and passing standard, there was little uniformity among the boards on examination, no effective reciprocity system, and no equal protection for the public across the nation. As NCARB grew, it organized delegates from its Member Boards into working groups during its Annual Meetings to address the problem of exam uniformity. Their efforts eventually led to agreement on a syllabus of written examination subjects. Subsequently, the length of each test and the dates of administration were agreed on, and this concurrence served to achieve the goal of greater consistency in examination questions and scoring. By the late 1950s, standardized testing had made impressive progress. The NCARB examination committees studied the latest developments and converted sections of the syllabus to a multiple-choice format by the mid-1960s and made them available to all of NCARB Member Boards. In 1979, NCARB conducted an extensive \\"task analysis and validation study\\" that led to the development of the forerunner of today's ARE. At that time, candidates were required to take all nine divisions over a four-day period and the exam was only offered once a year in major cities across the United States. In the late 1980s, as the practice of architecture moved into the computer age, NCARB began to develop a computer- based exam. After a decade of research and development, the last paper-and- pencil test was issued in 1996, and the computer-based exam rolled out in 1997. NCARB conducted comprehensive Practice Analysis studies in 2001, 2007, and 2012 that led to improvements of the ARE. These improvements have since been rolled out in ARE 3.0, ARE 3.1, ARE 4.0, and ARE 5.0, which launched November 1, 2016. ARE 4.0 retired on June 30, 2018. Eligibility Before an ARE division can be scheduled, candidates must be approved to test and receive eligibilities from their state board. The majority of states participate in NCARB's eligibility services, which enable NCARB to manage a candidate‚Äôs eligibilities. Most states require completion of a professional degree from the National Architectural Accrediting Board (NAAB) (B.Arch or M.Arch), and some require candidates to record professional experience before testing. Process In order to take the ARE, candidates must meet the requirements of the registration board he or she plans to receive an initial license from, establish an NCARB Record, and receive an Authorization to Test (ATT).Getting Started With the ARE Each division of the ARE is taken separately at a Prometric test center. Divisions are scored by Prometric as either pass or fail and then sent to the jurisdiction that grants the candidate the authorization to test, which then notifies the candidate. A pass score is valid for five years, sometime less depending on the jurisdiction's rules. Prior to October 2014, a candidate who failed a division would not be eligible to retake that division for six months; NCARB shortened that time to 60 days for all tests taken since August 2014. Under the requirements of NCARB's Rolling Clock, a candidate must pass all divisions of the ARE within five years. Some jurisdictions require the exam be completed in less time.NCARB Rolling Clock Difficulty The ARE assesses candidates‚Äô knowledge, skills, and ability to practice architecture independently. It focuses on those services that most affect the health, safety, and welfare of the public. Because of this, the exams are rigorous and require demonstration of competency in each of the testing areas. Test structure NCARB currently offers one version of the exam: ARE 5.0. = ARE 3.0 = The ARE 3.0 was introduced in February 1996 and its use was discontinued on February 26, 2006. It utilized a similar structure to 4.0. Graphic vignettes and multiple choice questions were on separate tests. = ARE 3.1 = The ARE 3.1 was introduced on February 27, 2006. Use was discontinued in 2009. * Pre-Design (105 MC questions) * General Structures (85 MC questions) * Lateral Forces (75 MC questions) * Mechanical and Electrical Systems (105 MC questions) * Building Design/Materials and Methods (105 MC questions) * Construction Documents & Services (115 MC questions) * Site Planning (Site zoning, site Grading, and Site Design vignettes) * Building Planning (Interior layout and schematic design vignettes) * Building Technology (Building section, structural layout, accessibility/ramp, mechanical and electrical plan, stair design and roof plan vignettes) =ARE 4.0= The ARE 4.0 was introduced in July 2008 and consists of seven divisions: *Programming, Planning & Practice (85 multiple choice and fill-in questions, and one site zoning vignette) *Site Planning & Design (65 multiple choice and fill-in questions, and two vignettes: site grading and site planning) *Building Design & Construction Systems (85 multiple choice and fill-in questions, and three vignettes in accessibility, roof plan and stair design) *Schematic Design (two vignettes in building layout and interior layout) *Structural Systems (125 multiple choice and fill-in questions, and one structural layout vignette) *Building Systems (95 multiple choice and fill-in questions, and one mechanical & electrical plan vignette) *Construction Documentation & Services (100 multiple choice and fill-in questions, and one building section vignette) *ARE 4.0 was available through June 30, 2018. =ARE 5.0= ARE 5.0 was introduced in November 2016 and consists of six divisions. These divisions include multiple-choice questions, check-all-that-apply, fill-in-the-blank, hotspot, drag-and-place, and case study questions. *Practice Management (80 items) *Project Management (95 items) *Programming & Analysis (95 items) *Project Planning & Design (120 items) *Project Development & Documentation (120 items) *Construction & Evaluation (95 items) Exam confidentiality All NCARB tests are held in strict security and confidence and are protected by U.S. copyright laws. Before beginning the test, candidates are required to accept NCARB's Confidentiality Agreement, which prohibits any disclosure of exam content. Candidates found to have violated the Confidentiality Agreement are referred to NCARB's Committee on Professional Conduct. The Committee reviews each case and then recommends a disciplinary action. The cases are then forwarded to the NCARB Board of Directors for review and final disciplinary action. All disciplinary actions taken by the Board of Directors are final and become a part of each individual's permanent NCARB Record. Individual candidates may also be subject to additional disciplinary measures from their state board. When exam content is disclosed, NCARB works with the test consultant, Prometric, to determine the impact on the exam. If NCARB finds that it is necessary to remove (or turn off) content, the ability to continuously deliver the ARE is seriously jeopardized.Exam Security See also * Examination for Architects in Canada * Architectural Experience Program (AXP) * National Council of Architectural Registration Boards (NCARB) References External links * NCARB ** ARE Homepage ** ARE History ** ARE Pass Rates ** Preparing for the ARE * Examination for Architects in Canada website Category:Professional certification in architecture ","title":"Architect Registration Examination"},{"id":"2171258","text":"Interspersed repetitive DNA is found in all eukaryotic genomes. They differ from tandem repeat DNA in that rather than the repeat sequences coming right after one another, they are dispersed throughout the genome and nonadjacent. The sequence that repeats can vary depending on the type of organism, and many other factors. Certain classes of interspersed repeat sequences propagate themselves by RNA mediated transposition; they have been called retrotransposons, and they constitute 25‚Äì40% of most mammalian genomes. Some types of interspersed repetitive DNA elements allow new genes to evolve by uncoupling similar DNA sequences from gene conversion during meiosis. Intrachromosomal and interchromosomal gene conversion Gene conversion acts on DNA sequence homology as its substrate. There is no requirement that the sequence homologies lie at the allelic positions on their respective chromosomes or even that the homologies lie on different chromosomes. Gene conversion events can occur between different members of a gene family situated on the same chromosome. When this happens, it is called intrachromosomal gene conversion as distinguished from interchromosomal gene conversion. The effect of homogenizing DNA sequences is the same. Role of interspersed repetitive DNA Repetitive sequences play the role of uncoupling the gene conversion network, thereby allowing new genes to evolve. The shorter Alu or SINE repetitive DNA are specialized for uncoupling intrachromosomal gene conversion while the longer LINE repetitive DNA are specialized for uncoupling interchromosomal gene conversion. In both cases, the interspersed repeats block gene conversion by inserting regions of non-homology within otherwise similar DNA sequences. The homogenizing forces linking DNA sequences are thereby broken and the DNA sequences are free to evolve independently. This leads to the creation of new genes and new species during evolution. By breaking the links that would otherwise overwrite novel DNA sequence variations, interspersed repeats catalyse evolution, allowing the new genes and new species to develop. Mechanism of Repetitive DNA Sequences in blocking gene conversion Interspersed DNA elements catalyze the evolution of new genes DNA sequences are linked together in a gene pool by gene conversion events. Insertion of an interspersed DNA element breaks this linkage, allowing independent evolution of a new gene. The interspersed repeat is an isolating mechanism enabling new genes to evolve without interference from the progenitor gene. Because insertion of an interspersed repeat is a saltatory event the evolution of the new gene will also be saltatory. Because speciation ultimately depends on the creation of new genes, this naturally causes punctuated equilibria. Interspersed repeats are thus responsible for punctuated evolution and rapid modes of evolution.

Generally, companies that have low working capital reserves can get into cash flow problems because invoices are paid on net 30 terms. Debtor finance solutions fund slow-paying invoices, which improves the cash flow of the company and puts it in a better position to pay operating expenses. Types of debtor financing solutions include invoice discounting, factoring, cashflow finance, asset finance, invoice finance and working capital finance. Need Most businesses have to offer credit terms, usually of 30 days, in order to secure orders from customers. Current statistics show that these invoices can take up to 60 days to be paid. This delay reduces essential cash flow and restricts the growth of the business. Security requirements Security requirements vary, but traditionally focus on the value of the debtors ledger, supported by a pledge of specific assets as collateral and a charge or mortgage over the business, along with the personal guarantees of directors. Apart from some specialised lenders, real estate security is not taken. By focusing on the value and collectability of the accounts receivable ledger, most debtor finance credit lines will automatically increase in response to increases in sales, and provide ongoing working capital to fund the growth of the business. Typically the advance rate ranges from 70% of accounts receivable ledger value up to 90%. The remaining 30% to 10%, known as the 'retention' is released following receipt of payment of each invoice by the customer/debtor/buyer. Types Debtor finance products, by whatever name, essentially fall into two categories: * Confidential: the customer or end-user is unaware of the funding being provided, usually called 'invoice discounting', * Disclosed: traditionally referred to as 'factoring', where invoices have a notice that warns the customer to pay the funds to the financier in settlement of the debt. Export factoring is a highly specialised and selective form of factoring, and can provide non-recourse funding to exporters, paid at the time of shipment, and with solvency of the overseas importer underwritten by an overseas bank or institution. Under each category there are a number of financiers, all with varying policies and guidelines regarding their procedures, security, pricing and target markets. There are providers of import and export factoring, and their conditions vary widely. Transaction structure  Most debtor financing transactions are structured to operationally resemble an asset-based loan. The client submits its accounts receivable ledger to the finance company. The finance company processes the ledger and remits the funds to the client's bank account. Lenders often finance a percentage of the ledger, commonly 80%‚Äì85%, and hold the rest as a reserve. The percentage of the ledger that is financed varies and is based on the industry and risk profile of the client. The reserve is remitted to the client once the advances settle, when customers pay their invoices. Terms of providers Some providers have minimum terms, exit fees, notice periods, audit requirements, etc. that need to be fully assessed prior to entering into any agreement. Due to the involvement by the financier with a factored customer, the advance rate on such invoices is higher than with a confidential facility. In addition, some facilities marketed as 'confidential' still require completion of anonymous 'audits' before invoices are funded. Most financiers will fund invoices for up to 90 days from the month the invoice was issued, and will 'recourse' any invoice not paid by the end of the 90 days. 120-day recourse periods are provided in exceptional circumstances. Providers in some countries will offer a non-recourse, or limited recourse facility, where the provider assumes part or all of the credit risk on a debtor. Other providers may insist on the client taking out credit insurance on their customers, with the policy and benefits assigned to the provider. Credit limits may also be set on individual customers to minimise risk by some financiers, and 'concentration' limits might also limit funding available to major customers, or to specific classes of customers. An in-depth knowledge of all these issues is essential to ensure that a debtor finance partnership is with a compatible financier. Eligibility A firm's eligibility to sell off its invoices by means of factoring is dependent on the terms of acceptance of the factor. These terms do vary from factor to factor. Most factors would consider the rate at which the firm realizes bad debts by checking the firms bad debts account while another could only consider the reputation of the firm. Most business that provide goods or services to other businesses on credit can qualify for debtor finance. Debtor finance is more difficult to place for contractors involved in the building industry, but there are some specialised providers that are comfortable with contract issues. Growth The use of debtor financing has grown strongly, as it has become more widely recognised as a valuable financing tool, supplementing or replacing traditional overdrafts or fixed-limit business loans. Internationally, debtor finance business has grown from ‚Ç¨40 billion in 1978 to over ‚Ç¨580 billion in 2003, provided by more than 1,000 companies, most of whom are associated with international banks. This volume is greater than the business written each year in leasing.

As the title implies, the subject of the film is the workplace and the personal difficulties that result from conflicts among management and labour, corporations and individuals. It stars Jalil Lespert. Most of the other actors are non-professionals. It won the C√©sar Award for Best First Feature Film and the C√©sar Award for Most Promising Actor at the 26th C√©sar Awards. Plot Set in Gaillon, Normandy, the movie tells the story of \\"good son\\" Franck (Jalil Lespert), who returns to his hometown to do a trainee managerial internship in the Human Resources department of the factory where his anxious, taciturn father has worked on the shopfloor for 30 years. At first Franck is lauded by both friends and family for breaking through the glass ceiling and becoming \\"white-collar\\". But very soon hidden envy and rivalries erupt. Franck forms a friendship with Alain, a young worker whom his father has mentored. This mentoring in the blue-collar workforce is contrasted with the cagier, trust-less mentoring Franck receives in the white-collar world from his own supervisor, Chambon. Franck discovers that his boss is going to use Franck's field study on the proposed 35-hour workweek to justify downsizing - and that Franck's father is among those to be let go. This leads to a confrontation between the trainee and management, between the workers and the owners, and ultimately between son and father. In the emotional climax, Franck confronts his father and accuses him of imbuing him with a legacy of shame at being blue-collar.

Its boundaries are the Ohio River on the West, Bank Street and the Portland neighborhood on the North, I-264 on the East, and West Broadway on the South. Maps sometimes identify the area as Shawneeland. History The Olmsted-designed Shawnee Park Shawnee Park was completed in 1892 and residential districts sprung up around it quickly. In 1895, Louisville annexed Shawnee and extended street car lines. The land between Shawnee and Louisville was subdivided and many whites moved in during the early 20th century. The wealthiest areas were near the park and golf course, with middle- and working-class neighborhoods further east. The Flood of 1937, as well as air pollution problems caused many white families to move further east. The neighborhood became integrated in the 1960s and was predominantly black following the 1968 riots when many longtime white residents moved. Many of the homes in Shawnee are examples of late-19th century architecture. The grand homes are still in good to excellent condition. The size and quality of these homes rival those found in other areas of the city, particularly Crescent Hill. As Louisville's West End is economically depressed and lacks many amenities, the housing costs are considerably lower than other areas of the city. Like other Southern cities, many of Louisville's public facilities were segregated. The park system was no exception to this rule. Shawnee Park was a segregated whites-only public park, while Chickasaw Park, to the south, was a public park for blacks until the 1950s. Fontaine Ferry Park, an early amusement park located at the end of Market Street from 1905 to 1969, was restricted to whites, with the exception of \\"negro days\\" which was a common occurrence for opening segregated facilities limited to whites in the south. The park was integrated in 1963 and operated without incident until opening day 1969 when a race riot erupted which resulted in the amusement park being closed by its owners citing safety concerns. In 1973 it reopened as Ghost Town On The River and later as River Glen Park until it closed due to poor patronage in 1977. Following a series of fires which destroyed portions of the park in 1978 the park was demolished. Aubrey Dude Ranch remained until 1983 when it closed. In September 2007, Shawnee residents voted to ban liquor sales in four precincts of the neighborhood in an effort to combat crime. Shawnee suffered from a rash of unsolved murders in 2005, although crime rates have since declined. Demographics As of 2000, the population of Shawnee was 12,630. Though not recorded, the race breakdown is estimated to be around 90% Black or African- American, 5% White, and 5% Hispanic. Education Shawnee has a lending library, a branch of the Louisville Free Public Library.

Early life Ingpen was born in Geelong, Victoria, and attended Geelong College to 1957. He graduated with a Diploma of Graphic Art from RMIT in 1958, where he studied with Harold Freedman. Career In 1958, Ingpen was appointed by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) as an artist to interpret and communicate the results of scientific research. From 1968 Ingpen worked as a freelance designer, illustrator and author. He was also a member of a United Nations team in Mexico and Peru until 1975, where he designed pamphlets on fisheries and was involved in \\"a number of Australian conservation and environmental projects\\". He left the CSIRO to work full-time as a freelance writer in 1968. Ingpen's interest in conservation issues continued, and he was one of the founding members of the Australian Conservation Foundation. =Work= Flag of the Northern Territory as designed by Ingpen. Ingpen has written or illustrated more than 100 published books. These include children's picture books and fictional stories for all ages. His nonfiction books mostly relate to history, conservation, environment and health issues. His most frequent collaborator has been the author and editor Michael Page. Ingpen has designed many postage stamps for Australia, as well as the flag and coat of arms for the Northern Territory. Ingpen has created a number of public murals in Geelong, Melbourne, Canberra and the Gold Coast in Queensland. He also has designed bronze statues, which include the Poppykettle Fountain in the Geelong Steam Packet Gardens (currently dry due to drought restrictions) and the bronze doors to the Melbourne Cricket Club. His most recent work is the design and working drawings for a tapestry, which was woven by The Victorian Tapestry Workshop, to celebrate the 150 years of the Melbourne Cricket Ground. In 1982 Ingpen designed the Dromkeen Medal for the Governors of the Courtney Oldmeadow Children's Literature Foundation. The Dromkeen is awarded annually to Australians in recognition of contributions to children's literature and Ingpen received it himself in 1989 for his own work in the field. Ingpen was illustrator for the centenary editions of J.M.

F. Driver from the then Loughborough College. This equipment was reassembled initially in a wooden hut in Packe Street, Loughborough, and later in a purpose built generating station opened in 1937. They were finally taken out of use, and replaced, in 1949.Leonard Cantor, Loughborough University of Technology: Past and Present, 1990, LUT, p.50.

Several versions of UPA have been promulgated by the NCCUSL, the earliest having been put forth in 1914, and the most recent in 1997. Revised Uniform Partnership Act The NCCUSL's first revision of UPA was promulgated in 1992 and amended in 1993 and 1994. The 1994 revision was often referred to as the Revised Uniform Partnership Act (RUPA). Confusion arose when the 1996 and 1997 versions were also called RUPA. Because of this confusion, the NCCUSL now officially refers to each UPA version as \\"Uniform Partnership Act (year),\\" where \\"year\\" is replaced by the actual year that NCCUSL approved it. Many people still use the term \\"RUPA\\" to mean any version from 1994 forward. Thus, \\"RUPA\\" may actually imply any version of UPA except the 1914 version. UPA and RUPA differences The UPA and RUPA provide rules as to many aspects of a partnership relationship including formation, the ownership of partnership assets, the assessment of fiduciary duties, the settlement of partnership disputes, and termination. Each allows modification of these rules in the individual agreement among the partners. RUPA is significantly more detailed than is the UPA as to the degree to which the partnership agreement may modify the default rules set forth in the statute. RUPA also clarifies the nature of a partnership itself by clearly defining it as an entity rather than an aggregation of individuals. There are also a number of other important differences between UPA (1914) and subsequent versions. Enactment by states The 1914 version of the UPA was enacted into law in every state except Louisiana. The most recent revision has been enacted into law by 37 states. The NCCUSL website lists the states that it considers to have adopted these and other uniform acts. However, due to state variations it is not appropriate to rely upon this listing. The NCCUSL website lists these states as having adopted UPA (1997): Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Florida, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota (substantially similar), Tennessee, Texas (substantially similar), U.S. Virgin Islands, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, and Wyoming.

It is the contrary in many ways to the recently evolved just in time manufacturing system. Operation In JIC, manufacturers need to maintain large inventories of supplies, parts, warehousing resources, and extra workers to meet production contingencies. These contingencies, more common in less industrialized countries, can be poor transportation infrastructure, poor quality control, vulnerability to other suppliers' production problems, and natural disasters. These supply-chain instabilities could lead to costly production inefficiencies therefore a manufacturer may maintain and pay for excess inventory and backups of \\"fragile\\" production stages which could get out of sync, cause production shutdowns, or create supply-chain delays for other manufacturers. In JIC, manufacturers reorder stock before it reaches the buffer level or minimum level to allow themselves to have inventories to be sold while the suppliers are supplying the goods. This time range from the time the firm reorders the stock to the time the supplier provides the new stock is known as lead time. Thus a JIC inventory system tries to keep a minimum level of inventories just in case of emergencies, hence the name \\"Just In Case\\". One major reason for practicing a more costly JIC system are the potential losses paid (i.e. permanent loss of major customers, loss of suppliers, supply-chain collapse) if supply-chain shocks occur on several occasions. If the JIT response contingencies are too slow or fail to keep production flowing additional costs may be incurred. Under these circumstances the additional costs due to maintaining extra storage, resources, and system resiliency may potentially be more cost effective than using a more efficient JIT system. A JIC examples of buyers would be the military or hospitals who need to maintain large inventories because waiting for JIT producers to ramp up production for needed supplies may result in losses (i.e. wars, lives)Frontline:America's Medical Supply Crisis.

It is the numbered highway portion of Forest Parkway, which continues both west and east of this highway. It connects areas south of Atlanta's Hartsfield‚ÄìJackson Atlanta International Airport with Forest Park and Lake City. Route description SR 331 begins at an intersection with SR 85 south of the Hartsfield‚ÄìJackson Atlanta International Airport and just west of Forest Park. Immediately, the highway travels to the northeast, to an interchange with Interstate 75 (I-75). Inside this interchange, it curves to the east-northeast and crosses over Mud Creek. Just after that interchange, the highway enters Forest Park at an intersection with Frontage Road. Just over later, SR 331 intersects US 19/US 41/SR 3 (Old Dixie Road). After a slight curve back to the northeast, it curves to the southeast, passing north of Starr Park. A little over after intersecting the northern terminus of Bartlett Drive, the highway leaves Forest Park and enters Lake City. Approximately after entering the city limits of Lake City, it meets its eastern terminus, an intersection with SR 54 (Jonesboro Road). SR 331 is not part of the National Highway System, a system of routes determined to be the most important for the nation's economy, mobility and defense. History SR 331 in Forest Park The roadway that would eventually be designated as SR 331 was built in the mid-1950s as Thames Avenue, from SR 85 to the intersection with US 19 Bus./US 41 Bus. (now US 19/US 41/SR 3), and Georgia Avenue from there to the central part of Forest Park. In the early 1960s, the segment of Thames Avenue between SR 85 and US 19/US 41 (now I-75) was designated as SR 331. In the middle of the decade, the SR 331 designation was extended eastward to US 19/US 41/SR 3, which were then following their current path. In 1971, SR 331 was extended eastward to SR 54, and the entire roadway was renamed as Forest Parkway.

It is located in the eastern part of Chai Wan, and is administratively under the Eastern District. The population was 59,729 in June 2011. Location The current perimeter of Siu Sai Wan includes the rest of Chai Wan east of Wing Tai Road. Prior to reclamation, Siu Sai Wan was a small bay east of Chai Wan. Chai Wan was once known as Sai Wan (; West Bay), and the small bay as Siu Chai Wan (; Small Chai Wan) or Chai Wan Tsai (; Little Chai Wan), and over time the names combined into the current name Siu Sai Wan. History Siu Sai Wan was originally an intelligence gathering centre for the United Kingdom. In 1947, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, United Kingdom and United States signed an agreement to jointly pursue the gathering of intelligence. The British Armed Forces then set up an intelligence gathering centre in Siu Sai Wan, one of the largest in the Far East, to monitor wireless communications from Taiwan (ROC) to China (PRC). In 1985, shortly after the handover of Hong Kong to China was agreed, the centre was dismantled. At the same time, along with the development of the Mass Transit Railway, the resettlement estates in Chai Wan were to be demolished. To accommodate residents from these estates and from the expanding urban population, the government decided to develop Siu Sai Wan. At that time the name Siu Sai Wan was deemed \\"indecent\\" by the Government, who suggested to name the area \\"Siu Chai Wan\\" instead. This didn't sit well with local residents, and as a result when the Siu Sai Wan Estate was built a few years later, the name Siu Sai Wan was returned to the area. Nevertheless, taxi drivers are known to use a similar-sounding profane term when they refer to the area. Siu Sai Wan faces Tathong Channel and Lei Yue Mun, an entrance to the Victoria Harbour. The government has built Home Ownership Scheme housing such as Harmony Garden. Housing Siu Sai Wan Estate Fullview Garden * Private housing estates include: ** Island Resort * Public housing estates in Siu Sai Wan ** Siu Sai Wan Estate Schools A number of schools including both primary and secondary schools can be found in Siu Sai Wan. * Secondary schools: ** Fukien Secondary School (Siu Sai Wan) ** Hon Wah College ** Lingnan Hang Yee Memorial Secondary School ** The Chinese Foundation Secondary School (CFSS) ** The Methodist Church Hong Kong Wesley College * Primary schools: ** Pui Kiu Primary School ** Tung Wah Group of Hospitals Lee Chi Hung Memorial Primary School (Chai Wan) (Closed down on 31 August 2011) * Kindergartens: ** Cannan Kindergarten (Siu Sai Wan) ** Gar Lam Anglo-Chinese Kindergarten (Siu Sai Wan) Social amenities Siu Sai Wan Sports Ground Siu Sai Wan Promenade * Siu Sai Wan Sports Ground * Siu Sai Wan Promenade * Siu Sai Wan Complex Transport With the Island Resort now constructed, the population of Siu Sai Wan has been steadily increasing, so both First Bus and Citybus extended routes ending at Chai Wan (East) to Siu Sai Wan Estate and Island Resort.

Its boundaries are 34th Street on the west, West Broadway on the north, Woodland Avenue on the south, and 26th Street on the east. It was originally called Homestead and was incorporated in 1874. In 1884 the name was changed to Parkland. The neighborhood was initially a wealthy suburb of Louisville. A tornado on March 27, 1890 devastated Parkland, and Parkland was annexed by Louisville in 1894. When rebuilt, part of Parkland was called Little Africa, but many mansions were built in \\"White Parkland.\\" Little Africa was demolished in 1948 to make way for several housing projects. On May 27, 1968, Parkland was the site of race riots. Two teenagers were killed, and the National Guard occupied Parkland for seven days. Most businesses and many residents left Parkland after the riots. The neighborhood has since been the subject of several urban renewal efforts. As of 2000, the population of Parkland was 4,550 . In 2015, the former Boxing Commissioner of Pennsylvania, George Bochetto, along with a real estate investor, Jared Weiss, bought Muhammad Ali's childhood home located at 3302 Grand Avenue in the Parkland section of Louisville. The home has been restored to its original 1950s condition when Ali lived there. Ali returned to this home in Parkland after his win of Olympic gold in the 1960 Rome Olympics. In 2016, the home opened as a museum called the Muhammad Ali Childhood Home Museum. Both Bochetto and Weiss hope that the renovation will help promote further pride and growth in the Parkland section of Louisville.

The original mix of \\"Stand!\\" garnered a warm, yet unenthusiastic, reaction when Sly Stone had an early acetate of the record played in a San Francisco club. As a result, Stone went back into the studio and had the song's final section, a fevered gospel music-styled break, rerecorded. Most of the Family Stone was unavailable for the session, and Stone resorted to using mostly studio musicians for the rerecorded section. \\"I Want to Take You Higher\\", the b-side of \\"Stand!\\", was also a hit single in 1969/1970.

It is an extremely strong oxidant and decomposes into oxygen and fluorine even at at a rate of 4% per day: its lifetime at room temperature is thus extremely short. Dioxygen difluoride reacts vigorously with nearly every chemical it encounters ‚Äì even ordinary ice ‚Äì leading to its onomatopoeic nickname \\"FOOF\\" (a play on its chemical structure and its explosive tendencies). Preparation Dioxygen difluoride can be obtained by subjecting a 1:1 mixture of gaseous fluorine and oxygen at low pressure (7‚Äì17 mmHg (0.9‚Äì2.3 kPa) is optimal) to an electric discharge of 25‚Äì30 mA at 2.1‚Äì2.4 kV. A similar method was used for the first synthesis by Otto Ruff in 1933. Another synthesis involves mixing and in a stainless steel vessel cooled to , followed by exposing the elements to bremsstrahlung for several hours. A third method requires heating a mix of fluorine and oxygen to , and then rapidly cooling it using liquid oxygen. All of these methods involve synthesis according to the equation: : + ‚Üí It also arises from the thermal decomposition of ozone difluoride: : ‚Üí + or :2 ‚Üí 2 + Structure and properties In , oxygen is assigned the unusual oxidation state of +1. In most of its other compounds, oxygen has an oxidation state of ‚àí2. The structure of dioxygen difluoride resembles that of hydrogen peroxide, , in its large dihedral angle, which approaches 90¬∞ and C2 symmetry. This geometry conforms with the predictions of VSEPR theory. Dioxygen difluoride's structure The bonding within dioxygen difluoride has been the subject of considerable speculation, particularly because of the very short O‚àíO distance and the long O‚àíF distances. The O‚àíO bond length is within 2 pm of the 120.7 pm distance for the O=O double bond in the dioxygen molecule, . Several bonding systems have been proposed to explain this, including an O‚àíO triple bond with O‚àíF single bonds which are destabilised and lengthened by repulsion between the lone pairs on the fluorine atoms and the œÄ-orbitals of the O‚àíO bond. Repulsion involving the fluorine lone pairs is also responsible for the long and weak covalent bonding in the fluorine molecule. Computational chemistry indicates that dioxygen difluoride has an exceedingly high barrier to rotation of 81.17 kJ/mol around the O‚àíO bond (in hydrogen peroxide the barrier is 29.45 kJ/mol), this is close to the O‚àíF bond disassociation energy of 81.59 kJ/mol. The 19F NMR chemical shift of dioxygen difluoride is 865 ppm, which is by far the highest chemical shift recorded for a fluorine nucleus, thus underlining the extraordinary electronic properties of this compound. Despite its instability, thermochemical data for have been compiled. Reactivity The compound readily decomposes into oxygen and fluorine. Even at a temperature of , 4% decomposes each day by this process: : ‚Üí + The other main property of this unstable compound is its oxidizing power, although most experimental reactions have been conducted near . Several experiments with the compound resulted in a series of fires and explosions. Some of the compounds that produced violent reactions with include ethyl alcohol, methane, ammonia, and even water ice. With and , it gives the corresponding dioxygenyl salts: :2 + 2 ‚Üí 2 + Uses The compound currently has no practical applications, but has been of theoretical interest. One laboratory used it to synthesize plutonium hexafluoride at unprecedentedly low temperatures, which was significant because previous methods for preparation needed temperatures so high that the plutonium hexafluoride created would rapidly decompose.

Takhar is worshipped at the foot of trees, and in the new moon, the atmospheric spirits of the air and night are \\"conjured with mysterious incarnations\\".

These Serer high priests preside over all cases relating to law and order, i.e. theft, witchcraft, etc. In the past, these high priests (the Saltigues) would concoct doses of poison which they would administer to the accused witch, taken orally. However, these concoctions were deliberately never made fatal enough to cause death. These high priests mostly depended on the fear of Takhar as dispenser of justice and vengeance, than their poisons. Patronage As the god of justice, Takhar is the perpetual patron of all those who work within the judiciary and pass judgement on legal issues.

In 1957 Villius joined Swedish Radiotj√§nst (now Sveriges Radio), Sweden's national public radio corporation, and began making popular historical documentaries and programming until he moved to Sveriges Television (SVT) in 1966. It was at SVT that Villius began working with TV-producer Olle H√§ger, a very productive collaboration that would span some two decades. During the 1980s and 1990s, H√§ger and Villius produced several popular documentaries like Fyra dagar som skakade Sverige (\\"Four days that shook Sweden\\") in 1988 about the Swedish \\"Midsummer crisis\\" during World War II and Raoul Wallenberg - f√•nge i Sovjet (\\"Raoul Wallenberg - prisoner in the Soviet Union.\\") as well as one of SVT's biggest and most popular documentary productions ever, Hundra Svenska √Ör (\\"One Hundred Swedish years\\"), consisting of eight one-hour documentaries on the history of Sweden during the 20th century from many different perspectives. Other than his dedication to entertaining and educating, Villius was most famous for his narrating both his own and others' documentaries, and his soft Kalmar-accent is instantly recognizable to millions of Swedes (even to those who do not know his name). He also played the Minister of Justice in Bo Widerberg's thriller The Man from Majorca (1984). His voice has almost become a concept of its own, intimately associated with serious educational programming and spawning many parodies (e.g., in TV-commercials) and imitations among comedians.

They are best known for their hit single \\"I'd Rather Jack\\", which peaked at number 8 on the UK Singles Chart in April 1989, number 6 in Ireland, number 8 in the Netherlands, number 7 in the Flanders region of Belgium, and number 43 in Australia. It remained in the UK singles chart for 12 weeks. The sisters signed to the PWL record label after giving Pete Waterman a demo tape. Their single was produced by Stock Aitken Waterman. The sisters grew up in Litherland, a suburb of Sefton, Liverpool, and were of Irish descent. The duo's younger sister, Debbie, played the original Katie Rogers, in Brookside, from 1987 to 1989. \\"I'd Rather Jack\\" started out as a response to music critics who ignored the younger pop acts in the UK at the time, and to radio DJs who continued to play older bands on their playlists rather than Stock Aitken Waterman songs. It was also a response to a perceived snub at the Brit Awards, where SAW acts lost out to more \\"mature\\" acts such as Enya and Steve Winwood. After their one hit, The Reynolds Girls were dropped by the label. A second single, \\"Get Real\\", was released but this failed to chart and the duo have not made any real media appearance since. It is unknown what happened to them after they quit the music industry, and they could not be traced for a 2012 PWL reunion concert. In a public poll conducted by Channel 4 in 2003, \\"I'd Rather Jack\\" was voted number 91 in a list of the 100 Worst Pop Records of All Time. In a documentary about PWL that aired in 2012, the people interviewed admitted that the single was indeed a tongue-in-cheek response to the critics, and in part did ruin the siblings' career after they'd recorded it. In 2013, ITV started a search for the sisters, so they could appear in a commemorative documentary about Stock, Aitken and Waterman.

Fran√ßois Dominique de Reynaud, Comte de Montlosier (April 16, 1755 in Clermont-Ferrand ‚Äì December 9, 1838), was a notable French politician and political writer during the First French Empire, Bourbon Restoration and July Monarchy. He was the youngest of a large family belonging to the poorer nobility. Political activity He was elected as a stand-in diplomat from the nobility of bailiwick of Clermont-Ferrand to the Estates- General, where he was a member from September 1789. Later, in 1791, he was also elected to the National Constituent Assembly, where he sat on the Royalist side. He defended the French monarchy with obstinacy and talent and helped edit the French pamphlet Les Actes des Ap√¥tres. In September 1791, after the dissolution of the Assembly, Montlosier fled to Germany where he tried to join the counter-revolutionary Army of Cond√© at Coblenz. After some protest concerning the liberal leanings he had shown in the Assembly, he was finally accepted. Exile in England After the cannonade of Valmy, Montlosier withdrew to Hamburg, and thence to London, where he avoided English society, moving exclusively among the French exiles. In his Courrier de Londres, published in London, he advocated moderation and the abandonment by the exiles of any idea of revenge. He was recalled to Paris in 1801, with permission to publish his paper in London. The Courrier was soon suppressed, nevertheless, its editor being compensated by a comfortable sinecure in the ministry of foreign affairs. Next year he sold his pen to the government to edit the violent anti-English Bulletin de Paris. Historical works At Napoleon's request he undertook an account of the ancient monarchy of France, which should serve as a justification for the empire. After four years' labor Montlosier submitted his work to a specially appointed committee, by which it was rejected because of the stress laid on the feudal limitations of the royal authority. The work De la monarchie fran√ßaise . . . ou recherches sur les anciennes institutions fran√ßaises . . . et sur les causes qui ont amen√© la revolution . . . appeared in 1814 in three volumes, a fourth and supplementary volume in the next year containing a preface hostile to Napoleon. His views were no more acceptable to Louis XVIII than they had been to the emperor, and he devoted himself to agriculture until he was roused by the clerical and reactionary policy of Charles X. His anti-clerical Memoire √† consulter sur un syst√®me religieux, politique . . . (1826) rapidly passed through eight editions. In 1829 he published De l'origine, de la nature, et des progr√©s de la puissance √©cclesiastique en France [On the origin, nature, and progress of ecclesiastical power in France]. In this book, Montlosier claims there were 500,000 affiliated Jesuits in France in the Chamber of Paris, in the Chamber of Deputies, at the court, in the army, in the courts, etc. He had no part in the revolution of 1830, but supported Louis Philippe's government, and entered the House of Peers in 1832. He died on December 9, 1838 at Blois. Ecclesiastical burial was denied him because he had refused to abjure his anti-clerical writings.

It causes the particle to move towards the area of the weaker field strength, rather than oscillating around an initial point as happens in a homogeneous field. This occurs because the particle sees a greater magnitude of force during the half of the oscillation period while it is in the area with the stronger field. The net force during its period in the weaker area in the second half of the oscillation does not offset the net force of the first half, and so over a complete cycle this makes the particle move towards the area of lesser force. The ponderomotive force Fp is expressed by :\\\\mathbf{F}_{\\\\text{p}}=-\\\\frac{e^2}{4 m \\\\omega^2} abla(E^2) which has units of newtons (in SI units) and where e is the electrical charge of the particle, m is its mass, œâ is the angular frequency of oscillation of the field, and E is the amplitude of the electric field. At low enough amplitudes the magnetic field exerts very little force. This equation means that a charged particle in an inhomogeneous oscillating field not only oscillates at the frequency of œâ of the field, but is also accelerated by Fp toward the weak field direction. This is a rare case where the sign of the charge on the particle does not change the direction of the force ((-e)2=(+e)2). Derivation The derivation of the ponderomotive force expression proceeds as follows. Consider a particle under the action of a non-uniform electric field oscillating at frequency \\\\omega in the x-direction. The equation of motion is given by: :\\\\ddot{x}=g(x)\\\\cos(\\\\omega t), neglecting the effect of the associated oscillating magnetic field. If the length scale of variation of g(x) is large enough, then the particle trajectory can be divided into a slow time motion and a fast time motion:Introduction to Plasma Theory, second edition, by Nicholson, Dwight R., Wiley Publications (1983), :x=x_0+x_1 where x_0 is the slow drift motion and x_1 represents fast oscillations. Now, let us also assume that x_1 \\\\ll x_0. Under this assumption, we can use Taylor expansion on the force equation about x_0, to get: :\\\\ddot{x}_0+\\\\ddot{x}_1=\\\\left[g(x_0)+x_1 g'(x_0)\\\\right]\\\\cos(\\\\omega t) :\\\\ddot{x}_0 \\\\ll \\\\ddot{x}_1, and because x_1 is small, g(x_0) \\\\gg x_1 g'(x_0) , so :\\\\ddot{x}_1=g(x_0)\\\\cos(\\\\omega t) On the time scale on which x_1 oscillates, x_0 is essentially a constant. Thus, the above can be integrated to get: :x_1=-\\\\frac{g(x_0)}{\\\\omega^2} \\\\cos(\\\\omega t) Substituting this in the force equation and averaging over the 2\\\\pi / \\\\omega timescale, we get, :\\\\ddot{x}_0=-\\\\frac{g(x_0)g'(x_0)}{2 \\\\omega^2} :\\\\Rightarrow \\\\ddot{x}_0=-\\\\frac{1}{4 \\\\omega^2}\\\\left.\\\\frac{d}{dx}\\\\left[g(x)^2\\\\right]\\\\right_{x=x_0} Thus, we have obtained an expression for the drift motion of a charged particle under the effect of a non-uniform oscillating field. Time averaged density Instead of a single charged particle, there could be a gas of charged particles confined by the action of such a force. Such a gas of charged particles is called plasma. The distribution function and density of the plasma will fluctuate at the applied oscillating frequency and to obtain an exact solution, we need to solve the Vlasov Equation. But, it is usually assumed that the time averaged density of the plasma can be directly obtained from the expression for the force expression for the drift motion of individual charged particles:V. B. Krapchev, Kinetic Theory of the Ponderomotive Effects in a Plasma, Phys. Rev. Lett. 42, 497 (1979), http://prola.aps.org/abstract/PRL/v42/i8/p497_1 :\\\\bar{n}(x)=n_0 \\\\exp \\\\left[-\\\\frac{e}{\\\\kappa T} \\\\Phi_{\\\\text{P}} (x)\\\\right] where \\\\Phi_{\\\\text{P}} is the ponderomotive potential and is given by :\\\\Phi_{\\\\text{P}} (x)=\\\\frac{ m}{4 \\\\omega^2} \\\\left[g (x)\\\\right]^2 Generalized ponderomotive force Instead of just an oscillating field, a permanent field could also be present. In such a situation, the force equation of a charged particle becomes: :\\\\ddot{x}=h(x)+g(x)\\\\cos(\\\\omega t) To solve the above equation, we can make a similar assumption as we did for the case when h(x)=0. This gives a generalized expression for the drift motion of the particle: :\\\\ddot{x}_0=h(x_0)-\\\\frac{g(x_0)g'(x_0)}{2 \\\\omega^2} Applications The idea of a ponderomotive description of particles under the action of a time-varying field has applications in areas like: *Combined rf trap *High harmonic generation *Plasma acceleration of particles *Plasma propulsion engine especially the Electrodeless plasma thruster *Quadrupole ion trap *Terahertz time-domain spectroscopy as a source of high energy THz radiation in laser- induced air plasmas The ponderomotive force also plays an important role in laser induced plasmas as a major density lowering factor.

Contrabandista! Praeger, ASIN B0006C4TXQ. The authors state Sarti was 41 at time of death. ‚Äì April 28, 1972) was a French drug trafficker. Drug smuggling In 1948, Sarti founded the group Piedra Fuerte with fellow Corsicans Auguste Ricord and Francois Chiappe, which smuggled opium in the Golden Triangle. Chiappe was known to be part of the Organisation arm√©e secr√®te, a French dissident paramilitary terrorist group that conducted targeted assassinations and bombings, including the attempted assassination of Charles de Gaulle in 1962. Ricord was a heroin trafficker and Nazi collaborator who was part of the French Gestapo. On April 19, 1968, Sarti was arrested along with Ricord and Chiappe for questioning regarding the robbery of a branch of the Central Bank of Argentina. The three were released due to lack of evidence. In April 1972, Sarti was shot to death in Mexico City during a raid of a drug trafficking ring by the Mexican federal police. A detective in Rio de Janeiro was later suspended from the police force after being accused of accepting a bribe to free Sarti and Helena Ferreira, his girlfriend, from jail earlier in 1972. In January 1975, four French citizens alleged to have supplied heroin to Sarti were among a group of 19 indicted by a federal grand jury in Brooklyn. Allegations of involvement in the assassination of John F. Kennedy =The Murderers of John F. Kennedy and The Men Who Killed Kennedy= In November 1988, Steve J. Rivele's French-published book The Murderers of John F. Kennedy named Sarti as one of three French gangsters involved in the assassination of John F. Kennedy. Rivele claimed Sarti fired the fatal shot from Dealey Plaza's \\"grassy knoll\\". According to Rivele, Sarti, Roger Bocagnani, and Sauveur Pironti were contracted by organized crime in the United States to protect their drug interests. The British two-hour television special The Men Who Killed Kennedy was based on Rivele's book, but preceded its release airing on October 25, 1988. In the French newspaper Le Proven√ßal published the day following the special, Pironti denied the allegation stating he believed at the time of the assassination that Sarti was held in Marseille's Baumettes Prison and that Bocagnani was in Bordeaux's Fort du H√¢. He also showed the paper military records showing that he was serving on a minesweeper from October 1962 to April 1964. The French Ministry of Justice stated that Bocagnani was in prison on the day of Kennedy's assassination and officials for the French Navy confirmed Pironti's military service. =E. Howard Hunt= After the death of E. Howard Hunt in 2007, Howard St. John Hunt and David Hunt stated that their father had recorded several claims about himself and others being involved in a conspiracy to assassinate John F. Kennedy. In the April 5, 2007 issue of Rolling Stone, Howard St. John Hunt detailed a number of individuals purported to be implicated by his father including Sarti, as well as Lyndon B. Johnson, Cord Meyer, David Phillips, Frank Sturgis, David Morales, and William Harvey. The two sons alleged that their father cut the information from his memoirs, \\"American Spy: My Secret History in the CIA, Watergate and Beyond\\", to avoid possible perjury charges. According to Hunt's widow and other children, the two sons took advantage of Hunt's loss of lucidity by coaching and exploiting him for financial gain. The Los Angeles Times said they examined the materials offered by the sons to support the story and found them to be \\"inconclusive\\". Further reading *Davis, John H.

The route connects Byron with the Atlanta metropolitan area, via Forsyth, McDonough, and Forest Park.  Route description  SR 42 begins at an intersection with SR 49/SR 540 (Peach Parkway) in Byron, in Peach County. It stairsteps its way to the west and northwest, crossing into Crawford County along the way. In Knoxville, it intersects US 80/SR 22 (East Crusselle Street). The three highways head concurrent to the west, into Roberta, where they intersect US 341/SR 7 (South Dugger Avenue). Here, SR 42 leaves the concurrency of US 80/SR 22 and joins the concurrency of US 341/SR 7\\\\. The three routes travel to the north-northwest into the town of Musella, where SR 42 splits off to the north-northeast and enters Monroe County. In Dyas is an intersection with SR 74\\\\. The route continues to the north-northeast, through rural areas of the county and heads toward Forsyth. Just before entering town, it crosses over Tobesofkee Creek. In town, it passes by Forsyth City Cemetery before it has an intersection with US 41/SR 18/SR 83 (Main Street). At this intersection, SR 83 begins a very brief concurrency through parts of town. After the two routes diverge, SR 42 curves to the northwest and parallels Interstate 75 (I-75) for less than before resuming its north-northeast routing and an interchange with I-75. Farther along, it crosses over the Towaliga River. A few miles later, the road enters Butts County. SR 42 passes through Flovilla and intersects US 23/SR 87 just northwest of town. At this intersection, SR 87 reaches its northern terminus and US 23/SR 42 run concurrent for most of the remainder of SR 42's length. The concurrency heads northwest into Jackson, where they head to the west for a short while. First SR 16, and then SR 36 join and then leave the concurrency. US 23/SR 42 resume their north-northwest routing, passing Sylvan Grove Hospital before leaving town. They curve to the west again, traveling through the town of Jenkinsburg, then enter Henry County. The two routes curve again to the north-northwest and pass through Locust Grove. Then, they enter McDonough, where they intersect SR 155 (North McDonough Road) and then SR 20/SR 81\\\\. They pass by Alexander Park before crossing over Camp Creek and leaving town. Then, US 23/SR 42 enter Stockbridge. There, they pass Eagle's Landing Parkway and then head west- northwest on a concurrency with SR 138\\\\. The three routes curve to the northwest and reach the end of the concurrency. US 23/SR 42 resume their north-northwest routing and enter Clayton County. The two routes have an interchange with I-675 and then travel through the town of Rex. They skirt along the eastern edge of Fort Gillem and pass by Conley Park, just before entering DeKalb County. US 23/SR 42 meet the northern terminus of SR 54 Conn. (Thurman Road) before an interchange with I-285. They pass to the east of the Lake Charlotte Nature Preserve. After that, they cross over the South River, enter Atlanta, and run along the Fulton‚ÄìDeKalb county line. They pass by Chestnut Hill Cemetery and meet the eastern terminus of SR 42 Spur (McDonough Boulevard SE). Then, they pass by the western side of Brownwood Park before meeting the western terminus of SR 260 (Glenwood Avenue SE). Just over later is an interchange with I-20. Immediately north of there is SR 154 (Memorial Drive). The two highways travel through the Little Five Points district of the city. They travel through a portion of Freedom Park and meet the eastern terminus of SR 42 Conn. (Freedom Parkway). Just over later, they intersect US 29/US 78/US 278/SR 8/SR 10 (Ponce de Leon Avenue). At this intersection, US 23 splits off to the east, while SR 42 continues to the north. Almost immediately afterward, it curves to the northeast, re-entering DeKalb County proper. Then, it heads fairly northward, passing between Emory University and Herbert Taylor Park and crosses over South Peachtree Creek. It intersects SR 236 (Lavista Road NE). Then, SR 42 turns to the left onto North Druid Hills Road NE. After an interchange with I-85, it meets its northern terminus, an intersection with SR 13 (Buford Highway NE). The only portion of SR 42 that is part of the National Highway System, a system of routes determined to be the most important for the nation's economy, mobility, and defense, is from the I-285 interchange east of the southeastern part of Atlanta to the Ponce de Leon Avenue intersection in the eastern part of the city.  History   Major intersections   Special routes  = Connector route = State Route 42 Connector (SR 42 Conn.) is a connector route that exists entirely within Freedom Park in the eastern part of Atlanta. The eastbound lanes are known as John Lewis Freedom Parkway NE for their entire length. The westbound lanes are known as Ralph McGill Boulevard NE from the western terminus to an intersection with North Highland Avenue NE; they are known as John Lewis Freedom Parkway for the rest of their length. It begins at an interchange with SR 10 (John Lewis Freedom Parkway NE) east-northeast of Atlanta Medical Center. It travels northeast through Freedom Park until it meets its eastern terminus, an intersection with US 23/SR 42 (Moreland Avenue SE). SR 42 Conn. is not part of the National Highway System, a system of roadways important to the nation's economy, defense, and mobility. = Spur route = State Route 42 Spur (SR 42 Spur) is a spur route that exists entirely within the eastern part of Atlanta. It is known as McDonough Boulevard SE for its entire length. It begins at an intersection with SR 54 (known as Jonesboro Road SE south of this intersection and as McDonough Boulevard SE north of it) just east of Carver High School. It travels southeast and meets the northern terminus of SR 54 Conn. (Sawtell Avenue SE) on the northeastern corner of the United States Penitentiary. The highway skirts the northern edges of the penitentiary, before it passes northeast of Thomasville Park and Thomasville Heights Elementary School. It continues to the east and meets its eastern terminus, an intersection with US 23/SR 42 (Moreland Avenue SE). SR 42 Spur is not part of the National Highway System, a system of roadways important to the nation's economy, defense, and mobility.

However, Malta is non-alcoholic, it has a strong beer smell and flavor and is consumed in the same way as beer or cola in its original carbonated form, and to some extent, iced tea in non-carbonated form. Malta is often described as being like a beer that has not been fermented. It is similar in color to stout (dark brown) but is slightly sweet, and is generally described as tasting like molasses. Unlike beer, ice is often added to a Malta when consumed. A popular way Africans and Americans sometimes drink is by mixing it with condensed or evaporated milk. Origin Malta originated in Germany as Malzbier (\\"malt beer\\"), a malty dark beer whose fermentation was interrupted at approximately 2% ABV, leaving quite a lot of residual sugars in the finished beer. Malzbier in its native form was superseded during the 1960s by its modern form, formulated from water, glucose syrup, malt extract and hops extract, which had been on the market since the latter half of the 19th century, notably in Denmark. Such formulated drinks are called Malztrunk (\\"malt beverage\\") according to German law, since they are not fermented. In colloquial use, Malzbier has nevertheless remained, along with other nicknames such as Kinderbier (\\"children's beer\\"). Distribution Most Malta is brewed in the Caribbean and can be purchased in areas with substantial Caribbean populations. Aside from the islands of the Caribbean, it is also popular in Caribbean coastal areas such as Cura√ßao, Aruba, Haiti, Panama, Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic, Colombia, Ecuador, Cuba, Venezuela and Trinidad and Tobago and countries that share a Caribbean coast. Malta is brewed worldwide, and is popular in many parts of Africa like Nigeria which has its own first malt brand - Maltex in 1967. It is also sold in Chad, Ghana, Benin, Cameroon and around the Indian Ocean. Malta Guinness is brewed under licence internationally. Some native Malzbiere is available in Germany, notably in Cologne, where the taps of breweries Malzm√ºhle and Sion sell it alongside their traditional K√∂lsch. Many German breweries have a in their range, sometimes produced under licence (for example Vitamalz). Malta is also occasionally called \\"champagne cola\\" by some brands. However, there is a separate type of drink with this name, having the flavor of bubble gum. Despite this appellation, neither drink is a champagne or a cola. Due to its distinctive color, is sometimes known as black brewed beer. In fact, in Chile the word malta means a Schwarzbier beer. Malta is high in B vitamins. Some breweries, like Albani Brewery of Denmark, fortify their non-alcoholic beverages with Vitamin B complex. Albani Brewery claims on their website to have been the first brewery to create non-alcoholic malt beverages in 1859.

Many colleges and universities now offer such courses (or entire degree programs) either partially or wholly online. There are an estimated 4,500 such institutions with total enrollments approaching perhaps 2 million. The majority of students using virtual campuses to obtain online degrees are adults students for three main reasons: * Flexibility ‚Äì Adults with full-time jobs and families would find it impossible to attend daily at a traditional school setting. Online classes allow students to work at their own pace and work around their busy lives. * Cost ‚Äì The cost of an online degree is relatively cheaper than at a traditional college setting. Obtaining your degree online eliminates costs such as classroom costs and facility upkeep costs that traditional students are required to pay because they are using the campus. However, the cheaper cost of an online degree does not diminish the value of the degree. * Broad Choices ‚Äì Students can remain at home and have availability to degrees that may not be offered by universities or colleges nearby. Schools use a variety of tools for conducting classes ‚Äì typically called learning management systems (LMS) or course management systems (CMS). CMS may also refer to CONTENT Management Systems. Some of the aspects that go under virtual campus includes various types of learning activities such as lectures, homework, discussions, readings, assignments. Classes are usually self paced using online documents and databases that might be available to them. Tests and other assignments are available online in specific programs used for online classes. Other methods used in virtual campus are live sessions, videoconferencing, discussing and sharing various applications. Individuals are able to access the materials any time they want under the teacher's control and are able to access anywhere online where they're able to access internet usage. Email is a big part of the virtual campuses and is often used before, during and after sessions. This aids individuals in exchanging information and or point them to the right direction that would be useful in increasing and understanding various methods available to them via documents and online sources.  Virtual campus experience  Alexander et al. conducted a study and found that the use of technology did not in itself result in improvements in the quality of learning but that success depended on the design of the whole learning experience. There are two main models for the virtual campus emerging. The first of these is one in which an educational institution uses communication and information technologies (CITs) to provide all conventional services. In the second model, services are unbundled, with some being sub-contracted to other organizations. Virtual campuses are learner centered, and students can customize their virtual campus to fit their learning styles and preferences thanks to the Internet and telecommunication technologies. Teleconferencing, videoconferencing, computer-based interactive multimedia packages, and various forms of computer mediated communication are technologies that facilitate synchronous delivery of content and real-time interaction between teacher and students as well as opportunities for problem- solving either individually or as a team.

It was acquired by the Thomson Corporation in 2008, forming Thomson Reuters, and moving its head office to Toronto. Reuters Group was best known for the Reuters news agency, which was the original business of the company. By the time of its acquisition by Thomson, the bulk of Reuters Group's revenues came from the provision of financial market data, with news reporting comprising less than 10% of its turnover. History =Beginnings= Paul Reuter aged 53 years (1869), by Rudolf Lehmann. Reuters Docklands Technical Centre, in the London Docklands area Paul Julius Reuter noticed that, with the electric telegraph, news no longer required days or weeks to travel long distances. In the 1850s, the 34-year-old Reuter was based in Aachen ‚Äì then in the Kingdom of Prussia, now in Germany ‚Äì close to the borders with the Netherlands and Belgium. He began using the newly opened Berlin‚ÄìAachen telegraph line to send news to Berlin. However, the telegraph did not extend the to Brussels, Belgium's capital city and financial center. Reuter saw an opportunity to speed up news service between Brussels and Berlin by using homing pigeons to bridge that gap. In 1851, Reuter moved to London. After failures in 1847 and 1850, attempts by the Submarine Telegraph Company to lay an undersea telegraph cable across the English Channel, from Dover to Calais, promised success. Reuter set up his \\"Submarine Telegraph\\" office in October 1851 just before the opening of that undersea cable in November, and he negotiated a contract with the London Stock Exchange to provide stock prices from exchanges in continental Europe in return for access to the London prices, which he then supplied to stockbrokers in Paris. In 1865, Reuter's private firm was restructured, and it became a limited company (a corporation) called the Reuter's Telegram Company. Reuter had been naturalised as a British subject in 1857. Reuter's agency built a reputation in Europe for being the first to report news scoops from abroad, such as Abraham Lincoln's assassination. Almost every major news outlet in the world now subscribes to Reuters' services, which operates in over 200 cities in 94 countries in about 20 languages. The last surviving member of the Reuters family founders, Marguerite, Baroness de Reuter, died at age 96 on 25 January 2009, after having suffered a series of strokes. =Initial public offering (IPO)= Reuters was financed as a public company in 1984 on the London Stock Exchange and on the NASDAQ in the United States. However, there were concerns that the company's tradition for objective reporting might be jeopardised if control of the company later fell into the hands of a single shareholder. To counter that possibility, the constitution of the company at the time of the stock offering included a rule that no individual was allowed to own more than 15% of the company. If this limit is exceeded, the directors can order the shareholder to reduce the holding to less than 15%. That rule was applied in the late 1980s when Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, which already held around 15% of Reuters, bought an Australian news company that also owned stock in Reuters. Murdoch was subsequently compelled to reduce his holdings to less than 15%. Further protecting Reuters from owner actions that might threaten its independence is Reuters Founders Share Company Limited, formed in 1984 as part of the share float. This company's stated mission is to protect the integrity of the company's news output. It holds one \\"Founders Share,\\" which can veto all other shares if an attempt is made to alter any of the rules relating to the Reuters Trust Principles. These principles set out the company's aims of independence, integrity, and freedom from bias in its news reporting. Subsequent to the forming of Thomson Reuters the trust principles continued, with the RFSC now holding a Founders Share in each of Thomson Reuters Corporation and Thomson Reuters PLC. =Post-IPO expansion= Reuters grew rapidly after its 1984 IPO, widening the range of its business products and global reporting network for media, financial and economic services. In 1988, Reuters formed a joint-venture with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange to build an automated futures trading system named \\"Globex\\" at a cost of over US$100 million.What is an exchange?: the automation, management, and regulation of Financial Markets, Rueben Lee Key product launches include Equities 2000 (1987), Dealing 2000-2 (1992), Business Briefing (1994), Reuters Television for the financial markets (1994), 3000 Series (1996) and the Reuters 3000 Xtra service (1999). In the mid-1990s, the Reuters company engaged in a brief foray in the radio sector ‚Äì with London Radio's two radio stations, London News 97.3 FM and London News Talk 1152 AM. A Reuters Radio News service was also set up to compete with the Independent Radio News. In 1995, Reuters established its \\"Greenhouse Fund\\" to take minority investments in start-up technology companies, initially in the US, only. In October 2007, Reuters Market Light, a division of Reuters, launched a mobile phone service for Indian farmers to provide local and customised commodity pricing information, news, and weather updates. =Acquisition by Thomson= On 15 May 2007, Canada's The Thomson Corporation acquired Reuters in a deal valued at US$17.6 billion. Thomson controlled about 53 percent of the new company, named Thomson Reuters. Tom Glocer, the former head of Reuters became the CEO of Thomson Reuters. An earlier rule of 15-percent maximum ownership was waived; the reason as given by Pehr Gyllenhammar, the chairman of the Reuters Founders Share Company, as that the \\"future of Reuters takes precedence over the principles. If Reuters were not strong enough to continue on its own, the principles would have no meaning.\\"Others dismissed this waiver as a convenience to get Company Management off the hook for poor performance.Aussie guardian for agency's ethics  The Australian citing the recent bad financial performance of the company. The acquisition was closed on 17 April 2008. Acquisitions and investments * Action Images ‚Äì In September 2005, Reuters purchased North London-based Action Images, a collection of sports photography of more than 8 million images, of which 1.7 million are online. * Application Networks ‚Äì In June 2006, Reuters acquired Application Networks, Inc., a provider of trade and risk management software based on JRisk, and agreed to acquire Feri Fund Market Information Ltd (FERI FMI) and its fund database subsidiary, FI Datenservice GmbH (FID). * AVT Technologies ‚Äì In December 2002, Reuters announced that it would acquire AVT Technologies, a specialist in foreign exchange transaction technology.

Corporate locations The Reuters Building in Canary Wharf, London Borough of Tower Hamlets From 1939, corporate headquarters were in London's famous Fleet Street in a building designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens. In 2005, Reuters moved to a larger building in the more modern Canary Wharf. The Reuters Building at 30 South Colonnade is near the One Canada Square tower, Jubilee Park and Canary Wharf tube station. The open space below the Reuters building has since been renamed Reuters Plaza. The company's North American headquarters are located in Hoboken, New Jersey. and were previously located at the Reuters Building at 3 Times Square, New York. It is on Seventh Avenue between 42nd and 43rd Streets, and was constructed from 1998 to 2001. The Asian headquarters were located in Singapore, having moved there from Hong Kong ahead of the British handover to China in 1997 (Thomson Reuters retains offices here at ICBC Tower and Cityplaza 3). It had two offices in Singapore, one in the city centre at One Raffles Quay, and another at 18 Science Park Drive next to the National University of Singapore.  References  * Read, Donald (1992).

The brand is now owned and manufactured by SPC Ardmona, which has itself been owned by Coca-Cola Amatil since February 2005. History The company was first established by Henry Jones in Hobart in 1891 as H. Jones & Company.John Reynolds, 'Jones, Sir Henry (1862 - 1926)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, Volume 9, MUP, 1983, pp 513-514. Retrieved 2009-08-19 The company derived from Jones' employment with George Peacock's jam factory from 1874. In 1895 the company purchased a building in Melbourne and commenced manufacture of jams and spreads. The building became known as The Jam Factory. IXL formed as a limited liability company in 1903. The IXL brand ‚Äì 'I excel in everything I do' was Henry Jones's personal motto. Throughout most of the twentieth century Henry Jones IXL thrived as a food processing company with IXL a leading brand. In 2004 the Henry Jones IXL business was the leading manufacturer of fruit spreads in Australia, with 30.2 per cent of the market, ahead of Cadbury Schweppes's Monbulk and Cottee's labels. In 1974 Elder Smith Goldsbrough Mort & Co Ltd merged with Henry Jones IXL to form Elders IXL under the managing directorship of prominent businessman, John Dorman Elliott. It was subsequently sold in 1989 to The J.M. Smucker Co. based in the USA. In 2004 Australian food company SPC Ardmona Ltd, based in Shepparton, bought the Henry Jones IXL business for $51 million. The primary processing plant of the Henry Jones Foods business was located in Kyabram, in Victoria's Goulburn Valley and is close to SPC Ardmona's manufacturing sites at Shepparton and Mooroopna. Products produced and marketed under the IXL brand by SPC Ardmona include fruit bars, fruit snacks, and a wide range of fruit spreads, including gourmet, low sugar, and tumbler ranges. On 25 February 2005, IXL, as part of SPC Ardmona, was bought by Coca- Cola Amatil. =Brands= IXL is an iconic Australian brand name, associated with jams and other fruit based products. A familiar feature of many Australian kitchens are the glass tumblers in which IXL brand jams are often sold. IXL was the flagship brand of Henry Michael Jones IXL, which was founded in Hobart, Tasmania in 1891 (as H. Jones & Co.), and expanded to the mainland shortly thereafter, purchasing a building in Melbourne in 1895. The name IXL is said to derive from the founders personal motto (variously quoted as 'I excel in everything I do' or 'I will excel in everything I do') however a manufacturer of stoves and other household appliances and fixtures based in Geelong, near Melbourne had been using the brandname IXL for some 30 years before H.

A total of 10,000 tons of arms and ammunition were involved in the explosion. The initial blast was started by a small fire created by a box of Egyptian rockets which had been armed with fuses prior to shipment contrary to safety protocol. The rockets had been sent by the United States Central Intelligence Agency to the Pakistani Inter- Services Intelligence for delivery to the mujahideen commanders as part of Operation Cyclone. There was an eight to ten minute delay between the start of the fire and the explosion. The previous year, a fire had been started by leaky white phosphorus grenades but was extinguished promptly, preventing an explosion. U.S. Defense Department officials said that they believed that the explosion at Ojhri Camp was the work of the Soviet Union and the pro-Soviet regime in Kabul as the explosion resembled the pattern of previous attacks by the Soviet Union and the Kabul regime against civilians and military installations in Pakistan. However, there were also some speculations that the camp was deliberately blown up to cover up the theft of weapons from the stocks. Further, Brigadier Mohammad Yousaf, who oversaw the operations of the mujahideen in his role as the head of the ISI Afghan Bureau from 1983 to 1987, suggested that while the Soviets had the most obvious motive, the CIA may also have had a hand in the explosion, as an Islamic fundamentalist government in Kabul was just as dangerous as a communist one to US interests. The Geneva Accords (1988) were signed just 4 days later, and the Soviets were able to withdraw without any major ambushes, claiming only one casualty on their retreat. This event hindered the mujahideen's capability to fill the power vacuum, as their weapons reserves were depleted and the CIA cut back their shipment of arms until December. Khaqan Abbasi, Father of future Prime Minister of Pakistan Shahid Khaqan Abbasi died in the disaster as his car was hit by a missile, while his son Zahid Khaqan Abbasi was hit on the head, after which he went into a coma and died in 2005, having remained bedridden for 17 years.

It was an outgrowth of the Bandung Conference, held in Indonesia during April, 1955, which led to the establishment of the Asian Legal Consultative Committee (ALCC). In April, 1958, it changed its name to the Asian-African Legal Consultative Committee (AALCC) to reflect the growth of its membership beyond the African side of the United Arab Republic. Since 2001, it has been known by its current name, the AALCO, reflecting the growth of its international status; currently an intergovernmental organization having received a standing United Nations invitation to participate as an observer in the sessions and the work of the General Assembly and maintaining a permanent office at Headquarters. In 2014, the AALCO established an Informal Expert Group on Customary International Law. That group adopted a set of comments on the work of the International Law Commission on identification of customary international law. Those comments and the report of the AALCO Special Rapporteur Sienho Yee are published on the website of the AALCO.  AALCO Regional Centres for International Commercial Arbitration  One of the major achievements of AALCO in its programme in the economic field was the launching of its Integrated Scheme for Settlement of Disputes in the Economic and Commercial Transactions in 1978. Pursuant to that Scheme, it was decided to establish Regional Arbitration Centres under the auspices of AALCO, which would function as international institutions with the objectives to promote international commercial arbitration in the Asian- African regions and provide for conducting international arbitrations under these Centres. Five such Centres have been established so far, as below: *Asian International Arbitration Centre (AIAC, formerly known as Kuala Lumpur Regional Centre for Arbitration), Malaysia *Cairo Regional Centre for International Commercial Arbitration (CRCICA), Arab Republic of Egypt *Regional Centre for International Commercial Arbitration Lagos (RCICAL), Nigeria *Tehran Regional Arbitration Centre (TRAC), Islamic Republic of Iran *Nairobi Centre for International Arbitration (NCIA), Nairobi, Republic of Kenya The respective host Governments recognize their independent status like an international organization and have accorded privileges and immunities to these Centres. AALCO provides its expertise and assistance to its Member States in the appointment of arbitrators and other matters related to the conduct of arbitration. Its Centers provide the opportunities for training of arbitrators as well. The Directors of the Centres, who are from amongst lawyers familiar to arbitration, are appointed by suggestion of the host governments and ratification of the Secretary-General of AALCO. Directors of the Centres present their reports on the functioning of the Centres at the Annual Sessions of AALCO.  List of AALCO Secretary-General * H.E.

It is a sequel to Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver and the third game in the Legacy of Kain series. Originally developed as a PlayStation and Dreamcast project, it was reworked into a PlayStation 2 and Microsoft Windows title in early production, and was released in 2001. Soul Reaver 2 was followed by two sequels, Blood Omen 2 and Legacy of Kain: Defiance, in 2002 and 2003. The game continues the adventures of the vampire- turned-wraith Raziel, the protagonist of Soul Reaver. Though Raziel initially seeks to exact revenge on Kain, his murderer and former master, this objective is superseded by a higher quest for knowledge and a desire for freedom, as he finds himself manipulated by those he encounters and begins to learn more about his former life as a human. Traveling through history, he gradually exposes the truth behind his own past and destiny, as he uncovers the history of Nosgoth. Hoping to deliver a more story-focused, cinematic experience than Soul Reaver, Crystal Dynamics researched time travel fiction, theology, and the works of Joseph Campbell when creating Soul Reaver 2's narrative. Critics praised the game for its involved storyline, visuals and puzzles, but criticized it for lacking replay value and ending without a definite resolution. Its developers felt the final product fell short of their ambitions, but it performed well commercially, and was included on Sony's \\"Greatest Hits\\" list. Gameplay Raziel with the wraith-blade in the Air Forge area. The icon in the lower left signifies that the light-elemental version of the Reaver is equipped, whereas the coil in the lower right indicates the player's health. Soul Reaver 2 is a single-player action- adventure game. The player controls Raziel, a ghostly \\"ex-vampire\\", from a third-person perspective. Gameplay, which is based on the original Soul Reaver, prompts the player to shift between two planes of existence‚Äîthe material and spectral realms‚Äîto progress. The material realm represents the physical, living world, whereas the spectral realm is a warped mirror of this environment. In the spectral realm, the player cannot manipulate objects and weapons, and water is insubstantial. Raziel's health slowly regenerates in the spectral world, whereas it gradually depletes in the material realm. If Raziel runs out of health in the material world, he is shunted into the spectral realm, and if killed in this plane, he returns to the nearest checkpoint. Save points enable players to record their progress and continue their game. Raziel retains most of the powers he possessed in the previous game, such as the abilities to glide, climb walls, fire bolts of telekinetic energy, and swim. To sustain his strength and travel between the planes, he must devour souls; this is typically accomplished by defeating enemies. The game's combat consists of a hack and slash system, entailing the use of combinations of attacks before executing a finishing move. Human enemies exist only in the material world, and include mercenaries, demon hunters, and the Sarafan, a monastic order of vampire hunters; other material creatures include dogs, thralls, and mutants. Sluagh are enemies who exclusively inhabit the spirit world, whereas cross-planar beings such as demons and shades can pursue the player between both realms. Enemies leave behind souls when killed, which replenish Raziel's health once consumed. The player's primary weapon is a ghostly version of the Soul Reaver sword, referred to as the wraith-blade. The wraith-blade is symbiotically bound to Raziel, and can be summoned or dismissed at any time in the material world, but, if overused, the sword can turn against Raziel, siphoning his health. Other weapons include claws, swords and spears. As the game progresses, the player encounters magical forges which imbue the wraith-blade with elemental powers associated with darkness, light, air, and fire. These enhancements have various uses, but are only available in the material realm. If Raziel shifts, he loses his active elemental imbuement, and must re-forge the blade at locations scattered throughout the game world. Plot =Setting= Soul Reaver 2 is set in Nosgoth, a fictional land with fantasy aspects. In the first game in the series, Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain, the vampire Kain embarks on a journey to restore the Pillars of Nosgoth‚Äînine supernatural edifices which are inextricably tied to the health of the land, but become corrupted.Raziel: The Pillars are still standing in this time? / Moebius: Yes, Raziel - they are the embodiment of the divine force which preserves the life of our world. We who serve the Pillars maintain their delicate balance - and Kain is destined to be the fulcrum upon which that balance turns. I believe you have already endured the wasteland wrought by his terrible, selfish decision. Kain's very existence is a cancer upon this world. As long as he lives, all of Nosgoth is in peril. Raziel: Shall I show you the same mercy you showed the rest of the Circle, then? You blithely murdered them to restore their Pillars, yet your hand faltered when it came to the final sacrifice. What makes you exempt, Kain? You're merely the last man standing. Why condemn me for simply carrying out what you hadn't the courage to do yourself? During his adventure, Moebius, a manipulative sorcerer, tricks Kain into orchestrating the destruction of the vampire race: Kain is left the last surviving vampire in Nosgoth.Kain: In my youth, I witnessed William's rise to power, and his transformation into the 'Nemesis' who laid waste to Nosgoth. / Raziel: Keep your distance, Kain. / Kain: Years later, I stumble upon a chance to journey back in history, unaware that the entire affair has been carefully orchestrated by Moebius. In my wisdom, I seize this opportunity to murder the young king before he can ravage Nosgoth... and thereby provide the catalyst Moebius needs to ignite a genocidal war against our race. / Raziel: I warn you ‚Äì no further! / Kain: This one reckless act unravels the skein of history. The Nemesis never becomes the Nemesis; William dies a martyred saint. I, the vampire assassin, become the author of my own species' extinction. And Moebius profits from it all. I destroyed a tyrant only to create one far worse. After restoring eight of the Pillars, Kain discovers that he would need to sacrifice his own life to restore the final corrupt one. Realizing that his death would ensure the annihilation of his species, he refuses to kill himself. This triggers the Pillars' collapse, and dooms the world to eternal decay, but enables Kain to live on and revive the vampire race.Kain: Thirty years hence, I am presented with a dilemma ‚Äì let's call it a two-sided coin. If the coin falls one way, I sacrifice myself and thus restore the Pillars. But as the last surviving vampire in Nosgoth, this would mean the annihilation of our species. Moebius made sure of that. If the coin lands on the reverse, I refuse the sacrifice and thus doom the Pillars to an eternity of collapse. Either way, the game is rigged. By the time of Soul Reaver, 1500 years later, Kain is a despotic emperor, his vampires dominate the land, and Nosgoth hinges on the brink of collapse.Raziel: I emerged... and for the first time beheld Nosgoth in its former glory. The land overflowed with abundant life and vitality. And I knew with certainty then that the world I had left behind was nothing more than the corpse of Nosgoth ‚Äì a lifeless husk, bled dry by the corruption of Kain's parasitic empire. This was the fragile world Kain sacrificed to preserve his own petty life and ambition, heedless of the profound cost. The sight only deepened my resolve... I sensed that the Pillars lay to the northwest ‚Äì if Kain truly waited to confront me there, I would not disappoint him... The Elder God, a demiurge-like entity, lurks beneath Nosgoth and controls the cycle of reincarnation; the vampires, whose biological immortality opposes his doctrine, are his enemies.Raziel: These are the fathomless truths, Raziel: the agony of birth and death and rebirth ‚Äì this is the Wheel of Fate, the purifying cycle which sustains all life. Vampires are an abomination, a plague which leeches this land of its spiritual strength. They obstruct the flow of life and death ‚Äì their souls stagnate in their wretched corpses. But the Wheel must turn; Death is inexorable and cannot be denied. Your destiny is irresistible, Raziel ‚Äì you are my soul reaver, the scourge of the vampires, reaper of their apostate souls. Remain steadfast. End the vampires' parasitic curse, and restore Nosgoth. Kain's blood belongs on your hands. In Soul Reaver, Raziel‚ÄîKain's lieutenant‚Äîis executed by Kain, but The Elder God resurrects him and encourages him to exact revenge.Raziel: Indebted? You would have me show gratitude for a 'gift' I didn't ask to be bestowed? Do you forget that you forced me to inhabit this vile carcass ‚Äì / Elder God: ‚Äì I restored you to yourself, Raziel. It was Kain who destroyed you. The very enemy you have just let slip through your grasp. Do not fail me, my servant... Traversing the wasteland and murdering the vampires, Raziel confronts Kain, who attacks him with the Soul Reaver sword, imbued with a spirit which absorbs its victims' souls. The Soul Reaver shatters when it strikes Raziel, and the blade's spirit binds itself to his arm.Raziel: And here I discovered the source of the displacement ‚Äì the Soul Reaver itself, laid out like a holy relic... And broken, apparently in the battle between William and Kain. I had not thought such a thing was possible... Until, of course, Kain shattered the blade against me when he tried to strike me down. Thus the captive spirit inhabiting the Reaver was released ‚Äì and binding itself to me, became my symbiotic weapon. His motives still mysterious, Kain lures Raziel through a time portal into Nosgoth's past. In Soul Reaver 2, it is established that, in Nosgoth, fatalism is an actuality‚Äîhistory is immutable, and all individuals are subject to predestination.Kain: ‚Äì and profoundly ingrained, Raziel. You must understand, our presence here doesn't alter history. You and I meet here because we are compelled to ‚Äì we have always met here. History is irredeemable. Drop a stone into a rushing river ‚Äì the current simply courses around it and flows on as if the obstruction were never there. You and I are pebbles, Raziel, and have even less hope of disrupting the time-stream. The continuum of history is simply too strong, too resilient. Raziel, due to his paradoxical destiny, is the only exception to this rule‚Äîhis presence enables temporal paradoxes to be triggered, altering history for better or worse.Kain: It doesn't matter, Raziel. Listen to me ‚Äì you must understand that every creature is bound to one predestined path. We are all shackled - / Raziel: ‚Äì to the Wheel of Fate. Believe me, I know that even better than you do. / Kain: All but one. Because of your re-making, you are the one unbound creature, the one among us all that truly has free will. You have a choice, Raziel ‚Äì Kain relies on Raziel's free will in a bid to outsmart Moebius and resolve the dilemma he faced in Blood Omen, ultimately hoping to enable both the restored Pillars and the vampire race to co-exist in the future.Kain: How strange to see this place long before my birth... centuries before the corruption set in that would poison the land, and put me on the treacherous path I still followed. In the future, these edifices would be condemned to darkness and decay. I would cause their fall, and build my empire upon their ruins. Was it still possible that with the right knowledge, the right moves, I might one day see Nosgoth restored, the Pillars pure once more? My answer ‚Äì according to Moebius ‚Äì lay somewhere to the west of this place. I could restore the world, perhaps. But never again could I give Nosgoth back her innocence. Soul Reaver 2 opens as Raziel emerges from the time slip and is greeted by Moebius, having arrived in an era 30 years prior to the events of Blood Omen.Moebius: My role as Time Guardian affords me a certain level of omniscience, Raziel. No, you don't kill me. That honor belongs to your maker, Kain, some thirty years from now. Two further time periods, 100 years after and 500 years before Blood Omen respectively, are also explored as the story progresses. =Characters= Raziel returns as the protagonist of Soul Reaver 2. In Soul Reaver, Raziel discovered that he was once a human and a leading member of the vampire-hunting Sarafan brotherhood, and his epiphanies drive the conflict in the story. Kain, the antagonist of Soul Reaver, appears as a non-player character in cutscenes, urging Raziel to unearth his destiny. Moebius the Time Streamer, a sorcerer who was a villain in Blood Omen and had a cameo at the end of Soul Reaver, is a primary antagonist of Soul Reaver 2 who attempts to manipulate Raziel into destroying Kain‚Äîit is revealed that he is an agent of The Elder God, Raziel's ally and guide in Soul Reaver, who is slowly established as a more sinister entity. Ariel, a specter bound to the Pillars who featured in Blood Omen and Soul Reaver, returns, and the vampire Vorador, also from Blood Omen, assists Raziel early in the game. The ancient vampire Janos Audron, a new character who was previously only mentioned in Blood Omen, acts as Raziel's mentor towards the end of the story. =Story= The story continues by summarizing Soul Reaver's ending: Raziel confronts Kain in Nosgoth's wasteland, and pursues him through a portal leading to the past. Moebius, the leader of a vampire-hunting crusade in this age, coerces Raziel to re-embrace his former heritage as a Sarafan vampire hunter by killing Kain.Moebius: You may never again be human, Raziel... But you can re-embrace the essence of your humanity, and the nobility of your Sarafan heritage. Go to him, Raziel, and end this. But first you will need to find your way out of the Stronghold ‚Äì and in this, I'm afraid, I cannot help you. My soldiers will not understand your appearance here; they will try to kill you. You needn't fear them, of course. They're no match for you. Try to keep the casualties to a minimum, but do what you have to do. All great movements require a few martyrs... Though Raziel is initially eager to do so,Raziel: For the first time, I beheld the image of my Sarafan self, memorialized here among my fallen comrades. It tortured me to see how noble and pure I had been ‚Äì and what a vile phantasm I had become. And a profound sense of injury ‚Äì of loss and betrayal ‚Äì welled up in me, so overwhelming I could barely contain it. All I wanted at this moment was to find Kain, and destroy him. his enthusiasm wanes over time as he witnesses the ruthlessness of Moebius's soldiers.Raziel: These vampires had nothing in common with the deranged jackals I left behind in Kain's derelict empire ‚Äì they seemed to retain much of their former humanity. In this era, vampires were clearly not the uncontested predators we had been... these creatures were hunted mercilessly, and oppressed. And while I still believed that vampirism was a plague, and had to be wiped out, there was nothing noble or righteous in this crusade ‚Äì this was simply ruthless persecution. Kain, who is destined to die at Raziel's hands in this era, implores Raziel to thwart fate and instead facilitate his quest to restore the Pillars.Kain: If you truly believe in free will, Raziel, now is the time to prove it. Kill me now, and we both become pawns of history, dragged down the path of an artificial destiny. I was ordained to assume the role of Balance Guardian in Nosgoth, while you were destined to be its savior. But the map of my fate was redrawn by Moebius, and so in turn was yours... After he learns that Moebius serves The Elder God, and that he has thus been duped,Raziel: I serve no one ‚Äì not you, not Kain... and not your lackey, Moebius. / Elder God: Moebius is my good servant. I have many. Raziel faces a decision: indulge his lust for vengeance but submit to fate by killing Kain, or defy his cohorts and exercise his free will by exerting mercy. While exploring this period, Raziel discovers evidence that two ancient races waged war in Nosgoth's distant past. One race created the Pillars to banish their adversaries, but the enemy race‚Äîthe Hylden‚Äîretaliated with a curse which transformed the Pillars' architects into the first vampires.Raziel: The scenes I discovered here were unambiguous... This race of winged beings ‚Äì the architects of the Pillars, and the creators of the Reaver ‚Äì were Nosgoth's first vampires. Their blood-thirst appeared to be a curse, inflicted upon them by their vanquished enemies. These images confirmed the truths that Kain had divulged to me, but I had been too incredulous to accept. I struggled in vain to see how the pieces fit together... How Kain intended to escape the dilemma of his destiny, and what role he had plotted for me... And why Moebius, and the dark powers with which he seemed to be allied, were so desperate to see Kain dead, and so intent on me being the instrument of his execution... Kain explains that, had he sacrificed himself, the vampire race‚Äîthe rightful inheritors of the Pillars‚Äîwould have become extinct.Raziel: We agree then that the Pillars are crucial, and must be restored? / Kain: Yes, Raziel ‚Äì that's why we've come full-circle to this place. / Raziel: So after all this you make my case for me. To end this stalemate, you must die so that new Guardians can be born. / Kain: The Pillars don't belong to them, Raziel... they belong to us. / Raziel: Your arrogance is boundless, Kain. / Kain: There's a third option ‚Äì a monumental secret, hidden in your very presence here. But it's a secret you have to discover for yourself. Unearth your destiny, Raziel. It's all laid out for you here. Raziel chooses to spare Kain, causing a paradox; history reshuffles itself to accommodate the extension of Kain's life.Kain: History abhors a paradox, Raziel. Even now, the time-stream strains to divert itself, finding its old course blocked by your refusal to destroy me. The future is reshuffling itself to accommodate your monumental decision. He, however, refuses to indulge Kain's plans any further, instead opting to explore his own past. Vorador tells Raziel that the last of the ancient vampires, Janos Audron, held the key to Raziel's destiny, but Janos was murdered by the Sarafan five centuries ago.Vorador: But you see, even if you are who you appear to be, it no longer matters... You're simply too late. Janos Audron ‚Äì the Reaver Guardian, the last of the Ancients, and my maker ‚Äì was murdered by the Sarafan nearly five centuries ago. He alone would have the answers you seek, but his secrets died with him. I don't know how you've come even this far without his guidance ‚Äì or without the Reaver, stolen these 500 years ago by the Sarafan. I am afraid, my friend, that you ‚Äì and all of us ‚Äì are out of luck. Deciding to speak with Janos, Raziel orders Moebius to send him further back in time.Moebius: What are you doing? / Raziel: Come now, Moebius ‚Äì you're a cunning serpent... you'll piece it together, I imagine. This era is of no further use to me. You will operate this device to provide me passage. I want to see the world in a simpler time ‚Äì before the Sarafan began their crusade. Moebius deceives Raziel, instead conveying him over a century into the future,Raziel: If I had any doubts about the era I now occupied, this grotesque tableau certainly eliminated them. For here was Moebius ‚Äì long since murdered by Kain ‚Äì lionized and beatified as the martyred leader of his bloodthirsty crusade. And if I required further evidence, I needed only to behold the gruesome trophy Moebius held aloft: the severed head of Vorador, the final triumphant kill of Moebius's cutthroat mob. His execution marked the annihilation of the vampires. Far from channeling me into Nosgoth's past, Moebius had propelled me over a century into its ghastly future. where he and The Elder God highlight the consequences of the Pillars' destruction to turn Raziel against Kain.Raziel: Well, they're certainly trying to eliminate you, Kain, there can be no doubt of that. I am assaulted relentlessly with demands for your demise. Whatever it is that you're plotting, they're scared to death of you. As for me, I suspect they made a grave error when they allowed my unique resurrection. I don't think they know how to destroy me. Raziel navigates the future era and finds his own way back to the age of the Sarafan and Janos Audron. There, Janos presents Raziel with the Reaver, a younger version of the physical Soul Reaver blade which will later house a soul-devouring spirit.Janos: The most formidable weapon ever forged by our swordsmiths... They infused the blade with vampiric energy, empowering the Reaver to drain our enemies of their precious lifeblood. / Raziel: As Janos presented the blade, an inexplicable sense of dread crept over me, more palpable than anything I'd felt before. I was at once horribly repelled by the sword and yet irresistibly compelled to touch it, to take it up. Suddenly, a group of Sarafan led by Raziel's former, human self launch an ambush, and Janos sacrifices himself. Raziel swears vengeance as Janos dies, and pursues the attackers.Raziel: I would pursue the Sarafan dogs to their loathsome fortress, and avenge Janos Audron's murder. Moebius would pay dearly for his treachery, and my Sarafan brethren would reap the horrors they had sown. I would retake the stolen Reaver, which was rightfully mine. And finally, when all these debts had been paid, I would reclaim Janos Audron's heart from their filthy, unworthy hands. If the heart was truly imbued with the power to restore vampiric unlife, its highest purpose was clear to me... I would restore the heart to Janos, and thus undo the vile crime committed by my abominable former self. He uses the Reaver to kill them and his younger self, renouncing his Sarafan past.Raziel: My former brethren Dumah and Rahab confronted me next ‚Äì this all seemed so elegantly choreographed. Exhilarated by the Reaver, I was drunk with revelations... I could finally appreciate the delicious irony of Kain's blasphemous, private joke ‚Äì and I reveled as I colluded with him across the centuries. For it was I who put these bastards in their tomb ‚Äì thus providing the corpses for Kain to raise as his vampire sons a millennium from now. The wraith-blade attached to Raziel's arm, over- aroused after the deaths of the Sarafan, suddenly seizes control of the physical Reaver, and impales Raziel; Raziel, horrified, then realizes his destiny. He himself has always been the ravenous spirit inside the Reaver, and therefore is fated to be stuck in a time loop; the sword shattered against him in Soul Reaver because it was unable to consume itself.Raziel: With all other foes exhausted, the conjoined blades turned themselves on me. And I realized, finally, why I had sensed nothing when Janos offered me the blade. The Reaver was never forged to be a soul-stealing weapon... the ravenous, soul-devouring entity trapped in the blade was ‚Äì and always had been ‚Äì me. This is why the blade was destroyed when Kain tried to strike me down ‚Äì the Reaver could not devour its own soul. The paradox shattered the blade. So ‚Äì this was my terrible destiny ‚Äì to play out this purgatorial cycle for all eternity... I could not bear it ‚Äì despair overwhelmed me. While his soul is being drawn into the sword, Kain emerges and tears the Reaver from Raziel's body, saving him in reciprocation and forcing history to reshuffle again.Raziel: And then... a growing sense of vertigo, and the familiar displacement ‚Äì the paradoxical moment when my twinned soul hovered both outside and inside the Reaver blade... This was the instant ‚Äì the glimmer of temporal distortion ‚Äì Kain had been counting on all along. This was the edge of the coin ‚Äì the minute flicker of probability upon which Kain had gambled everything. / Kain: Now you are free to reclaim your true destiny, Raziel. However, this paradox strains Nosgoth's history too far, enabling the Hylden to return and jeopardize his ambition to restore the Pillars.Raziel: Behind Kain's eyes, I could see new memories blooming and dying, as history labored to reshuffle itself around this monumental obstruction... And I could see by the dawning horror on his face that perhaps we had strained history too far this time... that by trying to alter my fate, he may have introduced a fatal paradox. / Kain: My god... the Hylden... we walked right into their trap... Raziel! Janos must stay dead! Amidst Kain's dismay, Raziel realizes that the wraith-blade is still bound to him, and laments that his destiny has not been changed, but merely postponed.Raziel: But Kain's warning was lost as I slipped into the spirit realm, too weak to maintain my physical form... And there, waiting for me as always, was the Reaver... the wraith blade ‚Äì my own soul, twinned and bound eternally to me. And I realized that I could never escape my terrible destiny... I had merely postponed it. History abhors a paradox. Development Even before the release of Soul Reaver, Crystal Dynamics were aware that they would create a follow-up, but had no \\"master plan\\". Soul Reaver uses the engine of Gex: Enter the Gecko. Prior to the beginning of development, director Amy Hennig emphasized that the role-playing game elements of Blood Omen, stronger dialogue and character interaction, a greater variety of acquirable mechanics, and wider use of the spectral realm should figure into the sequel. Pre-production began in late 1999, and the project briefly entered development for the PlayStation and Dreamcast with a targeted release date in fall of 2000. The team was given approval to switch to the PlayStation 2 after creating a proof-of-concept demo for E3 2000, and the game was announced as an console exclusive title for the PlayStation 2, dropping the Dreamcast and original PlayStation versions in the process. Executive producer Andrew Bennett analogized the developers' design sensibilities to the non-linear nature of Nintendo's The Legend of Zelda and Mario franchises, but said it was decided that Soul Reaver 2 would not be a \\"traditional 'complete a level, fight a boss' type of game\\". Level designers constructed a generalized puzzle and object-interaction system, helping to prevent an undesired re- emergence of Soul Reaver's abundant block puzzles. Instead of creating more inherent and optional abilities for Raziel, they focused on including new, mandatory enhancements for the Soul Reaver weapon. On the decision to downplay Raziel's quest for vengeance against Kain in this sequel, Hennig explained, \\"he's being pretty simple-minded, he's sort of being very black-and-white in his interpretation of things, and being kind of petulant [...] he's not really as heroic as Kain is, and he has a lot of stuff to figure out, basically, about what's going on\\". Soul Reaver 2 was crafted to feature a more cinematic, story-focused experience than its predecessor, which the developers felt had been \\"patchy\\" in this regard. It entered production after Blood Omen 2, but shipped almost six months before the latter game. A separate team within Crystal Dynamics, with creative autonomy, developed Blood Omen 2, and contradictions created by its scenario hindered work on Soul Reaver 2. After researching time travel fiction, Hennig devised a subplot concerning temporal paradoxes to resolve the continuity problems between both titles, and established that Blood Omen 2's story is a product of the final paradox created when Kain saves Raziel at the end of Soul Reaver 2. Other themes were inspired by the works of Joseph Campbell, and theology surrounding Gnosticism. Concepts which formulated the crux of the story included the idea \\"that the only way a hero can ever succeed is by following his own path\\", and the question, \\"can you change history or not? And if so, what does it mean to change history - in terms of being responsible for the repercussions?\\" British comic book writer Paul Jenkins was drafted by Crystal Dynamics to help refine the game's script. Though Soul Reaver features a variety of boss encounters, Soul Reaver 2 does not; this was a conscious decision on the part of the staff, to ensure the game's pacing more closely emulated that of a novel or a film, although near the end of the game, the Sarafan commanders including Raziel's human self are considered somewhat as a \\"bosses\\" since they are more challenging than the usual enemies during the game. While expanding the series' fiction, Hennig sought to take people back to the characters and mythology of the original Blood Omen, and built on its latent themes, including issues of fatalism, ethical dilemma and morality. In an interview, she stated that \\"the game will have a proper ending this time\\", and said \\"it has a conclusion. It's the end of a chapter. There won't be a cliffhanger\\". However, the story needed to be restructured several times before its completion, and, like the original Soul Reaver, many planned areas and abilities were excised, including three elemental forges (earth, water and spirit), more Reaver enhancements, and nine \\"spell-type things\\". She explained that the project's small programming crew, its switch to the PlayStation 2, and its limited 17 month production schedule had forced the team to \\"pick their battles\\", leading numerous features to be simplified or eliminated. Commenting on the final product, lead designer Richard Lemarchand said that Soul Reaver 2 \\"fell short of what the team had wanted to accomplish. In particular, some puzzles were too opaque, the combat was rather one- dimensional, [and the story] ended without a decent resolution\\". =Audio= Soul Reaver 2 was composed by Kurt Harland, of American band Information Society, and Jim Hedges. Harland and Hedges had already collaborated on Soul Reaver, but Hedges had not previously contributed compositions. The adaptive audio framework from the previous game returned; depending on signals from the game in certain situations‚Äîsuch as combat, puzzles, danger or suspense‚Äîthe game's soundtrack actively changes. Music from both Soul Reaver and Soul Reaver 2 was released on a promotional soundtrack in 2001. Gordon Hunt returned as the game's recording director, with Kris Zimmerman as casting director. Voice actors from both Blood Omen and Soul Reaver reprised their roles, with Michael Bell playing Raziel and Simon Templeman portraying Kain. The Elder God was again voiced by Tony Jay, Richard Doyle voiced Moebius, and Anna Gunn played Ariel. Paul Lukather, absent from Soul Reaver, rejoined the cast as Vorador. Ren√© Auberjonois, the only newcomer to the Legacy of Kain series, provided the voice of Janos Audron. Release Publisher Eidos Interactive was \\"broadly satisfied\\" with the commercial performance of Soul Reaver 2, which sold more than 500,000 copies by June 2002. Later, Sony re- released it under the \\"Greatest Hits\\" label. Shortly after the initial PlayStation 2 release in October 2001, the Microsoft Windows port shipped, developed by Nixxes Software BV. The PlayStation 2 release featured bonus material, including voice casting outtakes, artworks, a soundtrack, trailers, the game's dialogue script, and a compilation of Nosgoth's history. In 2012, digital distribution services GOG.com and Steam made the Windows port of Soul Reaver 2 available for purchase. Reception On the PlayStation 2, Soul Reaver 2 respectively received an aggregate score of 81% and 80/100 from rating websites GameRankings and Metacritic. Various reviewers held its storytelling, visuals and sound in high regard, but described its gameplay as dull and unsatisfying. Doug Perry of IGN praised the game's dark atmosphere and intriguing story, but said that it can become tiresome and drag on. He thought the \\"haughtiness\\" and drama of the dialogue, particularly between Raziel and Kain, was often overdone, and noted that its gameplay was near identical to that of its predecessor but with less replay value. Perry enjoyed the new puzzles involving the elemental powers of the Reaver for being more complex and diverse than the block puzzles of Soul Reaver, and praised the combat system. He gave the game a score of 9.0, but in his later review for Defiance, he revised his opinion, saying this rating was \\"way too high\\" and \\"that game told a great story, but just didn't deserve that score\\". Joe Fielder of GameSpot gave Soul Reaver 2 a score of 8.8 and called it an excellent sequel, again praising the change to elemental puzzles and the combat system, but criticizing the dearth of sidequests and boss fights, and the lack of definite resolution to the storyline. Electronic Gaming Monthly's reviewer said that it triumphed as an aesthetic showcase, but deemed its gameplay mediocre and unappealing. The reviewer for Game Informer regarded Soul Reaver 2 as \\"quite engrossing\\". Star Dingo of GamePro similarly praised its graphics, sound design and voice acting, but condemned missed creative opportunities concerning the potential of the spectral realm and time travel, saying that the game \\"takes as many steps back as it does forward, and ends up teetering precariously over the brink of being a disappointment\\". The review concurred with IGN that the plot and dialogue, though entertaining, sometimes bordered on pretentiousness, and Game Revolution's Duke Ferris repeatedly compared the story to a soap opera. Other critics, such as GameZone's Michael Lafferty, were less reserved in their praise of the narrative‚ÄîThe Electric Playground referred to it as \\"a textbook example to other console developers on how to write videogame prose\\"‚Äîbut agreed that its complex and involved backstory could alienate some players. Journalists also commonly cited Soul Reaver 2's poor lifespan and replayability as an issue; the reviewer for Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine opined that \\"the problem is that there just isn't much gameplay there\\" and Fielder warned that play \\"burns bright, but not as long as you'd like\\". Jim Preston reviewed the PlayStation 2 version of the game for Next Generation, rating it four stars out of five, and stated that \\"Perhaps a little too rococo for our tastes, Soul Reaver 2 is nonetheless an absorbing and expertly crafted game.\\" References Category:2001 video games Category:Action-adventure games Category:Cancelled Dreamcast games Category:Cancelled PlayStation (console) games Category:Dark fantasy video games Category:Legacy of Kain Category:PlayStation 2 games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Windows games Category:Crystal Dynamics games Category:Eidos Interactive games Category:Single-player video games Category:Vampire video games ","title":"Soul Reaver 2"},{"id":"2171598","text":"William Cullen Bryant High School, or William C.

Life Williams was born in Okinawa Prefecture, Japan, to a Filipino mother and an American father who was a chief petty officer in the United States Navy. She attended Fitch Middle School in Seaside, California, at the time of her abduction. Before moving to California, Williams and her family lived at Yokosuka Naval Base in Japan. It was the first time the family had lived in the mainland United States. Kidnapping Williams left her home at around 7:30 p.m. PDT. Greg returned home an hour later trailing his leash. The case attracted widespread, national media attention. Exactly seven months later, on January 12, 1999, a body was found on the former Fort Ord Army base about from the Williams' home. The remains were positively identified as those of Christina Williams. The area where she was found had been searched previously, but nothing had been found. The person who found Williams' body was a botanist from the University of California, Santa Cruz who was conducting a scientific survey. Sketches of people suspected of the abduction, a man in his late teens and one in his early twenties, were widely released in the media but they did not help in identification of the suspects. Aftermath Several celebrities, including Clint Eastwood, Mariah Carey, and Reggie Jackson, made a public service announcement for Williams. Her case was also aired on America's Most Wanted. Williams was survived by her parents and two siblings. Many people, including Williams' former friends in Japan, were affected by her abduction. Her family later moved to Florida. Investigators focused their efforts on finding a 1980s Mercury Monarch or Ford Granada car. In 2006, the still-open case was featured on CNN's Anderson Cooper 360¬∞. Up to US $100,000 has been offered for information leading to those responsible for her death. The City of Marina erected a memorial in Williams' honor located at 15520 Imjin Road, across from Preston Park. At the University of California, Berkeley a scholarship in her name was established by a philanthropist. Suspect and arrest It was reported that Charles Holifield was a suspect in Williams' murder. He was in prison for attempted kidnapping; he had raped teenage girls in the past. In 2011, an ex-girlfriend of Holifield recanted an alibi for Holifield she made in 1998, saying she had previously been threatened with harm if she withdrew it. In 2016, DNA found on Williams' clothing was found to match Holifield's DNA. On April 6, 2017 the District Attorney of Monterey County announced that Holifield would be arrested and charged with the murder. A death penalty trial for Holifield was originally set for October 2019 but was delayed. In December 2019, Holifield waved his right to a trial by jury, in order to remove the possibility of receiving the death penalty; in addition Holifield waved his rights to writs and appeals. On March 2, 2020 the non-jury trial began; on March 16, the defense team began their portion of the trial. On March 20, Judge Pamela Butler found Holifield guilty of the murder of Williams, with two special circumstances; he was sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.

The group came together in Tijuana, Baja California, Mexico. Their genre mixes electronica with musical elements and instrumentation of tambora and norte√±o music, resulting in the nortec (\\"norte√±o\\" + \\"techno\\") style. The various projects began producing and performing nortec music around 1999. In 2001, they were signed to a recording contract with Palm Pictures, and released their first album, Tijuana Session Volume 1, under the name Nortec Collective. The line-up for that album included Bostich, Clorofila, Fussible, Hiperboreal, Panoptica, Plankton Man and Terrestre. The latter two would leave Nortec Collective in 2002. Nortec Collective's second album, Tijuana Sessions, Vol. 3 (Nacional Records), received much critical praise and was nominated for two Latin Grammy awards in 2006. In 2008, Nortec Collective ceased to function as a proper collective, with the various individual projects performing and recording separately. According to the Collective's Myspace page, \\"For the time being, Nortec Collective has decided to release music separately...\\" and \\"Until further notice, there will be not be any bookings for Nortec, Nortec Collective or Colectivo Nortec with the full four member line-up.\\" The various individual projects went on to release and perform separately. 2008's Tijuana Sound Machine by Bostich and Fussible (Nacional Records) was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Latin Rock/Alternative Album. The Nortec Collective has borrowed several elements of Banda music sub-culture and have used them both in their songs (\\"Narcoteque\\", \\"Almada\\") and in their visuals and album covers. Performances and projects Since 1999, the Nortec Collective musicians have toured throughout the United States, Mexico, Europe, Japan and Latin America. They have played New York's Central Park SummerStage and Irving Plaza, as well as the Winter Music Conference in Miami, the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., and shows at the Royal Festival Hall in London and Elys√©e Montmartre in Paris. Former Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo invited Nortec to provide music for the Mexican pavilion at the Expo 2000 in Hannover, and they have done remixes for Beck, Calexico, Ennio Morricone, Kronos quartet, Leigh Nash, and Lenny Kravitz among others. In 2006 Nortec performed at the LA Weekly Detour Festival in Los Angeles, sharing the bill with Beck, Queens of the Stone Age, and Basement Jaxx. The band also performed \\"Que Bonita Bailas\\" for the AIDS benefit album Silencio=Muerte: Red Hot + Latin Redux produced by the Red Hot Organization. Nortec's music has appeared in commercials for Volvo, Dell, Fidelity Mutual, Edwin Jeans (with Brad Pitt), and Nissan. The song \\"Tijuana Makes Me Happy\\" is on the soundtrack 2006 FIFA World Cup Germany, the video game by EA Sports, and is the title song of the feature film by the same name. An interactive book entitled Paso del Nortec: This Is Tijuana dedicated to the Nortec phenomenon was released in the US, Mexico and Europe in 2004. In 2005, Nortec Collective released their most acclaimed work to date, the album Tijuana Sessions, Vol. 3, which received two Latin Grammy nominations and earned significant airplay on tastemaker radio stations like KCRW (Los Angeles), KEXP (Seattle) and KUT (Austin). The omission of a second volume was thought to have been in imitation of the Traveling Wilburys' intentional numbering of their two albums as Volumes 1 and 3, but it was more in reference to an unfinished Volume 2 album that was not released. The book Nor-tec Rifa!: Electronic Dance Music from Tijuana to the World by Alejandro L. Madrid was published in March 2008. It describes nortec music's composition process and its relation to the nortena, banda, and grupera traditions.

Tramp! Tramp!\\" and \\"The Battle Cry of Freedom\\". He is regarded as the first American to compose a secular cantata. Early life and education Root was born at Sheffield, Massachusetts, and was named after the German composer George Frideric Handel. Root left his farming community for Boston at 18, flute in hand, intending to join an orchestra. He worked for a while as a church organist in Boston, and from 1845 taught music at the New York Institute for the Blind, where he met Fanny Crosby, with whom he would compose fifty to sixty popular secular songs. In 1850 he made a study tour of Europe, staying in Vienna, Paris, and London.Obituary, New York Times, August 8, 1895, p. 2 He returned to teach music in Boston, Massachusetts as an associate of Lowell Mason, and later Bangor, Maine, where he was director of the Penobscot Musical Association and presided over their convention at Norumbega Hall in 1856. From 1853-1855, Root helped Lowell Mason and William Bradbury establish the New York Normal Musical Institute, which served as a school for aspiring music educators. From 1855 on, Root would spend most of his summers traveling and teaching at music education conventions throughout New England. He applied a version of Pestalozzi's teaching (although misunderstood by both Root and Mason) and was instrumental in developing mid- and late-19th century American musical education. He was a follower of the teachings of Emanuel Swedenborg. Career On his return from Europe, Root began composing and publishing sentimental popular songs, a number of which achieved fame as sheet-music, including those with Fanny Crosby: The Hazel Dell, Rosalie the Prairie Flower, There's Music in the Air and others, which were, according to Root's New York Times obituary, known throughout the country in the antebellum period. Root chose to employ the pseudonym Wurzel (German for Root) to capitalize on the popularity of German composers during the 1850s, and to keep his identity as a serious composer against his composition of minstrel and popular songs. Besides his popular songs, he also composed gospel songs in the Ira Sankey vein, and collected and edited volumes of choral music for singing schools, Sunday schools, church choirs and musical institutes. Root assisted William Bradbury in compiling The Shawm in 1853, a collection of hymn tunes and choral anthems, featuring the cantata Daniel: or the Captivity and Restoration. The cantata was a collaboration between Root and Bradbury musically, with text by Fanny Crosby and C.M. Cady. He also composed various sacred and secular cantatas including the popular The Haymakers (1857). Root's cantatas were popular on both sides of the Atlantic throughout the 19th century. His first cantata, The Flower Queen: or The Coronation of the Rose, was composed in 1851 with libretto by Fanny Crosby, and gained immediate success in singing schools across the United States.The Flower Queen has been regarded as the first secular cantata written by an American. Cover to \\"The Battle-Cry of Freedom\\" by George F. Root Building on his talent for song-writing, Root moved to Chicago, Illinois in 1859 to work for his brother's music publishing house of Root & Cady. He became particularly successful during the American Civil War, as the composer of martial songs such as Tramp! Tramp! Tramp! (The Prisoner's Hope), The Vacant Chair (with lyrics by Henry S. Washburn, about the death of John William Grout), Just before the Battle, Mother, and \\"The Battle Cry of Freedom\\". He wrote the first song concerning the war, The First Gun is Fired, only two days after the conflict began with the bombardment of Fort Sumter. He ultimately had at least 35 war-time \\"hits\\", in tone from the bellicose to the ethereal. His songs were played and sung at both the home front and the real front. Tramp, Tramp, Tramp became popular on troop marches, and \\"Battle Cry of Freedom\\" became well-known even in England. After the war, he was elected as a 3rd Class (honorary) Companion of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States. Root's songs, particularly \\"The Battle Cry of Freedom\\", were popular among Union soldiers during the war. According to Henry Stone, a Union war veteran recalling in the late 1880s: Later life and death Root was awarded the degree of Musical Doctor by the first University of Chicago in 1872. He died at his summer home in Bailey Island, Maine, at the age of 74. He was buried at the Harmonyvale Cemetery in North Reading, Massachusetts. Legacy Root was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1970. Tramp, Tramp, Tramp, the Boys are Marching provided the tune for the later Jesus Loves the Little Children, with lyrics by C. Herbert Woolston, and also for the later God Save Ireland. The Vacant Chair provided a tune reused in Life's Railway to Heaven, and sometimes reused in To Jesus' Heart All Burning.

It offers brand name clothing, footwear, bedding, furniture, fine jewellery, beauty products, and housewares. Products are at a 20-60% discount rate and the stores generally do not carry the same merchandise for an entire season. The firm does not sell online. Its market niche is similar to the American store TJ Maxx, and it is a partnered retailer to department stores HomeSense and Marshalls. History Winners logo from 1982 to 2005 Winners in Richmond Hill, Ontario Winners store in Bayers Lake Business Park with 1980s logo In 1982, Winners was founded in Toronto, Ontario by David Margolis and Neil Rosenberg. It was one of the first off-price department stores in Canada. In 1990, it merged with TJX Companies, the world's largest off-price department store owner. Since late 2001, Winners stores have been paired with HomeSense, a home accessory retailer, modelled on TJX's American HomeGoods stores. Winners acquired the struggling \\"Labels\\" brand from Dylex in 2001. Labels had been meant to compete with Winners, but never succeeded; most of its stores have been turned into Homesense stores. Les Ailes de la Mode opened a similar concept under the Labels banner after Winners did not renew its trademark on the name.  Controversy  In 2016, CBC's Marketplace investigated Winner's \\"compared at\\" pricing and found that retail price of the manufacture could be misleading and inaccurate. For example, \\"researchers at Marketplace found that a Risk board game at Winners was being sold for $49.99, with a \\"compared at\\" price of $100.00. However, the game was available at full price from retailer F.G Bradley's Canadian website for $74.99.\\" Winners responded by saying \\"compared at\\" prices are accurate and fair, and that the misunderstanding could be a result of an error in pricing merchandise due to their large volume of product intake.. In follow up letter to CBC marketplace, Winners was able to verify every \\"compared at\\" price for 20 out of the 21 items, by finding the items at the \\"compared at\\" prices at comparable retailers. For the remaining item, Winners admitted that it was an error on their part and pledged to fix the mismatch.

At the theatre, locals and visitors alike were able to watch performances of drama and song. Today its ancient edifice in the rione of Sant'Angelo, Rome, once again provides one of the city's many popular spectacles or tourist sites. Space for the theatre was cleared by Julius Caesar, who was murdered before its construction could begin; the theatre was advanced enough by 17 BC that part of the celebration of the ludi saeculares took place within the theatre; it was completed in 13 BC and formally inaugurated in 12 BC by Augustus,Leland M. Roth 1993 Understanding Architecture: Its Elements, History and Meaning (Westview Press: Boulder, CO and Cassius Dio 53.30.5., pp 230-31 named after his nephew Marcus Claudius Marcellus who had died in 23 BC. The theatre was 111 m in diameter and was the largest and most important theatre in Ancient Rome; it could originally hold between 11,000 and 20,000 spectators. A catalogue complied at the end of the 4th century recorded that the theatre's seating capacity was 17,580 persons.Gregorovius, Ferdinand, History of the City of Rome in the Middle Ages, Vol. 1, (1894), pg. 45 It was an impressive example of what was to become one of the most pervasive urban architectural forms of the Roman world. The theatre was built mainly of tuff, and concrete faced with stones in the pattern known as opus reticulatum, completely sheathed in white travertine. However, it is also the earliest dateable building in Rome to make use of fired Roman brick, then a new introduction from the Greek world.Blagg, T.F.C., \\"Brick and tile\\" section, in \\"Architecture, 1, a) Religious\\", section in Diane Favro, et al. \\"Rome, ancient.\\" Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press, accessed March 26, 2016, subscription required The network of arches, corridors, tunnels and ramps that gave access to the interiors of such Roman theatres were normally ornamented with a screen of engaged columns in Greek orders: Doric at the base, Ionic in the middle. It is believed that Corinthian columns were used for the upper level but this is uncertain as the theatre was reconstructed in the Middle Ages, removing the top tier of seating and the columns. Like other Roman theatres in suitable locations, it had openings through which the natural setting could be seen, in this case the Tiber Island to the southwest. The permanent setting, the scaena, also rose to the top of the cavea as in other Roman theatres. End section, showing later redevelopment The theatre fell out of use in the early 4th century and the structure served as a quarry, e.g., for the Pons Cestius in 370 AD. However, the statues located inside the building were restored by Petronius Maximus in 421 and the remaining structure still housed small residential buildings. In the Early Middle Ages the theatre was used as a fortress of the roman family of Faffo or Fabi (called \\"from Pescheria\\") and then at the end of the 11th century (when it was known as templum Marcelli), by Pier Leoni and later his heirs (the Pierleoni). This saved the complex from further destruction. The Savelli held it in the 13th century. Later, in the 16th century, the residence of the Orsini, designed by Baldassare Peruzzi, was built atop the ruins of the ancient theatre. By the 19th century, rises in the street level meant that almost half the ground floor was below it. Now the upper floors are divided into multiple apartments, and its surroundings are used as a venue for small summer concerts; the Portico d'Ottavia lies to the north west leading to the Roman Ghetto and the Tiber to the south west. In the 17th century, the English architect Sir Christopher Wren explicitly acknowledged that his design for the Sheldonian Theatre in Oxford was influenced by Serlio's engraving of the Theatre of Marcellus.

McFarland & Company, Inc. . P. 34. was an American actor and announcer in radio, television and film. With his rather youthful sounding voice, Bartell was one of the busiest West Coast character actors from the early 1940s until the end of network radio drama in the 1960s. He served in the United States Army. Early years Bartell was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, but grew up in Houston, where he got his start at station KRPC. In 1942, he joined the staff of KWKW radio as an announcer. Radio Upon moving to California, Bartell became a favorite of producer/director Norman MacDonnell, performing frequently on Escape (notably as Ronald Dawson in The Second Class Passenger and Peyton Farquar in Ambrose Bierce's An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge), and was a leading member of the Gunsmoke repertory company. Bartell was with the latter series from the first broadcast on April 26, 1952 until the last show on June 18, 1961; his roles ranged from friendly townspeople to victims to heavies, from the occasional role of Dodge City printer Mr. Hightower to famed gunslinger Doc Holliday in a 1952 episode. With fellow actor Vic Perrin, he also co-wrote two episodes near the end of the radio run, and appeared many times on the TV version of Gunsmoke, sometimes reprising his radio roles. Bartell worked on other radio Westerns such as The Six Shooter, Frontier Gentleman, Have Gun Will Travel, and Fort Laramie (a regular as Lt. Seiberts). Other recurring radio parts included a stint as one of several actors to play Archie Goodwin in The New Adventures of Nero Wolfe starring Sydney Greenstreet, Tommy Brooks on the situation comedy The Charlotte Greenwood Show, and Officer Ed Miller on Rogers of the Gazette. As an announcer, he was heard on The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes for several years, interviewing Dr. Watson and segueing into commercials for Petri Wine (he also announced on Silver Theater in the 1940sDunning, John. (1998). On the Air: The Encyclopedia of Old-Time Radio. Oxford University Press. . Pp. 615-616. and on the radio version of Dear Abby from 1960 until 1972). Other radio acting jobs included multiple roles in Norman Corwin's VE day special On a Note of Triumph, frequent appearances on Jack Webb's shows Dragnet and Pete Kelly's Blues, and episodic parts on The Modern Adventures of Casanova (starring Errol Flynn), My Favorite Husband, The Saint, Suspense, and Lux Radio Theater. He was a member of the stock company of the detective series Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar, playing characters on both sides of the law, as well as the recurring role of jittery insurance adjuster Harry Branson (and his equally fussy twin brother Peter Branson). Television In films and television, Bartell's youthful voice was revealed to come from a silver-haired figure. His TV appearances included guest roles on Get Smart, I Love Lucy, The Wild Wild West, The Untouchables, The Fugitive, and The Twilight Zone, in addition to the television versions of Gunsmoke and Dragnet (reprising his radio role of Father Rojas in Christmas episodes of the 1951, 1967, and 1970 series). Film Bartell's films included Voice in the Mirror, Johnny Concho, the 1954 Dragnet movie and an unbilled part in Howard Hawks' Monkey Business. Personal life Apart from his acting work, Bartell was an active photographer (many of his photos of the Gunsmoke cast appeared in the 1990 book on the series Gunsmoke: A Complete History). In his last years, he was a frequent presence at old-time radio conventions and recreations, wrote online articles about the medium and his experiences, and even participated in radio-themed chat rooms. His final radio appearance was on Seattle radio producer Jim French's series The Further Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, guest starring as a blustery American publisher in an August 2003 episode. He died the following February. Death On February 26, 2004, Bartell died in Ashland, Oregon. He was 90 years old. He was cremated and his ashes returned to his family in residence.

The first Yosakoi festival was held in 1954 in Kochi. Yosakoi-style dancing has spread throughout much of Japan. The style of dance is highly energetic, combining traditional Japanese dance movements with modern music. The choreographed dances are often performed by large teams. Along with a number of professional yosakoi schools and town dance teams, yosakoi is also a popular event during the sports festivals held by Japanese elementary, junior, and senior high schools. Yosakoi participants include men and women of almost all ages ‚Äì sometimes within a single team. Costumes and naruko A group of yosakoi dancers dancing down a street, with naruko clappers and large flags waving The costumes used by yosakoi teams vary widely. Happi coats and yukata are the most predominant costumes and can be seen in a wide variety of colors. However, some groups choose costumes that are based on historical attire, popular fashions, or ethnic fashions. Typically, all members of a team wear similar costumes. One of the defining aspects of yosakoi dance is the use of naruko: small wooden clappers that are held in the hands of each dancer. Naruko were originally used in K≈çchi Prefecture to scare birds away from rice fields. The traditional naruko has black and yellow beaters on a wooden body, but most modern yosakoi groups create their own naruko, choosing colors and materials that match their costumes. The use of naruko is required in yosakoi dance, but many groups also use other hand-held instruments or props, such as drums, other percussion instruments, flags, batons, and floats. Yosakoi Naruko Dancing The official yosakoi dance is based on a song called \\"Yosakoi Naruko Dancing\\", written by Takemasa Eisaku. This song was created by combining elements of three songs: \\"Yosakoi-bushi\\" (\\"yosakoi melody\\"), \\"Yocchore\\" (a children's song), and \\"Jinma-mo\\" (a folk song of K≈çchi Prefecture). The original competition in K≈çchi requires that each team's music include some part of this original music. Competitions and festivals in other areas may not have this requirement (thus allowing teams to compose their own music), or may require that elements of different local folk songs are worked into the dance routines. Takemasa has given the copyright on \\"Yosakoi Naruko Dancing\\" to the public. \\"Yosakoi Naruko Dance\\" by Takemasa Eisaku , English translation from Youtube Takeaki Mitsunaga „É®„ÉÉ„ÉÅ„Éß„É¨„É® „É®„ÉÉ„ÉÅ„Éß„É¨„É® / Yotchoreyo Yotchoreyo „É®„ÉÉ„ÉÅ„Éß„É¨ „É®„ÉÉ„ÉÅ„Éß„É¨ „É®„ÉÉ„ÉÅ„Éß„É¨„É® / Yotchore Yotchore Yotchoreyo „É®„ÉÉ„ÉÅ„Éß„É¨ „É®„ÉÉ„ÉÅ„Éß„É¨ „É®„ÉÉ„ÉÅ„Éß„É¨„É® / Yotchore Yotchore Yotchoreyo È´òÁü•„ÅÆÂüé‰∏ã„Å∏Êù•„Å¶„Åø„ÅÑ„ÇÑÔºà„ÇΩ„É¨Ôºâ/ Come to near Kochi castle „Åò„Çì„Åæ„ÇÇ „Å∞„Çì„Å∞„ÇÇ „Çà„ÅÜË∏ä„Çã / Grandfather and grandmother are dancing well È≥¥Â≠ê‰∏°Êâã„Å´ „Çà„ÅÜË∏ä„Çã „Çà„ÅÜË∏ä„Çã / Dancing well holding Naruko in hands Âúü‰Ωê„ÅÆ„ÉºÔºà„É®„Ç§„É§„Çµ„Éé „Çµ„Éé „Çµ„ÉéÔºâ È´òÁü•„ÅÆ „ÅØ„Çä„Åæ„ÇÑÊ©ã„ÅßÔºà„É®„Ç§„É§„Çµ„Éé „Çµ„Éé „Çµ„ÉéÔºâ/ Near the Harimaya bridge in Kochi known as Tosa Âùä„Åï„Çì „Åã„Çì„Åñ„ÅóË≤∑„ÅÜ„Çí„Åø„ÅüÔºà„ÇΩ„É¨Ôºâ/ A monk is buying a hairpin „Çà„Åï„Åì„ÅÑ „Çà„Åï„Åì„ÅÑÔºà„Éõ„Ç§ „Éõ„Ç§Ôºâ/ Yosakoi Yosakoi hoi hoi ‰∫å„ÄÅÔºà‚Äª„Åè„ÇäËøî„ÅóÔºâ/ Verse 2 Âæ°Áï≥ÁÄ¨Ôºà„É®„Ç§„É§„Çµ„Éé „Çµ„Éé „Çµ„ÉéÔºâ Ë¶ã„Åõ„Åæ„Åó„Çá Êµ¶Êà∏„ÇíÈñã„Åë„Å¶Ôºà„É®„Ç§„É§„Çµ„Éé „Çµ„Éé „Çµ„ÉéÔºâ/ Lets show Mimase.

There are two versions of it: the black canoe and the jade canoe. The black canoe features on Canadian $20 billshttp://www.billreidfoundation.org/banknote/spirit.htm issued between 2004 and 2012. Background The Spirit of Haida Gwaii, the Jade Canoe, inside Vancouver International Airport The sculpture was originally created in 1986 as a -scale clay model, enlarged in 1988, to full-size clay. In 1991, the model was cast in bronze. This first bronze casting was entitled The Spirit of Haida Gwaii, the Black Canoe and is now displayed outside the Canadian Embassy in Washington, D.C. The second bronze casting, entitled The Spirit of Haida Gwaii, the Jade Canoe, was first displayed at the Canadian Museum of History in 1994. Finally, in 1996, the Jade Canoe (as it is generally called) was moved to the International Terminal at Vancouver International Airport. The original plaster pattern for the sculpture is on display in the main hall of the Canadian Museum of History.http://www.historymuseum.ca/cmc/exhibitions/aborig/grand/gh04eng.shtml Full-sized model in Canadian Museum of History On 30 April 1996 Canada Post issued The Spirit of Haida Gwaii, 1986‚Äì1991, Bill Reid in the Masterpieces of Canadian art series. The stamp was designed by Pierre-Yves Pelletier based on a sculpture The Spirit of Haida Gwaii (1991) by William Ronald Reid in the Canadian Embassy, Washington, United States. The 90¬¢ stamps are perforated 12.5 mm √ó 13 mm and were printed by Ashton-Potter Limited.Canada Post stamp An image of the sculpture is featured prominently on the reverse of the 2004 edition of the Canadian twenty-dollar bill. These bills are no longer issued; a new design entered use in 2012. Sculpture Port side of the Jade Canoe The Spirit of Haida Gwaii is intended to represent the Aboriginal heritage of Haida Gwaii, formerly called the Queen Charlotte Islands. In green-coloured bronze on the Vancouver version and black-coloured on the Washington version, it shows a traditional Haida cedar dugout canoe which totals six metres in length. The canoe carries the following passengers: Raven, the traditional trickster of Haida mythology, holding the steering oar; Mouse Woman, crouched under Raven's tail; Grizzly Bear, sitting at the bow and staring toward Raven; Bear Mother, Grizzly's human wife; their cubs, Good Bear (ears pointed forward) and Bad Bear (ears pointed back); Beaver, Raven's uncle; Dogfish Woman; Eagle; Frog; Wolf, claws imbedded in Beaver's back and teeth in Eagle's wing; a small human paddler in Haida garb known as the Ancient Reluctant Conscript; and, at the sculpture's focal point, the human Shaman (or in Haida), who wears the Haida cloak and woven spruce root hat and holds a tall staff carved with images of Seabear, Raven, and Killer Whale. Consistent with Haida tradition, the significance of the passengers is highly symbolic. The variety and interdependence of the canoe's occupants represents the natural environment on which the ancient Haida relied for their very survival: the passengers are diverse, and not always in harmony, yet they must depend on one another to live. The fact that the cunning trickster, Raven, holds the steering oar is likely symbolic of nature's unpredictability. The sculpture is long, not quite from the base to the top of the Shaman's staff, and weighs nearly .http://www.canadainternational.gc.ca/washington/offices- bureaux/haida.aspx?lang=eng References External links *Vancouver International Airport: The Spirit of Haida Gwaii page *Foreign Affairs Canada: The Spirit of Haida Gwaii page Category:First Nations culture Category:Outdoor sculptures in Washington, D.C.

Alice Houri, who starred in Denis' previous film N√©nette et Boni, has a small cameo as a girl on a metro who watches Shane. Plot An American couple, Dr. Shane Brown and his wife June, go to Paris, ostensibly for their honeymoon. In reality, Shane has come to Paris to hunt down neuroscientist Dr. L√©o S√©meneau and his wife, Cor√©, whom Shane once knew and was obsessed with. Despite having had a prolific career, L√©o is now working as a general practitioner to keep a low profile. He locks Cor√© in their house every day, but she occasionally escapes and initiates sex with men before violently murdering them. To protect her, L√©o buries the bodies. Shane begins investigating S√©meneau's whereabouts. A doctor who once worked with L√©o eventually gives Shane the couple's address, explaining that Cor√© is unwell. Meanwhile, two young men who have been casing the S√©meneau home break in, and one of them finds Cor√© in a boarded-up room. After she seduces him, they begin to have sex, but she violently bites him to death, ripping out his tongue with her teeth. When Shane arrives at the house, he discovers Cor√© covered in blood. She tries to bite him, but Shane is able to overpower her. As he strangles her, she drops a match, setting the house on fire. Shane leaves her to be consumed by the flames. Just after Shane departs, L√©o arrives and witnesses the carnage and the dead Cor√©. After Cor√©'s death, Shane becomes strange and distant. While having sex with his wife, he stops and finishes by masturbating, then runs away from her and adopts a puppy. Finally, he goes to a hotel where he brutally rapes a maid and bites her to death, then showers and washes the blood from his body. His wife enters and the couple agree to return home.

Derek Elley of Variety wrote that it is \\"over-long, under-written and needlessly obscure instead of genuinely atmospheric.\\" Chris Fujiwara of The Boston Globe was more positive, but concludes by calling the film \\"a success in some sense, but it's hard to like a film so cold and dead.\\" Later, the film developed a small following who admire it for its themes of existentialism and its unique take on the horror genre as well as gender roles. It was given an in depth analysis by Salon.com which looked at the intricacies of the film, particularly the metaphorical nature of the narrative. At Film Freak Central, Walter Chaw said, \\"Plaintive and sad, Claire Denis' Trouble Every Day is a rare combination of honesty, beauty, and maybe even genius.\\"review The film has been associated with the New French Extremity.Quandt, James, \\"Flesh & Blood: Sex and violence in recent French cinema\\", ArtForum, February 2004 Accessdate: 10 July 2008.

Assurances In 2000, the British Government asserts that \\"Cantonese-speaking staff at the British Consulate-General pay periodic visits to the 80 or so BN(O)s who are in prison in Thailand.\\" In 2005, the British Consulate-General Hong Kong advertised for renewal of BN(O) passports in some magazines (e.g. HK Magazine) in Hong Kong, saying that \\"Travel with confidence on your BN(O) passport. Reliable. Secure. And renewable for life.\\" The Government of the People's Republic of China (PRC) claims that BN(O)s who are also PRC citizens can enjoy PRC consular protection in third countries even they travelled on their BN(O) passports. Incidents There have been instances that have cast some doubt regarding the availability of British consular protection for BN(O)s outside the UK and the PRC. In 1999, it was reported that a Hong Kong resident, who had travelled to India on his BN(O) passport had been wrongly detained for 23 days because his BN(O) passport was suspected by Indian officials to be fake and was certified as a forgery by the British High Commission in Bombay without seeking verification from the relevant authorities (British Consulate-General) in Hong Kong. However, he sought assistance from the PRC Embassy there and the BN(O) passport was verified by the British Consulate-General Hong Kong under pressure of the PRC Government. It was found that his BN(O) passport was genuine. ( pp. 22‚Äì25) Pursuant to this issue, the British authorities have upgraded all British passports regardless of type to include enhanced security features such as digitised photographs and signatures, and electronic security features that have made requests for verification by foreign immigration officers by the British Consulate-General in Hong Kong far less necessary/frequent. In 1999 Wu Man, a British National (Overseas) and a Hong Kong resident, was alleged to be a member of the gang once led by Cheung Tze- keung. He was arrested by police in a Bangkok street. As the request of the Chinese Government Wu was sent to mainland China directly. No formal extradition hearing was held for him because, say the Thai authorities, \\"he didn't ask for it\\". They also claimed that Wu, went willingly to China. The British Foreign Office stated that it should have been informed of Wu's arrest and impending extradition. Wu, in turn, should have been able to seek British consular assistance in Bangkok. However, British Foreign Office Minister John Battle, claimed the Thai authorities had later promised it would not happen again.

Keaton played the title character, a father killed in a car accident before returning to life as a snowman. Three of Frank Zappa's four children, Dweezil Zappa, Ahmet Zappa, and Moon Unit Zappa, appear in the film. Jack Frost was released in Australia on December 10, 1998, a day prior to its American release. It received negative reviews and became a box-office bomb, grossing just $34 million. Plot Jack Frost is the lead singer in a rock band simply titled \\"The Jack Frost Band\\", based in the town of Medford, Colorado, who make their living performing blues covers and an assortment of their own songs in the hope of signing a record deal. He returns to his 11-year-old son Charlie, who has just returned from a snowball fight against local bully Rory Buck. After they build a snowman in their front yard, Jack gives him his best harmonica, which he got the day Charlie was born, jokingly telling him that it's magical, and he will be able to hear it wherever he is. Jack promises his wife Gabby that he will attend his son's hockey game, but misses it in favor of recording \\"Don't Lose Your Faith\\". To make up for it, Jack then promises to take his family on a Christmas trip to the mountains, but is called in on a gig that could make or break his career. On his way there, Jack realizes his mistake and borrows his best friend (and keyboardist) Mac MacArthur's car to go home to his family. Unfortunately, Jack encounters a bad storm that he is unable to navigate through, due to a faulty windshield wiper, and unexpectedly crashes the car, killing himself (off-screen). A year later, Charlie, depressed over his father's death, withdraws from all contact with his friends. One night, Charlie makes another snowman that bears as much of a resemblance to Jack as he can remember and plays Jack's harmonica just before going to sleep. The harmonica turns out to be magical after all, as it resurrects Jack and his spirit awakens in the snowman. Thrilled to be alive again, Jack attempts to greet Charlie, but ends up terrifying him. The next day, Charlie discovers Jack in his yard and attempts to run away from him. When Charlie winds up in the snowball battlefield, Jack pelts Rory and the other children with snowballs and escapes with Charlie on a sled. After losing them, Charlie realizes that the snowman is his father after Jack uses his nickname \\"Charlie boy\\". Jack reconnects with Charlie and teaches him the values that he never got to teach him when he was alive. After some hockey lessons, Jack convinces Charlie to rejoin the team instead of continuing to grieve over his death, becoming their best player. In the meantime, Mac continues to be a friend of the family, while also becoming a father figure to Charlie at Gabby's suggestion. As winter approaches its end, Jack begins melting and struggles to get to Charlie's hockey game. Afterwards, Charlie decides to take Jack to the mountains where it is colder, but has a difficult time convincing Gabby to do so. Charlie comes across Rory, who also insults the snowman by asking which is more stupid. After Jack speaks in front of Rory by correcting his last sentence, Rory then sympathizes with Charlie not having a father and helps him sneak Jack onto a truck en route to the mountains. Jack and Charlie arrive at the isolated cabin that the family was going to stay at before Jack's death. Jack calls Gabby, nonchalantly asking her to come to the cabin to pick up Charlie; Gabby is shocked, but recognizes his voice and obliges. Jack tells a disheartened Charlie that he has to leave. When his wife arrives, the snowman shell dissipates, revealing Jack in an ethereal form. Jack tells Charlie he will be with him wherever he goes and, after saying farewell and giving his love to both his wife and son, returns to the afterlife. In the closing moments of the film, Charlie plays hockey with his group of friends (which now includes Rory), while Gabby happily watches and Mac plays music on the piano. The final street scene shows that all the front lawns have snowmen on them.

It has been acclaimed several times as the cleanest and greenest city in the Philippines. Etymology The name Puerto Princesa have several origins. It is said to have been attributed by locals to a princess-like maiden who roam the place at certain nights of the year, while other accounts attributed its geographical advantage as a seaport which is a naturally protected area due to its surrounding mountains, and is characterized by a depth able to accommodate any size of shipping vessel. Historically, this place was originally named Port Asuncion after Princess Asuncion, one of the princesses born to Isabella II of Spain and her consort, Francis, Duke of C√°diz. When the princess suffered an untimely death, the Queen changed the name to Puerto de la Princesa. Eventually, the name was shortened to Puerto Princesa.Tourist city venue for PNRC event.(Tourism), highbeam.com  History  = Spanish period = A 1904 map of Puerto Princesa Spanish colonizers founded the settlement on March 4, 1872 in the course of their exploration of the province. As they scanned the Palawan shoreline for a capital site, they came upon a hill with steep declivity. Rowing to shore, they surveyed the hill and discovered an extensive plateau which they decided as ideal for settlement. Soon after, Fr. Antonio Muro levelled a portion of the hill to make way for a chapel (that section is now occupied by the Roman Catholic Cathedral, the P.C. Barracks and the Rizal Park, the Old Municipal Building used to be there, as well as an Elementary School). The first mass celebrated in Puerto Princesa took place at a site where a marker now stands. In May 1872, the Port of Puerto Princesa became the center of Spanish Naval Operations in the area because the Bay met all the Navy's requirements. Royal Decrees later provided incentives to settlers, and by 1883 the settlement had flourished into a town of twelve roads, a hospital and well-built port. In 1894, Puerto Princesa was recognized by government authorities as one of the most beautiful towns in the country by virtue of the orderly distribution of streets, buildings and houses as well as the cleanliness of the community. = American period and World War II = In 1911, the New American Administration made Puerto Princesa the seat of the Palawan Provincial Government with Major John Brown as Lieutenant Governor.

They describe this territory as \\"two low islets about fifteen leagues from the island of Panay\\". They ruled these islets from the town of Arevalo in Iloilo by sailing south-southeast from this part of Panay, to the open sea. The islands are surrounded by many low reefs. But the Spaniards were able to discover their narrow entry, avoiding the great danger that awaited ships.Miguel de Loarca, Relacion de las Yslas Filipinas (Arevalo: June 1782) in BLAIR, Emma Helen & ROBERTSON, James Alexander, eds.

During the early period of Spanish colonizations, these small islets were inhabited by four hundred people, all of whom were very skillful shipbuilders. They were from Panay, and they came to these islets in order to fortify themselves by the reefs, for fear of pirates. Then they undertook to return to Panay in order to dwell there. But many of their women died there. Seeing this, as they were soothsayers, they returned to the islands of Cagayan, from where they set out every year, and scattered themselves over all the islands to build ships. They built the ships of the Spanish Royal Navy in the Philippines, as well as galleys, galliots, and frigates. They also helped in repairing and righting ships. Being the most important people in the islands for the Spaniards, the adelantado Miguel L√≥pez de Legazpi allotted their islands to the encomenderos of Negros Island. Afterwards, the colonizers found it best to put them under the direct control of the Spanish Crown. Thus, it was governed from the town of Arevalo in Iloilo. Historically, the islands also became part of Antique Province. It was made into a municipality in 1810, with Omabong as its first mayor. During the American regime, it came under the jurisdiction of Negros Occidental. In 1959, the following sitios were constituted into barrios of Cagayan: * the sitios of Banted, Nipay, Dool, Cavili, Cabayog and Langtad, as barrio Talaga; * the sitios of Ibiok, Panderse, Lato and Gatung-an, as barrio Mampio; and * sitio Nusa as Barrio Nusa Demographics In the , the population of Cagayancillo was people, with a density of .

It is known for being a vacation spot for those looking for sailing, fishing, and other activities associated with the water. The Middlesex County Board of Supervisors approved a resolution on October 2, 2012 supporting the efforts of the official naming, \\" Deltaville, The Boating Capital of the Chesapeake Bay.\\" Approximately 500-800 full-time residents call Deltaville home; however, the town's population swells to several thousand in the summer months. Deltaville is also home to numerous retirees. The Census Bureau defines Deltaville as a census-designated place (CDP) with a population of 1,119 as of 2010.Virginia Trend Report 2: State and Complete Places (Sub-state 2010 Census Data). Missouri Census Data Center. Accessed 2011-06-08. The town developed around being a large boat building area, mostly for commercial bay watermen. However those days have passed and now the area is dotted with numerous marinas, boatyards, and marine related businesses. Originally known as Sandy Bottom, the community decided to change the town name in 1909. The name Delta was proposed, because of the shape of the town, as it is bordered by the Rappahannock River to the North, the Piankatank River to the south, and the Chesapeake Bay to the east. There was a Delta, Virginia already in existence, so \\"ville\\" was tacked onto the end. The Deltaville ZIP code is 23043. Deltaville has been home for over a half century to a semi-pro baseball team, the Deltas. The 1948 vintage Deltaville Ballpark is their home field. Other activities in the town include a town pool, tennis courts, basketball court, and playground, and a community center, all built and maintained by a volunteer Board of the Deltaville Community Association - a (501) (c) (3) organization. The Deltaville Maritime Museum and Holly Point Nature Park, home to the Nationally registered historic buyboat, the F.D. Crockett, is located in Deltaville at 287 Jackson Creek Road. Situated on 36 acres crossing both the waters of Mill Creek and Jackson Creek Road, this water accessible park acts as a setting for the Museum, the multi-purpose events pavilion, outside exhibits and the waterfront performance area. Founded in 2002, the Museum and Park's mission is to preserve and present the history of Chesapeake Bay watermen, their workboats, fisheries, and methods. The Museum and ParkMuseum also host farmer's markets, plays, concerts, and Holiday events throughout the year. The tip end of Deltaville is Stingray Point, named by Captain John Smith on July 17, 1608. According to Captain John Smith's The General History, \\"He was stung by a stingray there while exploring the bay. Captain Smith is said to have given orders for his men to dig a grave because he believed himself to be dying from the sting. Walter Russell, a doctor of physic, and also a member of Smith's crew, applied a \\"precious oil\\" to Smith's wound. The Captain recovered sufficiently to eat the stingray for his dinner that evening. The legend that a cure was given to Smith by local Native Americans, who lived along what is now called Antipoison Creek, has been largely been discredited.\\" On the evening of April 16, 2011, the community was struck by a devastating tornado. Prior to reaching Deltaville the storm had torn a path from North Carolina to the Chesapeake Bay. With wind gust estimated 135 mph it only took minutes to cause approximately 6.8 million in damages. The tornado touched down near Porpoise Cove, on the south side of Deltaville, and ran a northeast path, destroying 32 homes, along with Zoar Baptist Church, the Community Association Pool, and severely damaged the community hall. Despite injuries, no one was killed. The F.D. Crockett was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2012.

He also feels that the title track for Final Fantasy VI was the most challenging track he has ever made. As for Final Fantasy VI Grand Finale, on the other hand, Uematsu has said that he was \\"not satisfied with this album at all\\", due to the deviation it took from his original visions for the music due to his lack of personal involvement in the arrangements. Although he did not feel that the album was a poor one, saying that if he said nothing no one would ever know of his dissatisfaction, he felt that it was not what he would have created if he had \\"defend[ed] the image of each piece\\".

He had previously served as provisional governor of Arizona Territory from 1860 to 1861.  Early life  Born in Roane County, Tennessee, Owings went to Yell County, Arkansas and then to Texas, where he helped found the town of Helena, serving as the first postmaster. In 1855, he served in the Texas House of Representatives but was defeated for reelection moving to Mesilla, New Mexico, where he had a mine.  Political career  In 1860 Owings was chosen as Provisional Governor of \\"Arizona Territory\\"--a region including New Mexico and Arizona--in an organization convention at Tucson. The Convention subsequently petitioned the United States Congress for recognition of their government, but the impending conflicts of the American Civil War in the east distracted Washington's attention away from what was then a remote frontier outpost. Owings nevertheless proceeded to carry out the official functions of a de facto governor in the largely unorganized territory and established three militia companies to protect residents from Indian raids and border smugglers. Owings held the post until August 1, 1861, when the Arizona Territory was formally reorganized by the Confederacy and declared south of the 34th Parallel by Lieutenant Colonel John R. Baylor, who then assumed the governorship. In 1862, following Baylor's ouster and the Confederate retreat from the territory following the Union victory at Glorietta Pass, Owings was again appointed Governor of the territory and held the office in exile in San Antonio until the end of the Civil War.  Later life  After the American Civil War, Owings went to Kansas briefly and then settled in Denison, Texas, serving briefly as mayor.http://followingtheirfootsteps.net/getperson.php?personID=I16483&tree;=Owings  References   Further reading  *In Old Arizona: True Tales from the Wild Frontier (1985) by Marshall Trimble  External links  * Category:1820 births Category:1875 deaths Category:19th-century American businesspeople Category:19th-century American physicians Category:19th-century American politicians Category:Governors of Arizona Territory Category:Burials in Texas Category:Businesspeople from Tennessee Category:Exiled politicians Category:Mayors of places in Texas Category:Members of the Texas House of Representatives Category:People of Arizona in the American Civil War Category:People from Roane County, Tennessee Category:Physicians from Tennessee ","title":"Lewis S.

Its territory includes the western half of Cuyo Island, as well as Bisucay, Caponayan, Cauayan, Imalaguan, Lubid, Manamoc, Pamalican, Pandan, Round, and Quiminatin islands, all part of the Cuyo Archipelago. Cuyo is the oldest town in Palawan which has a culture of its own and was preserved for more than 350 years. During the Spanish colonization of the Philippines, Cuyo became the second capital of Palawan after Puerto Princesa from 1873 to 1903.Cuyo , Official Website of the Province of Palawan. Accessed November 9, 2012. From the sea, Cuyo Island's first visible landmark is a lighthouse by the pier. Many of the streets leading to the town have already been cemented but the town has preserved the Hispanic plaza-iglesia structures. Dominating the town centre is Cuyo's 1860 church, convent, and fort built by the Spanish and finished in 1680. Nearby stands a schoolhouse, and a monument of national hero Jose Rizal. The municipality is served by Cuyo Airport in the neighboring municipality of Magsaysay. The town and its cultural and natural environs are being considered to be nominated in the tentative list for UNESCO World Heritage Site declaration in the future. History Oriental traders were early discoverers of the Cuyo group of islands and introduced barter trading with the locals. Later, the Malay chief Matuod and his people arrived in big boats called sakayan and formed settlements on Cuyo. The Islamic chieftain Datu Magbanua later also settled on Cuyo, later consolidating his power so that chieftains from other islands recognized his rule. The Malays brought with them their dances, and when blended with native dance, the \\"Soriano\\", it became known as the \\"pondo-pondo\\" one of the most popular folk dances even up to the present. During the rule of Datu Magbanua, three Chinese arrived on the island and settled also on Cuyo. The Chinese discovered gold deposits in Mount Aguado and introduced gold mining, smith working, pottery, and other handicrafts. The natives of Cuyo became suspicious of their presence and later expelled them. They sailed to Ilongilong (today known as Iloilo) and formed another settlement called Pari√°n. In 1622, the Conde de San Agust√≠n, together with five Spanish missionaries, colonised the island they named Cuyo. The friendly character of the people proved to be a blessing to the Spaniards, who found it easy converting the native population to Catholicism. They immediately baptised some 500 inhabitants, however, many still regarded their indigenous Cuyonon religion as sacred and continued to perform Cuyonon rituals. The supreme deity of the Cuyunon people was Diwata ng Kagubatan (literally goddess of the forest), who was honored in a celebrated feast, periodically held atop of Mount Caimamis in Cuyo Island. When most of the natives were converted to Christianity during the Spanish Era, about 2/3 of the converted Cuyunon were still celebrating her feast, angering the Spanish imperialists. The situation led the Spanish authorities to intensify their evangelization and governance efforts, which included the forced Roman Catholic conversion of the Cuyonon people, burning of houses of non-Catholic Cuyonons, and massive slavery. Later, the Spanish called Diwata ng Kagubatan as Virgen Del Monte, in another bid to rebrand the deity as 'Catholic'. In 1636, a powerful fleet under the Muslim Datu Tagul raided Cuyo and other places in Palawan. In Cuyo, the Muslims attacked the church and clergy house. They set the town on fire and took with them prisoners including a priest, Fr. Francisco de Jes√∫s Mar√≠a. They then sailed to Agutaya and Culion, where they pillaged and attacked defenceless civilians. The raiders abducted another priest from Culion, Fr. Alonzo de San Agust√≠n, as he was saying Mass. A Spanish naval flotilla of six vessels and 250 men under Captain Nicolas Gonz√°les met the returning pirates with their loot and booty on December 21, 1636. Datu Tagul was killed, 300 of his men captured, and 120 prisoners were freed. The two captured priests were killed. In 1957, the following sitios were converted to barrios: Emilod and Balading. Geography Cuyo Archipelago, with elevations (in feet). Cuyo Island is the largest island of the Cuyo Archipelago, about long, wide, and with an area of . Mount Bonbon with an elevation of is the highest mountain in Cuyo island. The Island is under the jurisdiction of the municipalities of Cuyo and Magsaysay. The poblacion of Cuyo is home to a Spanish fort, which shelters a church and a convent in its high stone walls.. =Barangays= Cuyo is politically subdivided into 17 barangays. In 1956, sitio Danawan was elevated into a barrio. =Climate= Demographics In the , the population of Cuyo, Palawan, was people, with a density of . Cuyo Fort During the early Spanish period, purposely to protect the Cuyonon from sporadic Moro attacks, Fort Cuyo was constructed and finished in 1680. The original complex of stone and mortar was a square with four bastions. The present complex, which occupies , is a solid rectangular edifice with walls high and thick. It has a tall belfry and watchtowers; its cannons, which face the sea, are now fired only during town celebrations. It is considered as one of the most ancient and unique forts in the Philippines. Unique in the sense that you can find the church, the convent and the Perpetual Adoration chapel all within the fort. In 1762 one of the British ships that invaded Manila fired at the Cuyo fort but it was not damaged at all. Another fort was started at Lucbuan seven kilometres away on the east side of Cuyo island, but it was never finished. In 1873, the capital of Paragua (present day Palawan) was transferred to Cuyo from Taytay. Culture Despite its long history Cuyo has held back the hands of time and preserved its rich cultural heritage preserved since more than 350 years. The tipano band, a flute and drum ensemble, and the de kwerdas (string band), supply background music on important social occasions. They also accompany singers and render dance music like the pinundo-pundo. The tipano is reserved for the ati-ati, sinulog, and komedya. Both ensembles use available instruments and instrumentalists. The tipano core is basically two drums and four to seven transverse mouth flutes with six finger-holes. One or two tipano \\"nga maite\\" (small flutes) and three or four tipano \\"nga mabael\\" (larger flutes) are played with a redublante (snare drum), bombo (big drum), and sometimes a pair of platilyo. The de kwerdas has two or three sabel, and occasionally a guitar, a bajo (six-stringed bass), a banjo, and a banduria. In Cuyunon music the \\"akompanimento\\" refers to the harmonic accompaniment- principal or \\"primera\\" to the first or highest voice, and \\"segunda\\" to the second. The Cuyonon youth celebrate love with song during the post-harvest courting season. The Cancion, a popular serenade, is sung with the strumming of a five - or six-stringed guitar in the distinctive punctual manner. Parting is a familiar concern in Cuyunon love songs. Examples of love songs are \\"Napopongao Ako\\", \\"Ang Gegma\\", \\"Ploning\\", \\"Daragang Taga Cuyo\\", \\"Konsomision\\", \\"Ako Maski Bayan\\", \\"Tiis Manong Pido\\", \\"Nagpamasiar Ako\\", and \\"Komosta\\". Cuyonon dances have evolved from native and Spanish influences. Among these are the Pastores (the Christmas dance of the sheppherds), the Chotis (from the German schothische), Lanceros de Cuyo (local French guadrille), Birginia (Virginia reel or square dance), Paraguanen (a romantic comic duet), and La Jota Paragua (a Castillan-type jota using bamboo castanets and manton). The island is known for the Mazurka de Cuyo, a social dance with characteristic mazurka steps. Another popular dance is the Pinundo-pundo, a stylish wedding dance marked by sudden pauses, its first two parts, featuring solo dances of the boy and the girl, are followed by the suring, a love play between the couple. The Cuyonon have developed the art of merging song, dance, and drama. Cuyo's Sayaw is a colorful enactment of a story heightened by the music of a string band. It is presented by five pairs of youth arranged in two lines, fully costumed and made up, and bearing props like flowers, crowns, and even knives. After an introductory dance, the leading couple proceed to relate the tale, sometimes using verse. The topic may be anything, from everyday occurrences to special events like winning the sweepstakes. This story is then interpreted in dance and ended with a finale. Yearly on August 28, Cuyo Island celebrates San Agustin's feast. On the eve of the fiesta, a cultural presentation featuring the traditional performing arts and sometimes a separate show of modern songs and dances may be presented. The feast day is begun with a morning mass (sometimes a High Mass officiated by the bishop ) and followed by the Ati-ati, a legacy of the Aklanon. Folk from the nearby islands board barotos (boats) to view the parade which recreates the confrontation of San Agustin and the native \\"savages\\". Participants portray the Aeta by darkening their bodies with soot and painting their faces with anyel (indigo). They don foot-high headgear of coconut ginit fiber adorned with chicken feathers, and decorate their costumes with coconut leaves. The men, clad in loin cloths, carry spears, bows and arrows, or bolo. The women, wearing patadyong and beaded necklaces, carry baskets with a tumpline The participants form two lines, one of men and the other of women. The director signals the start of the singing by striking his cane on the ground. This is followed by a spontaneous dance characterized by sways, hops, jumps, and the jerking of weapons accompanied by chanting; the director also signals the end of the dance. The teniente (barrio head) and his family may recite a series of verses. The director is then approached by the last to recite, customarily the teniente's youngest child. As the floats of San Agustin and other saints enter the church at the end of the procession, the participants kneel, prostrate themselves, or sing while performing skipping steps before the images. The merrymaking intensifies when the alakayo, a dancing clown, chases the ladies, stopping only when coins are thrown to him on the ground. The alakayo collects the coins with his mouth. Meanwhile, the panapatan performance are staged in front of various houses for a fee. These are mostly excerpts of the komedya and ati-ati known as komedya sa kalye and ati-ati sa bukid, the performers of which use simpler clothing than in the more elaborate full-length performances. Ati-ati sa bukid is sung and danced to celebrate a fruitful harvest. Today it is usually danced by young boys wearing masks or indigo- painted faces. Another pantomime, innocentes, recreates the descent of the \\"savages\\" from the hills to pay tribute to San Agustin. They are wearing coconut fibre masks and red striped shirts. The participants frolic and fence with sticks. Komedya or moro-moro performances are larger (with some 50 actors) and more refined than the ati-ati. The clash between the Mustlims and the Christians is further dramatized by background music; commonly used tunes are the pasadoble, marchas, giyera, and kasal. The same subject is portrayed by the sinulog. The Christians are identified by their black costumes, kampilan, and elongated shields; the Muslims by their red turbans and waistbands, and round shields. The participants may wear masks or paint their faces. Both groups, usually of six dancers each, sometimes perform to the beating of tin cans. Alternate steps of offense and defense, e.g., advancing and retreating, with corresponding movements of weapons, are followed by circular formations simulating scenes of strategy plotting. Aguado Pilgrimage Mt. Aguado features life-size Stations of the Cross constructed from the foot to the peak of the mountain. Cuyonon devotees, visitors and tourists make the annual pilgrimage to Mt. Aguado as part of the penitential rites done in Cuyo during the Holy Week particularly on Holy Thursday.

Painter unknown.Eug√®ne Rimmel Advertising (1851) for Rimmel's \\"toilet vinegar\\". Eug√®ne Rimmel (1820‚Äì1887) was a French-born British perfumer and businessman, responsible for manufacturing and marketing some of the earliest commercially made cosmetics. Early life and career Born in France, Rimmel moved with his family to London when his father accepted an invitation to manage a perfumery on Bond Street.Infomat Rimmel was apprenticed to his father. In 1834 he opened his own perfumery, the House of Rimmel. In the same year father and son produced their first cosmetic products. By the age of 24, Eug√®ne Rimmel had become an immensely talented perfumer and cosmetics innovator. Considered by many beauty historians as a trail-blazer of the beauty and healthcare industries, Rimmel contributed greatly to the concept of hygiene and bathing. He was also among the first to develop scented pomades, mouth rinses and his signature \\"Toilet Vinegar\\". His most innovative invention may well be the first commercial non-toxic mascara, which became so popular that \\"rimmel\\" is to this day the word for \\"mascara\\" in several languages including French, Italian, Portuguese, Persian, Romanian, Spanish, Turkish and Arabic. Rimmel was also considered an exceptional marketer and produced detailed mail order catalogues and advertising programmes with English theatres.All Business In 1865 he published The Book of Perfume, which appeared in 1870 in a French translation (Le Livre des Parfums) with a preface by Alphonse Karr.Bodleian Library online catalogue Later life Rimmel was so successful that he was granted ten Royal Warrants from heads of state all over Europe, including Queen Victoria, for his perfumes and fragranced products. With the headline \\"The Prince of Perfumers\\", The New York Times printed Rimmel's obituary on 15 March 1887. It stated that he was one of the founders of the French Hospital and Dispensary in London, and a constant advocate of its claims to the support of the public. Rimmel married a woman from Seurre, eastern France, Elisabeth ('Betsy') Letroublon with whom he had three children, Jules, Henry and Herminie. The sons assumed control of the beauty company at Rimmel's death in 1887, though they delegated the management of the company, which passed out of Rimmel family hands. After many difficulties Rimmel's cosmetics brand is now owned by Coty Inc.

History  The group was founded in April 1979 as a public service project of the Phillips Brooks House Association at Harvard College in Cambridge, Massachusetts, performing for the university community and local charitable organizations. Their repertoire was derived in part from the Dunster Dunces, an earlier Harvard a cappella group that was active from 1946 until 1968. Their first public concert was at Yale University in November 1979, amidst the pageantry of the Harvard-Yale football game. The group performed in their first film in 1982, entitled First Affair and starring Melissa Sue Anderson and Loretta Swit. They also appeared in the movie Mona Lisa Smile, a 2003 film starring Julia Roberts that was set at Wellesley College. The Harvard Din & Tonics celebrated their fortieth anniversary with a concert at Harvard's Sanders Theater on April 13, 2019. Previously an all-male ensemble, the group admitted its first woman member in 2018, and a second in 2019.  Origin of the Name  The name Din & Tonics is a pun on the popular drink the gin and tonic, and the words din, meaning a loud noise, and tonic, a musical term meaning the first note of a musical scale. The lime green socks worn by the group's members are said to represent the lime that is traditionally served with the gin and tonic, hence the group's slogan, \\"A cappella with a twist.\\"  Repertoire and Performance  The Dins, composed of 12 to 15 undergraduate students, is an entirely self-directed group. Most of their arrangements are written by current or former members of the group. Their repertoire consists primarily of jazz standards from the Great American Songbook, as well as humor songs drawn from various periods and styles. Their repertoire also extends at times to numerous other genres, including folk, rock, calypso, spiritual, and pop. They regularly perform in white tie, tails, and their signature lime green socks. The Din and Tonics began performing their own arrangement of \\"Sh-Boom\\" (generally regarded as the first popular doo-wop song after it became a #1 hit on the Billboard charts in 1954) in 1979. It has served as the Dins' signature song, and they have performed it at almost every concert since. \\"Sh-Boom\\" is featured on fourteen of the group's fifteen albums. The Dins have appeared on television shows, including The Price Is Right and Good Morning America, and have performed the \\"Star Spangled Banner\\" for the San Francisco Giants, the Tampa Bay Lightning, the Los Angeles Lakers, the PGA‚Äôs Ryder Cup, the Boston Red Sox and the New York Yankees, the Boston Celtics, the Boston Bruins, and the Boston Breakers.  Traveling and Tours  The Dins have performed overseas since the founding of the group, and began touring Asia regularly in the late 1980s. Since 1990, the Dins have gone on world tours biennially. Each tour is between 2 and 3 months long and includes performances in roughly 15 countries in Europe, Africa, Asia, Australia and North America. Additionally, they travel regularly to Vail, Colorado, Washington, D.C., New York City and spend spring break performing in Bermuda or Whistler, BC. The Dins have toured in: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, China, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Egypt, Fiji, France, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Malaysia, Mexico, Morocco, Nepal, Serbia, Singapore, Slovenia, South Korea, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, the United Kingdom, and the Vatican City. While on tour in 2010, the Dins performed at the closing ceremonies for the Shanghai Expo music festival. In January 2017 the Dins performed the National Anthem for the Los Angeles Lakers at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, following a performance with the Harvard Krokodiloes for the Harvard Club of Southern California.  Notable Collaborations and Performances  The Dins have performed for jazz vocalists Ella Fitzgerald and Bobby McFerrin, for members of the New York Voices, singer Lionel Richie, jazz pianist Herbie Hancock, jazz trumpeter Wynton Marsalis, former governor and professional wrestler Jesse Ventura, actresses Julia Roberts, Kristin Chenoweth, Sharon Stone, Jessica Lange, Kathie Lee Gifford, and Kathleen Turner, television host Conan O'Brien, actor Andy Garcia, comedian Jackie Mason, Maestro Keith Lockhart of the Boston Pops, cellist Yo- Yo Ma, Caroline Kennedy, former U.S. President Bill Clinton, as well as the Governor of Bermuda and the U.S. ambassadors to Australia, Germany, Greece, Nepal, Ireland, Morocco, Norway, Italy and Belgium. During their world tour, the Dins have recently performed with the award-winning German vocal quintet Vocaldente and Icelandic vocalist Andrea Gylfad√≥ttir. More recently, the Dins performed for John Williams and the assembled graduates at Harvard's 366th Commencement, to celebrate his distinguished career. The group performed an original medley of his most notable songs, ranging from Jaws to Star Wars and Indiana Jones. They have appeared in the films \\"Mona Lisa Smile\\" and \\"First Affair.

It runs a distance of 38 km between Lilydale and Warburton, along the former Warburton railway line. A section between Corduroy Road in Yarra Junction and Warburton is also known as the Centenary Trail.Melbourne and Geelong's shared paths in Google MapsMelbourne and Geelong's shared paths in Google Earth The trail begins at Lilydale and passes through the townships of Mount Evelyn, Wandin, Seville, Woori Yallock, Launching Place, Yarra Junction, Wesburn and Millgrove, ending at Warburton.  History  Since the closure of the Warburton railway line in July 1965 and the dismantling of the track in the 1970s the land had remained vacant. In 1984 and again in 1996 the state government investigated selling off the land, but withdrew these proposals in part due to community opposition. Since its establishment in 1996 the trail has been continually developed and maintained by a combination of local volunteers, particularly the Friends of the Lilydale to Warburton Rail Trail, as well the Local Council and State and Federal governments. Over several years a significant amount of effort went into clearing the land, restoring 13 bridges and surfacing of the trail. Negotiations were undertaken with neighbouring farmers who had previously occupied the reserve to erect fencing and gates where necessary. By 1998 the trail was continuous from Maroondah Highway, Lilydale to the site of the former Warburton station, with only a relatively short section between Lilydale Station and Maroondah Highway remaining incomplete. The remaining section of the trail, a bridge across the Maroondah Highway, was completed in early 2011. The next stage of improvements to the trail is a crossing at York Road in Mount Evelyn, which should be completed mid-2011.  Deviation  Although the trail is continuous from Lilydale to Warburton, it does not completely adhere to the former Warburton rail line's alignment. Some from Lilydale station, just before a historic bridge where the original alignment of Anderson Street passed over the railway, the trail deviates around the north, east and south of Mount Lilydale Mercy College. The school currently leases the land formerly occupied by the railway, which connects the old school grounds south-west of the line with an extension on the north-east. The southern end of the deviation rises to meet the original alignment of the trail at a steep grade that makes it unsuitable for wheelchairs. Map of the rail trail.

The first to arrive were the Dandal brothers (Anastacio, Ricardo, and Lauro), Alberto Radam, and Marcelino Gadiano with their families. After sometime their relatives followed forming a small community which gave rise to the election of Anastascio Dandal as the first Barrio Lieutenant. The small ethnic group of Agutaynon and Cuyunon increased in number and with the increase disputes emerged particularly in the choice of the Town‚Äôs Patron Saint. The Cuyunon wanted Saint Vincent Ferrer while the choice of Agutaynon was Saint Isidro Labrador. The group decided to resolve the issue by drawing a lot. The name of Saint Vincent Ferrer was drawn thus the name Malagnang was changed to San Vicente. The municipality of San Vicente was created on June 21, 1969, by virtue of Republic Act 5821. It officially functioned as distinct municipality on January 2, 1972.

San Vicente can offer a diverse range of attractions for adventure and nature enthusiasts. Roads and other infrastructure support facilities are now on its implementation process through the help of the National Government. As San Vicente Palawan slowly emerges to become one of the tourism hot spot in the Philippines, the real industry sector becomes dramatically stronger. Many land owners who have more than tens of thousand hectare properties have earned millions of pesos on selling their lots to investors. Beach front properties sell like pancakes in the real estate market. Many millionaires have ventured into land banking in San Vicente Palawan with its robust potential, earning exponentially from re- selling their acquired properties. Historically, rice field properties were sold at P300,000 per hectare in 2014. Three years later, an hectare big usually costs P3,000,000, with another increase after the San Vicente Airport started servicing small commercial planes. =Flagship Tourism Enterprise Zone (Flagship TEZ)= The introduction of the San Vicente Flagship TEZ was initiated with the marking of a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) between the TIEZA and the nearby government unit (LGU) of San Vicente in 2013 ‚Äì a fearless advance of the neighborhood organization to uphold association and set the course into tourism improvement. To meet the vision proclamation as the Flagship TEZ and to be a model goal, a Tourism Master Plan was defined to coordinate, control and accomplish adjusted formative pushes and methodologies of the LGU towards an independent, socially capable and naturally stable group. The Tourism Master Plan expects to advance and encourage feasible and reasonable improvement in the region. In light of the Integrated Tourism Master Plan for the Long Beach range, the Flagship TEZ should be zoned by its attributes and into topics to create tourism items, for example, however not restricted to sun and shoreline, relaxation and stimulation, recreational and sports tourism, eco-tourism and agri-tourism.

According to the , it has a population of people. Since 2002, its Cathedral of St. Joseph the Worker is the episcopal see of the pre-diocesan missionary Apostolic Vicariate of Taytay.  History  Before the Spanish colonization, The Kingdom of Taytay was ruled by a monarch noted as followed everywhere at any given time by ten scribes. The crew of Ferdinand Magellan held the Taytay king and queen for ransom after escaping the Battle of Mactan where Magellan was slain. They intended to secure more supplies as they plan to cross into the Moluccas where the Portuguese were so help could be sought. The native king and his subjects complied with the demands and even added more food supplies than what they asked for. This was duly recorded by Antonio Pigafetta, Magellan's chronicler, who was on board in one of the ships when these events took place. Pigafetta also took note of one curious thing in the kingdom. He found the natives fond of cockfighting, long before this pastime was seen or even heard of in the Western Hemisphere. During the Spanish colonization of the Philippines, Taytay was formally founded in 1623. Taytay became the capital of the province of Calamianes, the entire territory of Paragua (now Palawan), in 1818; and the province of Castilla, a land area occupying the northern part of Palawan, in 1858.Palawan Tourism Council: History of Palawan. Accessed August 27, 2008. Archived baptismal records of Cuyo, Palawan show that the last monarch of the Kingdom of Taytay was converted to Christianity and christened Flores de los Santos Cabaylo meaning Cabaylo, Flower of the Saints. No other sovereign royal datu after him ruled in his kingdom. King Cabaylo's descendants include the present clans of Cabaylo-Manlavi-Gabinete-Macolor as main genealogical roots. His Royal Highness Datu Dr. Fernando Macolor Cruz who hailed from the Cabailo- Manlavi-Gabinete-Macolor line of the royal house is the present pretender and sole claimant to the most serene and ancient throne of the Kingdom of Taytay. During the American era, Taytay ceased being Palawan's capital, and its administrative boundary was reduced by approximately 500,000 hectares upon the creation of the Municipality of El Nido in 1916.El Nido Tourism Office. Accessed August 28, 2008. The historic Taytay Fort, the Fuerza de Santa Isabel, built in 1667 under the Augustinian Recollect Fathers and named in honor of Spain's Queen Isabela II in the 19th century, was used as a military station during that period. This famous relic was completed in 1738. It was mainly used to defend against Muslim warrior-raiders in their colorful war boats while the Spanish soldiers fire at them with their huge cannons. The fort's small chapel and cannons are still intact.Official Website of the Province of Palawan . Accessed August 28, 2008. The fort is now under the supervision of the National Museum. The Moro action must be understood not as an act of piracy but as a showdown of power and challenge to Spanish hegemony over the islands. It can be viewed as the Tausug's efforts to recover what was once theirs. Similar raids were also carried out against Christian converts in Spanish Cuyo, Dumaran, Linapacan and Culion. In 1957, the Island of Dibangan was constituted into a barrio.

Her body of work includes film, fiction, monologue, digital media presentations, and live performance art. She wrote, directed and starred in the films Me and You and Everyone We Know (2005) and The Future (2011). She has authored a book of short stories, No One Belongs Here More Than You (2007); a collection of nonfiction short stories, It Chooses You (2011); and the novel The First Bad Man (2015).  Early life  July was born in Barre, Vermont, in 1974, the daughter of Lindy Hough and Richard Grossinger. Her parents are both writers who taught at Goddard College at the time. They were also the founders of North Atlantic Books, a publisher of alternative health, martial arts, and spiritual titles. Her father was Jewish, and her mother was Protestant. July was encouraged to work on her short fiction by author and friend of a friend Rick Moody. She was raised in Berkeley, California, where she first began staging plays at 924 Gilman Street, a local punk rock club. She attended The College Preparatory School in Oakland for high school. When she was 16, she wrote and directed The Lifers, a play for which she cast 20 Latina women. She describes this as an experience that pushed her heavily. She later attended University of California Santa Cruz, but she stopped attending in her second year. Career beginnings She relocated to Portland, Oregon, and took up performance art, or \\"one woman shows\\". Her performances were successful; she has been quoted as saying she has not worked a day job since she was 23 years old. In an interview for the Tate, she explains that she still tries to practice performance, partially due to its stark differences from film making, such as its live audience or how \\"present\\" it is in comparison. Portland is also where she began participating in the riot grrrl scene that was beginning to grow in the early 1990s. In the early stages of her film career, she created several small video projects and performances years prior to her feature film, Me and You and Everyone We Know. However, while she worked on her art, July had to work several odd jobs to survive, such as being a waitress, a tastemaker for Coca-Cola, a locksmith, and a stripper. Filmmaking =Joanie4Jackie= July reading at Modern Times Bookstore in San Francisco July was immersed in the riot grrl scene in Portland and motivated by its DIY ethos, and she began an effort that she described as \\"a free alternative distribution system for women movie-makers\\". One of July's reasons for starting the project was to apply the concepts of Riot grrrl into the film making world. The idea was to connect as many women artists as possible, let them see each other's work, and foster a sense of community. Participants sent a self-made short film to July, who mailed back a compilation videotape containing that film and nine others ‚Äì a \\"chainletter tape\\". When it began in 1995, the project was called Big Miss Moviola but was soon renamed Joanie4Jackie. July also credits the project to the loneliness she was experiencing at the time, but felt she learned from the project immensely, saying \\"that was my film school\\". July's first film, Atlanta, appears on the second tape of the series. July continued to run the project for years, handing it off to the film department of Bard College in 2003.Columpar & Mayer, pp.24‚Äì25. In Spring 2016, July donated an archive of Joanie4Jackie to the Getty Research Institute. The collection includes more than 200 titles from the 1990s and 2000s, videos from Joanie4Jackie events, booklets, posters, hand-written letters from participants, and other documentation. Thomas W. Gaehtgens, the director of the Getty Research Institute, stated that the acquisition is \\"an esteemed addition to our Special Collections that connects to work by many important 20th century artists who are also represented in our archives, such as Eleanor Antin, Yvonne Rainer and Carolee Schneemann.\\" =Me and You and Everyone We Know= Filmmaker rated her number one in their \\"25 New Faces of Indie Film\\" in 2004. After winning a slot in a Sundance workshop, she developed her first feature-length film, Me and You and Everyone We Know, which opened in 2005. The film won The Cam√©ra d'Or prize in The Cannes Festival 2005 as well as the Special Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival, Best First Feature at the Philadelphia Film Festival, Feature Audience Award for Best Narrative Feature at the San Francisco International Film Festival, and the Audience Award for Best Narrative Feature at the Los Angeles Film Festival. =The Future= On May 16, 2007, July mentioned that she was currently working on a new film. This film was originally titled \\"Satisfaction\\" but was later renamed The Future, with July in a lead role.Finding 'Satisfaction' Variety, May 15, 2008. The film premiered at the 2011 Sundance Film Festival. =Kajillionaire= In March 2018, it was announced July would write and direct a heist film, with Brad Pitt and Youree Henley producing the film, under their Plan B Entertainment and Annapurna Pictures banners, respectively. That same month, Evan Rachel Wood, Richard Jenkins, Debra Winger and Gina Rodriguez joined the cast of the film. In June 2018, Mark Ivanir joined the cast of the film. Principal photography began in May 2018. Its theatrical release was on September 25, 2020. =Other film work= Her short video The Amateurist (1998) features a dowdy researcher examining, via her own video monitor, a stereotypical \\"beautiful woman\\"; July plays both roles. A lengthier video, the 27-minute Nest of Tens (2000), juxtaposes four unrelated scenarios in which \\"seemingly everyday people go about acting completely normal while demonstrating distinct abnormality\\". Nest of Tens has been placed in the permanent online collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Wayne Wang consulted with July about aspects of his 2001 feature-length film The Center of the World, for which she received a story credit. July appears as herself in the 2017 documentary Turn It Around: The Story of East Bay Punk. She was interviewed for the film !Women Art Revolution. Music and spoken word She recorded her first EP for Kill Rock Stars in 1996, titled Margie Ruskie Stops Time, with music by The Need. She released two full-length LPs, 10 Million Hours A Mile in 1997 and The Binet-Simon Test in 1998, both on Kill Rock Stars. She collaborated with Calvin Johnson in his musical project Dub Narcotic Sound System, and in 1999 she made a split EP with IQU, released on Johnson's K Records. Acting At the San Francisco Cinematheque fundraiser at Theater Artaud, 2006 July has acted in many of her own short films, including Atlanta, The Amateurist, Nest of Tens, Are You The Favorite Person of Anyone?, and her feature-length films Me and You and Everyone We Know and The Future. She also made an appearance in the film Jesus' Son (1998). She appeared in an episode of Portlandia in 2012. She co-starred in Josephine Decker‚Äôs 2018 feature film, Madeline's Madeline. Live performance pieces In 1998, July made Love Diamond, her first full- length multimedia performance piece ‚Äì in her description, a \\"live movie.\\" This two-hour stage work had July playing multiple characters, humorously depicting women's perceived cultural roles. This was followed by a second full-length performance piece, The Swan Tool, and a six-minute film, Getting Stronger Every Day (2001). The latter is an abstract view of a grown man and a little girl, seemingly taunted by indistinct floating shapes while an offscreen narrator recounts a tale of real-life pedophilia. The Swan Tool is another \\"live movie\\", a one-woman show in which July plays Lisa Cobb, a woman searching for her lost body. Although it's peppered with deadpan comedy, the surrealist story concerns \\"childhood sexual traumas, adult alienation, and persistent, unfocused guilt\\". In 2006, after completing her first feature film, she went on to create another multimedia piece, Things We Don't Understand and Definitely Are Not Going To Talk About, which she performed in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and New York. This stage show contained several ideas that would become key elements of her later film, The Future. In March 2015, July premiered her performance work New Society as part of the 58th San Francisco International Film Festival. In the program for the performance, July requested the audience not share details of the show, stating it is now \\"a rare sensation to sit down in a theater with no idea what will happen.\\" Various art projects With artist Harrell Fletcher, July founded the online arts project called Learning to Love You More (2002‚Äì2009). The project's website offered assignments to artists whose submissions became part of \\"an ever-changing series of exhibitions, screenings and radio broadcasts presented all over the world\\". Over 8,000 people participated in the project. In addition to its Internet presentations, Learning to Love You More also compiled exhibitions for the Whitney Museum, the Seattle Art Museum, and other hosts. A book version of the project's online art was released in 2007. Starting May 1, 2009 the project's website stopped accepting assignment submissions. In 2010 the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art acquired the website, to preserve it as an archive of the project online. July constructed a sculptural exhibition, Eleven Heavy Things, for the 2009 Venice Biennale. Its assortment of cartoonish shapes, made sturdy with fiberglass and steel, were designed for playful interaction by visitors. The exhibition was also shown in New York City at Union Square Park and in Los Angeles at the MOCA Pacific Design Center. In 2013 she organized We Think Alone, an art project involving the private emails of public figures. Unredacted except for the recipients' names, the emails were freely donated by a disparate group of notable persons including author Sheila Heti, theoretical physicist Lee Smolin, basketball player Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, and actress Kirsten Dunst. July grouped selected emails by topic, and sent a new set to the project's subscribers every week for 20 weeks. As one reviewer described them, the emails are \\"simultaneously mundane and eerily revealing; they shed light on how people in the public eye craft their private identities... [they] also underscore, in some way, the way all of us present ourselves over email: excessively formal or passive-aggressive, lovey-dovey, flakey, overly excited.\\" In 2014 she created an iOS app, Somebody, which allows users to compose a message to be delivered to someone else in-person, or to deliver someone else's message in-person. When you send your friend a message through Somebody, it goes ‚Äì not to your friend ‚Äì but to the Somebody user nearest your friend. This person (likely a stranger) delivers the message verbally, acting as your stand-in. Somebody is a far-reaching public art project that incites performance and twists our love of avatars and outsourcing ‚Äì every relationship becomes a three-way. The project was funded by Miu Miu. The app closed on October 31, 2015. Writing As much as a filmmaker, July is also an author, mostly of short stories. Writing was something she did years before her first feature premiered. July in a 2016 interview explains that out of all the mediums she pursues, she is the least confident in her film making, partially because of the less familiar and hyper hierarchical and collaborative environment. She knows most people on her sets have never taken orders from a femme film director, and so she explains that there is an air of confidence you need to be that role. Her short story The Boy from Lam Kien was published in 2005 by Cloverfield Press, as a special-edition book with illustration by Elinor Nissley and Emma Hedditch. Another short story, Something That Needs Nothing, was published in the following year by The New Yorker. =No One Belongs Here More Than You= No One Belongs Here More Than You, July's collection of short vignettes, was published by Scribner in 2007. It won the Frank O'Connor International Short Story Award on September 24, 2007. In The New York Times, Sheelah Kolhatkar gave the collection a mixed review: \\"A handful of these stories are sweet and revealing, although in many cases the attempt to create 'art' is too self-conscious, and the effort comes off as pointlessly strange.\\" As of 2015 the collection has more than 200,000 copies in circulation. =It Chooses You= July's non-fiction story collection It Chooses You was published by McSweeney's in 2011. While procrastinating the writing of her screenplay The Future in 2009, July crisscrossed Los Angeles accompanied by photographer Brigitte Sireto to meet a random selection of PennySaver sellers, glimpsing thirteen surprisingly moving and profoundly specific realities, along the way shaping her film, and herself, in unexpected ways. The work received mixed reviews with fans citing the collection's \\"lasting impression\\" of realistic struggle and critics citing the mumblecore-influenced artist's writing style as a \\"cheap trick\\" in text- format. =The First Bad Man= July's first novel The First Bad Man was published by Scribner in January 2015. The narrative centers around Cheryl Glickman, a middle-aged woman in crisis whose life abruptly changes course when a young woman, named Clee, moves into her home. The novel explores the complex relationship between Cheryl and Clee. In her review for The New York Times Book Review, reviewer Lauren Groff writes The First Bad Man \\"makes for a wry, smart companion on any day. It's warm. It has a heartbeat and a pulse. This is a book that is painfully alive.\\"  Styles and themes  July was heavily inspired by the riot grrrl movement. She was friends with several of the bands who were part of the movement such as Bikini Kill, Excuse 17, and Heavens to Betsy. Her films have a common theme of \\"intimacy.\\" For example, many of her work's titles use pronouns (\\"me,\\" \\"you,\\" \\"we,\\" etc.). July creates \\"slice of life\\" films using ordinary characters and giving them attention within her films. She describes this as her being, \\"desperate to bring people together.\\" However, as she's aged she's become more interested in how people sabotage coming together. July receives criticism for being too \\"niche\\" or trying too hard to seem \\"quirky.\\" According to The New York Times, \\"July has come to personify everything infuriating about the Etsy-shopping, Wes Anderson-quoting, McSweeney's-reading, coastal-living category of upscale urban bohemia that flourished in the aughts.\\" She often gets lumped in with directors like Wes Anderson and Noah Baumbach, but says she gets more push back than them due to her films being so emotional and feminine, being called \\"precious\\" and \\"twee.\\" In this same interview with The New York Times, July explains that she likes the directors she's been compared to, but they never get criticized for making films about themselves, though she as a femme filmmaker often gets labelled as \\"self-obsessed.\\" In a 2015 Guardian article, July adds, \\"Yes, it's pretty clear that ‚Äòwhimsical‚Äô is a diminishing word, [...] I almost think asking the question is like I'm being asked to gossip about myself. I think it's kind of a female thing, being asked to gossip about yourself. I think I'm maybe done with that.\\" July also often includes the theme of sex in her film making. The New York Times describes this theme \\"as both a sudden surprise and a way to illuminate the inner lives of her characters\\". July elaborates: ‚ÄúI was always interested in sex, even as a kid. Sex includes shame and humiliation and fantasies and longing. It‚Äôs so dense with the kinds of things I‚Äôm interested in.‚Äù She has also expressed her interest for rhythm and feeling within film than being necessarily ‚Äúinspired‚Äù by other filmmakers, she states that she wouldn't call herself a ‚Äúcinephile.‚Äù In between Me and You and Everyone We Know and The Future, July began to incorporate some of the oddball avant-garde things she had done in theater performance into her films, some of which was easier to swallow on stage but not on screen, such as the talking cat in The Future, which she was later criticized for by viewers. July also has a strong interest in clothing and costume. She served as the lookbook creative director for Uniqlo UT's 2019 clothing line. Personal life July is married to artist and film director Mike Mills, with whom she has a child, born in February 2012. July and Mills met at both of their first Sundance Festival premieres in 2006, and married in mid-2009. In a 2007 interview with Bust magazine, July spoke of the importance which feminism has had in her life, saying, \\"What's confusing about [being a feminist]? It's just being pro-your ability to do what you need to do. It doesn't mean you don't love your boyfriend or whatever... When I say 'feminist', I mean that in the most complex, interesting, exciting way!\\"Profile , Feministing.com. Retrieved April 5, 2017. In another interview she had on Idaho's Public Television station, she explains that once she started confronting the racial issues addressed in current day politics, she started contacting publishers and revising her work, realizing not everything she had said was racially and politically sound. She thought up the last name \\"July\\" when she was 15, inspired by a story she read in a zine, and then proceeded to change her name legally in her early 20s. July describes her family as very \\"DIY\\", which probably accounts for some of July's makeshift style. Therefore, when July wanted to change her last name, her father was very accepting of the decision. Her father was a workaholic, which is something she believes she picked up from him. Her family also dabbled in practicing New Age religions and discussed spirituality while she was growing up.

Along with phenelzine and tranylcypromine, it is one of only three classical MAOIs still available for clinical use in the treatment of psychiatric disorders in the United States, though it is not as commonly employed in comparison to the others. Isocarboxazid is primarily used to treat mood and anxiety disorders. It has also been investigated in the treatment of Parkinson's disease and other dementia-related disorders. Isocarboxazid, as well as other MAOIs, increase the levels of the monoamine neurotransmitters serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine in the brain.Volz, Hanz-Peter. (November 1998) ‚ÄúMonoamine Oxidase Inhibitors A Perspective on Their Use in The Elderly‚Äù Biochemical Pharmacology (5) 341-352. Classical MAOIs, including isocarboxazid, are used only rarely due to prominent food and drug interactions and have been largely superseded by newer antidepressants such as the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). The cause of the interactions is because MAOIs inhibit the metabolism of dietary amines (e.g., tyramine) and the monoamine neurotransmitters. In combination with other drugs that increase the levels of the monoamine neurotransmitters such as the SSRIs, or with certain foods high in dietary amines such as aged cheeses, MAOIs can produce dangerous elevations of monoamine neurotransmitters resulting in potentially life-threatening syndromes such as hypertensive crisis and serotonin syndrome.

Kyabram is located in the centre of a rich irrigation district in the Goulburn River Valley, north of Melbourne. It is the second-largest town in the Shire of Campaspe, situated between the towns of Echuca and Shepparton and is close to the Murray River, Goulburn River, Campaspe River and Waranga Basin. As of the 2016 census the town had a population of 7,331 people and provides services to a district population of around 16,000. The name of the town is thought to derive from an Aboriginal word Kiambram meaning \\"Thick Forest\\". History The Bangerang people were the original inhabitants of the Goulburn valley. The township started in the 1870s with the first sale of town blocks held in 1876. Kyabram Post Office opened on 23 September 1878. Sheridan Post Office opened on 1 December 1884. On 8 April 1886, in anticipation of the arrival of the railway at what was then Sheridan, Kyabram was renamed Kyabram East and Sheridan was renamed Kyabram. The Kyabram Mechanics' Institute was built in 1891. John Allan, who lived in Kyabram from 1873, became Premier of Victoria in 1924 and Australia's first Country Party premier. Allan was associated with the Kyabram Reform Movement, a conservative political organisation formed at the start of the 20th century and led by Benjamin Goddard, a local businessman. The movement's campaign played a significant role in the downfall of the Peacock state government in June 1902 and its sound defeat in the subsequent September elections. The incoming Irvine government substantially reduced the number of state parliamentarians, a key demand of the movement. Kyabram was formally proclaimed a town on 4 July 1973. The Kyabram Magistrates' Court closed on 1 January 1990. Economy The district is dependent on the primary industries of dairying and fruit orchards. Henry Jones IXL, a subsidiary of SPC Ardmona, operate a plant in the town, manufacturing IXL jams. The town provides engineering, financial advisors, solicitors and accounting services to the district. Nestl√© (Tongala), Southern Processing Ltd and Fonterra (Stanhope) all have food processing plants nearby. Medical and aged care services in the town include a 46-bed hospital, a 30-bed home for the aged, infant welfare centre, ambulance station, several doctors, dentists and other health practitioners. In education Kyabram has now combined three state schools (Kyabram Secondary College, Dawes Rd and Haslem St Primary Schools) to one P-12 school containing three campuses (Dawes, Haslem and Fisher). Kyabram also has a Catholic primary and secondary school (St Augustine's College), two kindergartens and the Kyabram Community & Learning Centre providing community services and adult learning opportunities for the people of Kyabram and the surrounding region. The local newspaper is called the Kyabram Free Press, a part of the McPherson media group in the region, with a circulation of roughly 3,300 copies (Victorian Country Press Association 2008). Surrounding smaller towns include Merrigum (pop. 490), Lancaster, Undera, Cooma, Wyuna, Kyvalley, Girgarre, Stanhope and Tongala. Attractions include the Kyabram Fauna Park, a reserve housing five hundred species of wildlife. There are free-roaming kangaroos and emus and hides to observe a variety of water birds.  Sport  Kyabram Airfield Popular sports in Kyabram include Australian rules football and cricket. Jim Higgs was a spin bowler from Kyabram who played for Australia during the late 1970s. The local football team is known as the Bombers who compete in the Goulburn Valley Football League. Kyabram has produced a number of AFL recruits such as GWS utility and former Richmond best-and-fairest Brett Deledio, former Melbourne & Victorian Captain Garry Lyon, Richmond's Kayne Pettifer, Brisbane's Patrick Wearden, Hawthorn's Cohen Myers, Carlton's Nick Holman, former North Melbourne rookie Brad Mangan, and Kyabrams first AFLW's player, Julia Crockett-Grills. Netball and soccer are also popular in Kyabram. Golfers play at the course of the Kyabram Valley View Golf and Bowls Club on Curr Road, Mount Scobie, or at the Kyabram Parkland Golf Club, the home of the Victorian Par 3 Amateur Championships, on Racecourse Rd,Kyabram. Newly appointed president Tim Nelson and his Secretary Billy Ryan welcome all new visitors with correct green fee receipts and golfing attire. Notable residents In 2016, former resident Kristen Hilton was appointed Victoria's Human Rights Commissioner, head of the Victorian Equal Opportunity and Human Rights Commission. Kyabram is referenced by Irish singer-songwriter Declan O'Rourke on his debut album Since Kyabram. O'Rourke picked up his first acoustic guitar while living in the town as a teenager.

Early life and career Born in Abingdon, Virginia, Oury and his family moved to Bowling Green, Missouri in 1836 where he pursued his academic studies, studied law, and was admitted to the bar in 1848. That year, he moved to San Antonio, Texas and in 1849 to Marysville, California where he engaged in mining. He then moved to Tucson, Arizona in 1856 and began a law practice and was appointed a district judge for New Mexico Territory in Mesilla. Oury was involved in the infamous Crabb Massacre of April 1857, during which no more than 100 Americans were killed after an eight-day battle with Mexican forces at Caborca, Sonora. The Americans were under the command of General Henry A. Crabb, a former California senator, who was allegedly trying to take over Sonora like the filibuster William Walker. Oury was one of the men General Crabb had recruited in Tucson, and he was given the rank of captain and ordered to follow the general into Mexico after recruiting more men. However, when news reached Tucson that a superior force of Mexicans was besieging Crabb's expedition, Major R. N. Wood and Captain Oury were sent across the international border to help their compatriots. Just after crossing the border, the rescue party encountered about 200 Mexicans. A skirmish ensued which forced the Americans back across the border into Arizona. There were no casualties on the Americans' side. Of the Crabb party, all were killed except a fourteen-year- old boy and possibly one other man depending on varying sources.United States Department of State, pg. 72http://www.sandiegohistory.org/findaid/ms161.htmlhttp://www.logoi.com/notes/apache- land/war-time-in-arizona.html Civil War At the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861, Oury was elected to the Provisional Confederate Congress representing the Arizona Territory. Around this time, hostile Apaches attacked the town of Tubac, located south of Tucson. Over the course of a few days the Apaches besieged to old Presidio until the settlers were rescued by Oury and a small band of Confederate militia from Tucson. Tubac was destroyed and abandoned but the settlers were saved due to Oury and his men. Oury later resigned his seat in the Confederate Congress to serve as a captain in Herbert's Battalion of Arizona cavalry in the Confederate Army. He also served as a colonel on the staff of General Henry Hopkins Sibley in Texas and Louisiana from 1862 to 1864. He took the oath of allegiance at Fort Mason in Arizona on October 8, 1865. Political career After the end of the war, Oury returned to his law practice in Tucson. He was elected to the 3rd Arizona Territorial Legislature in 1866, serving as Speaker of the House that year, and was appointed Arizona Territory Attorney General in 1869. He moved to Phoenix in 1871 and was appointed district attorney for Maricopa County serving from 1871 to 1873. That year his brother, William S. Oury, was involved in the Camp Grant Massacre in which over 140 Apache men, women, and children were killed.http://files.usgwarchives.net/az/statewide/bios/oury.txthttp://www.brown.edu/Research/Aravaipa/ Granville was elected in 1873 and 1875 to the 7th and 8th Arizona Territorial Legislature, serving as Speaker during the 1873 session. Grave of Granville Henderson Oury in Adamsville A.O.U.W. Cemetery Oury unsuccessfully ran as a Democrat for the United States House of Representatives in 1878 and was appointed district attorney for Pinal County in 1879. He was elected a Democrat to the United States House of Representatives in 1880, reelected in 1882, serving from 1881 to 1885, not running for reelection in 1884. He served as a delegate to the 1884 Democratic National Convention in Chicago, returned to Florence in 1885, and resumed practicing law. He once again served as district attorney for Pinal County in 1889 and 1890. He died of throat cancer in Tucson on January 11, 1891 and was interred in the Adamsville A.O.U.W. Cemetery in Florence.

A group of historic buildings, mostly private dwellings, centre on it. As the name suggests, it was originally a B√©guinage. Today it is also the site of two churches, the Catholic Houten Huys and the English Reformed Church.  Earliest times  The Begijnhof is the only inner court in Amsterdam which was founded during the Middle Ages, and therefore lies within the Singel ‚Äî the innermost canal of Amsterdam's circular canal system. The Begijnhof is at medieval street level, which means a meter below the rest of the old city center. It is unclear when exactly the Begijnhof (Beguines' court) was founded. In 1346, the beguines still lived in a house (a document of that time mentioned one beghynhuys). A courtyard was only first mentioned in 1389, probably after the religious status of the city rose due to the Amsterdam Eucharistic Miracle of 1345. Originally the Begijnhof was entirely encircled by water (the Nieuwezijds Voorburgwal, the Spui and the Begijnensloot or \\"Beguines' Ditch\\"), with the sole entrance located at the Begijnensteeg (\\"Beguines' Alley\\"), which had a bridge across the Begijnensloot. The back facades were therefore water-locked. The Spui entrance only dates back to the 19th century.  Characteristics  Begijnhof, 2015 The Begijnhof differs from the usual Amsterdam patricians' court in that this old people's home was not founded by private persons. It bore closer resemblance to a convent, although the beguines enjoyed greater freedom than nuns in a convent. While beguines took a vow of chastity, and while they considered themselves obliged to attend Holy Mass every day and pray various official prayers, they were free to leave the court at any time in order to get married. = Tall Amsterdam houses = The buildings in the court are tall, characteristically Amsterdam-style town-houses, emphasising the court's relatively private character. The Begijnhof is the only court whose houses have addresses bearing the name of the court itself. Unlike most courts, the houses here do not form rows joining one dwelling with another; instead, there are 47 regular town houses, each with its individual aspect, and most of them with facades from the 17th and 18th century. However, the buildings themselves are usually of earlier date, eighteen of them still possessing a Gothic wooden framework. = The Wooden House = The Wooden House The ancient, restored wooden house (Het Houten Huys, 34 Begijnhof) is famous as one of the two wooden houses still existing in the center of Amsterdam (the other one being Zeedijk 1); there are annexed villages like Nieuwendam (Amsterdam North) with many wooden houses and even a wooden church. This house dates from about 1528, and is the oldest wooden house in Amsterdam. The courtyard has two bleaching greens, one on each side of the chapel. = Gates = The old Begijnesloot gate, restored in 1907, dates from 1574 and has a gable stone depicting Saint Ursula, patron saint of the Amsterdam beguines. The Spui gate from about 1725 was replaced by the present gatehouse in the 19th century. The Begijnhof has a great number of gable stones, many of which show a strong Roman Catholic character.  Religious strife  After the Alteration (Protestant takeover) of 1578, when Amsterdam came under Calvinist rule, the Begijnhof was the only Roman Catholic institution to be allowed to remain in existence. This was because the houses were the beguines' private property. The Chapel, however, was closed and lay empty for around 30 years before being ceded to the English Presbyterians, and since that time has been alluded to as the \\"English Church\\". Several of the pulpit panels were designed by Piet Mondrian. = A clandestine church = In 1671, the architect Philip Vingboons converted two dwellings opposite the Chapel entrance into a schuilkerk, or conventicle church, for Catholics, the Church of the Saints John and Ursula, named after the patron saints of the Begijnhof. This church was kept secret, as was demanded by the city government, and could not be recognized as a church from the outside. In 1908 this became the Miracle Church, after the original Miracle Church had been deliberately destroyed by its Protestant owners. = Buried in the gutter = The most famous beguine in the Begijnhof's history is sister Cornelia Arens, who died on 14 October 1654. (Her date of birth is unknown, but she professed the vows of chastity and the Catholic faith on 6 July 1621.) Rather than be laid to rest in the Chapel, which she considered \\"desecrated\\" by Presbyterians, she chose to be buried in the gutter of the court. Legend has it that contrary to her wish, she was in fact buried in the Chapel, but her coffin was found in the adjoining gutter the following day. This happened two more times, until she was at last laid to rest in the gutter. Another version of the legend is that her soul found no peace and roamed the court at night until she was buried in the gutter. = The last beguine = \\"Sister Antonia\\", whose original name was Agatha Kaptein, was born on 13 April 1887 at Akersloot. The last beguine, she died on 23 May 1971 at the age of 84. She was buried in the Sisters' Grave in the St. Barbara's Roman Catholic Cemetery in Amsterdam on 26 May of the same year.  Renovation  Until its renovation in 1979, the court had 140 dwellings ‚Äî some 110 of them consisting of a single room, and about 25 comprising two. The occupants likewise numbered 140. The renovations enlarged the houses to two or three rooms. Since that time, the number of female inhabitants has been an unvaried 105.

The stadium is owned by Mohun Bagan ,who use the stadium as their training ground. The stadium has a capacity of 20,000 spectators at present. The club offices of Mohun Bagan are adjacent to the stadium. This stadium is mainly used by ATK Mohun Bagan for Calcutta Football League matches against smaller and local Kolkata sides. History Mohun Bagan Club gallery The first ground of the club was inside the famous marble palace, owned by Kirti Mitra of the Mitra family and known as Mohun Bagan Villa. It was situated in Fariapukur lane of north Kolkata. As a football ground however, this ground was not sufficiently large. It is believed that Mohun Bagan played the first match on this very ground against the students of Eden Hindu hostel. In 1891, with the help of the Maharaja of Shyampukur, Durga Charan Laha, the club ground was relocated to his ground in Shyampukur. That place is now known as Shyampukur Laha Colony. Later, with the help of Mr. Harry Lee, the chairman of Kolkata Municipal Corporation, the ground was again shifted to Shyam Square. The ground was shared with the Aryan F.C. and Bagbazar Club. In 1900, Mohun Bagan became the partner of Presidency College and shared the same ground in Kolkata maidan. Mohun Bagan continued to play here for 15 years. Then in 1915, Mohun Bagan got the ground of National AC. On this ground, Mohun Bagan played till 1963. In 1915, that ground was stretched east‚Äìwest. But afterwards, it became north‚Äìsouth stretched like the other club grounds in Kolkata. Presently, that ground is occupied by one of the oldest clubs of Kolkata, Aryan F.C., who shares the ground with East Bengal. About The stadium has galleries on three sides and a rampart on the fourth side. The north side gallery is the member's gallery and is the most modern gallery of the stadium, having bucket seats installed. The east side and south side galleries are mainly made of steel & concrete structure and are designated for non-member supporters. The playing pitch is about 100m x 60m in dimension. Just adjacent the stadium, the club tent and main office are located. The club tent consists of a beautiful lawn, with benches known as the Mohun Bagan lawn. In 1977 Mohun Bagan became the first club in maidan to have floodlights installed in their stadium. The floodlights operated till the mid-1990s, after which they became fully dysfunctional. The lights were later repaired and renovated and were inaugurated on 25 February 2016 with an IFA Shield match between Mohun Bagan U19s and DSK Liverpool academy. For the 2015 ISL season, Kolkata-based franchisee Atl√©tico de Kolkata used the ground as a training ground. From the 2016‚Äì17 season, Mohun Bagan has decided to pitch for hosting I-League matches at their home club ground, especially with modern facilities like bucket seats and properly functional floodlight towers. In July 2019, the interiors of the stadium were renovated for making the stadium well equipped to host I-League matches. The dressing room in particular was given a major upgrade. Matches The Mohun Bagan Ground hosted a lot of historic matches. It was witness to the 2‚Äì2 draw of Mohun Bagan against FC Ararat Yerevan in the 1978 IFA Shield final. The first ever match under floodlight in maidan was held in this ground when Mohun Bagan faced Pakhtakor Tashkent FK in an exhibition game on 10 February 1977. In the 1960s and 1970s majority of the matches in Kolkata football were held in the Mohun Bagan Ground. =I-League Matches= References Category:Sports venues in Kolkata Category:Football venues in West Bengal ","title":"Mohun Bagan Ground"},{"id":"2171851","text":"The white-headed marsh tyrant (Arundinicola leucocephala) is a small passerine bird in the tyrant flycatcher family, the only species of the genus Arundinicola. It breeds in tropical South America from Colombia, Venezuela and Trinidad south to Bolivia, Argentina and Paraguay.  Description  The adult white-headed marsh tyrant is 12.7 cm long and weighs 15 g. The male is entirely brown-black, apart from the relatively large white head and yellowish lower mandible. The female has brown upperparts and wings and a black tail. Her underparts, sides of the head and forecrown are dull white. This is a quiet species, but the call is a sharp sedik. Female in Argentina This species is found in marshy savannahs, reedbeds and the edges of mangrove swamps.  Diet  White-headed marsh tyrants wait on an exposed low perch in marsh vegetation or a branch near water, occasionally sallying out to feed on insects, their staple diet, before returning to the perch. They often pick off insects from the vegetation, but more frequently out of mid-air and even from shallow water.de A. Gabriel & Pizo (2005) The nest is a feather-lined oval ball of grasses and other plant material, with a porched side entrance. It is placed at the end of a branch near or over water. Both sexes incubate the typical clutch of two or three creamy-white eggs, which are marked with a few brown spots. Cowbirds often parasitise the nest. This bird is not considered threatened by the IUCN. Local populations may disappear however due to declining habitat quality.Faria (2006), BLI (2008) Footnotes  References  * de A.

Written by Antonioni, Mark Peploe, and Peter Wollen, the film is about an Anglo-American journalist, David Locke (Jack Nicholson), who assumes the identity of a dead businessman while working on a documentary in Chad, unaware that he is impersonating an arms dealer with connections to the rebels in the current civil war. Co-starring Maria Schneider, The Passenger was the final film in Antonioni's three-picture deal with producer Carlo Ponti and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, after Blowup and Zabriskie Point, and competed for the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival. Plot David Locke (Jack Nicholson) is a television journalist making a documentary film on post-colonial Africa. To finish the film, he is in the Sahara seeking to meet with and interview rebel fighters involved in the Chadian Civil War. Struggling to find rebels to interview, he is frustrated when his Land Rover gets stuck on a sand dune. After a long walk through the desert back to his hotel, a thoroughly dispirited Locke discovers that an Englishman, Robertson (Charles Mulvehill), who has also been staying there and with whom he had struck up a friendship, has died overnight at the hotel from a heart condition. Locke decides to switch identities with Robertson; he is tired of his work, his marriage and his life, and sees an opportunity for a fresh start. Posing as Robertson, Locke reports his own death at the front desk, where the hotel manager mistakes Locke for Robertson, and the plan goes off without a hitch. In London, Locke's wife Rachel (Jenny Runacre) has been having an affair. She feels guilt-ridden and torn when she is informed of her husband's death. She approaches Locke's friend, Martin (Ian Hendry), a producer at the BBC, in an attempt to get in touch with Robertson to try and learn more about her husband's last days. Meanwhile, \\"Robertson\\" (Locke) has flown off to Europe with the dead man's belongings, including his appointment book. Locke soon learns that Robertson was gunrunning for the rebels whom, as a reporter, Locke had been trying to contact in the desert. When he goes to check out an airport locker listed in Robertson's diary, Locke is tracked down by the rebels' point man in Europe. He is there to complete the weapons sale. Since neither man has ever seen the other before, Locke's false identity is not revealed, and he hands the men the documents from Robertson's locker, and receives the first down payment for the set-up arms deal with Robertson before his death. Later, Locke accidentally spots his friend Martin on a street in Barcelona, as the latter tries to track Robertson down on behalf of Rachel. Locke backtracks and at this point bumps into an architecture student (Maria Schneider) while trying to hide nearby. He asks her to fetch his belongings from the hotel, so he won't be seen there by Martin who camped out to catch up with \\"Robertson\\". Martin overhears that she is collecting Locke's baggage, and requests she take him to meet \\"Robertson\\". She manages to evade him, and join Locke, who leaves Barcelona. They become lovers, and later, while trying to explain his rather odd behaviour, Locke confesses that he has stolen a dead man's identity. Locke is flush with cash from the down payment on the arms he cannot deliver, yet he is drawn to keep the meetings listed in Robertson's note book. In the meantime, Rachel has received his left-behind belongings, which were returned from Africa. Having heard from Martin of his unsuccessful chase of the elusive \\"Robertson\\", Rachel is shocked as she opens Locke's passport, seeing Robertson's photo pasted inside. Having realised why \\"Robertson\\" was so elusive, Rachel now heads off to Spain to track down Locke, who is fleeing from the Spanish police, brought in by Rachel to track Robertson. The student girl is, however, still loyal to Locke and helps him to evade them, providing rational advice, but Locke sends her away, intending to meet later in Tangiers. Reaching the Gloria hotel in the Spanish town of Osuna, province of Seville, Locke finds out that the girl has already booked them a double room, but then again he persuades her that she had better leave. Taking her time, she wanders around the dusty square outside. Shortly afterwards the rebel agents in pursuit of Robertson arrive at the hotel. There Locke's assassination takes place, mostly off-screen during one long take, ending with a single gun shot. The rebels leave the scene minutes before the police arrive with Rachel, to find Locke motionless in bed. There his wife says to the police officers that she \\"never knew\\" the dead man, while the student girl identifies him as Robertson.

The camera pans, without a cut, to hold on Robertson's now live appearance on the balcony, when Locke appears beside him and the two of them continue talking, i.e. an in-camera in-single-shot flashback. The film's penultimate shot is a seven-minute long take tracking shot which begins in Locke's hotel room, looking out onto a dusty, run-down square, pushes out through the bars of the hotel window into the square, rotates 180 degrees, and finally tracks back to a close exterior view of the room's interior.Chatman, pp. 183‚Äì185, 202 * The location of the hotel is stated to be Osuna in the film. However, the bullring at the edge of the square is recognisably that of the one in the Spanish town of Vera, in the province of Almer√≠a. In a DVD commentary, decades later, Nicholson said Antonioni built the entire hotel so as to get this shot. * Since the shot was continuous, it was not possible to adjust the lens aperture as the camera left the room and went into the square. Hence the footage had to be taken in the very late afternoon near dusk, in order to minimise the lighting contrast between the brightness outside and that in the room. * The square was windy and the crew needed stillness to ensure smooth camera movement. Antonioni tried putting the camera in a sphere so the wind might catch it less, but this would not fit through the window. In the scene, it appears that the bars may have been adjusted to be removed as the camera approached them. * The camera ran on a ceiling track in the hotel room and when it came outside the window, was meant to be picked up by a hook suspended from a giant crane nearly 30 metres high. A system of gyroscopes was fitted on the camera to steady it during the switch from this smooth indoor track to the crane outside. Meanwhile, the bars on the window had been given hinges. When the camera reached the window and the bars were no longer in the field of view, they were swung away to either side. At this time the camera's forward movement had to stop for a few seconds as the crane's hook grabbed it and took over from the track. To hide this, the lens was slowly and smoothly zoomed until the crane could pull the camera forward.Only a year later (1976) the wholly portable Steadicam, which uses a counterweight system rather than gyroscopes, became available for this kind of shot, greatly simplifying such setups. Then the cameraman walked the camera in a circle around the square, giving the crew time to shut the window bars before the camera returned to look through the window from the outside this time. Antonioni directed the scene from a van by means of monitors and microphones, talking to assistants who communicated his instructions to the actors and operators.Interview with Antonioni in L'ultima sequenza di Professione: Reporter (1974) directed by Andr√© S. Labarthe, available with English subtitles as The Last Sequence of The Passenger. Although this is often referred to as the \\"final shot\\" of the film, there is one more. The last passage shows a small driving school car pulling away in the twilight, and the camera holds on the hotel as the film's credits begin to roll. Some years after the production ended, Nicholson had a dispute with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on an unrelated matter. The former had a deal with MGM in producing a film together, but when that project was not pursued, Nicholson demanded compensation; the result being the acquisition of this film. This explains why, out of the three arranged productions between Carlo Ponti and Michelangelo Antonioni for MGM beginning with Blowup (1966) and followed up by Zabriskie Point (1970); this was the only one not passed on to Warner Bros., successor-of-interest to the pre-1986 MGM catalogue via their acquisition of Turner Entertainment, who was the initial purchasor of said catalogue. For years Nicholson kept The Passenger out of circulation until Sony Pictures Classics courted him with an offer to restore the film. Reception La Pedrera in Barcelona, as seen in 2005. The look of the roof was quite different in 1975, during filming of The Passenger. Locke (Nicholson) asks the Girl to get his things from the hotel so as not to be seen by his friend from the BBC. The Passenger has been widely praised for its camerawork (by Luciano Tovoli) and its acting. It competed for the Palme d'Or award at the 1975 Cannes Film Festival. The film was praised by such critics as Peter Travers of Rolling Stone and Manohla Dargis of The New York Times. Roger Ebert wrote that it was a perceptive look at identity, alienation and the human desire to escape oneself.

The museum is actually associated with two other museums in Greater Los Angeles: the Page Museum at the La Brea Tar Pits in Hancock Park and the William S. Hart Ranch and Museum in Newhall. The three museums work together to achieve their common mission: \\"to inspire wonder, discovery, and responsibility for our natural and cultural worlds.\\"http://www.nhm.org/site/about-our-museums/mission History Old east door of The Natural History Museum in 1956 NHM opened in Exposition Park, Los Angeles, California, United States in 1913 as The Museum of History, Science, and Art. The moving force behind it was a museum association founded in 1910. Its distinctive main building with fitted marble walls and domed and colonnaded rotunda, is on The National Register of Historic Places. Additional wings opened in 1925, 1930, 1960, and 1976. The museum was divided in 1961 into The Los Angeles County Museum of History and Science and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA). LACMA moved to new quarters on Wilshire Boulevard in 1965, and the Museum of History and Science was renamed The Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History. Eventually, the museum renamed itself again, becoming The Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County. Hall of African Mammals In 2003, the museum began a campaign to transform its exhibits and visitor experience. The museum reopened its seismically retrofitted renovated 1913 rotunda, along with the new Age of Mammals exhibition. in 2010. Its Dinosaur Hall opened in July 2011. A new Los Angeles history exhibition, Becoming Los Angeles, opened in 2013. The outdoor Nature Gardens and Nature Lab, which explore L.A. wildlife, also opened in 2013. Research and collections Triceratops mount in the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County The museum maintains research and collections in the following fields: * Annelida * Anthropology and Archaeology * Ethnology * Crustacea * Echinoderms * Entomology * Herpetology * History * Ichthyology * Invertebrate paleontology * Malacology * Mammalogy * Mineralogy * Ornithology * Vertebrate paleontology The museum has three floors of permanent exhibits. Among the most popular museum displays are those devoted to animal habitats, dinosaurs, pre-Columbian cultures, The Ralph M. Parsons Discovery Center and Insect Zoo, and the new Nature Lab, which explores urban wildlife in Southern California. The museum's collections are strong in many fields, but the mineralogy and Pleistocene paleontology are the most esteemed, the latter thanks to the wealth of specimens collected from The La Brea Tar Pits. The museum has almost 30 million specimens representing marine zoology. These include one of the largest collections of marine mammal remains in the world, housed in a warehouse off site, which at over 5,000 specimens is second in size only to that of The Smithsonian. The museum's collection of historical documents is held in The Seaver Center for Western History Research. Special exhibits The museum hosts regular special exhibitions which augment its collections and advance its mission. Recent special exhibits have included Mummies and Pterosaurs. The museum also hosts a butterfly pavilion outside every spring and summer and a spider pavilion on the same site in the fall. Architecture Museum rotunda Over the years, the museum has built additions onto its original building. Originally dedicated when The Natural History Museum opened its doors in 1913, the rotunda is one of the museum's most elegant and popular spaces.

The battle boiled during the late 1970s and early 1980s and came to a head when the racing teams affiliated with FOCA, an equivalent to a racing team union, boycotted the 1982 San Marino Grand Prix. Introduction The battle for control of Formula One was contested between the F√©d√©ration Internationale du Sport Automobile (FISA), at the time an autonomous subcommittee of the FIA, and the Formula One Constructors' Association (FOCA). The principals in the matter were Jean-Marie Balestre, then FISA president, Bernie Ecclestone, then the leader of FOCA and owner of the Brabham Formula One team, and Max Mosley, later president of the FIA, but then legal advisor to both Ecclestone's Brabham team and FOCA in general. The beginnings of the dispute are numerous, and many of the underlying reasons may be lost in history. The teams (excepting Ferrari and the other major manufacturers ‚Äì Renault and Alfa Romeo in particular) were of the opinion that their rights and ability to compete against the larger and better funded teams were being negatively affected by a perceived bias on the part of FISA, the controlling organisation, toward the major manufacturers. In addition, the battle revolved around the commercial aspects of the sport (the FOCA teams were unhappy with the disbursement of proceeds from the races) and the technical regulations which, in FOCA's opinion, tended to be malleable according to the nature of the transgressor more than the nature of the transgression. The battles raged throughout the late 1970s and early 1980s, the first major confrontation being at the 1980 Spanish Grand Prix. In the buildup to the race, FISA fined the majority of the FOCA team drivers who had not appeared at the drivers' briefings at the Belgian and Monaco races and unless the fines were paid, the drivers at fault would have their racing licences revoked by the governing body.Bower (2011) pp.109 After a lengthy debate between the teams, the drivers, FOCA and FISA, the race went ahead at the insistence of King Juan Carlos without FISA's sanctioning or the support of the factory teams. The race, won by eventual World Champion Alan Jones in a Williams-Ford, was therefore run as a non-championship event.Griffiths (1997) pp.255 A notable point of the dispute was the formation of a short lived \\"World Federation of Motorsport\\" in November 1980 to stage a rival championship. The FOCA teams staged a Formula One race under the WFMS banner in South Africa in February , won by Carlos Reutemann in a Williams-Ford. However, the lack of major factory team attendance, the resulting poor fan support and limited media coverage meant that the viability of the rival series was compromised immediately.Bower (2011) pp.114 A grudging settlement was reached thereafter which allowed the FOCA teams to return to the \\"FISA\\" world championship in time for the first race in March. Things came to a head just before the beginning of the 1982 season. FISA had introduced a clause into the drivers' super licences, stipulating that they must drive for the team they were currently contracted to and no others. The Grand Prix Drivers' Association led by Didier Pironi and Niki Lauda organised a 'drivers' strike' at the 1982 South African Grand Prix in protest, with the majority of the drivers in support (Italian driver Teo Fabi was the only one not to participate in the strike). After lengthy debates and negotiation between the GPDA, FISA and FOCA the dispute was settled in favour of the drivers, and the clause was dropped. The war culminated in a FOCA boycott of the 1982 San Marino Grand Prix three months later. In theory, all the FOCA-aligned teams were supposed to boycott the Grand Prix as a sign of solidarity and complaint at the handling of the regulations and financial compensation. In practice, four of the teams ‚Äì Tyrrell, Osella, ATS and Toleman ‚Äì backed out of the boycott, citing \\"sponsor obligations\\". Nonetheless, there were only 14 cars in the race ‚Äì the six cars from the FISA-aligned Ferrari, Renault and Alfa Romeo teams, and the eight cars from the four FOCA teams that had broken the boycott. The hard feelings and repercussions of the four FOCA teams' participation in the race would continue into the mid-1980s. Boycott and water-cooled brakes The FOCA team bosses claimed that their boycott of the 1982 San Marino Grand Prix was in response to the disqualification of Nelson Piquet's Brabham and Keke Rosberg's Williams from the 1982 Brazilian Grand Prix. Ford-Cosworth DFV engine, was used from 1967 to 1985 in Formula One. The Renault RS10: the first turbocharged car to win a Grand Prix, in 1979. This disqualification was a response to the FOCA teams' attempts to overcome their cars' power deficit to the other (mainly manufacturer backed or owned) teams' turbocharged engines. Renault had introduced turbocharged engines to Formula One in . Initially the turbocharged cars had been heavy, unreliable, and difficult to drive, meaning the Ford-Cosworth DFVs used by the majority of the Formula One teams (with Ferrari's Flat 12 engine the notable exception) were still dominant. However, by turbo engines were becoming faster, more reliable and easier to drive. By this time, Ferrari and later Alfa Romeo () joined Renault in the turbo camp, while even Bernie Ecclestone's Brabham team began using turbocharged BMW engines in 1982. The FOCA teams stuck with the DFV, but even the latest versions of the engine (which had been introduced in ) showed their age and were significantly down on power relative to the newest turbo engines. In order to keep pace with the turbo cars, FOCA team bosses began to look for loopholes in the regulations. Before the Brazilian race, the FOCA teams found a loophole in the weighing procedure used at the races. The rules stated a car would be weighed with all coolants and lubricants on board, and said nothing about whether those coolants and lubricants needed to be in the car when the race finished. The FOCA teams claimed this meant that all coolants and lubricants could be 'topped up' after the race. This practice was illegal in all other forms of FIA racing, but was not explicitly banned in Formula One. With this in mind, the FOCA teams showed up at the 1982 Brazilian Grand Prix with \\"water-cooled brakes\\". The cars were also fitted with large water tanks, which the teams claimed were to hold the water needed to cool the brakes. In reality, the water in the tanks wasn't used for cooling the brakes at all, but was instead sprayed out of the car in the early laps of the race. This resulted in the cars running most of the race significantly under the mandated minimum weight limit. However, after the race (or on occasion during a late race pit stop) the teams refilled the tanks before the cars were weighed. Since the cars were supposed to be weighed with all coolants and lubricants on board, and the water was supposed to be a coolant, this was not a violation of the letter of the rules of Formula One. In the Brazilian Grand Prix of 1982, the Brabham-Ford/Cosworth of Nelson Piquet and the Williams- Ford/Cosworth of Keke Rosberg finished first and second respectively, with the turbocharged Renault of Alain Prost finishing third (without the water-cooled brakes). Renault immediately protested the top two cars, and Piquet and Rosberg were disqualified for finishing the race underweight. The FISA teams accused the FOCA teams of intentionally mis-interpreting the rule in question, while the FOCA teams claimed since 'topping up' the tanks wasn't specifically illegal, it had to be legal. Brabham and Williams appealed the disqualification of their cars. As per normal procedure, there was a delay before the FIA Court of Appeals heard the appeal on the disqualifications. This meant another Grand Prix (the United States Grand Prix West) was run before the appeals were heard, and Ferrari (who was aligned with FISA) took the opportunity to show where things would lead if teams were allowed to exploit loopholes in the regulations. Both Ferrari 126C2s showed up at the race with two rear wings. The wings were located side-by-side, with one slightly in front of the other. Both wings were the legal size, but the effect was the same as running one rear wing that was double the legal width. Ferrari claimed this setup was legal, as there was no rule stating teams could only run one rear wing, so running multiple rear wings had to be legal. The FIA disagreed, and disqualified Gilles Villeneuve after he finished 3rd in a Ferrari. Whether this episode influenced the FIA Court of Appeals or not is unknown, but either way the appeals from Williams and Brabham were rejected, and the disqualifications stood. Ironically, the rest of the FOCA teams' cars in the Brazilian Grand Prix (some of which had scored points) were not disqualified despite the fact they ran the same water-cooled brakes system. The reason was simple: Renault had only protested the cars which had finished in front of their driver (Prost). None of the other cars using the system had been protested, meaning they were allowed to keep their points.  Rules and breaches During this period, the Formula One rules specified that any car must weigh at least 585 kg to be deemed in compliance with the rules. The method of testing was somewhat haphazard ‚Äì teams would be notified that they would be \\"weight checked\\" when they exited the pits during practice or qualifying. This gave the teams ample opportunity to add weight to their cars while in the pits so as to pass the test. Former Formula One driver Eddie Cheever claimed that during 1981, when his Tyrrell was tagged for a weight check in qualifying, the team took off the \\"racing\\" rear wing (a fiberglass/metal hybrid) and replaced it with a \\"weight check\\" rear wing before allowing him to proceed to the scale. Cheever said it took four of them to lift the \\"weight check\\" rear wing and the car was largely undriveable with it installed. He believed that the weight check rear wing was made mostly of lead. Similarly, after the limiting of ground effect technology in Formula One at the end of 1980 the Brabham team devised a system to circumvent the minimum ride height regulation of 6 centimetres. The FISA had implemented this rule in order to make it relatively easy to eliminate ground effect skirts and underwings, both of which required that the bodywork of the car be very close to the racing surface at all times. The Brabham team at the time was headed by Ecclestone, with legal representation by Max Mosley, and its chief mechanic was Charlie Whiting ‚Äì all of whom became FIA Senior staffers. The team's designer Gordon Murray produced a hydropneumatic suspension system for the Brabham BT49C, in which compressed air acted as the spring. The air springs supported the car at the regulation height for checks while stationary in parc ferm√©. At speed, where the ride height could not be measured, downforce compressed the suspension and the car settled to a much lower ride height, creating more downforce. It returned to its original height when the car slowed down to enter the pits. Murray believes the system to have been legal on the basis that all suspension systems compress under download. The loophole was in the degree of compression permitted, which was not specified under the rules.Henry (1985) pp.223‚Äì225 Resolution While it is not clear that these issues were ever properly resolved, the FISA‚ÄìFOCA war was ultimately put into more or less permanent abeyance by the Concorde Agreement to which both parties agreed at the beginning of 1981. The regulatory body (FISA, which was an autonomous satellite body created by the FIA to oversee international motorsport) agreed to a more equal distribution of funds, to arbitration provisions, and to a timetable for technical regulation changes, amongst other things. The teams agreed to appear for every race in the world championship (which had not been the case previously, as to save money, often teams did not enter \\"fly away\\" races, i.e. South American, Antipodean, or North American events) under financial penalty. Furthermore, they agreed to abide by the rulings of the arbitration provisions of the agreement. The FOCA teams also agreed to share travel expenses equally amongst all teams who score world championship points in a given season. The initial Concorde Agreement went into effect in 1981 and lasted until 1987. While the Concorde Agreement has been both extended and substantially modified since then, the ten teams contesting the Formula One World Championship in are still covered under its provisions. Repercussions The fallout from the FISA‚ÄìFOCA war is significant and worthy of mention. Firstly, the Concorde Agreement hastened the commercial development of the sport. The fact that promoters could guarantee that \\"all 26\\" cars (as was the custom) would appear at every race led to increased sponsorships and commercial opportunities. This, in turn, led to a significant increase in financial remuneration to each of the teams (including the non-FOCA teams ‚Äì the manufacturers). Secondly, those teams who had backed out of the 1982 San Marino boycott were harshly dealt with. The Tyrrell team was the last team to obtain a turbocharged engine contract (essential in order to be competitive in Formula One from 1983 onward), finally signing a deal to run \\"customer\\" Renault turbos in the latter part of 1985 (roughly three years before turbo engines were ultimately banned), having involved in a controversy in the team's final full year without turbo engines (prior to the ban) for using an illegal weight ballast. Toleman was effectively squeezed out of the Formula One world championship in 1985 when their tyre supplier pulled out of Formula One. In both cases, it must be said, the teams had previously blotted their copybook with inappropriate acts. In Tyrrell's case, they had backed out of a 1974 contract to run Renault turbo engines, leading directly to the carmaker's entry into Formula One as a factory team in 1977, while in Toleman's case, they broke a Pirelli tyre contract in favour of Michelin tyres in 1984, only to be left without a contract when Michelin withdrew at the end of 1984. Pirelli, understandably, felt they could not reasonably supply the team in 1985. Goodyear, the other supplier, refused to do so on grounds of capacity. This was resolved before the Monaco Grand Prix in 1985, when Toleman bought the Pirelli contract from the recently closed Spirit team, after signing a long-term sponsorship with Luciano Benetton. Finally, the entente cordiale between FISA and FOCA led more or less to the inclusion of some of FOCA's principals within the FIA, namely Bernie Ecclestone and Max Mosley. The commercial aspects of Formula One have grown immensely since their involvement in the late 1980s, although the neutrality of the governing bodies and their judgements is still debated by the press and followers of the sport.

The name comes from a member of the prominent Basque‚ÄìSpanish Berreyesa family: Nicolas Berreyesa, a Californio settler who was granted Rancho Milpitas in 1834. The name North Valley is sometimes used by locals to refer to Berryessa. Informal use of the term sometimes also includes parts of Milpitas and Alviso to mean the northern portion of the Santa Clara Valley. History In the late 19th century, Berryessa was a small farming community well known across California for its high-quality fruit. Hostetter Road, Capitol Avenue, Piedmont Road, and Lundy Avenue were formerly surrounded by apricot and prune orchards, whereas today this area is distinguished as a fast-growing bedroom community of San Jose, served by VTA light rail and (in 2019), an extension of the Bay Area's BART system. Geography The district borders Milpitas along Landess Avenue to the north and the Alum Rock neighborhood of East San Jose along Mabury Road to the south. The residential neighborhood is part of the Fourth City Council District, along with Alviso, and was represented by Chuck Reed prior to his election as Mayor of San Jose. The district representative is now Lan Diep. The J. F. Flickinger Fruit Packing Company, one of the largest fruit packing companies in the Santa Clara Valley, was located around present-day Hostetter Road. In the 1960s and 1970s, however, the orchards were developed into suburban residential neighborhoods and businesses. Tiny remnants of these lands remain today, including the Orlando Farm till 2013 when it too was developed into housing on Capitol Avenue and the Mattos' apricot orchard off Piedmont Road.

It was first used in 1944 at Antwerp during the Battle of the Scheldt. Terrapins served with the Royal Engineer assault teams of the 79th Armoured Division and were used to carry infantry units (Canadian and British) over rivers. Development Due to a shortage of US-manufactured DUKWs, the British Ministry of Supply commissioned Thornycroft to design an amphibious vehicle capable of ferrying supplies and troops from ship to shore for the D-Day landings.Brissette, Richard and Bannerman, Mark: \\"The Terrapin\\", Military Modelling Magazine, 29 Feb 2008, page 60. Some 500 Terrapin Mark 1 were built by Morris Commercial, the commercial vehicle side of Morris Motors Limited. A Mark 2 Terrapin with a number of improvements reached the prototype stage, but the war ended before it entered production. Mark 1 The Terrapin was powered by two Ford V8 engines mounted side-by-side, with each motor driving the wheels on one side. Wheel braking was used to steer, the brakes being operated by levers. On a level surface, the vehicle was supported on the four middle wheels, the front and rear wheels remaining clear of the surface (the front pair being raised significantly, the rear pair only slightly). The front and rear wheels provided support and traction on soft surfaces and when climbing slopes, such as riverbanks. When driven in the water, it was propelled by two rear-mounted propellers. Despite success in its first military action, the Terrapin was not overall a successful design and had many significant defects, which were never overcome in service. Due to the large diameter tyres, the Terrapin was a relatively high vehicle and, although open-topped, it was difficult to enter and exit. Any soldier attempting to exit over the side faced both prolonged exposure to enemy fire and possible injury from the fall. A column of \\"Alligator\\" amphibious vehicles passing Terrapin amphibious vehicles (to the left) during the Battle of the Scheldt, 13 October 1944. Like the Medium Mark A Whippet tank of the First World War, the Terrapin had separate engines driving each side of the vehicle with skid steering. This arrangement was awkward on the Whippet, and on the Terrapin as well. If one engine broke down, the Terrapin tended to swing around violently. The two centrally located engines split the cargo compartment in two and, though rated as a 4-ton vehicle, this prevented large loads, such as heavy artillery or vehicles, from being carried. In addition, the driver had poor visibility as he was centrally located inside the middle of the vehicle. This was compounded by the installation of a canvas cover over the forward hold. As a result, another crew member typically had to stand behind the driver and provide directions. In use, the vehicle was found to be rather slow, and was easily swamped in rough seas. The specification had limited the length to and this made its seagoing characteristics inferior to the American DUKW. These failings quickly led to the abandonment of the design in favour of the development of the Mark 2, but the growing availability of large numbers of the much more successful DUKW made further development unnecessary. Mark II This was similar to the Mark 1, but had a forward driving position. It was a much longer vehicle, being long compared with the length of the Mark I. Only five of these 5-ton capacity vehicles were built.Ware, P World War II Military Vehicles ‚Äì Transport & Halftracks p155 Use Terrapins were used in Operation Vitality II on 26 October to carry units from the British 52nd (Lowland) Division across the Scheldt; Amphibious Sherman DD tanks led the attack. During the operations against Walcheren, Terrapins and Buffalo transports carried the 9th Canadian Infantry Brigade in what was intended to be a diversionary attack across a mile wide inlet on 9 October 1944. A sufficiently large bridgehead was made that the attack became the main attempt and the German defences were turned. After the war, Terrapins, together with DUKWs, were used as a form of public transport on the still-flooded Walcheren island until circa 1946.

The spillway operates when there is excess water in the reservoir; in 2017 after heavy rains it started flowing, for the first time since 2006. It started flowing again in 2019 after heavy rains. In 1997 a woman was killed after being pulled inside the spillway. The spillway at Monticello Dam, Lake Berryessa, in operation, February 19, 2017 Geology The active Green Valley Fault runs parallel to the Lake in the hills to the west. History Prior to American settlement, the area was home to the Pomo tribe. The valley was an agricultural region, whose soils were considered among the finest in the country. The main town in the valley, Monticello, was abandoned in order to construct the reservoir. This abandonment was chronicled by the photographers Dorothea Lange and Pirkle Jones in their book Death of a Valley. Construction of Monticello Dam began in 1953, completed in 1958, and the reservoir filled by 1963, creating what at the time was the second-largest reservoir in California after Shasta Lake. The Monticello Dam with Lake Berryessa, Putah Diversion Dam with Lake Solano, and associated water distribution systems and lands are known collectively as the Solano Project, which is distinct from other water projects in California such as the Central Valley Project. Monticello residents opposed the government and the Solano Project but were unsuccessful. Residents abandoned their homes, the Monticello cemetery had to be relocated, and houses were destroyed. Monticello ranchers were evicted as equipment was auctioned away and the fertile land destroyed and flooded. The discovery of gold in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada caused an influx of people to the central valley. Communities in Solano County grew quickly in the gold rush. More water was needed to accommodate the rising population, so around the 1940s the Solano County Board of Supervisors organized the Solano County Water Council to search for the best place to develop a water project. Monticello Dam and Lake Berryessa were the result. Interest in damming Putah Creek started around the early 1900s. In 1907, a few cities in the Bay Area were interested enough to hire three engineers, including Arthur Powell Davis and George Washington Goethals. Their interest quickly evaporated in favor of larger projects, but the place continued to attract interest. Small irrigation projects had developed in the surrounding areas but had little success. In the end the Solano Water Council agreed to focus on Monticello Dam. The original plan included alterations to both Putah Creek and Cache Creeks but complications led to a simpler plan which only dammed Putah Creek at Devil‚Äôs Gate, which the Bureau of Reclamation assured engineers and planners was the most feasible spot to place a dam on Putah Creek. Some predicted the dam would be unsuccessful and the valley would never fill. Monticello, a small farming town was founded by Ezra Peacock in 1867. By the time of the evacuations for the dam it had a population of about 250 with some scattered on the outskirts in the valley. Putah Creek was the town‚Äôs life source, it provided them with close access to water for both crop and livestock raising. A few years after the completion of the dam, Governor Edmund G. Brown proposed a new project to build an even bigger dam and a larger lake. The \\"Greater Berryessa Project\\" was envisioned to be a much larger project; the 304-foot dam would be replaced with a 600-foot dam that would be capable of holding ten times the amount of water, expanding the lake to three times the current size, flooding productive farmland. The project's primary purpose was storage of northern water for use in parts of southern California. Hydrology A view of Lake Berryessa The lake is fed by the headwaters to the 576-square-mile (1,490 km¬≤) Putah Creek watershed. It has a storage capacity of , making it one of the larger reservoirs in California. Besides Putah Creek there are three other major tributaries that contribute to the lake: Capell Creek, Pope Creek, and Eticuera Creek. Since all of these creeks do not come from the same area, the lake level rise is hard to predict. Each creek has a different flow rate and that rate is based on the precipitation level where the creek comes from. These smaller tributaries mostly contribute in the winter or wet season only and usually dry out in the summer months. Though Putah Creek is not the only creek that is directly impacted by the project, it is the only creek that is dammed. The Solano Projects are much more than just Monticello Dam and Lake Berryessa, including Putah Diversion Dam, Lake Solano, and the Putah South Canal. Lake Berryessa is the largest body of water formed from the Solano Projects and so is the most well-known. Lake Berryessa does help to manage for flooding in the Yolo county. It is estimated that for the first forty years, over five million dollars were saved from avoided flood damage. A study in 1986 shows that it is highly unlikely that Lake Berryessa will overflow. There are few times has it actually gone over 440 ft, as it did on February 17, 2017. In the study, the probability of the lake level reaching 450 ft. was estimated at about one percent; likely only to happen once in a hundred years. The highest water level ever recorded at Lake Berryessa was 446.7 ft. Raising Monticello dam is highly unlikely but one possible way to increase water storage at the lake is to raise the height of Glory Hole. Lake Berryessa supplies water to Vacaville, Suisun City, Vallejo, and Fairfield as well as Travis Air Force Base located south of Lake Berryessa has its water supplied by Berryessa. The Solano County Water Agency (SCWA) and its partners work closely together to manage the water levels at Lake Berryessa. A \\"Drought Contingency\\" Plan is in place for if the lake level dwindles down below 800,000 acre-feet then SCWA and acting partners will work find supplies for the lake‚Äôs recipients and try to conserve the lake‚Äôs water as long as possible. Though the lake and Monticello Dam are in Napa County, the water yield of up to about 245,000 acre-feet per year from the Solano Project is largely contracted to Solano County Water Agency and managed under subcontract by Solano Irrigation District for use in Solano County. The water is used for agricultural, municipal, and industrial purposes under a contract for use of water rights held by the federal Bureau of Reclamation. Another contract allows for use of up to 1,500 acre-feet of water per year around Lake Berryessa in Napa County. The 25-year contracts were renewed in 2009. The Monticello Dam Powerplant built in 1983 generates up to 12 MW of hydroelectric power. A settlement of water right claims to Putah Creek was made in 2000. Known as the Putah Creek Accord, it allowed for scheduled instream flows in lower Putah Creek flowing to the Yolo Bypass. Water rights for the watershed above Monticello Dam were amended in 1996. Lake Berryessa is a monomictic lake, which means that the waters of the lake turnover once a year. For monomictic lakes that turnover time is somewhere in the Fall. Lake turnover happens when the warmer surface water starts to cool to match the lower cooler water. Once the lake is all the same temperature, water can freely circulate all around and oxygen replenishes parts of the water where it has been diminished. Fishing during the turnover time or after can be difficult because the monotone temperature and oxygen level of the lake allows for the fish to go anywhere in the lake. Lake Berryessa is critical for recharging the groundwater in the surrounding areas. Without the dam, Putah Creek can dry out in summer.  Management  The creation of Monticello Dam and Lake Berryessa were not intended for public and recreational use. The lake was initially fenced off but interest from the public overcame and many people still managed to access the water in the first two years. With no federal or state agencies wanting to manage affairs at the lake, agencies authorized seven concessionaires to provide recreational activities at the lake to the public on federal land in the late 1950s. Those 50 year contracts for the concessionaires have come to an end in 2009. During the time of the concessionaires, they leased some land to RV homes for long term housing. When the contracts ended, all the recreational facilities and mobile homes were forced to move from federal property. The new reclamation has yet to seriously start any new development on recreational activities at the lake though a new multi-purpose trail is to be in the future. Post-contract, recreation levels and activities at Lake Berryessa have perished from the concessionaire days. Estimates from the bureau estimated that visitations at Lake Berryessa dropped to less than half since the termination of all seven resorts. The Bureau of Reclamation held an open bid period in 2015 to businesses for developmental opportunities at Lake Berryessa. As of early 2016 there were no successful bids for any of the concession areas at Lake Berryessa. The management of Zebra and Quagga mussels for Lake Berryessa is managed by the SCWA and its interns. The program that has been going on for over 15 years informs, educates, and manages boaters for potential mussels. Any boater that has visited a lake known to have either mussel must wait a full thirty day from the day of inspection before entering the water. Unfortunately, insufficient funds and resources make it difficult to inspect boaters year round so the program runs for about half to a third of the calendar year only.Solano County Water Agency - Personal Interview In 2007, the SCWA conducted a study on the bottom floors of the lake to determine if the lake has lost some of its capacity due to soil sedimentation as well as map the floor to the most accurate as possible with the newest technologies they had available. The study found that Lake Berryessa did not lose any storage capacity. Climate The National Weather Service has maintained a cooperative weather station at the lake since November 1, 1957. Records show that the area has hot, mostly dry summers and cool, wet winters. Normal January temperatures are a maximum of and a minimum of . Normal July temperatures are a maximum of and a minimum of . There is an average of 80.1 days with highs of or higher and an average of 28.0 days with lows of or lower. The record high temperature was on July 24, 2006. The record low temperature was on December 22, 1990. The wettest year was 1983 with and the driest year was 1976 with . The most precipitation in one month was in January 1995. The most precipitation in 24 hours was on December 31, 2005. Snowfall is very rare, but fell in January 1974.; In the late afternoon of April 27, 2016, a funnel cloud appeared at Lake Berryessa. The 2015-2016 \\"El Nino\\" did not dramatically raise the lake's water level at Berryessa. The total rainfall at the end of March 2016 was just a few inches from the average and the lake was actually just shy of its capacity the year prior. Recreation Popular activities include fishing, waterskiing, jet skiing, pleasure boating, kayaking and canoeing, hiking, road bicycling, motorcycle pleasure biking, birding, wildlife observation, picnicking, and swimming. The Lake Berryessa Seaplane Base is located on the lake's surface, and an estimated 200 seaplane operations were reported between September 2011 and September 2012. It is used for seaplane landings and splash-ins. Lake Berryessa is a swimming and water skiing site for enthusiasts. The narrow portion of the reservoir, nearest to the Monticello Dam, is referred to as the \\"Narrows,\\" and is sometimes busy with boaters on holidays and weekends. There are several resorts with marinas at the lake, as well as nearby Lake Solano County Park located west of Winters, California. Day use areas include Oak Shores and Smittle Creek. There are swimming areas closed to boats and other watercraft, as well as several hiking trails. Lakeshore lands, facilities, and concessions in Napa County are managed by the Bureau of Reclamation. However, five of the seven resort concessions that expired in 2009 have not yet become fully operational. Based on rules against exclusive occupancy of federal recreation lands, about 1,300 long-term resident trailers were removed from the resorts when the 50-year concession contracts expired. In the following years, public usage of the lake dwindled due to government delays in formulating a future plan. There is a seaplane landing area that is open to the public. One of the larger islands contained a small plane landing area but it was closed in the early 1970s in response to a safety report issued by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). = Fishing = Fishing at Lake Berryessa can be successful year-round as the lake is home to both warm-water and cold-water fish species. Lake Berryessa offers a variety of fish from sunfish to landlocked salmon. Because fish species are plentiful, fishing can be done in a variety of ways; from finesse techniques, bait fishing, and to trolling in the deep. Fish species at Lake Berryessa include; largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides), smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomeiu), spotted bass, channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus), bullhead catfish (Ictalurus dolomeiu), white catfish (Ameiurus catus), carp (Cyprinus carpio), Sacramento pikeminnow (Ptychocheilus grandis), crappie, bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus), rainbow trout (Onchorhynchus mykiss), brown and brook trout, Kokanee, and also Chinook salmon (Onchorhynchus tschawytscha). The rainbow trout species is native to the region while many other species were introduced. Largemouth bass and smallmouth bass were both introduced into the lake in the late 1950s and spotted bass followed in the 1980s. Bass and salmon are mostly noted as sport fishing species, bluegill, black and white crappie, and catfish are more of a recreational and beginners type of fish and carp and pikeminnow are usually not favored among anglers. The introduced species of carp is also present and feeds on organic matter, water snails, bloodworm, fresh water mussels as well as their own eggs. Besides the Sacramento pikeminnow, Lake Berryessa also has the golden shiner and threadfin shad which are usually baitfish to the other species of fish. Aside from the fish Lake Berryessa also supports other aquatic organisms such as crawfish, clams, and otters. The California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) has issued a safe eating advisory for any fish caught in Lake Berryessa due to elevated levels of mercury. A copy of these guidelines can also be found at Lake Berryessa‚Äôs Visitor Center. Mercury levels at Lake Berryessa are on the rise and there are no fish that OEHHA recommend to eat more than three times a week. In context of mercury, trouts are the best option for Berryessa at this time. Fishing regulations accord with standard California Department of Fish and Wildlife regulations. There are tournaments scheduled throughout nine of the twelve months out of the year for bass. = Hunting = Hunting on Lake Berryessa is not permitted in lands that are managed by the Bureau of Reclamation. Firearms are, however, allowed on these lands under specific criteria; possession of a Carry Conceal Weapon (CCW) certificate or, if the firearm is disassembled, disarmed and you have a valid California Hunting License and a Permit to Transport Firearm. The Permit to Transport Firearm does not allow for possession of firearm while recreating in Bureau of Recreation lands. Hunting can be possible on lands managed by other agencies next to Reclamation lands such as Knoxville Wildlife Area, Knoxville Recreation, and Cedar Roughs Wildlife area. These areas are under the jurisdiction of California Department of Fish and Wildlife and/or the Bureau of Land Management. Hikers are also present in these areas and the perimeter is fairly small so caution and safety should always be the main priority. =Cedar Roughs Wilderness= Adjoining the Lake Berryessa Recreational Area is the recently designated Cedar Roughs Wilderness Area. The Northern California Coastal Wild Heritage Wilderness Act of 2006 set aside the former study area of located past Pope Creek bridge on the Pope Creek arm of Lake Berryessa. The wilderness area can be accessed by car or boat, although there are no maintained trails (as yet). Hiking can be difficult as more than half of the wilderness area consists of Sargent's cypress, which covers and is relatively pure genetically. It is the second most widely distributed cypress in California, and was named for Charles Sprague Sargent (1841‚Äì1927), the founder and director of Harvard University's Arnold Arboretum and author of the 14-volume Silva of North America. The area is jointly managed by the Bureau of Land Management and California Department of Fish and Game. Flora and fauna Notable plants in the area include sergeant cypress, white alder, leather oak, Jepson's navarretia, and Bridge's brodiaea. The east side of the lake has a Wildlife Management Area managed by the California Department of Fish and Game that protects wildlife habitats for such species as mountain lion, black-tailed deer, western rattlesnake, raccoon, skunk, osprey, turkey, rabbit and golden eagle. 1969 murder In 1969, the lake became the site of one of the infamous Zodiac murders. On the evening of September 27, Pacific Union College students Bryan Hartnell and Cecelia Shepard were picnicking at Lake Berryessa on a small island connected by a sand spit to Twin Oak Ridge. A man approached them wearing a black executioner's-type hood with clip-on sunglasses over the eye-holes and a bib- like device on his chest that had a white 3-by-3-inch (76 mm √ó 76 mm) cross- circle symbol on it. He approached them with a gun, which Hartnell believed to be a .45. The hooded man claimed to be an escaped convict from Deer Lodge, Montana, where he had killed a guard and stolen a car, explaining that he needed their car and money to go to Mexico. He had brought precut lengths of plastic clothesline and told Shepard to tie up Hartnell, before he tied her up. The killer checked and tightened Hartnell's bonds, after discovering Shepard had bound Hartnell's hands loosely. Hartnell initially believed it to be a weird robbery, but the man drew a knife and stabbed them both repeatedly. The killer then hiked 500 yards (460 m) back up to Knoxville Road, drew a cross-circle symbol on Hartnell's car door with a black felt-tip pen, and wrote beneath it: \\"Vallejo/12-20-68/7-4-69/Sept 27‚Äì69‚Äì6:30/by knife\\", the dates of the killer's first two crimes and the date and time of the crime he had just committed. At 7:40 p.m. (19:40), the killer called the Napa County Sheriff's office from a pay telephone to report this latest crime. The phone was found, still off the hook, minutes later at the Napa Car Wash on Main Street in Napa, only a few blocks from the sheriff's office, yet 27 miles (43 km) from the crime scene. Detectives were able to lift a still-wet palm print from the telephone but were never able to match it to any suspect. After hearing their screams for help, a man and his son who were fishing in a nearby cove discovered the victims and summoned help by contacting park rangers. Cecelia Shepard was conscious when law enforcement officers from the Napa County Sheriff's office arrived, but lapsed into a coma during transport to the hospital and never regained consciousness. She died two days later, but Hartnell survived to recount his tale to the press. Napa County Sheriff Detective Ken Narlow, who was assigned to the case from the outset, worked on solving the crime until his retirement from the department in 1987.

In Judaism, slaves were given a range of treatments and protections. They were to be treated as an extended family with certain protections and could be freed. They were property but could also own material goods. Early Christian authors maintained the spiritual equality of slaves and free persons, while accepting slavery as an institution. Early modern papal decrees allowed enslavement of the unbelievers, though popes denounced slavery from the 15th century onward. In the eighteenth century the abolition movement took shape among Christians across the globe, but various denominations did not prohibit slavery among their members into the 19th century. Enslaved non- believers were sometimes converted to Christianity, but elements of their traditional beliefs merged with their Christian beliefs. Early Islamic texts encourage kindness towards slaves and manumission, while recognising slavery as an institution and permitting enslavement of non-Muslims imprisoned or bought beyond the borders of Islamic rule. Children born to slaves were also considered legally as slaves.  Slavery in the Bible  The Genesis narrative about the Curse of Ham has often been held to be an aetiological story, giving a reason for the enslavement of the Canaanites. The word ham is very similar to the Hebrew word for hot, which is cognate with an Egyptian word (kem, which means black) and is used to refer to Egypt itself, in reference to the fertile black soil along the Nile valley. Although many scholars therefore view Ham as an eponym which is used to represent Egypt in the Table of Nations,Jewish Encyclopedia (1901), article on Ham a number of Christians throughout history, including OrigenOrigen, Homilies, on Genesis 16:1 and the Cave of Treasures,(edited by Ciala Kourcikidz√©), The cave of treasures: Georgian version, translated by Jean-Pierre Mah√© in The written corpus of eastern Christianity 526-27, part of Scriptores Iberici 23-24 (Louvain, 1992-93), 21:38-39 have argued for the alternate proposition that Ham represents all black people, his name symbolising their dark skin colour;Goldenberg, D. M. (2003). The Curse of Ham. Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press, page 141. pro-slavery advocates, from Eutychius of Alexandria(edited by J.P. Migne), Complete course in Patrology‚Ä¶Greek series, (Paris, 1857-66), on Annals 111:917B:41-43 and John Philoponus,A. Sanda, Opposcula Monophysitica Johannes Philoponi (Beirut, 1930), page 96 to American pro-slavery apologists,Haynes, S. R. (2002). Noah's Curse. New York: Oxford University Press, page 71. have therefore occasionally interpreted the narrative as a condemnation of all black people to slavery.Felder, C. H. (2002). Race, Racism, and the Biblical Narratives. Minneapolis, Minnesota: Augsburg Fortress, page 8. A few Christians, like Jerome, even took up the racist notion that black people inherently had a soul as black as [their] body.Jerome, Homilies, 1:3:28 Slavery was customary in antiquity, and it is condoned by the Torah. The Bible uses the Hebrew term ebed to refer to slavery; however, ebed has a much wider meaning than the English term slavery, and in several circumstances it is more accurately translated into English as servant.Jewish Encyclopedia (1901), article on Slaves and Slavery It was seen as legitimate to enslave captives obtained through warfare, but not through kidnapping. Children could also be sold into debt bondage, which was sometimes ordered by a court of law.Jewish Encyclopedia (1901), article on Slaves and Slavery As with the Hittite Laws and the Code of Hammurabi,Peake's commentary on the Bible (1962), on Exodus 21:18-27 the Bible does set minimum rules for the conditions under which slaves were to be kept. Slaves were to be treated as part of an extended family; they were allowed to celebrate the Sukkot festival, and expected to honour Shabbat. Israelite slaves could not be compelled to work with rigour, and debtors who sold themselves as slaves to their creditors had to be treated the same as a hired servant. If a master harmed a slave in one of the ways covered by the lex talionis, the slave was to be compensated by manumission; if the slave died within 24 to 48 hours, he or she was to be avenged (whether this refers to the death penaltyMaimonides, Mishneh Torah or notJewish Encyclopedia (1901), article on Avenger of Blood is uncertain). Israelite slaves were automatically manumitted after six years of work, and/or at the next Jubilee (occurring either every 49 or every 50 years, depending on interpretation), although the latter would not apply if the slave was owned by an Israelite and wasn't in debt bondage. Slaves released automatically in their 7th year of service, which did not include female slaves, orJewish Encyclopedia (1901), article on Law, Codification ofPeake's commentary on the Bible (1962), on Exodus 21:2-11 did, were to be given livestock, grain, and wine, as a parting gift (possibly hung round their necks). This 7th-year manumission could be voluntarily renounced, which would be signified, as in other Ancient Near Eastern nations,Thomas Kelly Cheyne and John Sutherland Black, Encyclopaedia Biblica (1903), article on Slavery by the slave gaining a ritual ear piercing; after such renunciation, the individual was enslaved forever (and not released at the JubileeThomas Kelly Cheyne and John Sutherland Black, Encyclopaedia Biblica (1903), article on Slavery). Non- Israelite slaves were always to be enslaved forever, and treated as inheritable property. In New Testament books, including the First Epistle of Peter, slaves are admonished to obey their masters, as to the Lord, and not to men; and the Epistle to Philemon was used by both pro-slavery advocates as well as by abolitionists;Religion and the Antebellum Debate Over Slavery, by John R. McKivigan, Mitchell Snay in the epistle, Paul returns Onesimus, a fugitive slave, back to his master. Judaism More mainstream forms of first-century Judaism did not exhibit such qualms about slavery, and ever since the 2nd-century expulsion of Jews from Judea, wealthy Jews have owned non-Jewish slaves, wherever it was legal to do so; nevertheless, manumissions were approved by Jewish religious officials on the slightest of pretexts, and court cases concerning manumission were nearly always decided in favour of freedom, whenever there was uncertainty towards the facts.The Minor Tractates, Abadim 9:6 The Talmud, a document of great importance in Judaism, made many rulings which had the effect of making manumission easier and more likely: *The costly and compulsory giving of gifts was restricted the 7th-year manumission only. *The price of freedom was reduced to a proportion of the original purchase price rather than the total fee of a hired servant, and could be reduced further if the slave had become weak or sickly (and therefore less saleable). *Voluntary manumission became officially possible, with the introduction of the manumission deed (the shetar shihrur), which was counted as prima facie proof of manumission. *Verbal declarations of manumission could no longer be revoked.Gittin 1:6 *Putting phylacteries on the slave, or making him publicly read three or more verses from the Torah, was counted as a declaration of the slave's manumission. *Extremely long term sickness, for up to four years in total, couldn't count against the slave's right to manumission after six years of enslavement. Jewish participation in the slave trade itself was also regulated by the Talmud. Fear of apostasy lead to the Talmudic discouragement of the sale of Jewish slaves to non-Jews,Gittin, 4:6 although loans were allowed;Gittin, 46b similarly slave trade with Tyre was only to be for the purpose of removing slaves from non-Jewish religion.Jewish Encyclopedia (1901), article on Fairs Religious racism meant that the Talmudic writers completely forbade the sale or transfer of Canaanite slaves out from Palestine to elsewhere.Gittin 4:6 Other types of trade were also discouraged: men selling themselves to women, and post-pubescent daughters being sold into slavery by their fathers. Pre-pubescent slave girls sold by their fathers had to be freed-then-married by their new owner, or his son, when she started puberty; slaves could not be allowed to marry free Jews,Gittin 4:5 although masters were often granted access to the services of the wives of any of their slaves.Kiddushin 22a According to the Talmudic law, killing of a slave is punishable in the same way as killing of a freeman, even if it was committed by the owner. While slaves are considered the owner's property, they may not work on Sabbath and holidays; they may acquire and hold property of the own.Encyclopedia Judaica, 2007, vol. 18, p. 668 Several prominent Jewish writers of the Middle Ages took offense at the idea that Jews might be enslaved; Joseph Caro and Maimonides both argue that calling a Jew slave was so offensive that it should be punished by excommunication.Maimonides, Mishneh Torah, 6:14Joseph Caro, Shulkhan Arukh, Yoreah De'ah 334 However, they did not condemn enslavement of non-Jews. Indeed, they argued that the biblical rule, that slaves should be freed for certain injuries, should actually only apply to slaves who had converted to Judaism; additionally, Maimonides argued that this manumission was really punishment of the owner, and therefore it could only be imposed by a court, and required evidence from witnesses. Unlike the biblical law protecting fugitive slaves, Maimonides argued that such slaves should be compelled to buy their freedom. At the same time, Maimonides and other halachic authorities forbade or strongly discouraged any unethical treatment of slaves. According to the traditional Jewish law, a slave is more like an indentured servant, who has rights and should be treated almost like a member of the owner's family. Maimonides wrote that, regardless whether a slave is Jewish or not, \\"The way of the pious and the wise is to be compassionate and to pursue justice, not to overburden or oppress a slave, and to provide them from every dish and every drink. The early sages would give their slaves from every dish on their table. They would feed their servants before sitting to their own meals... Slaves may not be maltreated of offended - the law destined them for service, not for humiliation. Do not shout at them or be angry with them, but hear them out.\\" In another context, Maimonides wrote that all the laws of slavery are \\"mercy, compassion and forbearance\\".Encyclopedia Judaica, 2007, vol. 18, p. 670 Christianity Different forms of slavery existed for over 18 centuries within Christianity. Although in the early years of Christianity, freeing slaves was regarded as an act of charity, and the Christian view that all people were equal including slaves was a novel idea within the Roman Empire, the institution of slavery was rarely criticised. David Brion Davis writes that the \\"variations in early Christian opinion on servitude fit comfortably within a framework of thought that would exclude any attempt to abolish slavery as an institution\\". Indeed, in 340, the Synod of Gangra condemned the Manicheans for urging that slaves should liberate themselves; instead the canons of the Synod declared that anyone who preached abolitionism should be anathematised, and they also declared that slaves had a \\"Christian obligation\\" to submit to their masters. Augustine of Hippo, who renounced his former Manicheanism, argued that slavery was part of the mechanism to preserve the natural order of things;Augustine of Hippo, City of GodElaine Pagels, Adam, Eve, and the Serpent (1988), page 114 John Chrysostom, who is regarded as a saint by Eastern Orthodoxy and Roman Catholicism, argued that slaves should be resigned to their fate, because by \\"obeying his master he is obeying God\\".Henri Daniel-Rops, Cathedral and Crusade (1957), page 263 but he also stated that \\"Slavery is the fruit of covetousness, of extravagance, of insatiable greediness\\" in his Epist. ad Ephes.http://medicolegal.tripod.com/catholicsvslavery.htm Leroy J. Pletten, Roman Catholic Church Opposition to Slavery (2005) As the Apostle Paul admonished the early Christians; \\"There is neither Jew nor Greek: there is neither bond nor free: there is neither male nor female. For you are all one in Christ Jesus\\". And in fact, even some of the first popes were once slaves themselves. In 1452 Pope Nicholas V issued the papal bull Dum Diversas, which granted Afonso V of Portugal the right to reduce any \\"Saracens, pagans and any other unbelievers\\" to hereditary slavery. The approval of slavery under these conditions was reaffirmed and extended in his Romanus Pontifex bull of 1455. (This papal bull was issued in response to the wars which were triggered by the Fall of Constantinople in 1453) In 1488 Pope Innocent VIII accepted the gift of 100 slaves from Ferdinand II of Aragon and distributed those slaves to his cardinals and the Roman nobility. Also, in 1639 Pope Urban VIII purchased slaves for himself from the Knights of Malta. In the 15th and 16th centuries other Popes denounced slavery as a great crime, including Pius II, Paul III,Alessandro Farnese, Sublimus Dei (1537) - online copy and Eugene IV.Gabriele Condulmer, Sicut Dudum (1435) - online copy In 1639, pope Urban VIII forbade slavery, as did Benedict XIV in 1741. In 1815, pope Pius VII demanded that the Congress of Vienna suppress the slave trade, and Gregory XVI condemned it again in 1839. In addition, the Dominican friars who arrived in the Spanish settlement of Santo Domingo in 1510 strongly denounced the enslavement of the local Indians. Along with other priests, they opposed the mistreatment of the Indians and denounced it as unjust and illegal in an audience with the Spanish king as well as in the subsequent royal commission. As a response to this position, the Spanish monarchy's subsequent Requerimiento provided a religious justification for the enslavement of the local populations, on the pretext that they refused to convert to Roman Catholicism and therefore denied the authority of the Pope. Various interpretations of Christianity were also used to justify slavery. For example,some people believed that slavery was a punishment that was reserved for sinners. Some other Christian organizations were slaveholders. The 18th- century high-church Anglican Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts owned the Codrington Plantation, in Barbados, which contained several hundred slaves, who were branded on their chests with the word Society.Adam Hochschild, Bury the Chains, The British Struggle to Abolish Slavery (2005), page 61 George Whitefield, who is famed for his sparking of the so-called Great Awakening of American evangelicalism, overturned a province-wide ban against slavery,Arnold Dallimore, George Whitefield: The Life and Times of the Great Evangelist of the Eighteenth Century (1980), Volume 2 and went on to own several hundred slaves himself.Edward J. Cashin, Beloved Bethesda : A History of George Whitefield's Home for Boys (2001) Yet Whitefield is remembered as one of the first evangelists who preached to the enslaved.Thomas S. Kidd, ‚ÄúGeorge Whitefield‚Äôs Troubled Relationship to Race and Slavery‚Äù (Christian Century, Jan 07, 2015) At other times, Christian groups worked against slavery. The 7th-century Saint Eloi used his vast wealth to purchase British and Saxon slaves in groups of 50 to 100 in order to set them free.Life in Medieval Times by Marjorie Rowling The Quakers in particular were early leaders of abolitionism, and in keeping with this tradition they denounced slavery at least as early as 1688. In 1787 the Society for Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade was formed, and 9 of its 12 founding members were Quakers; William Wilberforce, an early supporter of the society, went on to push through the 1807 Slave Trade Act, striking a major blow against the Atlantic slave trade. Leaders of Methodism and Presbyterianism also vehemently denounced human bondage,Thoughts Upon Slavery, John Wesley, Published in the year 1774, John Wesley: Holiness of Heart and Life, 1996 Ruth A. DaughertyCharles G. Finney, Memoirs (New York: A.S. Barnes, 1876), 324Wylie, Samuel Brown, D.D., Memoir of Alexander McLeod, D.D., New York (New York: Charles Scribner, 145 Nassau Street, 1855), 51 convincing their congregations to do likewise; Methodists and Presbyterians subsequently made the repudiation of slavery a condition of membership. In the Southern United States, however, support for slavery was strong; anti-slavery literature was prevented from passing through the postal system, and even the transcripts of sermons, by the famed English preacher Charles Spurgeon, were burned due to their censure of slavery.The Christian Cabinet, Dec. 14 1859 When the American Civil War broke out, slavery became one of the issues which would be decided by its outcome; the southern defeat led to a constitutional ban on slavery. Despite the general emancipation of slaves, members of fringe white Protestant groups like the Christian Identity movement, and the Ku Klux Klan (a white supremacist group) see the enslavement of Africans as a positive aspect of American history. =Slave Christianity= In the United States, Christianity not only held views about slavery but also on how slaves practiced their own form of Christianity. Prior to the work of Melville Herskovits in 1941, it was widely believed that all elements of African culture were destroyed by the horrific experiences of Africans who had been forced to come to the United States of America. Since his groundbreaking work, scholarship has found that Slave Christianity existed as an extraordinarily creative patchwork of African and Christian religious traditions.Charles H. Lippy, \\"Slave Christianity\\" in Modern Christianity to 1900: A People's History of Christianity, ed. Amanda Porterfield (Minneapolis: Fortress Press, 2007), 291-292. The slaves brought a wide variety of religious traditions with them including tribal shamanism and Islam. Beyond that, tribal traditions could vary to a high degree across the African continent. During the early eighteenth century, Anglican missionaries who attempted to bring Christianity to slaves in the Southern colonies often found themselves butting up against uncooperative masters and resistant slaves. An unquestionable obstacle to the acceptance of Christianity among slaves was their desire to continue to adhere to the religious beliefs and rituals of their African ancestors as much as possible. Missionaries who worked in the South were especially displeased with the slaves' retention of African practices such as polygamy and what they called idolatrous dancing. In fact, even blacks who embraced Christianity in America did not completely abandon the religion of the Old World. Instead, they engaged in syncretism, blending Christian influences with traditional African rites and beliefs. Symbols and objects, such as crosses, were conflated with charms which were carried by Africans in order to ward off evil spirits. Christ was interpreted as a healer who was similar to the priests of Africa. In the New World, fusions of African spirituality and Christianity led to distinctly new practices within slave populations, including voodoo or vodun in Haiti and Spanish Louisiana. Although African religious influences were also important among Northern blacks, the exposure to Old World religions was more intense in the South, where the density of the black population was higher. There were, however, some commonalities across the majority of tribal traditions. Perhaps the primary understanding of tribal traditions was the commonly-held belief that there was no separation of the sacred and the secular.Charles H. Lippy, \\"Slave Christianity\\" in Modern Christianity to 1900: A People's History of Christianity, ed. Amanda Porterfield (Minneapolis: Fortress Press, 2007), 295. All life was sacred and the supernatural was present in every facet and focus of life. Most tribal traditions highlighted this experience of the supernatural in ecstatic experiences of the supernatural which were brought on by ritual song and dance. Repetitious music and dancing were often used to bring on these experiences through the use of drums and chanting. These experiences were realized in the \\"possession\\" of a worshipper in which one is not only taken over by the divine but actually becomes one with the divine. Echoes of African tribal traditions can be seen in the Christianity that was practiced by slaves in the Americas. The songs, dances, and ecstatic experiences of traditional tribal religions were Christianized and practiced by slaves in what is called the \\"Ring Shout.\\" Charles H. Lippy, \\"Slave Christianity\\" in Modern Christianity to 1900: A People's History of Christianity, ed. Amanda Porterfield (Minneapolis: Fortress Press, 2007), 299-300. This practice was a major mark of African American Christianity during the slavery period. Christianity came to the slaves of North America more slowly. Many colonial slaveholders feared that baptizing slaves would lead to emancipation because of vague laws that concerned the slave status of Christians under British colonial rule. Even after 1706, by which time many states had passed laws that stated that baptism would not alter a slave's status, slaveholders continued to believe that the catechization of slaves wouldn't be a wise economic choice. Slaves usually had one day off each week, usually Sunday. They used that time to grow their own crops, dance and sing (doing such things on the Sabbath was frowned upon by most preachers), so there was little time for slaves to receive religious instruction. During the antebellum period, slave preachers - enslaved or formally enslaved evangelists - became instrumental in shaping slave Christianity. They preached a gospel which was radically different from the gospel which was preached by white preachers, who often used Christianity in an attempt to make slaves more complacent with their enslaved status. Instead of focusing on obedience, slave preachers placed a greater emphasis on the Old Testament, especially on the Book of Exodus. They likened the plight of the American slaves to the plight of the enslaved Hebrews of the Bible, instilling hope into the hearts of those who were enslaved. Slave preachers were instrumental in shaping the religious landscape of African Americans for decades to come.Dennard, David C. \\"Religion in the quarters: a study of slave preachers in the antebellum South, 1800-1860.\\" (1984): 3465-3465. Islam According to Bernard Lewis, slavery has been a part of Islam's history from its beginning. The Quran like the Old and the New Testaments, states Lewis, \\"assumes the existence of slavery\\". It attempts to regulate slavery and thereby implicitly accepts it. Muhammad and his Companions owned slaves, and some of them acquired slaves through conquests. The Quran does not forbid slavery, nor does it consider it as a permanent institution. In various verses, it refers to slaves as \\"necks\\" (raqabah) or \\"those whom your right hand possesses\\" (Ma malakat aymanukum). In addition to these terms for slaves, the Quran and early Islamic literature uses 'Abd (male) and Amah (female) term for an enslaved and servile possession, as well as other terms. According to Brockopp, seven separate terms for slaves appear in the Quran, in at least twenty nine Quranic verses., Quote: \\"Slaves are mentioned in at least twenty-nine verses of the Qur æƒÅn, most of these are Medinan and refer to the legal status of slaves. Seven separate terms refer to slaves, the most common of which is the phrase ‚Äúthat which your/their right hands own‚Äù (mƒÅ malakat aymƒÅnukum/aymƒÅnuhum/aymƒÅnuhunna/yamƒ´nuka), found in fifteen places.\\" The Quran assigns the same spiritual value to a slave as to a free man,Gordon, Murray. Slavery in the Arab World (p. 35). New Amsterdam Books. Kindle Edition. Quote: \\"At a spiritual level, the slave was possessed of the same value as a freeman.\\" and a believing slave is regarded as superior to a free pagan or idolator. The manumission of slaves is regarded as a meritorious act in the Quran, and is recommended either as an act of charity or as expiation for sins. While the spiritual value of a slave was the same as the freeman, states Forough Jahanbakhsh, in regards to earthly matters, a slave was not an equal to the freeman and relegated to an inferior status. In the Quran and for its many commentators, states Ennaji, there is a fundamental distinction between free Muslims and slaves, a basic constituent of its social organization, an irreparable dichotomy introduced by the existence of believers and infidels., Quote: \\"The Koran addresses with this statement the community of free Muslims, according to many commentators, thereby establishing a distinction between statuses. In Muslim society, slavery was one of the manifestations and fundamental constituents of the social organization. The very existence of believers and infidels irreparably induces the dichotomy between free men and slaves, two contradictory and complementary statuses. There could be no infidels without believers, no paradise without hell, no free men without slaves\\". The corpus of hadith attributed to Muhammad or his Companions contains a large store of reports enjoining kindness toward slaves. Chouki El Hamel has argued that the Quran recommends gradual abolition of slavery, and that some hadith are consistent with that message while others contradict it. According to Dror Ze'evi, early Islamic dogma set out to improve conditions of human bondage. It forbade enslavement of free members of Islamic society, including non-Muslims (dhimmis) residing under Islamic rule. Islam also allowed the acquisition of lawful non-Muslim slaves who were imprisoned, slaves purchased from lands outside the Islamic state, as well as considered the boys or girls born to slaves as slaves. Islamic law treats a free man and a slave unequally in sentencing for an equivalent crime. For example, traditional Sunni jurisprudence, with the exception of Hanafi law, objects to putting a free man to death for killing a slave. A slave who commits a crime may receive the same punishment as a free man, a punishment half as severe, or the master may be responsible for paying the damages, depending on the crime. According to Ze'evi, Islam considered the master to own the slave's labor, a slave to be his master's property to be sold or bought at will, and that the master was entitled to slave's sexual submission. The Islamic law (sharia) allows the taking of infidels (non-Muslims) as slaves, during religious wars also called holy wars or jihad. In the early Islamic communities, according to Kecia Ali, \\"both life and law were saturated with slaves and slavery\\". War, tribute from vassal states, purchase and children who inherited their parent's slavery were the sources of slaves in Islam., Quote: \\"Islam and Slavery. (...) Slaves were obtained through purchase, conquest, and as tribute from vassal states. Children of slaves were also slaves.\\" In Islam, according to Paul Lovejoy, \\"the religious requirement that new slaves be pagans and need for continued imports to maintain slave population made Africa an important source of slaves for the Islamic world.\\" Slavery of non-Muslims, followed by the structured process of converting them to Islam then encouraging the freeing of the converted slave, states Lovejoy helped the growth of Islam after its conquests.; Quote: \\"In Islamic tradition, slavery was perceived as a means of converting non-Muslims. One task of the master was religious instruction and theoretically Muslims could not be enslaved. Conversion (of a non-Muslim to Islam) did not automatically lead to emancipation, but assimilation into Muslim society was deemed a prerequisite for emancipation (...)\\" According to Mohammed Ennaji, the ownership gave the master a right \\"to punish one's slave\\". In Islam, a child inherited slavery if he or she was born to a slave mother and slave father. However, if the child was born to a slave mother and her owner master, then the child was free. Slaves could be given as property (dower) during marriage. The text encourages Muslim men to take slave women as sexual partners (concubines), or marry them. Islam, states Lewis, did not permit Dhimmis (non-Muslims) \\"to own Muslim slaves; and if a slave owned by a dhimmi embraced Islam, his owner was legally obliged to free or sell him\\". There was also a gradation in the status on the slave, and his descendants, after the slave converted to Islam.; Quote: \\"They [Dhimmis] were not permitted to own Muslim slaves; and if a slave owned by a dhimmi embraced Islam, his owner was legally obliged to free or sell him.\\" (...) \\"Non-Muslims are of course excluded. But that is not all. A convert is not as good as the son of a convert; the son of a convert is not as good as the grandson of a convert. Here too the rule is limited to three generations, after which all are equal in their Islam\\". Under Islamic law, in \\"what might be called civil matters\\", a slave was \\"a chattel with no legal powers or rights whatsoever\\", states Lewis. A slave could not own or inherit property or enter into a contract. However, he was better off in terms of rights than Greek or Roman slaves.; Quote: \\"In what might be called civil matters, the slave was a chattel with no legal powers or rights whatsoever. He could not enter into a contract, hold property or inherit. If he incurred a fine, his owner was responsible. He was, however, distinctly better off, in the matter of rights, than a Greek or Roman slave\\" According to Chirag Ali, the early Muhammadans misinterpreted the Quran as sanctioning \\"polygamy, arbitrary divorce, slavery, concubinage and religious wars\\", and he states that the Quranic injunctions are against all this. According to Ron Shaham and other scholars, the various jurisprudence systems on Sharia such as Maliki, Hanafi, Shafi'i, Hanbali and others differ in their interpretation of the Islamic law on slaves. Slaves were particularly numerous in Muslim armies. Slave armies were deployed by Sultans and Caliphs at various medieval era war fronts across the Islamic Empires, playing an important role in the expansion of Islam in Africa and elsewhere. Slavery of men and women in Islamic states such as the Ottoman Empire, states Ze'evi, continued through the early 20th-century. Bah√° º√≠ Faith Bah√°'u'll√°h, founder of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith, commended Queen Victoria for abolishing the slave trade in a letter written to Her Majesty between 1868‚Äì1872. Bah√°'u'll√°h also forbids slavery in the Kit√°b-i-Aqdas written around 1873 considered by Bah√° º√≠s to be the holiest book revealed by Bah√°'u'll√°h in which he states, \\"It is forbidden you to trade in slaves, be they men or women.\\" Both the B√°b and Bah√°'u'll√°h owned slaves of African descent before the writing of the Kitab-i-Aqdas. While the B√°b purchased several slaves, Bah√°'u'll√°h acquired his through inheritance and freed them. Bah√°'u'll√°h officially condemned slavery in 1874. 21st century scholarship has found that the B√°b credited one of the slaves of his elders as having raised him and compares him favorably with his own father. Work has continued on other recent finds in archives such as a very early document of Bah√°'u'll√°h's explaining his emancipating his slave because as all humans are symbolically slaves of God none can be owned by another saying \\"How, then, can this thrall claim for himself ownership of any other human being? Nay,‚Ä¶.\\" Hinduism The term \\"dasa\\" (dƒÅsa) in ancient Hindu text is loosely translated as \\"slave.\\" However, the meaning of the term varied over time. R. S. Sharma, in his 1958 book, for example, states that the only word which could possibly mean slave in Rigveda is dƒÅsa, and this sense of use is traceable to four later verses in Rigveda. The term dƒÅsa in the Rigveda, has been also been translated as a servant or enemy, and the identity of this term remains unclear and disputed among scholars. The word dƒÅsi is found in Rigveda and Atharvaveda, states R.S. Sharma, which he states represented \\"a small servile class of women slaves\\". Slavery in the Vedic period, according to him, was mostly confined to women employed as domestic workers. He translates dasi in a Vedic era Upanishad as \\"maid-servant\\". Male slaves are rarely mentioned in the Vedic texts. The word dƒÅsa occurs in the Hindu Sruti texts Aitareya and Gopatha Brahmanas, but not in the sense of a slave. Towards the end of the Vedic period (600 BCE), a new system of varnas had appeared, with people called shudras replacing the erstwhile dasas. Some of the shudras were employed as labouring masses on farm land, much like \\"helots of Sparta\\", even though they were not treated with the same degree of coercion and contempt. They could be given away as gifts along with the land, which came in for criticism from the religious texts ƒÄ≈õvalƒÅyana and KƒÅtyƒÅyana ≈örautas≈´tras. The term dasa was now employed to designate such enslaved people. Slavery arose out of debt, sale by parents or oneself (due to famines), judicial decree or fear. The slaves were differentiated by origin and different disabilities and rules for manumission applied. While this could happen to a person of any varna, shudras were much more likely to be reduced to slavery. The Arthashastra laid down norms for the State to resettle shudra cultivators into new villages and providing them with land, grain, cattle and money. It also stated that aryas could not be subject to slavery and that the selling or mortgaging of a shudra was punishable unless he was a born slave. In the territories controlled by the East India Company, in South Asia, an adaptation of a Dharma≈õƒÅstra named Manusmriti, and specifically an interpretation of verse 8.415 of the Manusmriti,Manusmriti with the Commentary of Medhatithi by Ganganatha Jha, 1920, was used to regulate the practice in Hindu communities, via what became known as the Hindu law.John Griffith (1986), What is legal pluralism?, The Journal of Legal Pluralism and Unofficial Law, Volume 18, Issue 24, pages 1-55 Buddhism In Pali language Buddhist texts, Amaya-dasa has been translated by Davids and Stede in 1925, as a \\"slave by birth\\",Thomas William Rhys Davids, William Stede (2015 Reprint, Original: 1925), Pali- English Dictionary, 2nd Edition, Motilal Banarsidass, , page 104 Kila-dasa translated as a \\"bought slave\\",Thomas William Rhys Davids, William Stede (2015 Reprint, Original: 1925), Pali-English Dictionary, 2nd Edition, Motilal Banarsidass, , page 217 and Amata-dasa as \\"one who sees Amata (Sanskrit: Amrita, nectar of immortality) or Nibbana\\".Thomas William Rhys Davids, William Stede (2015 Reprint, Original: 1925), Pali-English Dictionary, 2nd Edition, Motilal Banarsidass, , page 73 However, dasa in ancient texts can also mean \\"servant\\".Gregory Schopen (2004), Buddhist Monks and Business Matters, University of Hawaii Press, , page 201 Words related to dasa are found in early Buddhist texts, such as dƒÅso na pabbƒÅjetabbo, which Davids and Stede translate as \\"the slave cannot become a Bhikkhu\\".Thomas William Rhys Davids and William Stede (2015 Reprint, Original: 1925), Pali-English Dictionary, 2nd Edition, Motilal Banarsidass, , page 320 This restriction on who could become a Buddhist monk is found in Vinaya Pitakam i.93, Digha Nikaya, Majjhima NikƒÅya, Tibetan Bhiksukarmavakya and Upasampadajnapti.Gregory Schopen (2010), On Some Who Are Not Allowed to Become Buddhist Monks or Nuns: An Old List of Types of Slaves or Unfree Laborers, Journal of the American Oriental Society, Vol. 130, No. 2, pages 225-234 Schopen states that this translation of dasa as slave is disputed by scholars.Gregory Schopen (2010), On Some Who Are Not Allowed to Become Buddhist Monks or Nuns: An Old List of Types of Slaves or Unfree Laborers, Journal of the American Oriental Society, Vol. 130, No. 2, page 226 Early Buddhist texts in Pali, according to R. S. Sharma, mention dƒÅsa and kammakaras, and they show that those who failed to pay their debts were enslaved, and Buddhism did not allow debtors and slaves to join their monasteries. The Buddhist Emperor Ashoka banned slavery and renounced war.The Multimedia Encyclopedia of Women in Today's World, p.130, SAGE publication, Mary Zeiss Stange, Carol K. Oyster, Jane E. Sloan Medieval Buddhist states codified slavery, combining local customary practices with derivatives of the Vedic Manusmriti. The series of Theravada Buddhist states covering Burma and North West India observed the 14 kinds of slavery set out in the Wareru Dhammathat, while Slavery in Bhutan was regulated into the mid 20th century by a local derivation of the Tibetan Buddhism Tsa Yig Chenmo. Sikh Religion Guru Nanak, first Guru of Sikhs, preached against slavery. He not only advocated human equality, by rejecting class inequalities and caste hierarchy, but also practically promoted it through the institution of Pangat and Sangat. Baba Farid also protested against slavery. See also Notes References ; Sources  * *Lal, K. S. (1994). Muslim slave system in medieval India. New Delhi: Aditya Prakashan.

It occupies a strategic position on an isthmus between Loch Lochy to the east, and Loch Arkaig to the west. The settlement has a long association with Clan Cameron: Sir Ewen Cameron of Lochiel built the original Achnacarry Castle in about 1655. This was destroyed by government troops after the Battle of Culloden, but \\"New Achnacarry\\" was built near the same site in Scottish Baronial style in 1802. In the Second World War it housed the Commando Basic Training Centre and the village retains close ties to British Commandos, the United States Army Rangers and similar units from other allied nations. In 1928, the Achnacarry Agreement was signed, an early attempt to set petroleum production quotas. Geography Achnacarry is not far from the village of Spean Bridge and about north of the town of Fort William. It has been described by Queen Victoria as follows: \\"As you approach Achnacarry, which lies rather low, but is surrounded by very fine trees, the luxuriance of the tangled woods, surmounted by rugged hills, becomes finer and finer till you come to Loch Arkaig, a little over from the house. This is a very lovely loch, reminding one of Loch Katrine, especially where there is a little pier, from which we embarked on board a very small but nice screw steamer which belongs to Cameron of Lochiel.\\"‚ÄîRoyal Visit to Achnacarry, from the Journal of Queen Victoria, Friday, 12 September 1873. Between Achnacarry Castle and Loch Arkaig is a path of interwoven trees known as The Dark Mile, or Mile Dorcha. History =Original castle= Ewen \\"Eoghainn MacAilein\\" Cameron, XIII Chief of Clan Cameron, built the highly disputed Tor Castle (said to have been on Clan Mackintosh lands) in the early 16th century. Tor Castle would remain the seat of the Camerons of Lochiel until demolished by his great-great-great grandson, Sir Ewen \\"Dubh\\" Cameron, XVII Chief. Sir Ewen Cameron wanted a \\"more convenient\\" house, which was further removed from the Clan Mackintosh, Clan Campbell and Oliver Cromwell's garrison at Inverlochy Castle. He built Achnacarry Castle in around 1655 in a strategic position on the isthmus between Loch Lochy and Loch Arkaig. One of the few remaining descriptions relate that Lochiel's seat was \\"a large house, all built of fir-planks, the handsomest of that kind in Britain.\\" Sir Ewen's bard described the home somewhere around 1663 in song as \\"The generous house of feasting...Pillared hall of princes...Where wine goes round freely in gleaming glasses...Music resounding under its rafters.\\" Others portrayed \\"old\\" Achnacarry as a \\"man's home,\\" with the feel and look of a grand hunting lodge amidst the West Highlands. In 1665 the Stand-off at the Fords of Arkaig took place near Achnacarry, which saw the Camerons finally end their 360-year feud with the Chattan Confederation led by the Clan Mackintosh. Modern reprint of November 1883 article with a detailed account of Cameron history from 1654 to 1665. With Sir Ewen's death in the early 18th century his son John Cameron became Clan Chief, soon after which his son, Donald would assume Achnacarry when Lord Lochiel (as his father was known) fled into exile in Flanders after the first Jacobite Uprising. From Donald Cameron (\\"The Gentle Lochiel\\") XIX Chief we find the best description of the grounds of Achnacarry. In his marriage contract a requirement was placed in which Lochiel had to build his wife \\"a house...to the value of 100 pounds sterling at least, with gardens, office houses [privies], lands, other conveniencys.\\" Donald was planting a long line of beech trees near the banks of the River Arkaig when word of \\"Bonnie Prince Charlie's\\" landing arrived in 1745...it would be the last landscaping done at Achnacarry Castle for years to come. With the Jacobite army's defeat at the Battle of Culloden in April 1746 the clans retreated into the Scottish Highlands, with Donald taking the lead in re-grouping them. After this last attempt at resistance failed, he and his men took to the mountains. On May 28, 1746, Donald watched as men from Bligh's Regiment under the command of Lt-Col Edward Cornwallis and an Independent Company of Munros, commanded by George Munro, 1st of Culcairn, burned Achnacarry to the ground. Many valued relics and personal possessions were relocated beforehand, but the great fir-planked \\"Old\\" Achnacarry was left in ashes. =Current Achnacarry Castle= In 1802 Achnacarry, which had spent the last fifty or so years in ruin, was rebuilt under Donald Cameron, XXII Chief of Clan Cameron as a Scottish baronial style home, although this \\"New Achnacarry\\" is still referred to as a castle. His wife Anne n√©e Abercromby engaged James Gillespie as architect. In 1928 Achnacarry served as the meeting place for global petroleum producers in an effort to set production quotas. A document known as the Achnacarry Agreement or \\"As-Is\\" Agreement was signed on 17 September 1928. 18 August 1928 draft of the Achnacarry Agreement. Second World War Commandos cross a river on a 'toggle bridge' under simulated artillery fire January 1943 Commando Memorial The current building and the surrounding estate gained fame as the Commando Training Depot for the Allied Forces from March 1942 to 1945. British Commandos, United States Army Rangers and commandos from France, the Netherlands, Norway, Czechoslovakia, Poland and Belgium trained there. Each training course culminated in an \\"opposed landing\\" exercise around the area of nearby Bunarkaig on Loch Lochy. As live ammunition was used, there were some casualties whilst training at Achnacarry. Some 25,000 commandos completed training at the centre during the four years it was in use. The castle also suffered some damage due to fire. Several military associations still sponsor a Commando march either annually or from time to time. Generally it is a timed march, in full battle gear, backpack and combat boots, from Spean Bridge (site of the striking Commando Memorial) to Achnacarry.Achnacarry Speed March 2008Commando Speed March Post Second World War In August 2001, Achnacarry served as the site of the International Gathering of Clan Cameron, commemorating the 50th anniversary of Colonel Sir Donald Hamish Cameron of Lochiel, K.T., XXVI Chief of Clan Cameron.

Her husband, journalist Georgiy Gongadze, was abducted and murdered in 2000. Since then she has been a prominent advocate for freedom of the press and protection of the safety of reporters in Ukraine, and has continued to work for justice in the case of her husband's murder. Biography and Career Myroslava Petryshyn () was born on June 19, 1972, in Berezhany, Ternopil Oblast, Ukraine. She earned a master's degree in civic law from Lviv University (completed in 1997), and in the early 1990s worked as a legal consultant for local government agencies. During the early 1990s, Petryshyn became involved in journalism and Ukrainian politics. In 1993 she was a specialist in the information department of the journal Post-Postup. In 1994 and 1995 she served as deputy director and director of the press center for the New Wave political alliance (). During 1995 she was the head of the media department for the International Media Center STB (), and in 1998 was the head of public relations for the daily newspaper Day (). At the same time, Petryshyn became active in filmmaking . She was assistant director of Georgiy Gongadze's documentary short film Shadows of War (, 1993) about the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict and executive producer of Dream Defenders (, 1996). Myroslava Petryshyn was married to Georgiy Gongadze in 1995, and their twin daughters were born in 1997. Along with her husband, Myroslava Gongadze continued to work in journalistic projects opposed to the administration of President Leonid Kuchma. In 2000, Georgiy Gongadze was kidnapped and brutally murdered. Secret tape recordings provided by one of the president's bodyguards and released by opposition politicians implicated Kuchma in the crime. The resulting political controversy became known as the cassette scandal, damaged Kuchma's popularity and laid part of the groundwork for the Orange Revolution of 2004. It also brought Myroslava Gongadze to greater prominence as a campaigner for democracy, human rights, and freedom of the press in Ukraine.

She also maintains that the atmosphere of fear and uncertainty, as well as the incomplete and contradictory information provided during the investigation, forced her to leave the country and caused her suffering, contrary to Article 3 (prohibition of inhuman and degrading treatment) of the Convention. On 31 March 2005, the court declared her complaint admissible and thereby agreed to pursue her case against the State of Ukraine. On 9 November 2005, the European Court of Human Rights passed its judgement in case of Myroslava Gongadze vs Ukraine in favor of the late journalist's widow. Under the Court's ruling, Ukraine has violated articles 2, 3, 13 and 41 of the European Convention on Human Rights by the Ukrainian power's failure to protect the right to life of the applicant's husband, Georgiy Gongadze.European Court of Human Rights: judgment in the case of Gongadze v. Ukraine, Council of Europe information Office in Georgia (9 November 2005) According to the judgement, the investigation was not adequate and caused many moral traumas to the applicant.

The Gongadze murder trial began on 9 January 2006, in Kiev. Three former policemen are charged with the killing of Georgiy Gongadze. Another suspect, ex-police general Oleksiy Pukach, who had been believed to have fled abroad but was found in Ukraine in 2009 living under his real name, was arrested and charged. On the day the trial started, Myroslava Gongadze commented on the fact that no one has been charged for ordering the killing: \\"They are known and they should be punished just the same as those who will be sitting in the dock today\\".

The coat of arms of the city of Johannesburg is displayed in the centre of the flag on a green panel in the centre of a heraldic fret on a white disk on a black background.

It was an engagement between Confederate and Union forces during the American Civil War. The battle resulted in a Confederate victory and led directly to the official establishing of a Confederate Arizona Territory, consisting of the southern portion of the New Mexico Territory. The victory paved the way for the Confederate New Mexico Campaign the following year. Background Following the secession of Texas in February 1861 and its joining the Confederacy, a battalion of the 2nd Texas Mounted Rifles under Lieutenant Colonel John R. Baylor was sent to occupy the series of forts along the western Texas frontier which had been abandoned by the Union Army. Baylor's orders from the Department of Texas commander, Colonel Earl Van Dorn, allowed him to advance into New Mexico in order to attack the Union forts along the Rio Grande if he thought the situation called for such measures. Convinced that the Union force at Fort Fillmore would soon attack, Baylor decided to take the initiative and launch an attack of his own. Leaving during the night of July 23, Baylor arrived in Mesilla the next night, preparing to launch a surprise attack the next morning. However, a Confederate deserter informed the fort's commander, Major Isaac Lynde, of the plans. The next day, Baylor led his battalion across the Rio Grande into Mesilla, to the cheers of the population. A company of Arizona Confederates joined Baylor here, and were convinced to muster into the Confederate Army. On July 25, leaving a small force behind to guard the fort, Lynde led 380 Regulars to the village to drive out Baylor. Battle John Baylor Lynde approached the town with his command and demanded Baylor's surrender. When Baylor refused, Lynde deployed his men into a skirmish line and opened fire with his mountain howitzers. The infantry was ordered to advance but heavy sand and corn fields interfered with this attack. Lynde then ordered his cavalry, three companies of the Regiment of Mounted Rifles, to charge Baylor's men. The Confederates shot many of the Union soldiers during this time, which disorganized the attack. The Union assault was repulsed, and both sides began skirmishing at long range. Lynde reformed his command but decided to retreat back to the fort, with the Confederates troops and armed Arizona citizens in pursuit. Lynde lost a disputed three to thirteen men killed and two officers and four men wounded, while Baylor lost a disputed two dead and seven seriously wounded with twenty horses killed. Aftermath At sunset the next day, Baylor ordered his artillery and more cavalry to reinforce him, while the rest of his command moved into position to attack the fort the next day. During the same night, the Confederates captured 85 of the fort's horses, which formed most of the fort's transportation. Fearing an attack the next day, Lynde abandoned Fort Fillmore after destroying the ammunition and supplies in the citadel. He retreated northeast towards Fort Stanton across the dry Organ Mountains via San Augustin Pass. Many Union troops apparently had filled their canteens with the fort's medicinal whiskey instead of water, hardly wise for a summertime march across desert country. The Organ Mountains. During the pursuit the following day, the Confederates were able to capture dozens of straggling Federals. Lynde's dehydrated command, reduced to 100 men by this time, was overtaken by the Confederates, some of whom used a pass (later known as Baylor Pass) to intercept them. They were forced to surrender at San Augustine Springs on July 27. The prisoners were paroled, and Baylor concentrated his battalion at the fort. He was able to refit his command with the captured Springfield rifles and other captured equipment. The Confederate victory at Mesilla actualized local overtures towards secession, which had been ratified by two conventions in March 1861. On August 1 Baylor declared the establishment of an organized Confederate Arizona Territory, consisting of the portion of the New Mexico Territory south of the 34th parallel north. Baylor installed himself as the new territory's military governor, and declared martial law. Baylor's success at Mesilla led to Henry Hopkins Sibley's ambitious New Mexico Campaign the following February. On 25 November 1861 Major Lynde was, by direction of the President of the United States, dropped from the Army rolls for \\"abandoning his post ‚Äî Fort Fillmore, N. Mex. ‚Äî on the 27th of July, 1861, and subsequently surrendering his command to an inferior force of insurgents\\". See also *Apache Wars References * Frazier, Donald S.

It closely resembles the Irrawaddy dolphin (of the same genus, Orcaella) and was not described as a separate species until 2005. The closest relative to the genus Orcaella is the killer whale, Orcinus orca. The Australian snubfin has three colors on its skin, while the Irrawaddy dolphin only has two. The skull and the fins also show minor differences between the two species. Taxonomy The taxonomic specific name, heinsohni, was chosen in honor of George Heinsohn, an Australian biologist who worked at James Cook University, \\"for his pioneering work on northeast Australian odontocetes, including the collection and initial analysis of Orcaella heinsohni specimens which form the basis for much of our knowledge of the new species\\". New species of large mammals are quite rarely described nowadays, and those that are usually are from remote areas ‚Äî such as the saola - or are otherwise rarely encountered, see for example Perrin's beaked whale, or the spade-toothed whale, which is only known from two complete specimens and a few bones cast ashore. In fact, the Australian snubfin was the first new dolphin species to be described in 56 years, but was followed, in 2011, by the discovery and description of the Burrunan dolphin (T. australis), also from the Australian continent. The Australian snubfin dolphin is unusual among recently described mammals in that a population is accessible for scientific study. Nonetheless, the existence of snubfin dolphins in the waters of northern Australia had only become known in 1948, when a skull was found at Melville Bay (Gove Peninsula, Northern Territory). This individual apparently had been caught and eaten by aboriginals. However, the discovery remained unnoted until discussed by Johnson (1964), and soon thereafter a Dutch skipper had his observations of the then-unrecognized species published. The common name \\"snubfin dolphin\\" was suggested in 1981 and highlights a diagnostic external character and has previously been used in field guides for identification. Two scientists, Isabel Beasley of James Cook University and Peter Arnold of Museum of Tropical Queensland, took DNA samples from the population of dolphins off the coast of Townsville, Queensland, and sent them to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Southwest Fisheries Science Center in La Jolla, California. The results showed George Heinsohn was correct in his hypothesis that the Townsville population was a new species. The holotype QM JM4721 (JUCU MM61) is the skull and some other bones of an adult male found drowned in a shark net at Horseshoe Bay, Queensland, on 21 April 1972. It was about 11 years old at the time of its death. Description A species of delphinid in the genus, Orcaella, which contains one other species, the Irrawaddy dolphin Orcaella brevirostris, O. heinsohni females can reach lengths of and males can reach . Australian snubfin dolphins are subtly tricoloured: brownish on the top, lighter brown along the sides, and a white belly; the Irrawaddy dolphin, on the other hand, is uniformly slate grey except for the white belly. The new species has a rounded forehead, very unlike other dolphin species in Australia, and the very small, \\"snubby\\" dorsal fin distinguishes it from other dolphins in its range. The lack of a groove on each side of the back and the presence of a neck crease further distinguishes this species from its relative. Tail flukes also have an identifiable jagged trailing edge that can help distinguish it from other species of delphinids. The number of nasal bones in each side of a snub fin dolphin's skull vertex varies from none to six. There is a poorly developed mesthemoid plate. In the upper jaw there are roughly 11‚Äì22 teeth in each half, and in the lower jaw there are roughly 14‚Äì19 teeth in each half.  Life history  In a study of Australian snubfin dolphins consisting of 18 individuals, it was determined the approximate life span is around 30 years. However, since sightings are so rare, a lot remains unknown about many about this species. Gestation is estimated to be around 11 months based on rates of similar species. Behavior Much remains unknown about the ecology and behaviors of the Australian snubfin dolphin. Australian snubfin dolphins have a varied diet, eating a range of fish, shrimp and cephalopods (squid, cuttlefish and octopus). They are found in small groups of about 2‚Äì6, but larger groups (up to 14 individuals) have also been observed. Populations are usually smaller than 150 individuals. Some instances long-term sociability has been observed among individuals off the coast of Queensland, Australia. Grouping associations seem to be strongest among male individuals implying some potential correlation to reproductive strategy. Additionally, there was an observation of snubfin dolphins displaying mating courtship between Australian humpback dolphins.Annalisa Berta, 2015, Whales, Dolphins, and Porpoises - A Natural History and Species Guide, Both the Australian snubfin dolphin and the Australian humpback dolphin co-occur throughout much of the tropical Northern waters of Australia, and have similar vocal repertoires consisting of click trains, burst pulses, and whistles. As a member of the suborder odontoceti, much of these vocalizations are thought to be associated with echolocation for both navigation and foraging. They produce clicks of short durations with high peaks, making their clicks distinguishable from other odontocetes. Snub fin dolphins have also been observed interacting with Australian humpback dolphins, and one case of a hybrid between the two species was documented using DNA analysis in 2014. Australian snubfin dolphins have been observed to spit jets of water across the surface of the water as a potential feeding strategy. Jets of water appear to cause fish to leap from the water towards the dolphin, making them easier prey targets. = Feeding = Off the coast of Queensland, Australia, the Australian snubfin dolphin predominantly feeds in coastal-estuarine waters. There is a predominance of feeding activity by rivers and areas off the coast of Cleveland bay. Australian snubfin dolphins have also been seen foraging and then following passing by fish trawlers to capitalize on an opportunity for prey. They can be classified as opportunistic feeders and have been seen congregating to feed in groups. Being opportunistic feeders snubfins consume a large array of prey items. Snubfin dolphin consume a wide array of prey, that can be narrowed down to coastal, estuarine, and reef‚Äêassociated fishes throughout the water column and at the bottom. The most common prey items by specie are cardinal fish (Apogon), proceeded by the cuttlefish (Sepia), the squid Uroteuthis (Photololigo), and the toothpony fish (Gazza). Another big part of the snubfin diet are cephalopods. Range and status The snubfin dolphin is considered endemic to Australia. In the Pacific Ocean off Townsville, about 200 individual snubfin dolphins were found. The range of the species is expected to extend to Papua New Guinea; that is, O. heinsohni is endemic to the northern half of the Sahul Shelf, but the majority live in Australian waters. They are found all along the northern coasts of Australia, from Broome, Western Australia, to the Brisbane River in Southeast Queensland. They are not thought to be common, and are being given a high conservation priority. Australian snubfin dolphins are currently listed as \\"vulnerable\\" by the IUCN. Habitat range has primarily been determined through visual sightings and stranding data, limiting the range to areas accessible by humans. Pacific acoustic monitoring methods are being deployed to attempt to more accurately determine the range of these animals by listening for their distinctive echolocation clicks. Threats Although some hunting by indigenous people occurs (as evidenced by the 1948 specimen), this is likely to be insignificant compared to other threats such as drowning in sharknets and fishing gear. Snubfins are particularly at risk from incidental capture in gillnets, which are often placed in near-shore areas and near the mouths of rivers, where these dolphins are more likely to be found. Although it is not known how many dolphins die in this manner, it is considered to be the greatest threat to populations in Papua New Guinea. Anti-shark nets and drumlines put in place for Queensland's shark control program are also a significant threat to snubfins, with about 1.8 snubfin dolphins killed every year between 1997 and 2011. The coastal zones along the Australian snubfin dolphin's range have been highly modified for mining and agricultural purposes as well as ports, aquaculture and residential development. Land reclamation, vessel traffic and construction results in the degradation of the snubfin's natural habitat through increased noise, lower water quality and a reduction in food supply, in addition to direct loss of habitat areas due to land reclamation. This can result in decreased survival rates and/or emigration in search of better resources. Pollution is another threat to snubfin dolphins, as the water discharge from rivers in the dolphins' Australian range are contaminated by industrial and agricultural runoff. The snubfin dolphins' strong site fidelity means they are likely exposed to pollutants on a daily basis. Indeed, one study of snubfins on the Great Barrier Reef found levels of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) far exceeding the thresholds for small cetaceans, over which reproductive anomalies and immunosuppression can occur. Periodic floods present a temporary threat to snubfin dolphins in that they result in an increase in freshwater discharge, heavy metals, nutrients, sediment and pesticides in coastal areas. Increases in floods, cyclone severity, storm surges and sea surface temperatures due to climate change will likely also affect the habitat and future food supply of snubfin dolphins. As a result of the cumulative effects of drowning as bycatch and habitat loss and degradation, the Australian snubfin dolphin population is believed to be decreasing and is likely to meet the criteria for IUCN's \\"endangered\\" status in the near future. As small populations are more vulnerable to extinction due to the small numbers and low genetic diversity, the snubfin dolphin is at significant risk in their human populated habitat. The insufficient data on the species poses additional threat as their general ecology is not fully understood. Conservation The Australian snubfin dolphin is listed on Appendix II\\"Appendix II \\" of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS). As amended by the Conference of the Parties in 1985, 1988, 1991, 1994, 1997, 1999, 2002, 2005 and 2008. Effective: 5 March 2009. of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS). It is listed on Appendix II as it has an unfavourable conservation status or would benefit significantly from international co- operation organised by tailored agreements. Australian snubfin dolphins are also listed as \\"vulnerable\\" by the IUCN. In addition, Australian snubfin dolphins are covered by Memorandum of Understanding for the Conservation of Cetaceans and Their Habitats in the Pacific Islands Region (Pacific Cetaceans MOU).Official webpage of the Memorandum of Understanding for the Conservation of Cetaceans and Their Habitats in the Pacific Islands Region See also *List of cetaceans *Marine biology *Environmental issues in Australia References Australian snubfin dolphin Category:Torres Strait Australian snubfin dolphin ","title":"Australian snubfin dolphin"},{"id":"2171973","text":"Quest for King Arthur is a 2004 History Channel production introduced by Ioan Gruffudd and narrated by Patrick Stewart.

Jenkins, 515 U.S. 70 (1995), is a case decided by the United States Supreme Court. On June 12, 1995 the Court, in a 5-4 decision, overturned a District Court ruling that required the state of Missouri to correct de facto racial inequality in schools by funding salary increases and remedial education programs. Background The case began in 1977 l, when the Kansas City, Missouri School District (KCMSD) sued the State of Missouri, federal agencies, and suburban districts around Kansas City on behalf of the district's students. The District Court then instead named the school district as a defendant. The courts held that the state of Missouri was liable for segregated schools within the boundaries of KCMSD. Originally, the school district wanted a \\"metropolitan plan,\\" which would have included bus transfers to even out the racial inequalities of inner-city and suburban schools. However, over the 18-year span of the case, the court ordered remedies that were focused instead on improving educational facilities and programs. In 1985, US District Court Judge Russell Clark ordered the legal remedy of educational improvement programs, school facility repairs, and magnet schools, which were thought to be the best way to attract white suburban students back into city schools. In 1987, the district courts ordered mandatory salary assistance, arguing that to end segregation in the schools the district needed higher-paid, quality teachers. In 1993, the district court ordered the state to pay for salary increases for teaching and non-teaching personnel. Decision The Supreme Court majority interpreted Brown v. Board of Education as restricting only de jure segregation and referred to Milliken v. Bradley and other precedents as applying only to intra-district desegregation. The Supreme Court argued that the lower courts had exceeded their authority in ordering measures such as across-the-board state-funded salary increases to fund continued quality education programs, which could not be sustained by local government. The Court looked to Board of Education of Oklahoma City Public Schools v. Dowell for the decisive question of \\"'whether the [constitutional violator] ha[s] complied in good faith with the desegregation decree since it was entered, and whether the vestiges of past discrimination ha[ve] been eliminated to the extent practicable.'\\" According to The Living Constitution, 3rd Revised Edition (Saul K. Padover, Revised by Jacob W. Landynski, 1995), the other issue involved was whether a federal court could order a local government to raise taxes above the state statute amount to cover the cost of removing the \\"vestiges of discrimination.\\" The Supreme Court ruled that while direct imposition of taxes is indeed beyond judicial authority, the district court may order the school district to levy the same tax: \\"Authorizing and directing local government institutions to devise and implement remedies not only protects the function of these institutions but, to the extent possible, also places the responsibility for solutions to the problems of segregation upon those themselves who have created the problem.\\" The Court also said, \\"To hold otherwise would fail to take account of the obligations of local governments, under the Supremacy Clause, to fulfill the requirements that the Constitution imposes upon them.\\" See also * List of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 515 * List of United States Supreme Court cases * Lists of United States Supreme Court cases by volume * List of United States Supreme Court cases by the Rehnquist Court References External links * Category:United States Supreme Court cases Category:United States Supreme Court cases of the Rehnquist Court Category:Legal history of Missouri Category:Education in Kansas City, Missouri Category:1995 in United States case law ","title":"Missouri v.
