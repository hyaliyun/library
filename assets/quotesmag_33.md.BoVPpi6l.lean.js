The father of Asiaticus was murdered on the orders of the Roman empress Valeria Messalina in 47 and the junior Asiaticus was later raised by his mother. Political career After serving as a Legatus of Gallia Belgica, he became the Roman governor of that province in the reign of the Roman emperor Nero.Wightman, Gallia Belgica, p. 61 In early 69 when Aulus Vitellius became Roman emperor, he was finding governors and commanders in the provinces as supporters for his emperorship who were genuinely enthusiastic.Morgan, 69 AD: The Year of Four Emperors, p. 81 Among those supporters was Asiaticus. When Vitellius was in the city of Lugdunum in Gaul, proclaiming his son and daughter as heirs from his wife Galeria Fundana, Vitellius betrothed his daughter Vitellia to Asiaticus. Asiaticus and Vitellia had married in the reign of Vitellius. He had become powerful through wealth and the skilful exploitation of imperial patronage. The alliance with Asiaticus and Vitellius was perhaps an attempt to reconcile the communities in Gaul with the Roman state. Asiaticus was unable to give Vitellius much support when the Roman army commanders appointed Vespasian as an alternative successor to Vitellius. When Vespasian became Roman emperor in the second half of 69, Asiaticus was appointed for a consulship in 70. Before he could serve his consulship in early 70, Asiaticus died.Epilogue: The Fall of the Vitellii - Vitellia?, daughter Asiaticus was survived by Vitellia and their son Marcus Lollius Paulinus Decimus Valerius Asiaticus Saturninus.Bowman, The Cambridge Ancient History, Volume 10, p. 217 Later in 70, Vespasian arranged for Vitellia to remarry another unnamed groom.

His music career began professionally in 2006 when he joined a mariachi street band on the world- famous Santa Cecilia square, where he practiced the Mexican music tradition, unnoticed until 2008. From 2008 Sotel√∫m performed live in many projects including Nortec Panoptica Orchestra, Pato Banton & The Ghostownians and Sotel√∫m & The Minarete Brass Orchestra (his own production). In early 2010, with the help of Pato Banton, Sotel√∫m founded Share The Light Music and launch his first studio LP; Minarete Brass an album that mixed Mexican folk music from the huasteca and tapatia regions with American standard styles like swing and jazz, clearly influenced by Herb Alpert & The Tijuana Brass. During Hanukkah 2011, Sotel√∫m released his first formal approach to electronic music with the exposure of his first studio EP; Synthetiklezmer a bold and experimental fusion between sephardic brass and klezmer with the drum machines and synthesizers that introduced him to the EDM scene. The EP counted with the special collaboration of Gustavo Bulgach, Argentine-American clarinetist and bandleader of Klezmer Juice and Yiddish Tango Club. In 2012, and after continuous collaborations with Big Javy from Inspector and Sonidero Travesura, Sotel√∫m released his second studio EP Huastech, a craft that mixed folk and electronic music heard in Synthetiklezmer, but this time with Mexican styles like mariachi and huasteca music. This material was produced and released in Guadalajara Mexico and many samples from Minarete Brass can be heard. In 2013, Sotel√∫m launched his third studio EP Share The Light, that exposes the same synth/folk previous proffers, but incorporating his own vocals and voice participations of the Mexican singer Linda Owlen and the Peruvian-Israeli singer Einat Schmal. In 2014, Sotel√∫m launched a eponymous compilation LP, Sotel√∫m.

The boat was an emergency cutter which was launched with only 12 people on board, including seven crew members, and had gained notoriety after the disaster. Early life and Titanic Symons was born in Weymouth, Dorset, England, son of Robert James Symons and Bessie Newman. He was one of thirteen children. Symons worked with Archie Jewell as a lookout on the Titanic. On the night of 14 April 1912, Symons and Jewell were replaced by their colleagues Reginald Lee and Frederick Fleet and off-duty when the iceberg struck the ship. Shortly afterwards, he was ordered to go up to boat deck and help with the task of loading the lifeboats. At around 1:00am, First Officer William McMaster Murdoch began to load Boat #1. Despite the orders of loading the boats with women and children first, Murdoch put Symons in charge of the lifeboat and loaded it with five stokers, Sir Cosmo Duff-Gordon, Lucy, Lady Duff-Gordon, her secretary and three other First-class passengers. The boat finally rowed away from the Titanic at 1:05am. It was picked by the RMS Carpathia hours later. On board the Carpathia, Symons stumbled upon his brother Jack who was a crew member of that ship. Later life After the sinking, he returned to Britain and married Mary Jane Bolt and they had two daughters. After the outbreak of World War I in 1914, Symons served for the Royal Naval Reserve.

Originally released as a tech demo titled Tiny & Big: Up That Mountain in March 2010,TASTY BETA DEMO RELEASE news - Tiny & Big: Grandpa's Leftovers - IndieDB the game was expanded into a full release, with the retail version appearing on Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X and Linux on June 19, 2012. Billed as a \\"jump and slice platformer,\\" the player is tasked with manipulating levels with a selection of tools to solve 3D environmental puzzles. The game's story focuses on Tiny, an inventor, on a mission to retrieve his prized possession, a magic-imbued pair of briefs left to him by his disappeared grandfather, from his \\"sandbox rival\\" Big, who intends to use them to rule the world.Steam: Tiny & Big: Grandpa's Leftovers Gameplay As Tiny, the player progresses through the game's levels using \\"the Tool,\\" an invention of Tiny's containing three key functions: a laser strong enough to cut through solid rock, a grappling rope for pulling objects toward the player, and a rocket for pushing items forward based on where on the item it lands. The combination of these actions forms the bulk of the gameplay, acting as the primary means of navigating the game's environments as well as being Tiny's main method of self-defense from attacks from Big. Tiny is also accompanied by the Radio, an artificial intelligence attached to a speaker in his rucksack; the Radio acts as a mentor to the player, providing prompts when needed to progress.Tiny and Big Tool and Gadgets news - Tiny & Big: Grandpa's Leftovers - IndieDB Plot As the game opens, Tiny and the Radio are traveling by taxi into the \\"mysterious desert,\\" where Tiny plans to confront Big over control of the Pants. The taxi is struck by an unknown object, leading the robotic driver to spin out of control and into a canyon. Tiny, unsettled by the crash but unscathed, collects his belongings from the crash site and attempts to continue on foot before being stopped by a cliff. Before getting the chance to think of an alternate way through, Big appears behind him, kicking him off of the cliff face. Tiny lands in front of a massive statue, which he uses the interior and exterior of to climb upward. Along the way Big uses his Pants-powered ability to leap long distances to taunt him, leading for the entire structure to collapse behind the two. Big reveals his plan to enter a nearby pyramid to strengthen his powers, and Tiny and the Radio give chase while Big uses the Pants' telekinesis with increasingly deadly force to keep them at bay, lifting the pyramid into the sky as the chase goes on. As Tiny and Radio pursue Big into the pyramid, they discover the origin of the Pants from the paintings on the walls of the pyramid. The Pants, which were once a normal pair of underwear, were struck by lightning and found by the Dotties, a race of mole-like creatures living in the ground; one of the creatures places the Pants on his head and gains superpowers from them, leading the others to worship him as a king. Under the eye of the leader, the Dotties are initially prosperous, forming a civilization with the pyramid and statue. Over time, though, the king is driven further into insanity by the Pants, eventually wiping out the entire population with their power. Meanwhile, Big discovers the king's throne and sits atop it, reactivating a set of pyres within the pyramid. Fearing the possibilities of what might happen if Big keeps the Pants, Tiny and the Radio enter the king's lair and destroy the pyres, which causes the pyramid to collapse on itself. Big and Tiny have a final duel atop the floating pieces of the pyramid, which culminates in Tiny slicing a boulder over Big's head, incapacitating him. As the wreckage of the pyramid lands, both boys wake up on the ground with the Pants laying near both over a Dottie hole. The two bicker over who their grandfather intended to be rightful owner of the pants, but before either gets the chance to grab them a Dottie surfaces from the ground and places them over its head. Knowing the entire process is going to happen again but lacking the item that drove their conflict, Big and Tiny form an unspoken truce, continuing to argue as they walk into the sunset together. Reception The game received a Metacritic score of 75, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\" from a selection of 30 reviewers.Metacritic: Tiny & Big in Grandpa's Leftovers In a positive review, PC Gamer UK‚Äôs Duncan Geere called the game's art style \\"adorable,\\" likening the visuals to Double Fine's Psychonauts; the review would also commend the game for going \\"out of its way to put you in situations where lasering things in half feels awesome,\\" though Geere was also concerned about the possibility of getting lost due to the freedom given to the player and felt the game was short for its retail price.PC Gamer UK review Game Informer's Adam Biessener praised the degree of freedom provided by the game's laser, stating, \\"Your power over the game world is immense.\\" Biessener was, however, more critical of the game's length, occasional bugs, and boss fights, calling the final fight with Big a \\"lame rehash of the same mechanics you‚Äôve conquered several times.\\"Game Informer review Reviewing for Destructoid, Allistair Pinstof noted that the game \\"runs out [of] ideas before its half-way point\\" and included moments where \\"you'll wish the game was either a little more tightly designed or a little more forgiving,\\" but praised the game for its soundtrack and the charm of its aesthetic and comedy, stating, \\"If Tiny & Big were a cartoon, it could easily occupy a time slot between Regular Show and Adventure Time.\\" Destructoid Review IGN's Anthony Gallegos felt similarly, noting that \\"the look of Tiny and Big feels like someone took the cartoon Adventure Time and put it into the Borderlands engine.\\"IGN review The game won the Unity Development Award at indiePub's 2011 Independent Propeller Awards, although it was not developed in Unity.

Calibration  Calibrating XCO requires an independent method of determining the amount of molecular hydrogen in a given astrophysical region. While direct emission from molecular hydrogen is difficult to observe, there are other ways of inferring molecular hydrogen mass, outlined below. * The mass of an individual molecular cloud can be inferred from its velocity dispersion. Assuming that the cloud is self gravitating and virialized, and that nearly all of the gas mass is molecular hydrogen, one obtains an estimate of the cloud's H2 mass. * H2 mass can be estimated through gamma ray observations, where gamma ray emission arises from the interaction of cosmic rays with H2 molecules. * Using optical and infrared observations, one can estimate the amount of dust in a region and convert to H2 mass through an (empirically determined) dust-to-gas ratio.

The results of the 1978 election were inconclusive: Parti civique de Longueuil leader Marcel Robidas was re-elected as mayor, but the Parti municipal won nine of seventeen seats and initially held a functioning majority on council until one of its representatives was expelled from the party. Ferland served as the Parti municipal's main spokesperson on council in this period in place of party leader Paul Viau, who did not seek a council seat in 1978 and was defeated in that year's mayoral contest. Ferland considered running for party leader in 1981 after Viau's resignation, but he ultimately stood aside in favour of Jacques Finet.Le Parti municipal de Longueuil: Le premier mandat 1978 - 1982, Soci√©t√© historique et culturelle du Marigot, accessed 10 January 2014.

As mayor, Ferland presided over a municipal policy that required Longueuil public servants to live within the city during their terms of employment. The Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) challenged this policy in 1988, on the grounds that it violated the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and the Quebec Charter of Rights and Freedoms.Catherine Buckie, \\"Residence policy in Longueuil assailed,\\" Montreal Gazette, 10 March 1988, G1. The law was introduced in 1984, before Ferland became mayor. Ferland and other South Shore mayors declined to pay a fifteen million dollar transit bill submitted by the Montreal Urban Community Transit Corp. (MUCTC) in early 1988 to cover a deficit. The mayors instead argued that Montreal Island residents should pay a fee increase, an option that was rejected by Montreal Urban Community councillors.Peter Kuitenbrouwer, \\"Laval, South Shore refuse to help with transit deficit,\\" Montreal Gazette, 26 April 1988, A3.

In November 1991, Ferland led the Longueuil council in approving a new municipal code of ethics that gave councillors six months to end conflict-of-interest situations. Gisele Hamelin of the Parti civique criticized the law as vague, arguing that it did not properly cover gifts received by councillors.\\"Longueuil's code of ethics called vague,\\" Montreal Gazette, 14 November 1991, H1. Ferland established a heritage committee in early 1992 to oversee historical buildings in Old Longueuil.Debbie Parks, \\"Longueuil to set up heritage commission; Follows demolition of old home,\\" Montreal Gazette, 26 March 1992, G3.

In October 1992, Ferland announced the Longueuil had joined an international network of medium-sized municipalities that also included Namur, Belgium; Poitiers, France; Maidstone and Northampton in the United Kingdom; Coimbra, Portugal; and P√©cs, Hungary. He indicated that the network was focused on achieving economic goals and that reciprocal visits and seminars were being planned.\\"Longueuil links up with Europe,\\" Montreal Gazette, 15 October 1992, G1. Ferland urged the provincial government to merge the municipalities of Longueuil, Boucherville, Brossard, Saint-Hubert, Saint-Lambert, Greenfield Park, and LeMoyne into a single city in early 1993, arguing that this would increase efficiency and promote tax equity.Harvey Shepherd, \\"Mayor urges province to merge seven cities,\\" Montreal Gazette, 4 March 1993, G1.

Ferland served as prefect of the Champlain County Regional Municipality in this period; in December 1993, he and the leader of the Lajemmerais Regional County Municipality endorsed the creation of a new body to represent their municipalities.Harvey Shepherd, \\"New body to give towns a single voice,\\" Montreal Gazette, 2 December 1993, G1. Fragmentation of the Parti Municipal (1992‚Äì94) Opposition Parti civique councillors demanded Ferland's resignation in June 1992, arguing that he had changed municipal rules to favour five developers working on a luxury housing project and had failed to provide opposition councillors with the costs of the policy change. The mayor's executive assistant responded that Ferland would not resign, that city staff had followed normal procedures in processing the information, and that a deliberate \\"political decision\\" had been made to support housing development during an economic downturn.Harvey Shepherd, \\"City gives developers sweetheart deal: critics,\\" Montreal Gazette, 25 June 1992, G1. Shortly after this exchange, council Roger Lacombe resigned from the Parti municipal to sit as an independent, charging that the city's policies were hurting small contractors.Julie Luoma, \\"Councillor quits Longueuil mayor's party in protest; Lacombe unhappy with golf course project, breaks for major contractors,\\" Montreal Gazette, 9 July 1992, G1. The governing board of the Parti municipal expelled councillor Michel Timperio at Ferland's urging in September 1992, without having first consulted the party caucus. Five more councillors later resigned from the party in protest.\\"Five in mayor's party quit caucus in Longueuil,\\" Montreal Gazette, 17 September 1992, A3.

Ferland himself unexpectedly resigned from the Parti municipal in January 1993 and pledged to serve the last two years of his term as an independent. He was quoted as saying, \\"Recent events have caused me to conclude that [...] the indispensable bond of confidence that has to exist between the leader of a party and his caucus simply no longer exists, at least not with an important part of the caucus.\\"\\"Mayor of Longueuil quits Municipal Party,\\" Montreal Gazette, 5 January 1993, A3. He did not align himself with the other former Parti municipal councillors, who remained opposed to his administration. In late January 1993, council voted to choose Florent Charest, a critic of Ferland, as council's new speaker.Harvey Shepherd, \\"Flexing their muscles; Factions on Longueuil council team up to oust speaker,\\" Montreal Gazette, 28 January 1993, G2. In May 1993, council speaker Florent Charest ruled that Ferland had been in an \\"apparent conflict-of-interest\\" in January when he voted to select a law firm for the city that was also representing him in a separate case. Ferland rejected the charge, and an aide described the speaker's decision as \\"very subjective.\\"Harvey Shepherd, \\"Longueuil council mulls conflict case,\\" Montreal Gazette, 29 April 1993, G1; Harvey Shepherd, \\"Longueuil mayor, speaker in spat,\\" Montreal Gazette, 27 May 1993, H5.

Raised for service during Second World War as part of the Second Australian Imperial Force, it was formed on 11 July 1940 at Trawool in central Victoria as part of the 23rd Brigade of the 8th Division. It was subsequently deployed to Ambon as part of Gull Force in December 1941 following the Japanese invasion of Malaya; however, with the defence of the island considered untenable due to the limited military resources available and overwhelming Japanese strength it was subsequently captured despite determined resistance, surrendering on 3 February 1942. Most members of the battalion became prisoners of war, and a large number died in captivity. History The 2/21st Battalion was formed on 11 July 1940 at Trawool in central Victoria as part of the Second Australian Imperial Force during the Second World War. Under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Leonard Roach, a Militia officer who had previously commanded the 14th Battalion, it was part of the 23rd Brigade of the 8th Division. The majority of the battalion's initial intake of volunteers were Victorians, drawn from the country areas around Shepparton as well as Melbourne. The colours chosen for the battalion's unit colour patch (UCP) were the same as those of the 21st Battalion, a unit which had served during World War I before being raised as a Militia formation in 1921. These colours were black over red, in a diamond shape, although a border of gray in an oval shape was added to the UCP to distinguish the battalion from its Militia counterpart; the oval border denoted that the battalion was an 8th Division unit. With an authorised strength of around 900 personnel, like other Australian infantry battalions of the time, the battalion was formed around a nucleus of four rifle companies ‚Äì designated 'A' through to 'D' ‚Äì each consisting of three platoons. Initially hampered by limited equipment and stores, the battalion undertook rudimentary training at Trawool until 23 September, the battalion moved on foot to Bonegilla, a march of which it completed by 4 October. At Bonegilla, the battalion concentrated with the 23rd Brigade's other two battalions, the 2/22nd and 2/23rd, and as more equipment became available, more complex training began. Training continued until 23 March 1941. While the 8th Division's two other brigades ‚Äì the 22nd and 27th ‚Äì were deployed to Malaya in 1941 to bolster the garrison there, the Australian government decided to keep the 23rd in Australia, to deploy to the islands to Australia's immediate north ‚Äì Ambon, Timor and Rabaul ‚Äì if war broke out with the Japanese. Within this plan, the 2/21st was earmarked to reinforce Dutch troops on Ambon if the Japanese decided to attack and the battalion subsequently moved to Darwin in the Northern Territory as the likelihood of war with Japan grew. The battalion began arriving in Darwin on 9 April 1941 and spent the next nine months training and on garrison duties; however, the amenities were isolated and uncomfortable and preparations were hampered through a lack of equipment. Following the Japanese invasion of Malaya on 8 December the battalion prepared to move, arriving on Ambon on 17 December as part of Gull Force. Under Roach's command Gull Force consisted of the 2/21st Battalion supported by anti-tank artillery, engineers and other supporting arms with a combined strength of 1,100 men. Meanwhile, Netherlands East Indies forces on the island numbered some 2,600 men, including several companies of Indonesian troops and Dutch coastal artillery. These troops were tasked with defending the Bay of Ambon and the airfields at Laha and Liang which were being used by a small number of Dutch and some Australian aircraft from No. 13 Squadron RAAF. Yet with the small Australian and Dutch force totaling just 3,700 men, Roach believed Ambon unable to be defended with the limited military resources available and he urgently requested reinforcement. He was subsequently relieved of his command, and was replaced by Lieutenant Colonel John Scott on 17 January 1942. Just prior to the Japanese landings Scott altered the location of many of his defensive positions, which resulted in the battalion being less prepared to repel the invasion. Laha airfield, as shown in December 1945, where the 2/21st had fought in 1942 On the evening of 30/31 January 1942 three battalions from 228th Infantry Regiment of the 38th Division and a battalion of marines from the 1st Kure Special Naval Landing Force landed at several locations on the north and south coast of the island. On the afternoon of 31 January Dutch forces around Paso had surrendered. Outnumbered and lacking air or naval support the 2/21st Battalion, which was guarding Ambon itself, was unable to prevent the advance despite determined resistance, and were pushed to the far west of the peninsula. With 24 hours of the landing Dutch forces on the island had capitulated. Meanwhile, B and C Companies of the 2/21st Battalion at Laha Airfield were attacked on 31 January. Around 150 Australian soldiers and some Indonesians and Dutch were subsequently captured and many were later massacred following a major Japanese offensive on 2 February. Meanwhile, the remainder of the battalion under Scott, located around Eri, surrendered the following day and were interned in their former barracks at Tan Tui. Gull Force lost 15 men killed during the defence of Ambon, and another 309 men at Laha who were either killed in action or murdered by the Japanese in mass executions which occurred on 6 February and between 15‚Äì20 February. Although several small parties managed to escape Ambon and return to Australia, at least 791 men of the former garrison were captured. The survivors subsequently went into captivity as prisoners of war for the remainder of the conflict. Conditions for the prisoners on Ambon were poor and they suffered the highest death rate of any group of Australian prisoners of war during the conflict. Meanwhile, some members of the battalion, including the majority of medical personnel were transferred by the Japanese to camps on Hainan Island in October 1942. Following the surrender of Japan in August 1945, the survivors began to be evacuated on 10 September 1945, with those on Hainan following two days later. The battalion was disbanded later in 1945, having lost 661 dead and 12 wounded. Members of the battalion received the following decorations: one Officer of the Order of the British Empire, three Members of the Order of the British Empire, one George Medal and 14 Mentions in Despatches.

His father, Samuel de Lange Sr., and his one year younger brother Dani√´l de Lange were also well known musicians. Biography De Lange was born in Rotterdam, the son of Johanna Molijn and Samuel de Lange Sr., a music teacher and organist in Rotterdam. In the year of Samuel Jr.'s birth, his father established a piano company with Jan and George Rijken, \\"Rijken & de Lange\\", a company that still operates in Rotterdam. Among other teachers, Samuel Jr. studied organ with Alexander Winterberger, a pupil of Liszt, and piano with Karol Mikuli, a pupil of Chopin. He took music composition lessons with Johannes Verhulst and Berthold Damcke. He spent his unusually productive life in many cities and countries. When he was just a teenager, he toured Eastern Europe as a pianist with his brother Dani√´l and Adrien-Fran√ßois Servais, both cellists. From the age of 20 to 23 (1860-1863) he taught piano at the music conservatory of Lemberg (now Lvov, Ukraine). After that he returned to Rotterdam, but he soon went abroad again. He lived and worked subsequently in Basel, Paris, Cologne and The Hague to finally settle in Stuttgart, where he became director of the music conservatory. De Lange befriended many fellow composers, including Johannes Brahms, Max Bruch and Max Reger, and dedicated compositions to Friedrich Gr√ºtzmacher (1st cello concerto), Hugo Becker (2nd cello sonata), Charles-Marie Widor and Johannes Brahms. De Lange introduced reforms in the education of music in Cologne, Basel, and Stuttgart and was, with his father, instrumental in the founding of De Nederlandse Bachvereniging. In 1871, he played the first performance in the Netherlands of Brahms' 1st piano concerto. Samuel de Lange Jr. died in his residence town of Stuttgart at the age of 70. Compositions De Lange's musical style was influenced by Bach and Beethoven, among others. His earlier works are akin to those by Schumann and Mendelssohn, while his later works are closer to those of Brahms. In contrast to his brother Dani√´l, from whom far fewer compositions have survived, he was not charmed by the music of contemporaries like Wagner and Liszt. His musical works include over 800 compositions, among which are 13 string quartets, many organ compositions, three cello concertos, two piano concertos, two violin concertos, one viola concerto, four piano sonatas, four violin sonatas, three cello sonatas, a clarinet sonata in c minor,http://www.musica-aeterna.de five piano trios, a piano quintet, a string quintet and hundreds of vocal works in a variety of settings. For example Friedrich Hebbel's poem Ein fr√ºhes Liebesleben is used in an unusual instrumentation for voice, string quartet and harp. An arrangement with piano instead of harp was made during a centennial revival of Samuel and Dani√´l de Lange's music. Only a small number of his compositions have yet been recorded, among which are two cello sonatas, several organ works, a number of songs, and some piano music. De Lange is still \\"notorious\\" for his T√§gliche √úbungen im Pedalspiel, a practice book for playing the organ pedal keyboard.

He was born at Youghal in County Cork to cobbler Patrick Walsh and Mary, n√©e Murphy. He was raised by his aunts following his mother's early death, and had little formal education. In 1893 he arrived in Brisbane with the intention of joining the planned socialist utopia New Australia, but lacked the necessary funds. He instead worked as a seaman and joined the Social Democratic Vanguard. He married Margaret O'Heir in Cairns on 18 November 1899. He soon moved to New South Wales, where he worked as a Newcastle agent for the Federated Seamen's Union of Australasia. A supporter of Peter Bowling in the 1909 coal strike, he rose to state branch secretary for the union in 1912. His wife Margaret died of tuberculosis on 6 April 1914 and their three daughters were sent to live with the socialist journalist Robert Ross. Tom and Adela (Smith's Weekly, 1922) Also living with the Rosses was Adela Pankhurst, the daughter of famed British suffragette Emmeline Pankhurst and her husband Richard Pankhurst. They married on 30 September 1917 in Melbourne. They returned to Sydney after the war, where Walsh, as general secretary of the union, organised the 1919 strike and served three months in gaol. Both Walshes were foundation members of the Communist Party, but soon fell out with the organisation. In 1922 Tom Walsh became federal president of the Seamen's Union, extracting improved working conditions on Australian vessels through a tactic of delaying ship's sailings until the union's demands were met. In 1925 the Bruce Government deregistered the union and charged Walsh with incitement, with the ultimate goal of Walsh's deportation. After the Australian union's support for a British strike in 1925, the Deportation Board found against Walsh and fellow unionist Jacob Johnson and they were held at Garden Island until a successful appeal. In 1928 Walsh lost control of the union to Johnson after advocating decreased militancy in order to consolidate its achievements. He attempted to form a new union founded on industrial peace but was unsuccessful, remaining exiled from the Seamen's Union until 1936. Walsh worked as a journalist during this period, the family surviving the Great Depression on his journalist's wages and Adela's income as a public speaker. The Walshes, increasingly anti-communist, advocated trade with Japan and in 1939-1940 visited the country as guests of the Japanese government, returning convinced of Japan's benevolent intentions towards Australia. Following the attack on Pearl Harbor, Adela was interned but appealed to be allowed to return to her dying husband's side, but she was unsuccessful. Tom Walsh died at North Sydney on 5 April 1943.

Where found, such voter suppression efforts vary by state, local government, precinct, and election. Separately, there have also been various efforts to enfranchise and disenfranchise various voters in the country, which concern whether or not people are eligible to vote in the first place (not covered by this article; see Voting rights in the United States). Methods=Historical= The passage of the Fifteenth Amendment in 1870 guaranteed the right to vote to men of all races, including former slaves. Initially, this resulted in high voter turnout among African-Americans in the South. In the 1880 United States presidential election, a majority of eligible African- American voters cast a ballot in every Southern state except for two. In eight Southern states, Black turnout was equal to or greater than White turnout. At the end of the Reconstruction era, Southern states began implementing policies to suppress Black voters. After 1890, less than 9,000 of Mississippi's 147,000 eligible African-American voters were registered to vote, or about 6%. Louisiana went from 130,000 registered African-American voters in 1896 to 1,342 in 1904 (about a 99% decrease). Poll taxes Poll taxes were used to disenfranchise voters, particularly African-Americans and poor whites in the South. Poll taxes started in the 1890s, requiring eligible voters to pay a fee before casting a ballot. Some poor whites were grandfathered in if they had an ancestor who voted before the Civil War era. This meant that they were exempt from paying the tax. Eleven Southern states (Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia), as well as several outside the South, imposed poll taxes. The poll tax mechanism varied on a state-by-state basis; in Alabama, the poll tax was cumulative, meaning that a man had to pay all poll taxes due from the age of twenty-one onward in order to vote. In other states, poll taxes had to be paid for several years before being eligible to vote. Enforcement of poll tax laws was patchy. Election officials had the discretion whether or not to ask for a voter's poll tax receipt. The constitutionality of the poll tax was upheld by the Supreme Court in the 1937 Breedlove v. Suttles and again affirmed in 1951 by a federal court in Butler v. Thompson. Poll taxes began to wane in popularity despite judicial affirmations, with five Southern states keeping poll taxes by 1962 (Alabama, Arkansas, Mississippi, Texas, and Virginia). The poll tax was officially prohibited in 1964 by the Twenty-fourth Amendment. Literacy tests Like poll taxes, literacy tests were primarily used to disenfranchise poor or African-American voters in the South. African-American literacy rates lagged behind White literacy rates until 1940. Literacy tests were applied unevenly: property owners were often exempt, as well as those who would have had the right to vote (or whose ancestors had the right to vote) in 1867, which was before the passage of the Fifteenth Amendment. Some states exempted veterans of the Civil War from tests. Literacy tests varied in difficulty, with African-Americans often given more rigorous tests. In Macon County, Alabama in the late 1950s, for example, at least twelve whites who had not finished elementary school passed the literacy test, while several college-educated African-Americans were failed. Literacy tests were prevalent outside the South as well, as they were seen as keeping society's undesirables (the poor, immigrants, or the uninformed) from voting; twenty states still had literacy tests after World War II, including seven Southern states, California, Connecticut, Massachusetts, and New York. A 1970 Amendment to the Voting Rights Act prohibited the use of literacy tests for determining voting eligibility. =Contemporary=Purging of voter rolls In 1998, Florida created the Florida Central Voter File to combat vote fraud documented in the 1997 Miami mayoral election. Many people were purged from voter registration lists in Florida because their names were similar to those of convicted felons, who were not allowed to vote at that time under Florida law. According to the Palm Beach Post, African-Americans accounted for 88% of those removed from the rolls but were only about 11% of Florida's voters. However, according to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, nearly 89% of felons convicted in Florida are black; therefore, a purge of convicted felons could be expected to include a disproportionately high number of blacks. The Post added that \\"a review of state records, internal e-mails of DBT employees and testimony before the civil rights commission and an elections task force showed no evidence that minorities were specifically targeted\\". Between November 2015 and early 2016, over 120,000 voters were dropped from rolls in Brooklyn, New York. Officials have stated that the purge was a mistake and that those dropped represented a \\"broad cross-section\\" of the electorate. However, an WNYC analysis found that the purge had disproportionately affected majority-Hispanic districts. The board announced that it would reinstate all voters in time for the 2016 congressional primary. The Board of Elections subsequently suspended the Republican appointee in connection to the purge, but kept on her Democratic counterpart. In 2008, more than 98,000 registered Georgia voters were removed from the roll of voters because of discrepancies in computer records of their identification information. Some 4,500 voters had to prove their citizenship to regain their right to vote. Georgia was challenged for requesting more Social Security-based verifications than any other state‚Äîabout 2 million voters in total. An attorney involved in the lawsuit said that since the letters were mailed with fewer than 90 days before the election, Georgia violated federal law. The director of the American Civil Liberty Union's Georgia Voting Rights Project said, \\"They are systematically using these lists and matching them and using those matches to send these letters out to voters.\\" \\"They're using a systematic purging procedure that's expressly prohibited by federal laws, if people who are properly eligible are getting improperly challenged and purged. Elise Shore, a regional attorney for the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund (MALDEF), agreed the letters appear to violate two federal laws against voter purging within 90 days of the election. \\"People are being targeted, and people are being told they are non-citizens, including both naturalized citizens and U.S.-born citizens,\\" said Shore. \\"They're being told they're not eligible to vote, based on information in a database that hasn't been checked and approved by the Department of Justice (DOJ), and that we know has flaws in it.\\" Secretary of State Karen Handel denied that the removal of voters' names was an instance of voter suppression. In 2019, presiding circuit court Judge Paul V. Malloy of Ozaukee County, Wisconsin, removed 234,000 voters from the statewide rolls, ruling that state law compelled him to do so.Wisconsin judge orders removal of 234,000 voters from state registry, FOX6Now, Amy Dupont, December 13, 2019. Retrieved December 24, 2019. Limitations on early and absentee voting In North Carolina, Republican lawmakers requested data on various voting practices, broken down by race. They then passed laws that restricted voting and registration many ways that disproportionately affected African Americans, including cutting back on early voting. In a 2016 appellate court case, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit struck down a law that removed the first week of early voting. The court held that the GOP used the data they gathered to remove the first week of early voting because more African American voters voted during that week, and African American voters were more likely to vote for Democrats. Between 2008 and 2012 in North Carolina, 70% of African American voters voted early. After cuts to early voting, African American turnout in early voting was down by 8.7% (around 66,000 votes) in North Carolina. As of 2020, Georgia requires absentee voters to provide their own postage for their ballots. On April 8, 2020, the ACLU filed a lawsuit challenging this rule, claiming it \\"is tantamount to a poll tax.\\"  Voting procedure disinformation  Voting procedure disinformation involves giving voters false information about when and how to vote, leading them to fail to cast valid ballots. For example, in recall elections for the Wisconsin State Senate in 2011, Americans for Prosperity, a conservative political advocacy group founded in 2004 by brothers Charles and David Koch to support Republican candidates and causes in the United States, sent many Democratic voters a mailing that gave an incorrect deadline for returning absentee ballots. Voters who relied on the deadline in the mailing could have sent in their ballots too late for them to be counted. The organization claimed that it was caused by a typographical error. Just prior to the 2018 elections, The New York Times warned readers of numerous types of deliberate misinformation, sometimes targeting specific voter demographics. These types of disinformation included false information about casting ballots online by email and by text message, the circulation of doctored photographs in 2016 which claimed Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents were arresting voters at polling places and included threatening language meant to intimidate Latino voters, polling place hoaxes, disinformation on remote voting options, suspicious texts, voting machine malfunction rumors, misleading photos and videos, and false voter fraud allegations. The Times added that messages purportedly sent by Trump to voters in Indiana, Kansas, Michigan, and Georgia were actually disseminated from Republican organizations. In 2018, Trump actually spread information about defective machines in a single Utah county, giving the impression that such difficulties were occurring nationwide.6 Types of Misinformation to Beware Of on Election Day. (And What to Do if You Spot Them), New York Times, Kevin Roose, Nov. 5, 2018. Retrieved December 25, 2019. Caging lists Caging lists have been used by political parties to eliminate potential voters registered with other political parties. A political party sends registered mail to addresses of registered voters. If the mail is returned as undeliverable, the mailing organization uses that fact to challenge the registration, arguing that because the voter could not be reached at the address, the registration is fraudulent.  Identification requirements  Some states like Indiana have imposed strict photo ID requirements. It has been explored whether or not strict photo ID laws disproportionately affect non-white voters: 7% of White Americans lack driver's licenses, for example, compared to 10% of Latinos and 21% of African-Americans. For driver's licenses that are unexpired where the stated address and name exactly match the voter registration record, 16% of White Americans lack a valid license, compared to 27% of Latinos and 37% for African Americans. In July 2016, a federal appeals court found that a 2011 Texas voter ID law discriminated against black and Hispanic voters because only a few types of ID were allowed; for example, military IDs and concealed carry permits were allowed, but state employee photo IDs and university photo IDs were not. In August 2017, an updated version of the same Texas voter ID law was found unconstitutional in federal district court; the district judge indicated that one potential remedy for the discrimination would be to order Texas election-related laws to be pre-cleared by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ). The court also ruled that the law would force some voters to spend money traveling to a government office to update their identification information; the court compared this provision to a poll tax. During the 21st century, several states with Republican-controlled governments passed restrictive voter ID laws affecting identification cards for college students (a liberal-leaning demographic group). A 2019 paper by University of Bologna and Harvard Business School economists found that voter ID laws had \\"no negative effect on registration or turnout, overall or for any group defined by race, gender, age, or party affiliation.\\" A 2019 study in the journal Electoral Studies found that the implementation of voter ID laws in South Carolina reduced overall turnout but did not have a disparate impact. 2019 studies in Political Science Quarterly and the Atlantic Economic Journal found no evidence that voter ID laws have a disproportionate influence on minorities. Historical examples=1838 Gallatin County Election Day Battle= William Peniston, a candidate for the Missouri state legislature, made disparaging statements about the Mormons and warned them not to vote in the election.. Reminding Daviess County residents of the growing electoral power of the Mormon community, Peniston made a speech in Gallatin claiming that if the Missourians \\"suffer such men as these [Mormons] to vote, you will soon lose your suffrage.\\" Around 200 non-Mormons gathered in Gallatin on election day to prevent Mormons from voting. When about 30 Latter Day Saints approached the polling place, a Missourian named Dick Weldon declared that Mormons were not allowed to vote in Clay County. One of the Mormons present, Samuel Brown, claimed that Peniston's statements were false and then declared his intention to vote. This triggered a brawl between the bystanders. The Mormons called upon the Danites, a Mormon vigilante group, and the Missourians left the scene to obtain guns and ammunition and swore to kill the Mormons. Rumors among both parties spread that there were casualties in the conflict. When Joseph Smith and volunteers rode to Adam-ondi-Ahman to assess the situation, they discovered there were no truths to the rumors. =Jim Crow laws= Jim Crow laws were state and local laws that enforced racial segregation in the Southern United States. All were enacted in the late 19th and early 20th centuries by white Democratic-dominated state legislatures after the Reconstruction period. The laws were enforced until 1965. The origin of the phrase \\"Jim Crow\\" has often been attributed to \\"Jump Jim Crow\\", a song- and-dance caricature of blacks performed by white actor Thomas D. Rice in blackface, which first surfaced in 1832 and was used to satirize Andrew Jackson's populist policies. As a result of Rice's fame, \\"Jim Crow\\" by 1838 had become a pejorative expression meaning \\"Negro\\". When southern legislatures passed laws of racial segregation directed against blacks at the end of the 19th century, these statutes became known as Jim Crow laws.Woodward, C. Vann and McFeely, William S. (2001), The Strange Career of Jim Crow. p. 7 During the Reconstruction period of 1865‚Äì1877, federal laws provided civil rights protections in the U.S. South for freedmen, the African Americans who had formerly been slaves, and the minority of blacks who had been free before the war. In the 1870s, Democrats gradually regained power in the Southern legislatures, having used insurgent paramilitary groups, such as the White League and the Red Shirts, to disrupt Republican organizing, run Republican officeholders out of town, and intimidate blacks to suppress their voting. In 1877, a national Democratic Party compromise to gain Southern support in the presidential election (a corrupt bargain) resulted in the government's withdrawing the last of the federal troops from the South. White Democrats had regained political power in every Southern state.Woodward, C. Vann, and McFeely, William S. The Strange Career of Jim Crow. 2001, p. 6. Blacks were still elected to local offices throughout the 1880s, but their voting was suppressed for state and national elections. Democrats passed laws to make voter registration and electoral rules more restrictive, with the result that political participation by most blacks and many poor whites began to decrease.Michael Perman.Struggle for Mastery: Disfranchisement in the South, 1888‚Äì1908. Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2001, Introduction.J. Morgan Kousser.The Shaping of Southern Politics: Suffrage Restriction and the Establishment of the One-Party South, New Haven: Yale University Press, 1974. Between 1890 and 1910, ten of the eleven former Confederate states, starting with Mississippi, passed new constitutions or amendments that effectively disenfranchised most blacks and tens of thousands of poor whites through a combination of poll taxes, literacy and comprehension tests, and residency and record-keeping requirements. Voter turnout dropped drastically through the South as a result of such measures. In Louisiana, by 1900, black voters were reduced to 5,320 on the rolls, although they comprised the majority of the state's population. By 1910, only 730 blacks were registered, less than 0.5% of eligible black men. \\"In 27 of the state's 60 parishes, not a single black voter was registered any longer; in 9 more parishes, only one black voter was.\\" The cumulative effect in North Carolina meant that black voters were completely eliminated from voter rolls during the period from 1896‚Äì1904. The growth of their thriving middle class was slowed. In North Carolina and other Southern states, blacks suffered from being made invisible in the political system: \\"[W]ithin a decade of disfranchisement, the white supremacy campaign had erased the image of the black middle class from the minds of white North Carolinians.\\"Richard H. Pildes, \\"Democracy, Anti- Democracy, and the Canon\\", 2000, pp. 12, 27. Retrieved March 10, 2008. In Alabama tens of thousands of poor whites were also disenfranchised, although initially legislators had promised them they would not be affected adversely by the new restrictions.Glenn Feldman, The Disfranchisement Myth: Poor Whites and Suffrage Restriction in Alabama, Athens: University of Georgia Press, 2004, pp. 135‚Äì136. In some cases, progressive measures intended to reduce election fraud, such as the Eight Box Law in South Carolina, acted against black and white voters who were illiterate, as they could not follow the directions. While the separation of African Americans from the white general population was becoming legalized and formalized during the Progressive Era (1890s‚Äì1920s), it was also becoming customary. For instance, even in cases in which Jim Crow laws did not expressly forbid black people to participate in sports or recreation, a segregated culture had become common. The Voting Rights Act of 1965, passed by huge bipartisan majorities in both houses of Congress and signed by President Lyndon Johnson, aimed to end these practices. A key provision of the act required that states with a history of disenfranchising black voters, namely those in the Jim Crow South, submit to the Department of Justice for \\"pre-clearance\\" any proposed changes to state voting laws. This provision was overturned by the Supreme Court in the case of Shelby County v. Holder (2013). In her dissenting opinion, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg argued, ‚ÄúThrowing out preclearance when it has worked and is continuing to work to stop discriminatory changes is like throwing away your umbrella in a rainstorm because you are not getting wet.\\" =2002 New Hampshire Senate election phone jamming scandal= In the 2002 New Hampshire Senate election phone jamming scandal, Republican officials attempted to reduce the number of Democratic voters by paying professional telemarketers in Idaho to make repeated hang-up calls to the telephone numbers used by the Democratic Party's ride-to-the-polls phone lines on election day. By tying up the lines, voters seeking rides from the Democratic Party would have more difficulty reaching the party to ask for transportation to and from their polling places. =2004 presidential election= Allegations surfaced in several states that a private group, Voters Outreach of America, which had been empowered by the individual states, had collected and submitted Republican voter registration forms while inappropriately discarding voter registration forms where the new voter had chosen to register with the Democratic Party. Such people would believe they had registered to vote, and would only discover on election day that they were not registered and could not cast a ballot. Michigan Republican state legislator John Pappageorge was quoted as saying, \\"If we do not suppress the Detroit vote, we're going to have a tough time in this election.\\" In 2006, four employees of candidate John Kerry's campaign were convicted of slashing the tires of 25 vans rented by the Wisconsin state Republican Party which were to be used for driving Republican voters and monitors to the polls. They received jail terms of four to six months. At the campaign workers' sentencing, Judge Michael B. Brennan told the defendants, \\"Voter suppression has no place in our country. Your crime took away that right to vote for some citizens.\\" =2006 Virginia Senate election= During the Virginia U.S. Senate election, Secretary of the Virginia State Board of Elections Jean Jensen concluded that incidents of voter suppression appeared widespread and deliberate. Documented incidents of voter suppression include: * Democratic voters receiving calls incorrectly informing them voting will lead to arrest. * Widespread calls fraudulently claiming to be \\"[Democratic Senate candidate Jim] Webb Volunteers,\\" falsely telling voters their voting location had changed. * Fliers paid for by the Republican Party, stating \\"SKIP THIS ELECTION\\" that allegedly attempted to suppress African-American turnout. The FBI has since launched an investigation into the suppression attempts. Despite the allegations, Democrat Jim Webb narrowly defeated incumbent George Allen. =2008 presidential election=Michigan On September 16, 2008, attorneys for then-Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama announced their intention to seek an injunction to stop an alleged caging scheme in Michigan. It was alleged that the Michigan Republican Party used home foreclosure lists to challenge voters who used their foreclosed homes as their primary addresses at the polls. Michigan GOP officials called the suit \\"desperate\\". A federal appeals court ordered the reinstatement of 5,500 voters wrongly purged from the voter rolls by the state. Minnesota The conservative nonprofit Minnesota Majority reportedly made phone calls claiming that the Minnesota Secretary of State had concerns about the validity of voters' registration. Their actions were referred to the Ramsey County attorney's office. Pennsylvania On Election Day 2008, at a polling station in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, two members of the New Black Panther Party (NBPP)‚ÄîMinister King Samir Shabazz and Jerry Jackson‚Äîstood in front of the entrance to a polling station in uniforms that have been described as military or paramilitary.\\"Republicans Push For New Black Panther Hearing\\".

The Associated Press, July 1, 2010. The incident drew the attention of police, who around 10:00 am, sent Shabazz away, in part because of his billy club.

Stephen Robert Morse, upon arriving at the scene, filmed Shabazz. The incident gained national attention after the video was uploaded to YouTube and went viral with over a million views. The Philadelphia incident became known as the New Black Panther Party voter intimidation case. No complaints were filed by voters about the incident, though poll watchers witnessed some voters approach the polls and then turn away, apparently in response to the NBPP members. Nevertheless, the Bush administration's Department of Justice (DOJ) became aware of the incident and started an inquiry. In January 2009, less than two weeks before the Bush Administration left office, Christopher Coates of the DOJ's Civil Rights Division filed a civil suit under the Voting Rights Act against four defendants, including Shabazz.Government Accused in Voting Case. The New York Times, September 25, 2010. Although none of the defendants challenged the lawsuit, the Obama administration dropped its claims against all but Shabazz in May 2009. A spokesperson for the Obama DOJ stated that claims were \\"dismissed against the other defendants based on a careful assessment of the facts and the law.\\" Questions about the validity of this explanation served as the basis for subsequent controversy over the case, which was investigated by the United States Commission on Civil Rights, Republican members of Congress, and the DOJ.Dispute over New Black Panthers case causes deep divisions. The Washington Post, October 22, 2010. The federal government eventually obtained an injunction forbidding Shabazz from displaying a weapon within 100 feet of a Philadelphia polling location.

In July 2010, seven Republican members of the Senate Judiciary Committee sent a letter to committee chairman Senator Patrick Leahy, calling for a hearing on potential \\"widespread politicization and possible corruption\\" in the DOJ in regard to its decision to narrow the case. In December 2010, the Civil Rights Commission released a report concluding that their investigations had uncovered \\"numerous specific examples of open hostility and opposition\\" within the Obama DOJ to pursue cases in which whites were victims. The report accused the DOJ of failing to cooperate with investigations into its reason for dropping the case.Rights commission raps DOJ over Black Panther case. The Washington Post, December 5, 2010. Critics charged the Obama Justice Department had refused to apply civil rights law in a colorblind fashion; the DOJ, they argued, would never have watered down the case had the alleged wrongdoers been white. The matter had made headlines again in 2010 because of renewed allegations by Coates, the DOJ lawyer who originally brought the case, that the Voting Rights section has long been \\"hostile\\" to cases in which minorities were perpetrators, not victims. Coates failed to offer specific evidence that the DOJ acted improperly. Republican Abigail Thernstrom, a former vice-chair of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights who was appointed by George W. Bush, became a vocal critic of the investigations over the New Black Panthers case. In an interview with CBS News, Thernstrom said that she believed \\"the evidence is extremely weak\\" that the DOJ during the Obama administration had discriminated against white voters.No Proof in New Black Panther Case: Official. CBS News. July 25, 2010. Retrieved January 5, 2020. Thernstrom explained her opinion on the case in a National Review article in which she referred to the case as \\"very small potatoes\\". She contended that her \\"fellow conservatives on the commission had this wild notion they could bring Attorney General Eric Holder down and really damage the president.\\" Controversy fueled by partisan hyperbole, conspiracy theories and misinformation had surrounded the case for over a year. The Washington Post asserted that the DOJ did what all law enforcement entities are ethically obligated to do: pressed only such charges as were supported by evidence. PolitiFact noted that Fox News hosts, led by Bill O'Reilly, regularly criticized the Obama DOJ for maintaining a purported double standard on race issues. O'Reilly interviewed numerous Fox News legal analysts who said criminal charges should have been pursued, per PolitiFact. On July 15, 2010, O'Reilly wrote, \\"If it were just about the Panthers, the story would be meaningless. But because Attorney General Eric Holder is involved in the dismissal of the criminal charges, the situation takes on some importance.\\" PolitiFact asserted that O'Reilly and Fox had misled the public by muddying the distinction between criminal and civil charges.Fact Check: Reports of voter ‚Äòintimidation‚Äô appear exaggerated, Jacksonville Times, Carole Fader, July 29, 2010.

Wisconsin The Republican Party attempted to have all 60,000 voters in the heavily Democratic city of Milwaukee who had registered since January 1, 2006 deleted from the voter rolls. The requests were rejected by the Milwaukee Election Commission, although Republican commissioner Bob Spindell voted in favor of deletion.Associated Press reported in Green Bay Press-Gazette, October 10, 2008. =2010 Maryland gubernatorial election= In the Maryland gubernatorial election in 2010, the campaign of Republican candidate Bob Ehrlich hired a consultant who advised that \\"the first and most desired outcome is voter suppression\\", in the form of having \\"African-American voters stay home.\\" To that end, the Republicans placed thousands of Election Day robocalls to Democratic voters, telling them that the Democratic candidate, Martin O'Malley, had won, although in fact the polls were still open for some two more hours. The Republicans' call, worded to seem as if it came from Democrats, told the voters, \\"Relax. Everything's fine. The only thing left is to watch it on TV tonight.\\" The calls reached 112,000 voters in majority- African American areas. In 2011, Ehrlich's campaign manager, Paul Schurick, was convicted of fraud and other charges because of the calls. In 2012, he was sentenced to 30 days of home detention, a one-year suspended jail sentence, and 500 hours of community service over the four years of his probation, with no fine or jail time.

They claimed to be aiming for more \\"geographic diversity\\"; Democrats accused them of trying to suppress the vote. The Burtonsville site had the most minority voters of all the early-voting sites in the county, while the proposed new locations were in more Republican- friendly areas with fewer minority residents. The Republican election board chairman admitted at a County Council committee that he and two GOP colleagues held a conference call with the chairman of Montgomery's Republican Party Central Committee. They said the call, from which Democrats were excluded, was legal. Democrats called it a violation of Maryland's Open Meetings Act. Todd Eberly, a political science professor from Saint Mary's College, called the claim by the Republicans, \\"a stupid defense.\\" =2016 presidential election= The 2016 presidential election was the first in 50 years without all the protections of the original Voting Rights Act. Fourteen states had new voting restrictions in place, including swing states such as Virginia and Wisconsin. Kansas In early 2016, a state judge struck down a law requiring voters to show proof of citizenship in cases where the voter had used a national voter registration form. In May, a federal judge ordered the state of Kansas to begin registering approximately 18,000 voters whose registrations had been delayed because they had not shown proof of citizenship. Kansas secretary of state Kris Kobach ordered that the voters be registered, but not for state and local elections. In July, a county judge struck down Kobach's order. Kobach has been repeatedly sued by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) for allegedly trying to restrict voting rights in Kansas. North Carolina In 2013, the state House passed a bill that requires voters to show a photo ID issued by North Carolina, a passport, or a military identification card to begin in 2016. Out-of-state drivers licenses were to be accepted only if the voter registered within 90 days of the election, and university photo identification was not acceptable. In July 2016, a three-judge panel of the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed a trial court decision in a number of consolidated actions and struck down the law's photo ID requirement, finding that the new voting provisions targeted African Americans \\"with almost surgical precision,\\" and that the legislators had acted with clear \\"discriminatory intent\\" in enacting strict election rules, shaping the rules based on data they received about African-American registration and voting patterns. On May 15, 2017, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to review the Appeals Court ruling. North Dakota North Dakota abolished voter registration in 1951 for state and federal elections, the only state to do so. It has since 2004 required voters to produce an approved form of ID before being able to vote, one of which was a tribe ID commonly used by Native Americans. However, it was common and lawful for a post office box to be used on this ID instead of a residential address. This has led to North Dakota being accused of voter suppression because many Native American were being denied a vote because they did not have an approved form of ID with a residential address.IN NORTH DAKOTA, NATIVE AMERICANS HAVE OVERCOME BARRIERS TO VOTE North Dakota‚Äôs ID law especially adversely effected large numbers of Native Americans, with almost a quarter of Native Americans in the state, otherwise eligible to vote, being denied a vote on the basis that they do not have proper ID; compared to 12% of non-Indians. A judge overturned the ID law in July 2016, also saying: \\"The undisputed evidence before the Court reveals that voter fraud in North Dakota has been virtually non-existent.\\" However, the denial of a vote on this basis was also an issue in the 2018 mid-term election. In the run-up to North Dakota's election for U.S. Senate in 2018, state lawmakers implemented changes to voter identification rules, citing nine \\"suspected\\" double voting cases. Under the new rules, voter IDs had to include a residential address, rather than a post office box. The change led to rebuke and lawsuits from Native American voters on a Turtle Mountain Chippewa reservation, as well as claims of partisanship from then-Senator Heidi Heitkamp, a Democrat, as the law was championed by Republican state representatives. The voters claimed discrimination, and in legal filings cited a survey that indicated 18% of Native Americans lacked a valid ID due to the new street address requirement, while the requirement only affected 10.9% of non-Natives. The survey pinned the discrepancy on higher poverty rates and lower transportation access in areas with higher proportions of Native Americans. The legal battle quickly rose to national attention. While former Attorney General Eric Holder called the rule \\"nothing more than voter suppression\\", North Dakota House Majority Leader Republican Al Carlson, who sponsored the law, said \\"Our attempt was never to disenfranchise anybody. From a legislative standpoint, we wanted the integrity ... in the ballots, but we also want to have anybody that wants to vote that is a legal citizen be able to identify where they live and be able to vote.\\" Ultimately, the legal battle ended when the Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal in November 2018, which effectively left the rule in place.The State of Voting Rights Litigation (November 2018), Brennan Center, November 15, 2018. Retrieved December 24, 2019. In July 2019, the ID law was judged to be constitutional. Eighth Circuit Upholds North Dakota Voter ID Law A settlement of the dispute was reached in February 2020. Ohio Since 1994, Ohio has had a policy of purging infrequent voters from the rolls. In April 2016, a lawsuit was filed, challenging this policy on the grounds that it violated the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (NVRA) and the Help America Vote Act of 2002. In June, the federal district court ruled for the plaintiffs, and entered a preliminary injunction applicable only to the November 2016 election. The preliminary injunction was upheld in September by the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. Had it not been upheld, thousands of voters would have been purged from the rolls just a few weeks before the election. Wisconsin In Wisconsin, a federal judge found that the state's restrictive voter ID law led to \\"real incidents of disenfranchisement, which undermine rather than enhance confidence in elections, particularly in minority communities\\"; and, given that there was no evidence of widespread voter impersonation in Wisconsin, found that the law was \\"a cure worse than the disease.\\" In addition to imposing strict voter ID requirements, the law cut back on early voting, required people to live in a ward for at least 28 days before voting, and prohibited emailing absentee ballots to voters. A study by Priorities USA, a progressive advocacy group, estimates that strict ID laws in Wisconsin led to a significant decrease in voter turnout in 2016, with a disproportionate effect on African-American and Democratic-leaning voters. =2017‚Äì2018=Election Integrity Commission and Crosscheck In May 2017, President Donald Trump established the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity, purportedly for the purpose of preventing voter fraud. Critics have suggested its true purpose is voter suppression. The commission was led by Kansas attorney general and Republican gubernatorial nominee Kris Kobach, a staunch advocate of strict voter ID laws and a proponent of the Crosscheck system. Crosscheck is a national database designed to check for voters who are registered in more than one state by comparing names and dates of birth. Researchers at Stanford University, the University of Pennsylvania, Harvard University, and Microsoft found that for every legitimate instance of double registration it finds, Crosscheck's algorithm returns approximately 200 false positives. Kobach has been repeatedly sued by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and other civil rights organizations for trying to restrict voting rights in Kansas. On February 20, 2016, while speaking to a committee of Kansas 2nd Congressional District delegates, regarding their challenges of the proof-of-citizenship voting law he championed in 2011, Kobach said, \\"The ACLU and their fellow communist friends, the League of Women Voters‚Äîyou can quote me on that, the communist League of Women Voters ‚Äî the ACLU and the communist League of Women Voters sued\\".Peter Hancock, Kansas Republicans hold to hard-right stance; ACLU and League of Women Voters ‚Äòcommunists,‚Äô Kobach says, Lawrence Journal-World, February 20, 2016; retrieved October 8, 2018. Often, voter fraud is cited as a justification for such measures, even when the incidence of voter fraud is low. In Iowa, lawmakers passed a strict voter ID law with the potential to disenfranchise 260,000 voters. Out of 1.6 million votes cast in Iowa in 2016, there were only 10 allegations of voter fraud; none were cases of impersonation that a voter ID law could have prevented. Only one person, a Republican voter, was convicted.

Much of the law was invalidated on appeal at various levels of appeals courts or voluntarily withdrawn or reworded. In its 2014 Shelby County v. Holder decision, the Supreme Court of the United States allowed jurisdictions with a history of suppression of minority voters to avoid continuing to abide by federal preclearance requirements for changes in voter registration and casting of ballots. Within 24 hours of that ruling, Alabama implemented a previously-passed 2011 law requiring specific types of photo identification to be presented by voters. The state closed DMV offices in eight of ten counties which had the highest percentage black population, but only three in the ten counties with the lowest black population. In 2016, Alabama's Secretary of State (SOS) John Merrill began the process to require proof of citizenship from voters, despite Merrill saying he did not know of any cases where non-citizens had voted. Four-term Republican Representative Mo Brooks found that he himself had been purged from the rolls. Merrill also declined to publicize the passage of legislation that enabled some 60,000 Alabamian former felons to vote.Seven Ways Alabama Has Made It Harder to Vote, New York Times, June 23, 2018.

A clerk of the local Jefferson County Commission allegedly called the intended voters' senior center to claim that the bus tour constituted \\"political activity,\\" which is barred at events sponsored by the county.

The 50 counties that have experienced the greatest increases in African- American and Latino populations had 542 polling sites closed between 2012 and 2018, while those with the lowest increases in minority populations had only 34 closures. Brazoria County, south of Houston, closed 60% of its polling places, below the statutory minimum; the county clerk promised this would not happen again. Texas law allows the centralization of vote centers, which sometimes make it easier for people to vote. However, the 334 poll closures outside of vote centers still put Texas ahead of Arizona, Georgia, Louisiana, and Mississippi.

The episode features Ted in 2024, telling the Mother about the day of Robin and Barney's wedding. The final scene prompted some to think that the Mother was dead; this was proven correct in the series finale, \\"Last Forever\\". Plot Ted and the Mother are dining at the Farhampton Inn during a snowstorm in 2024. They pass the time by telling each other stories, but come to realize that they have told each other every story they know, finally considering themselves \\"an old married couple\\". Curtis walks by and reminds Ted of a story about a lamp broken on the day of the wedding. Believing it to be a story he has never told the Mother, Ted excitedly recounts the events. Near the end of the morning on the day of the wedding, Robin and her sister Katie are playing ice hockey and Robin hits a lamp with the puck, shattering it to pieces. Lily intervenes and tries to show Robin a special scrapbook of her and Barney's love life. Robin's lack of interest in the scrapbook leads Lily to believe that Robin has not fully accepted the fact that she's getting married, even taking time to watch The Wedding Bride Too on her TV. Lily shares her thoughts with Marshall, who heads to the room to watch the movie with Robin. While they are enjoying the movie, Lily puts on the wedding dress she planned to wear for pictures to try and scare Robin, but Robin still doesn't show any reaction. At this point, the Mother realizes she has heard the story, but continues to listen. Meanwhile, Ted catches Barney secretly entering a room, and finds out that the room belongs to \\"Susan Tupp\\", leading him to believe that he is cheating on Robin. Ted breaks in to try and catch them in the act, but discovers that Barney actually rented the room as storage for all his suits (Sue Tupp aka \\"Suit Up!\\"). Barney is freaking out over which suit to wear and doesn't agree with Ted's choices. Finally, Ted tells him to try on a special wedding-day suit Tim Gunn made for him, but Barney dislikes it, claiming it looks and feels terrible. Ted explains to him that this is simply because the suit is new, but once the ceremonies begin, he will feel it is a perfect fit. This relaxes Barney, and he signs off on it. They rejoin the rest of the gang in Robin's room, where they realize this will be their last day together, as Ted is moving to Chicago the next day. They are sad at first, but get over it somewhat. The men go get some food while Robin goes out for some ice ‚Äì and chances upon her mother, whom she happily embraces and finally realizes she is about to get married. Reflecting on the events of the day 11 years later, Ted admits to the Mother that some moments like that one in Robin's room, with the gang all together possibly for the last time, were so intense that things were better left unsaid and to just enjoy the moments while you (still) have them. The Mother expresses worry at Ted living in his past stories, but instead asks him to live life moving forward. Noting the sudden appearance of Robin's mom, she asks, \\"What mother is going to miss her daughter's wedding?\\" At this, Ted falls silent, and his eyes visibly fill with tears. She quickly changes the subject to how Barney got the Scuba Suit for one of his earlier scams; Ted having forgotten that he had stolen it when he first told the story. Production In December 2013, Cobie Smulders stated that the show was looking to cast Robin's mother, and said that Annette Bening was one of the actresses she pitched to producers. Critical reception Bill Kuchman of Popculturology noted that the episode supports the theory that Ted is telling his children this story because The Mother is dead in the year 2030, drawing parallels between \\"Vesuvius\\" and \\"The Time Travelers\\". \\"When 'The Time Travelers' aired, there was a lot of discussion over what that soliloquy meant. Was The Mother dead? Was Ted dead? After seeing 'Vesuvius,' one of the theories certainly has a lot more weight now,\\" Kuchman wrote. \\"Sure, maybe Ted‚Äôs speech in 'The Time Travelers' and the ending of 'Vesuvius' have nothing to do with each other, but is that really the most likely case? ... I originally nixed both 'The Mother is dead' and 'Ted is dead' theories, citing Occam's razor. The simplest explanation is often the correct explanation, and back then that was the case. If I‚Äôm sticking to Occam‚Äôs Razor still, it's now a lot harder to debunk 'The Mother is dead' theory.\\" Donna Bowman of The A.V. Club graded the episode a B. Max Nicholson of IGN gave the episode 8.3/10, saying it finished strong thanks to a compelling and emotional frame story featuring Ted and the Mother.

It was written by Carter Bays and Craig Thomas, directed by Pamela Fryman, and aired on March 10, 2014. The episode centers around the guys searching for Lily (Alyson Hannigan), who is missing after a fight with her husband Marshall (Jason Segel), as they try to figure out why she changed her mind about going to Italy. At the same time, Robin (Cobie Smulders), who is engaged to marry Barney (Neil Patrick Harris), is worried she is marrying her someone just like her father. This episode contains a deleted scene that reveals the genesis of the pineapple from \\"The Pineapple Incident,\\" a long-running gag on the show. \\"Daisy\\" received mostly positive critical reception. Plot Four hours before the wedding, Robin asks her mother how she made it despite a fear of flying. Genevieve says she somehow got over the fear despite panicking on board and accidentally opening the exit door, resulting in her being restrained to her seat by duct tape. Genevieve asks Robin more about Barney and immediately makes comparisons to Robin Sr. Genevieve's various descriptions of Robin Sr. rankle Robin and Lily because the similarities with Barney make Robin think she's about to marry someone like him. Marshall discusses his upcoming judgeship with Ted, Barney, Ranjit and Billy Zabka, he admits he feels guilty due to Lily's desire to move to Italy and confused at her changing her mind while she was gone. Zabka claims he saw Lily leaving a nearby convenience store in a car owned by the Captain. The men go to the Captain's estate to confront him and discover he's engaged to Robin's old colleague Becky. The Captain insists that nothing happened between him and Lily, who came to use the powder room. When the Captain brings Ted a daisy from the powder room, Ted analyzes Lily's actions over the past several days. Ted believes that Marshall's recent absence prompted Lily to smoke. Her fight with Marshall made her smoke one last cigarette in the powder room, deducing that the cigarette may be in the daisy's vase and searches for it. The gang finds a positive pregnancy test. Lily paid Linus to serve her non-alcoholic drinks because she threw up on the train to Farhampton and feared she might be pregnant, later buying the test kit at the store. The men return to the Farhampton Inn, where Marshall reconciles with Lily over her pregnancy and tells her they are moving to Italy to let her pursue her dream. Barney is introduced to his soon-to-be mother-in- law, whom he embraces. Noting that Barney is a hugger unlike Robin Sr., Genevieve brings Robin to the balcony and tries to ease her wedding jitters. A year later in Rome, it is revealed that Marshall and Lily's second child is a girl named Daisy. Deleted scene A scene cut from this episode explains where the pineapple, one of the show's running gags from \\"The Pineapple Incident\\", came from. The scene was released online by Buzzfeed. In the clip, The Captain has a pineapple on his porch, and explains to the gang that he practices the tradition of putting one outside as a \\"symbol of hospitality\\". This leads Ted to remember stealing an identical pineapple from The Captain's house in New York when he was very drunk. Critical reception Bill Kuchman of Popculturology raised the theory that based on the reveal that Lily and Marshall had a daughter, the ending of Vesuvius could be foreshadowing something happening to Lily, saying, \\"Maybe Ted isn't broken up in 2024 over the thought of his wife missing the future wedding of his daughter, Penny‚Äîmaybe Ted is broken up over the thought of Lily missing the future wedding of her daughter, Daisy. ... We won't know for sure what the ending of 'Vesuvius' really meant, but if this theory is right, HIMYM once again outwitted one of the biggest fan theories surrounding the show.\\" Donna Bowman of The A.V. Club graded the episode a B+. Max Nicholson of IGN gave the episode 7.3/10, saying it was saved by an interesting shake-up for Marshall and Lily. Kaitlin Thomas of TV.com said the Marshall and Lily plot did not hit all of the \\"right emotional beats.\\" ReferencesExternal links * Category:How I Met Your Mother (season 9) episodes Category:2014 American television episodes ","title":"Daisy (How I Met Your Mother)"},{"id":"41609238","text":"Roberta \\"Lea\\" Brilmayer (born 1950) is an American legal scholar.

First described by W.G Tilesius in 1802, the species is transparent and gelatinous, making it difficult to be seen in water, which is helpful in avoiding predators. The fossil range is very recent. Other animals often mistaken for T. vagina are Salpa fusiformis, Aurelia aurita, and Pegea confoederata. There is no known status of conservation in this species. T. vagina DNA was sequenced as part of a larger project in 2014 where spiny lobster larvae were found attached to T. vagina and consuming it.  Description  T. vagina can reach up to 333 mm (13 in) long. They develop into two distinct forms; the aggregate generation and the solitary generation. The aggregated sexual blastozooids (aggregate form) can get to the size of 250 mm and has five muscle bands. The solitary asexual oozooids (solitary form) can get to size of 300 mm. Vaginas of this form have around 20 muscle bands, which are characterized as ‚Äústriped‚Äù with two short dark-colored tentacles at their ends, attached at the upper and lower halves of the body. Both the aggregate and the solitary forms have tests covered in ridges and grooves. They have a colored digestive system seen as a dark or colorful lump. The embryos have been found to be between 10-15 mm.  Distribution  T. vagina is found in pelagic marine environments. It occurs in tropical and temperate waters of the Pacific, Atlantic and Indian Ocean and is occasionally found in colder waters in the northern Atlantic, likely following warm water currents. The species is widespread but at low density (although they may occasionally be found at very high density), resulting in only rare accounts of it being caught. T. vagina has been found off the central coast of British Columbia, marking its north-most occurrence to date. It has been found by cataloging volunteers along the West Coast of the U.S. and reportedly congests nets of fisherman off the coast of northern Honshu and southern Hokkaido, Japan. In January 2009, the largest measured biomass of T. vagina was recorded at 852 g WW m‚àí3 in the Tasman sea. T. vagina stays in the photic zone and is often found in places of high chlorophyll concentration, likely due to its phytoplankton rich diet. A large increase of T. vagina is associated with an increase in phytoplankton. The ecology of this species is not fully understood.  Diet  Like other salps, T. vagina feeds by consuming plankton nutrient water on one end of its body, filtering it via an internal net made of mucus, and spewing the water out the other end. Their internal net is very effective, catching particles spanning four magnitudes in size. This action also allows them to move through the water column, classifying them as nektonic. T. vagina feeds on marine plankton, including single-celled organisms such as dinoflagellates, silicoflagellates, diatoms, and tintinnids, as well as copepods and other small particles. Continuing up the food chain, T. vagina is preyed upon by medusae, siphonophores, ctenophores, heteropods, sea turtles, late stage larvae of the spiny lobster, marine birds, along with various species of fish. They have a high energy content at (11.00 kJ g‚àí1 DW). In a study done in the Japan Sea in 2006, the gut contents of T. vagina where evaluated. The diatom Coscinodiscus spp. (13‚Äì55 ¬µm in diameter) was found to be the major makeup of the guts, with the diatom Coscinodiscus wailesii (219‚Äì313 ¬µm) being the second most prevalent. Another study off the coast of Maine found T. vagina gut content to be mainly made up of two dinoflagellates; Prorocentrummicans and Dinophysis norvegica. The study also found T. vagina to be an indiscriminate feeder over a broad size spectrum.  Ecology  Waste from T. vagina is densely packed, sinks quickly, and is full of carbon. Their carcasses also sink quickly and are carbon rich (31% dry weight, DW). This makes them efficient carbon sinks, but also harder to study. This carbon exchange could be responsible for up to 67% of the mean organic daily carbon flux in the area. In 2007 and 2009, the Tasman sea floor was analyzed from 200m to 2500m in depth and large quantities of T. vagina were found. The quantities found were some of the largest gelatinous zooplankton depositions ever recorded. Further, benthic communities were found consuming T. vagina carcasses. This sink provides nutrients to these benthic communities and are likely a large source of carbon input.

The main line was subsequently extended to Bareilly, Moradabad and Saharanpur and the entire line was thought of as the \\"main line\\" of Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway. An important branch line, the Allahabad-Faizabad line, which meets the main line almost at right angles, is included here. The main line is under the administrative jurisdiction of Northern Railway, a portion of the branch line is under the jurisdiction of North Central Railway. History The Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway opened the wide broad gauge line from Varanasi to Lucknow in 1872. The line was extended to Faizabad as ‚ÄòFaizabad Loop‚Äô. The Curzon Bridge across the Ganges was opened in 1905 by the East Indian Railway Company and the wide broad gauge Allahabad- Faizabad line was possibly opened the same year. It was operated by the Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway. The loop-line of the Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway from Benares through Faizabad to Lucknow traverses the Jaunpur District from south to north, while the main line of the same railway crosses the south west corner. A branch from Zafarabad to Phaphamau on the Ganges is under construction ib n 1905, which will give access to Allahabad. Shahganj is connected with Azamgarh, and Jaunpur city with Ghazipur, by branches of the Bengal and North Western Railway. Passenger movement Varanasi and Lucknow on the main line, and Allahabad on a branch line are amongst the top hundred booking stations of Indian Railway. Sheds, workshops and manufacturing facilities Lucknow diesel loco shed or Alambagh diesel shed is home to 160+ locomotives, including WDM-2, WDM-3A, WDM-3D, WDG-3A and WDG-4 varieties. Charbagh locomotive workshops handle periodical overhaul jobs. Allahabad has an engineering workshop. Diesel Locomotive Works at Varanasi initially assembled ALCO kits. Subsequently, with technology transfer from GM EMD, it produces advanced diesel locomotives with high efficiency and low maintenance costs. It produces around 240 locomotives annually. Railway reorganisation Around 1872, the Indian Branch Railway Company was transformed into Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway. Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway was merged with East Indian Railway Company in 1925. dia took over the Bengal and North Western Railway and merged it with the Rohilkhand and Kumaon Railway to form the Oudh and Tirhut Railway in 1943. In 1952, Eastern Railway, Northern Railway and North Eastern Railway were formed. Eastern Railway was formed with a portion of East Indian Railway Company, east of Mughalsarai and Bengal Nagpur Railway. Northern Railway was formed with a portion of East Indian Railway Company west of Mughal Sarai, Jodhpur Railway, Bikaner Railway and Eastern Punjab Railway. North Eastern Railway was formed with Oudh and Tirhut Railway, Assam Railway and a portion of Bombay, Baroda and Central India Railway. East Central Railway was created in 1996-97. North Central Railway was formed in 2003.

Background  Zhao Tingyin was born in 883, during the reign of Emperor Xizong of Tang. He was from Kaifeng.The Records of the Nine Kingdoms actually indicated that Zhao was from Taiyuan, which the History of Song then implicitly adopted in the biography of his son Zhao Chongtao (Ë∂ôÂ¥áÈüú). See History of Song, vol. 479. However, given that it was unambiguous that he served in the Later Liang's army, a Taiyuan origin appeared unlikely (as Taiyuan was under the control of Later Liang's archrival Jin (Later Tang's predecessor state)), and therefore the Spring and Autumn Annals of the Ten Kingdoms account that he was from Kaifeng (Later Liang's capital) will be used here. His early military career was in the Later Liang army, and he became an officer under the prominent general Wang Yanzhang.  During Later Tang  In 923, Li Cunxu, the emperor of Later Liang's archrival to the north, Later Tang, decided to launch a surprise attack on Later Liang's capital Daliang (i.e., Kaifeng), through Yun Prefecture (ÈÑÜÂ∑û, in modern Tai'an, Shandong). Wang Yanzhang's army, poorly-manned, was the only Later Liang army standing between him and Daliang, and he attacked, defeated, and captured Wang. Zhao Tingyin was also captured at that time, along with other officers Zhang Hanjie (), Li Zhijie (), and Liu Sibin (). Shortly after, with Li Cunxu's army approaching Daliang, Later Liang's last emperor Zhu Zhen committed suicide, ending Later Liang. Its territory came under Later Tang's control.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 272. Zhao's career apparently continued in the Later Tang army, although his activities the next few years were not recorded in historical records. It is known that he was an officer in Later Tang's army that conquered Former Shu in 925. When, in 926, after the conquest, the Later Tang commander of that invasion army, Li Jiji the Prince of Wei (the son of Li Cunxu) was prepared to depart Chengdu (the capital of the destroyed Former Shu state) and return to Later Tang's capital Luoyang, he left a detachment, commanded by several officers ‚Äî Zhao, Li Renhan, Pan Rensi (), Zhang Ye (Li Renhan's nephew), Wu Zhang (), and Li Tinghou () ‚Äî at Chengdu, to await the arrival of the new Later Tang-commissioned military governor of Xichuan Circuit (Ë•øÂ∑ù, headquartered at Chengdu), Meng Zhixiang, to arrive. Apparently, then, when Meng subsequently arrived to take office, Zhao and those other officers came under his command. Even after Meng's arrival, however, there was much banditry throughout the former Former Shu territory. Meng sent Zhao and Zhang to quell the banditry, and they killed the bandits and calmed the land.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 274. By 930, the relationships that Meng Zhixiang and Dong Zhang the military governor of neighboring Dongchuan Circuit (Êù±Â∑ù, headquartered in modern Mianyang, Sichuan) with the imperial government, with Li Cunxu's adoptive brother Li Siyuan as emperor (Li Cunxu's having been killed in a mutiny at Luoyang in 926), had become very strained, and it appeared that war between the imperial government and these two circuits would erupt at any time. In fall 930, Meng and Dong formally rose against the imperial government. Meng sent Li Renhan to command the army against the imperially- held Wuxin Circuit (Ê≠¶‰ø°, headquartered in modern Suining, Sichuan), with Zhao, who then carried the title of prefect of Han Prefecture (Êº¢Â∑û, in modern Deyang, Sichuan), serving as his deputy and Zhang serving as his forward commander. Li Renhan shortly after put Wuxin's capital Sui Prefecture () under siege. During the siege, however, news came that the main imperial army against the two circuits, commanded by Li Siyuan's son-in-law Shi Jingtang, had captured the key entry into the two circuits, Jianmen Pass. Meng thus diverted Zhao from Li Renhan's army, giving him 10,000 men to reinforce Dong's defenses at Jian Prefecture (ÂäçÂ∑û, in modern Guangyuan, Sichuan, near Jianmen Pass). At that time, it was deep in the winter, and Zhao's fearful soldiers initially did not want to advance to Jian. Zhao wept in front of them and stated: \\"Now the Northern Army [(i.e., the imperial army)] is strong. If you all do not fight hard to stop them, even your wives and children will be owned by others.\\" The soldiers were aroused by his speech, and advanced to Jian.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 277. Upon arriving at Jian, Zhao rendezvoused with another officer of Meng's, Li Zhao, and Dong's officer Wang Hui (). When Shi attacked Jian, they used the rough terrain in the area, as well as their soldiers' archery skills, to impede Shi's attack, forcing Shi to retreat back to Jianmen. Shi made another attack on Jian in spring 931, and Zhao again repelled him. By this point, Shi had tired of the campaign and did not believe victory was possible, and therefore, even before obtaining the permission of Li Siyuan (although Li Siyuan was preparing to abandon the campaign as well by this point), withdrew from the region, back to more-securely held imperial territory. The Xichuan and Dongchuan forces chased him to Li Prefecture (Âà©Â∑û, in modern Guangyuan), the capital of Zhaowu Circuit (), and seeing that Shi was withdrawing, the imperially-commissioned military governor of Zhaowu, Li Yanqi (), abandoned Li and withdrew as well. Meng commissioned Zhao as the acting military governor of Zhaowu. Meanwhile, hearing that Dong was coming to encourage the army, Zhao secretly informed Meng and requested permission to seize Dong, arguing to Meng that Dong was treacherous, and that seizing him would allow Meng to take control of Dongchuan easily. Meng refused, however, and when Dong visited Zhao, Zhao took no action but lamented his lack of authorization. Shortly after, Zhao and Li Zhao returned to Chengdu, leaving 5,000 men to guard Li Prefecture. Subsequently, in summer 931, Zhao returned to Li to take office. He then suggested to Meng that he be given an army to attack the imperially- held Xingyuan Municipality (ËààÂÖÉ, in modern Hanzhong, Shaanxi) and Qin (Áß¶Â∑û, in modern Tianshui, Gansu) and Feng (È≥≥Â∑û, in modern Baoji, Shaanxi) Prefectures. Meng, believing that the army had been worn out, declined. Zhao then repaired the walls of Li Prefecture, and then submitted a petition to Meng, pointing out that Li Zhao, like he, contributed to the victory at Jian Prefecture, and expressing that he was willing to yield Zhaowu to Li Zhao. Meng initially declined, but after Zhao offered again, agreed, sending Li Zhao to Zhaowu to serve as acting military governor and recalling Zhao to Chengdu. With Li Siyuan having withdrawn the imperial army and made overtures of peace to both Meng and Dong (including executing his chief of staff An Chonghui, the main proponent of the campaign against the two circuits), Meng wanted peace with the imperial government as well and was willing to resubmit to Li Siyuan as a vassal. Dong, however, refused, as he was still angry at the imperial government for executing his son Dong Guangye (). He soon launched an attack against Xichuan, and he sent letters to Zhao Tingyin, Zhao Jiliang, and Li Zhao, hoping that sending the letters would cause Meng to suspect the three of them, but Meng did not. Meng subsequently sent Zhao Tingyin to resist Dong, and followed himself with another army. Dong's attack was initially strong, capturing a number of Xichuan cities on the way to Chengdu, and when Zhao engaged Dong, Dong won the first three battles, but Zhao's counterattack crushed Dong's army, causing it to collapse and forcing Dong to flee back to Dongchuan's capital Zi Prefecture (). Wang Hui and Dong's nephew Dong Yanhao () then mutinied, and Dong was killed in the mutiny. When Zhao arrived at Zi, Wang surrendered the city, and Dong's head, to him. Meng subsequently arrived at Zi as well. Li Renhan soon rendezvoused with Zhao and Meng, and Zhao personally went to welcome Li's arrival. Instead of acknowledging Zhao's accomplishments in defeating Dong, however, Li insulted Zhao, causing Zhao to become resentful of him. When Meng himself subsequently arrived at Zi as well, he summoned Li and Zhao, asking them which of the two of them would be suitable to be the military governor of Dongchuan, believing that one of them would support the other, he was surprised that Li only made the comment of, \\"Even if you, Lord, want to give me Shu Prefecture [(ËúÄÂ∑û, in modern Chengdu ‚Äî which Li might have one point served as the prefect of)] again, I will accept it\\" and that Zhao was completely silent. Subsequently, with the two of them at a standoff, Meng decided to assume the military governorship of Dongchuan himself to avoid having Li and Zhao continue to struggle over it. He subsequently commissioned Li as the military governor of Wuxin Circuit (Ê≠¶‰ø°, headquartered in modern Suining, Sichuan), and Zhao the military governor of Baoning Circuit (‰øùÂØß, headquartered in modern Nanchong, Sichuan).Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 278.  During Later Shu  In 934, Meng Zhixiang claimed imperial title as emperor of a new state of Later Shu. Zhao Tingyin was made one of the imperial guard commanding generals, but continued to also serve as the military governor of Baoning. Meng Zhixiang died later in 934, leaving a will for his son Meng Renzan (who then changed his name to Meng Chang) to succeed to the throne, and entrusting Meng Chang to the chancellor Zhao Jiliang, Li Renhan, Zhao Tingyin, the chief of staff Wang Chuhui, and the imperial guard generals Zhang Gongduo and Hou Hongshi ().Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 279. Immediately after Meng Chang's assumption of the throne, Li Renhan insisted on being put in command of the imperial guards. Meng Chang initially reluctantly agreed and put him in command, making Zhao Tingyin his deputy. Meng Chang also gave Zhao the honorary chancellor designation Shizhong (). However, Zhang Gongduo and several of Meng Chang's close associates thereafter accused Li Renhan of plotting treason. After consulting with Zhao Jiliang and Zhao Tingyin, Meng decided to arrest him while he was attending an imperial meeting, and then put him to death, along with his son Li Jihong () and several associates. (Shocked by the development, Li Zhao, who had previously refused to bow to the young emperor, changed his attitude and became very submissive. Meng's associates advocated putting Li Zhao to death, too, but Meng did not do so, instead forcing Li Zhao into retirement.) In 941, as part of Meng Chang's reforms to end the practice of having high-level officials and generals hold office at the imperial government in Chengdu but continuing to serve also as military governors ‚Äî as the end result was that they were not attentive to their circuits, and their staff members would effectively rule the circuit and mismanage them ‚Äî several high level officials/generals who were doing so, including Zhao, who was then the military governor of Wude Circuit (Ê≠¶Âæ∑, i.e., Dongchuan), were given some additional honors but stripped of their military governorships.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 282. (For reasons unclear, in 944, Meng reversed his reform and again had high-level officials/generals assume military governorships, although it was not stated whether Zhao received the military governorship of Wude, or any other circuit, at that time.)Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 283. In 948, Zhang Ye, who was then serving as chancellor, was accused by Meng's close associates Sun Hanshao (), Li Hao, and An Siqian (). Zhang was put to death.

It was awarded as a title of honor until suspension of Celonese honors in 1956. History The post originated from the Portuguese colonial administration in the 17th century by enlisting natives of different castes form the coastal areas. The post continued throughout the Dutch East India Company administration and the British colonial administration until the abolition of the native department in the 1930s.Twentieth Century Impressions of Ceylon: The Native Headman System It was awarded as a title of honor until the suspension of Celonese honors in 1956. During the British administration official and titular appointments were made by the government agent of the district to a korale which was a revenue district; a muhandiram had several vidane arachchies that may come under his supervision. He would report to the mudaliyar of the korale or atapattu (district) and was subordinate to the assistant government agents and other civil servants. Appointments were non- transferable and usually hereditary, made to locals, usually from wealthy influential families loyal to the British Crown. This was an influential post, as the holder had much control over the populace of a korale and wielded quasi-judicial powers since he was responsible for keeping the peace, carrying out revenue collection and assisting in judicial functions.The Chieftains of Ceylon, J.

It was part of the traditional region of Lower Carniola and is now included with the rest of the municipality in the Central Slovenia Statistical Region.Ljubljana municipal site Geography Vodmat lies immediately east of the historical center of Ljubljana, south of the railroad to Moste, on either side of the railroad to Lower Carniola, and extending past the Ljubljanica River to the south, into the area north of the Gruber Canal, encompassing the Kodeljevo neighborhood and Kodeljevo Castle (, ). Name Vodmat is locally known as Udmat. The name is originally a hydronym, derived from Slavic *vodom«´t—ä 'turbid, cloudy water', and probably refers to a stream that clouded the water that it emptied into. An alternate but less likely theory derives the name from the participle *od—äm«´t- 'grown around'. Toponyms of the same origin include Udmat in Slovenia, and Wudmath () and Admont in Austria. History Vodmat developed from an old farming village that already existed in the Middle Ages. After the 1895 Ljubljana earthquake, Vodmat started being built up with single-story housing for workers and civil servants.Savnik, Roman, ed. 1971. Krajevni leksikon Slovenije, vol. 2. Ljubljana: Dr≈æavna zalo≈æba Slovenije, pp. 337‚Äì338. Agriculture was abandoned in Vodmat by the early 20th century due to urbanization. The part of Vodmat lying west of the railroad to Lower Carniola was annexed by the City of Ljubljana in 1896. This was then known as Stari Vodmat 'old Vodmat', distinguishing it from Novi Vodmat 'new Vodmat' east of the railroad and outside the city limits. The remainder of Vodmat was annexed by the City of Ljubljana in 1935, ending its existence as an independent settlement.

She was the first woman in the Australian Public Service to be appointed as a Secretary of an Australian government department. Early life Helen Williams was born in Adelaide, South Australia on 21 March 1945, the daughter of academics Sir Bruce Williams and Roma Williams. Career Early in her public service career, Williams joined the second division in the Department of Finance in 1979, her employment was controversial at the time due to her being a woman. When she was promoted to Deputy Secretary in the Department of Education and Youth Affairs in 1983, she became the first woman to hold a deputy secretary position in the Australian Government sphere. She was Acting Secretary of the Department of Education and Youth Affairs for a short time in 1984, and was later promoted to Secretary of the Department of Education in 1985, serving in the role until 1987 Her appointment as Secretary of the education department was the first time a woman had been appointed to head an Australian Government department of state. Williams told The Canberra Times in 2006 that in 1987 she was criticised by some women's groups and the senior public service bureaucracy when she took six months maternity leave after having her baby. Her daughter, Anna von Reibnitz, had been born in December 1986. Williams returned to work from maternity leave in 1987 on the day that a reorganisation of the public service was complete, with 28 departments cut down to just 18.

It is the type species of the genus Oneirophanta. It is found on the seabed at abyssal depths. It was first described by the Swedish zoologist Hjalmar Th√©el in 1879, being one of the many deep sea animals discovered during the Challenger expedition of 1872‚Äì1876. Etymology The generic name is from Greek œåŒΩŒµŒπœÅŒø (oneiro), 'dream', and œÜŒ±ŒØŒΩŒøŒºŒ±Œπ (phainomai), 'to appear', the thing that appears as in a dream. The specific name is Latin mutabilis, meaning changeable. Description This sea cucumber has an elongate body that can be up to long and wide. The mouth is at the anterior end of the ventral surface and is surrounded by a ring of twenty tentacles of varying lengths, the tip of each of which has eight projections round the margin. The tube feet on the ventral surface vary in number and are usually in a single row or scattered irregularly. A further row of peg-like tube feet run along each side and the dorsal surface is dotted with papillae (conical fleshy projections of the body wall with sensory tube feet at their apices) that vary from in length, the longer ones resembling tentacles. The skin is rough, brittle and somewhat transparent and the colour of preserved specimens is white, pale brown or dark brown. Distribution and habitat Oneirophanta mutabilis is found on the seabed at abyssal depths in most of the world's oceans. There is little current here and the temperature is permanently about . In the nearly level Porcupine Abyssal Plain in the Atlantic Ocean there is a bed of sediment that has been gradually accumulating for millennia and Oneirophanta mutabilis is one of a number of sea cucumbers that make up about 90% of the megafauna here. Behaviour Oneirophanta mutabilis moves slowly across the sediment on the seabed leaving a trail on the surface. As it progresses it ingests the sediment, processes it through its gut, removes the nutritive organic content and voids the indigestible remains. Little is known of the reproduction of this species.

Starring Hadidjah, Mohamad Mochtar, and Tan Tjeng Bok, the movie follows a brother and sister who are separated by robbers and almost marry before their cousin recognises them. Plot After a run-in with robbers, Badjoeri and his son Soebardja are set adrift on a river. Badjoeri's wife and daughter, Ramina and Mariani, are captured by the bandits. Though they escape with the help of Wirama, Ramina dies soon afterwards. Badjoeri also dies, soon after leaving Soebardja with Mansur. Years pass, and Soebardja and Mariani are set to marry. As they have been raised separately, by different people, they do not realize that they are brother and sister. The marriage is only called off after their cousin Ismail realizes the true relationship of the would-be bride and groom. Production Si Gomar was written and directed by Tan Tjoei Hock for Action Film, a subsidiary of Java Industrial Film (JIF). The film was produced by The Teng Chun, owner of the company, who had signed Tan in 1940 after seeing him at Prinsen Park (now Lokasari). Artistic arrangement was handled by Hajopan Bajo Angin. Music was provided by Mas Sardi, whereas sound was handled by The Teng Chun's brother TS The. Hadidjah, Mohamad Mochtar, and Tan Tjeng Bok starred in Si Gomar; the film also featured Bissu, Aysah, M. Sani, and Said Thalib. Hadidjah and Tan Tjeng Bok both took a dual role; Hadidjah played Ramina and Mariani, whereas Tan Tjeng Bok played Badjoeri and Soebardja. Filming of this black-and-white production had been completed by August 1941. Release and reception Si Gomar was released by September 1941. An anonymous review for Pertjatoeran Doenia dan Film praised the movie, particularly Tan Tjeng Bok's acting in his double role and the visual effects ‚Äì such as those showing an erupting volcano and a forest fire. Soon after the completion of Si Gomar, Action Film began production on another work, Singa Laoet. This later production featured the same cast and crew. Action Film, together with JIF, continued as the most productive studio in the Dutch East Indies until the Japanese occupation began in March 1942, causing all but one film studio to be shut down. Si Gomar was shown as late as December 1943. It is now likely lost, as are all Indonesian films from before 1950 according to American visual anthropologist Karl G. Heider. As elsewhere in the world at the time, movies produced in the Indies were shot on highly inflammable nitrate film, and after a fire destroyed much of Produksi Film Negara's warehouse in 1952, old films shot on nitrate stock were deliberately destroyed. However, Kristanto records several as having survived at Sinematek Indonesia's archives, and film historian Misbach Yusa Biran writes that several Japanese propaganda films have survived at the Netherlands Government Information Service.

Geography White Patch is on the western side of Bribie Island, adjacent to the Pumicestone Passage which forms its western boundary. Wright Creek passes through the southern part of the locality into Pumicestone Passage. The western (coastal) side of the locality is residential. The eastern side (centre of Bribie Island) is undeveloped; some of it is part of the Bribie Island National Park. History Land sales at White Patch occurred as early as 1887. A Department of Public Lands cadastral map drawn up in June 1925 shows properties facing Pumicestone Channel, bordered by Maud street on the north west, Charles Street to the north and Bunbuba Street on the south east. In November 1948, fishermen at White Patch claimed to have seen a sea serpent. It was described as being brown or yellow \\"like a banana\\", long with large eyes and was accompanied by smaller serpents (possibly its young). It was said to hiss and squeak. In December 1948, Eric Decker, the Member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly for Sandgate, caught such a \\"serpent\\" while on holidays at Bribie Island. Mr Mack, curator at the Queensland Museum, said the description was consistent with a common sea snake in Moreton Bay. At the White Patch recorded a population of 112. Demographics In the , White Patch recorded a population of 112 people, 50% female and 50% male. The median age of the White Patch population was 53 years, 16 years above the national median of 37. 68.4% of people living in White Patch were born in Australia. The other top responses for country of birth were England 14%, New Zealand 4.4%, Germany 3.5%, Netherlands 3.5%, Sweden 2.6%. 92.2% of people spoke only English at home; the next most common languages were 2.6% French, 2.6% Swedish.

For instance, Anhuicun or \\"Anhui Village\\" houses people from that room, and Henancun or \\"Henan Village\\" has settlers from that region.Friedmann, p. 70. Several ethnic enclaves house rural migrant workers based on their origin, such as Henancun and Zhejiangcun (Zhejiang Village).Wang, Zhou, and Fan, p. 112. Other ethnic enclaves consist of ethnic minorities who are established as permanent Beijing residents, including several Hui people settlements,Wang, Zhou, and Fan, p. 111-112. such as Niujie and Madian,Wang, Zhou, and Fan, p. 104. Wenfei Wang, Shangyi Zhou, and Cindy Fan wrote that Hui people, despite being permanent Beijingers, are \\"highly segregated\\" from Han people \\"socially and spatially\\". They added that the survival of Hui neighborhoods in Beijing is \\"solely dependent on the existing Hui residents and communities\\" because the communities are \\"not as readily replenished by new migrants\\" and because Hui see themselves as Beijingers and their communities as having \\"more permanent meanings\\" compared to migrant worker communities. =Migrant worker enclaves= Residents of the migrant worker enclaves support each other in looking for jobs and dealing with the local government. Inhabitants consider themselves \\"compatriots\\" (S: Âêå‰π°, P: t√≥ngxiƒÅng), a word equivalent to the English \\"homies\\". In the rural migrant worker communities there is a high turnover as members arrive for work and leave to go back to their hometowns. Some residents work in family workshops and go to the city to sell their wares while others commute to work within the city.Deng, F.F. and Y. Huang, p. 228-229. Most residents plan to eventually return to their home lands and do not consider themselves to be from Beijing. Even though the rural migrant workers are also Han Chinese they are considered to be of a lower status because they are not permanent residents and because they have rural upbringings and low socioeconomic statuses, so each community, in the words of Wenfei Wang, Shangyi Zhou, and Cindy Fan, \\"connotes a native place‚Äìbased ethnicity distinct from the urbanites\\". During periods the Beijing government has attempted to dismantle ethnic villages in the periphery of Beijing.Deng, F.F. and Y. Huang, p. 228. In the 1990s the government made attempts to dismantle Zhejiangcun,Deng, F.F. and Y. Huang, p. 229. including one time in 1995, and had also acted against Henancun (C: Ê≤≥ÂçóÊùë, P: H√©n√°n-c≈´n) and Xinjiangcun. While Uighurs, like the Hui, are Muslim, the Uighurs in Beijing had migrated there more recently than the Hui. Wenfei Wang, Shangyi Zhou, and C. Cindy Fan, authors of \\"Growth and Decline of Muslim Hui Enclaves in Beijing,\\" stated that the Beijing Uighur communities are \\"much smaller in size\\" compared to Hui communities.

She was Chile's Environment Minister in 2000 and 2001. She has advocated for the sustainable management and protection of Chilean forests, leading opposition to illegal logging in her role as coordinator of Defensores del Bosque Chileno (Defenders of the Chilean Forest) since 1992. Hoffmann has authored over a dozen books on the flora of Chile and has identified and classified 106 new species of cactus. Early life and career Adriana Hoffmann was born in Santiago to Lola (n√©e Jacoby) and Franz Hoffmann in 1940. She grew up in Providencia and attended Liceo Manuel de Salas. She was accepted at the University of Chile where she initially studied agronomy. She joined her mother when she traveled to Germany to study psychiatric techniques and there Adriana changed her focus to biology and specialized in botany and ecology. After she finished her studies, she returned to Chile and married engineer Hern√°n Calder√≥n. They lived abroad for a time until returning to Chile in the 1970s. Through her career, Hoffmann traveled throughout Chile, documenting flora and describing species. By April 2008, she had identified and classified 106 new species of Cactaceae. In 1992, Hoffmann became coordinator of the non-profit organization Defensores del Bosque Chileno, Chile's largest forest protection group. She formed Agrupaci√≥n de Defensores del Bosque Nativo in 1994, a group whose founding members included well-known singers and poets as well as economist Manfred Max Neef and Bishop Bernardino Pi√±era. By the mid-1990s, Hoffmann was recognized as one of Chile's premier environmental activists. Hoffmann has served on the board of the Lahuen Foundation, a forest preservation organization that established El Ca√±i Sanctuary. She also played a leading role in the Chilean Science Society, Biology Society of Chile, Earth Foundation, International Union for Conservation of Nature, and the Association of Chilean Female Leaders. Hoffmann's efforts with Defensores del Bosque included developing environmental education programs for teachers. Hoffmann was appointed by President Ricardo Lagos to serve as Executive Secretary of the Comisi√≥n Nacional del Medio Ambiente in March 2000. During her tenure she oversaw the creation of the national hiking trail network Sendero de Chile, improved the System of Environmental Impact Assessment (SEIA), and worked to implement environmental education programs and improve air quality in Santiago. During her tenure she encountered criticism from business interests for her environmentalist stances and from environmental groups for her perceived lack of influence within the administration. Following the controversial approval of petcoke for gas-fired generators over her objections, Hoffmann resigned in October 2001, stating that she no longer felt she was supported by Lagos or the Ministers. She returned to work with Defensores del Bosque and prepared for her eventual retirement. Environmental advocacy During Pinochet's dictatorship, the government gave multinational timber firms unfettered access to Chilean forests and little incentive to process the lumber in-country. Hoffmann has noted that the rapidly disappearing private native forests are mostly wasted through exports of wood chips. In a 1995 article she remarked: \\"We've seen with our own eyes how [timber companies] take immense trees and shred the whole thing, branches and all.\\" Beginning with her involvement with Defensores del Bosque, Hoffmann agitated for the reform of Chilean forestry practices. She has been a vocal advocate for sustainable forest management in the country, arguing that ecotourism and value-added products like furniture lead to greater long-term revenue. Hoffmann wrote columns about ecology for El Mercurio in the 1990s and opposed free trade agreements that would replace native forests with commercial tree plantations. She has criticized the Chilean government for not adopting a forestry policy. Hoffmann befriended American businessman and preservationist Douglas Tompkins, who provided funding for Defensores del Bosque. She defended his efforts to establish a 1200-acre nature reserve in the Chilean Lake District. The New York Times reported that she said: \\"If this investment were anywhere else but Chile, Mr. Tompkins would be considered a hero. But it happened in Chile, where envy and jealousy and business interests are institutions.\\" Awards and honors Hoffmann was recognized by the United Nations in 1997 as one of the 25 leading environmentalists of the decade for her efforts to protect Chile's forests. In 1999 she won the National Environmental Prize in the category of Environmental Education, awarded by CONAMA. For her research into Chilean flora and her work in environmental education, Hoffmann received the Luis Oyarz√∫n Award from the Austral University of Chile in 2003. She received a Fellow Award from the Cactus and Succulent Society of America in 2009. Hoffmann has also served on the judging panel for the United Nations Environment Programme's Sasakawa Prize. Works Hoffmann has authored more than a dozen books and illustrated field guides on the flora, medicinal plants and botanical resources of Chile. Among her works is La Tragedia del Bosque Chileno, which includes text and photographs that document illegal logging in Chilean forests. ;Papers * ;Books     See also *Carolina Villagr√°n *Claudio Donoso *Edmundo Pisano *Native Forest Law *Jurgen Rottmann ReferencesExternal links * Category:1940 births Category:Living people Category:Botanists with author abbreviations Category:Chilean botanists Category:Chilean women botanists Category:Chilean environmentalists Category:Chilean women environmentalists Category:People from Santiago Category:Taxonomists Category:University of Chile alumni Category:Chilean people of German-Jewish descent Category:Chilean people of Latvian-Jewish descent Category:Cactologists Category:Forestry in Chile Category:Environment ministers Category:Government ministers of Chile Category:Women taxonomists Category:20th-century women scientists Category:21st-century women scientists ","title":"Adriana Hoffmann"},{"id":"41609716","text":"Carl Raymond Kinscherf (1919-2006) was a professional American football player from New Jersey.

He joined the army in 1792 during the French Revolution and fought in several battles in the north. After being part of the force occupying the Batavian Republic, he gained promotion for heroism at the Battle of Castricum in 1799. He served as an aide-de-camp during the battles of Marengo and the Mincio in 1800. Deconchy fought in several actions during the War of the Third Coalition. Transferred to Spain, he was acting commander of a light infantry regiment in the VI Corps for a time before being elevated to colonel in September 1810. He participated in the 1810 French invasion of Portugal and led his regiment at Redinha during the retreat. He was promoted general officer in February 1813 and fought against the Spanish guerillas. In August 1813 he transferred to Italy where he led a brigade in the army of Eug√®ne de Beauharnais until the end of the fighting in 1814. He stayed in favor with the Bourbons and was elevated to the rank of lieutenant general in 1821. He led a division in the 1823 French intervention in Spain and died during the blockade of Pamplona. Portugal In September 1810, Deconchy commanded 36 officers and 1,678 rank and file of the 1st and 2nd Battalions of the 25th Light Infantry. The unit was part of Martial Bardet de Maison-Rouge's brigade in Julien Augustin Joseph Mermet's division of Marshal Michel Ney's VI Corps. Spain In the summer of 1813, Deconchy led a brigade of the Army of the North consisting of two battalions of the 64th Line Infantry Regiment, one battalion of the 22nd Line, four companies of the 34th Line and two companies of the 1st Line. With his 2,000-man brigade, Deconchy joined the 16,000 troops under Maximilien S√©bastien Foy who were evacuating the northern coast of Spain due to the British victory at the Battle of Vitoria. After he received news of Vitoria, Foy waited at Bergara for his forces to join him before marching off at top speed for the French frontier. A column led by Sir Thomas Graham attempted to cut Foy off, but was foiled at the Battle of Tolosa on 26 June. During that action, Deconchy's brigade held the walls of the town and easily repelled two attacks by the 1st King's German Legion Light Battalion under Christian Friedrich Wilhelm von Ompteda. At sunset, Foy issued orders to withdraw and Deconchy's men got away just as the Allies smashed down the town gates with cannon fire. As he fell back toward France, Foy sent Deconchy's brigade and every artillerist he could spare to defend San Sebasti√°n which was commanded by Louis Emmanuel Rey. The new troops replaced the previous unreliable garrison of gendarmes and recruits which were sent off as an escort for a large column of refugees.

The genus contains two described species, Afropone oculata and Afropone (?) orapa. Afropone is known from a group of Upper Cretaceous fossils, which were found at Orapa in the Central District of Botswana.  History and classification  Afropone oculata was described from two fossils, the holotype specimen number BP/2/28072a/2, identified as a female, and an additional poorly preserved fossil, number BP/2/26631-17. Afropone (?) orapa was based on a single holotype male, specimen BP/2/26628/1, and tentatively placed into the genus based on overall morphology. The specimens are mostly complete with variation in the quantity of detail, and are preserved as compression fossils in shale. The shales and mudstones of the Orapa site were rapidly deposited in a crater lake formed as the result of a large volcanic eruption in the Cretaceous. The sediment originated as an epiclastic kimberlite and derives from rapid weathering and decomposition of the sides of the kimberlite crater. Of the four major sedimentation types that have been observe at Orapa, fossils are found in only two, the granular mass flows and the fine-grained sediments: woody debris fossils are found in the granular mass flows, but well-preserved fossils are only recovered in the fine-grained sediments. The fossil-bearing stratum was uncovered during mining of the underlying diamond-bearing rocks at the site. Radiometric dating of the kimberlite pipe reported in 1977 gave an age in the general range of . Further dating utilizing zircon crystals reported on in 2004 gave more defined age of approximately placing the date in the Turonian age of the late Cretaceous. The fossils were first studied by Russian paleontologists Gennady M. Dlussky and Alexandr Rasnitsyn with South African paleontologist Denis Brothers. Their 2004 type description of the new genus and species were published in the journal Insect Systematics and Evolution. The genus name Afropone is a combination of Africa, where the fossil was found, and Ponera, the type species of the subfamily Ponerinae. The specific epithet oculata, a derivation of the Latin word oculus meaning eye is a reference to the large eyes of the species. The specific epithet orapa is derived from the fossil locality name. Description The eyes of Afropone species are large and well developed placed in the front portion of the head capsule in A. oculata females, and in the rear portion of the head capsule in A. (?) orapa males. Based on the preserved areas of known fossils, the mandibles of both species are short and rounded, without a distinct masticatory margin. Females of A. oculata are elongate being approximately long and have eyes which are 2.5 times as long as they are wide. The fore wings are narrow and 4.5 times longer than their width. As with other portions of the body both the mesosoma and petiole regions are narrowed. A. (?) orapa is smaller than A. oculata with a total body length of approximately . Overall the antennae are filiform and are composed of flagellomeres that are twice as long as wide. The scape at the base of each is generally short.

The building contains five two-bedroom units, 19 one-bedroom units, 14 studios, and 13 sleepers that share a bath, shower, and kitchen. History The Blackstone Apartment building was designed by architect Elmer Feig in 1930 for owner and real estate developer Harry Mittleman and is considered an outstanding example of Feig's work. Mittleman was known for employing large numbers of workers and finishing construction within months after beginning. In late March, 1930, Mittleman applied for an exemption to Portland's building code that would allow him to place a backyard on the side of the 100-foot square lot that would become Blackstone Apartments at 395 West Park Street. The address was later changed to 1831 SW Park Avenue according to the 1933 street renumbering system. In early April, Mittleman estimated construction costs at $120,000 and began excavation soon thereafter. By summer the building was completed at a cost of $300,000.February 8, 1931, The Oregonian article reprinted in The new apartment building offered a \\"gorgeously furnished,\\" five-room suite and choice, smaller units. Mittleman's office was on the ground floor of the Blackstone, and from there he managed construction of other apartment buildings on SW Park Avenue, including Parkway Manor and Jeanne Manor. On March 1, 1931, a bomb exploded outside Mittleman's office. No injuries were reported, and the case was never solved. Portland State University acquired the property in 1969.

The film stars Nayanthara and Vijay Sethupathi. Produced by actor Dhanush under his banner Wunderbar Films, the film features music composed by Anirudh Ravichander. The film was shot in Puducherry and Chennai over 75 days. It was released on 21 October 2015. The film was dubbed into Telugu as Nenu Rowdy Ne.  Plot  Pandiyan aka \\"Pondy Pandi\\" (Vijay Sethupathi) is the son of a Puducherry-based police inspector P. Meena Kumari (Raadhika). Despite being an inspector's son, he grew up being friendly with the criminals behind bars and on reaching adulthood, unknown to his mother, he becomes a rowdy, though an incompetent one. Pandi and his friends come across a deaf woman Kadhambari (Nayantara) and Pandi immediately falls in love with her. Kadhambari is the daughter of a sincere police officer Ravikumar (Azhagam Perumal). 15 years ago, then Sub-Inspector Ravi loves police profession, and was in pursuit of Killivallavan aka Killi (Parthiban), a dreaded gangster. Killi had been arrested in public by Ravi, and in retaliation Killi slapped ravi when he was shopping with Kathambari. Later, Ravi arrested almost all gang members of Killi. Heavily angered, Killi sent a bomb as a gift, to Ravi's home. The bomb had killed Ravikumar's wife and had caused Kadhambari to lose her hearing in her childhood. Then Ravi and his daughter moved to another part of the Union territory, and had returned for Ravi's last year in duty. Kadhambari seeks Pandi's help in finding her father, who has not spoken to her for the past two days, to which he agrees. Pandi soon learns that Ravikumar had been killed by Killi (as Ravi attempted to kill Killi) the same night he met Kadhambari, but hides the matter from Kadhambari as it would upset her. A week later, Kadhambari learns about her father's death from Meena Kumari and is determined to avenge his death by going after Killi. Pandi agrees to help her in her mission, with the promise that he will hold Killi's shoulders while she stabs him. Pandi and his gang along with Kadhambari hatch a plan to kill Killi while he is travelling. However, this is foiled as their plan gets mixed up with that of Mansoor (Mansoor Ali Khan), the political rival of Killi who wants to contest the upcoming election in place of Killi's mistress Baby (Meenakshi). Pandi's gang is enraged and despite Pandi's reassurances, decides not to help Kadhambari further. Kadhambari decides to go ahead on her own as she does not want Pandi and his friends to split up over her. She reaches Killi's hideout, but on attempting to kill him, he knocks her out. Pandi soon arrives at the hideout and he and Kadhambari, who has regained consciousness, try to kill Killi, but it fails as Kadhambari is unable to stab him. At this juncture, Mansoor arrives at the hideout; both he and Killi stab each other to death, with Pandi falsely taking credit for their deaths in order to impress Kadhambari. Ultimately, Pandi, disillusioned with the rowdy lifestyle, becomes a police officer per his mother's wishes, despite Kadhambari's reservations.

The project titled, Naanum Rowdy Dhaan, was described as an \\"urban flick\\" and the team tried to rope in Samantha for the female lead role. The film was titled after a dialogue spoken by Vadivelu in Thalai Nagaram (2006). In a turn of events in the following month, Anirudh chose not to make an acting debut and the film was briefly shelved as the team looked for a replacement lead actor. The film was subsequently officially announced by Gautham Menon in November 2013, who revealed that he would produce the film and that they had signed on Gautham Karthik to feature in the leading role, while Anirudh would retain his position as composer. George Williams was signed as the cinematographer after being acclaimed for his work in Raja Rani, while Dilip Subbarayan was announced as the film's action director. Vignesh Shivan revealed that the film would be based on a 19-year-old youngster caught in the midst of a gangster setting and noted he hoped to shoot the film in Mumbai, Chennai and Puducherry. Lavanya Tripathi was signed on to play the female lead role of a deaf girl and noted that she was impressed by Vignesh Shivan's narration of the script. However, the film failed to take off and Vignesh Shivan continued to discuss the film with different actors including Ashok Selvan, as he looked for a producer. On 29 August 2014, Vinayagar Chathurthi, in a turn of events, Dhanush announced via Twitter that he would be producing the film under his Wunderbar Film banner and also posted details about the cast and crew and the title design. While the principal crew was retained, the lead roles went to Vijay Sethupathi and Nayantara. The team began its shoot in December 2014, with the first leg of the venture held in Pondicherry for a span of 40 days. Scenes were shot at the Thirukameeswarar Temple in Villianur, a famous temple town 9 km away from Pondicherry bus stand. RJ Balaji joined the team's cast during the first schedule. Director Vignesh Shivan revealed that Vijay Sethupathi had put on weight for some of his recent roles, so he worked hard for the past two months to shed those pounds. He worked out and went on an extensive diet regime as well ‚Äì he even went without eating at times. Anandaraj joined the team in December 2014 and shot for the film in Pondicherry, and revealed he would play a gangster with negative shades.  Soundtrack  Vignesh Shivan, who had worked with Dharan Kumar, on his debut film's soundtrack, chose to collaborate with Anirudh Ravichander for Naanum Rowdy Dhaan's music. The soundtrack features six tracks, with four of them also featuring Anirudh's voice; besides, Neeti Mohan, Benny Dayal, Sid Sriram and Sean Roldan, a composer himself, sung the songs.

Also it will eliminate the possibility of having a meter without a shunt which is a serious concern in make-before- break switches. The selector switch changes the amount of resistance in parallel with Rm (meter resistance). The voltage drop across parallel branches is always equal.

History Medieval fresco remains in the form of \\"vault men\\" The church dates from the 14th century. The oldest part of the presently visible structure is the nave. This first church probably had a wooden ceiling, but was vaulted in the 15th century. The vaults were decorated with frescos only a little later, and again in the 16th century. In the 18th century the church was changed internally, when it received new furnishings (such as pews) and the frescos were covered with plaster. The style which came to dominate the church was a form of airy neoclassicism. The medieval church porch and vestry were also demolished during this century. By contrast, in the 19th century the church was again rather heavily reconstructed, this time in a Gothic revival style. The entire exterior was remade in 1854‚Äì55. At this time the presently visible tower was also erected. Further interior redecorations of the church took place in 1890 (destroying most of the remaining medieval frescos) and in 1925, again in a medievalist style. A more delicate renovation was carried out in 1955, when the remaining fresco fragments were also uncovered. During renovation works carried out in 2013, several coins (including some from the Middle Ages) and some graves, including children's graves, were found under the church floor. Architecture The exterior of the church is characteristically neo-Gothic. The entrance is through the copper-clad and corbie stepped western tower. Inside, the nave is still dominated by its medieval vaults, some of which are decorated with fragmentary remains of frescos. Some of the frescos, depicting the Veil of Veronica, were made by the so-called Tierp group or master. There are also remaining frescos in the vault, so-called \\"vault men\\". The pews are reconstructions of pews from church dating from the 17th century, made during the 1955 renovation. Two decorative pyramids (17th century) adorn the front pews. Some medieval furnishings still survive as well: the baptismal font is from the 13th century (and thus probably older than the church), and there is a wooden statue of Saint Bridget of Sweden from the 15th century. A triumphal cross from the 13th century, altered in the 15th century, also survive in the church, as do the medieval altarpiece, although some of its figures have been lost. It is probably made by a Swedish craftsman and shows influences from northern German art. The pulpit is from 1708, and the church was adorned with new stained glass windows by artist Julia L√ºning in 1955.

She was the wife of William Thomas Collings, Seigneur of Sark, and an ancestor of all subsequent seigneurs.  Collection  Collings was born either on 4 June 1818 or in 1828 as the eldest of the three daughters. Her parents were the Channel Islands naturalist, collector and antiquarian Frederick Lukis by his wife and first cousin Elizabeth (n√©e Collings). Due to the early 19th-century views on female education, Collings and her sisters probably did not receive any formal schooling. Her interest in lichens was most likely due to the influence of her father, from whom she probably inherited many of the local specimens; her brother, William Collings Lukis, also shared their father's interests. Collings swapped her specimens with other collectors, including the family friend, Charles du Bois Larbalestier of Jersey, eventually amassing a collection of over 1,300 lichens held in a set of 32 folders and small box files. She also took time in 1862 to compile a list of 150 species of lichens that appear on the island of Guernsey, and presented it to the geologist David T. Ansted, who was working on a book about the Channel Islands.  Family  Louisa Lukis married her cousin, William Thomas Collings, on 15 June 1847. The ceremony was conducted by her brother, William Collings Lukis, at St Saviour's Church. They had four daughters and two sons, William Frederick (1852‚Äì1927) and Henry de Vic (1855‚Äì1872). On the death of her mother-in-law Marie the next year, her husband became Seigneur of Sark. She was widowed in 1882, when the fief of Sark passed to her son; the seigneur from 1974, Michael Beaumont, is her descendant. Collings decided to pay a visit to her eldest daughter, Mary Edmeades, who lay ill in Folkestone. She died there on 24 March 1887, having suffered from bronchitis for three days, shortly after her daughter. She had outlived all her children except for the Seigneur; her other daughters died respectively in 1851, 1859 and 1871. Her collection passed to Guernsey's newly established Guille-All√®s Museum.

Between 1970 and 1997, he co-wrote 18 British Top 40 hits, 8 Billboard Hot 100 entries, 4 US Country No.1s and 1 US Adult Contemporary No.1, as well as 3 Australian chart-toppers. His songwriting collaborators have included Terry Britten, Albert Hammond, Troy Seals, Jim Diamond and his long-time performing partner, Benny Gallagher. His most famous composition is Tina Turner's 1984 US chart-topper and international smash, \\"What's Love Got to Do with It?\\", which reached No.1 in the US, Canada and Australia and won him the Song of the Year Grammy. He is also well known in Britain, Continental Europe and the Commonwealth as a member of Gallagher and Lyle, McGuinness Flint and Ronnie Lane's band Slim Chance. With Benny Gallagher (1965‚Äì1980) Lyle and Benny Gallagher initially teamed up in 1959 as members of the local Largs based band, The Bluefrets, and teamed up again in a band based in Saltcoats called the Tulsans with lead singer James (Drew) Galt, Dennis Donald (keyboards), Eric Brown on guitar, Benny Gallagher (bass) and Graham Lyle (drums). The Tulsans released two singles in 1965 under the name James Galt for Pye that are now prized by northern soul collectors: \\"Comes The Dawn\\" and \\"With My Baby\\". Benny and Graham later moved to London in the mid 60s. A rare one-off single, \\"Trees\\", was issued on UK Polydor 56093 in 1967, under the name Gallagher-Lyle. In 1968, Gallagher and Lyle were signed by Apple Records, where they wrote for musicians such as Mary Hopkin (\\"Sparrow\\", \\"The Fields of St. Etienne\\", \\"International\\", \\"Heritage\\", and \\"Jefferson\\"). In 1970, the two Scots became original members of the British band McGuinness Flint, writing nine of the 11 songs on the group's eponymous debut album, including the British hit singles \\"When I'm Dead and Gone\\" and \\"Malt and Barley Blues\\", which reached No.2 and No.5 respectively in Britain. The pair recorded a second album, Happy Birthday Ruthy Baby, with McGuinness Flint‚Äîagain writing most of the songs‚Äîbefore leaving to form the duo Gallagher and Lyle in 1972. As a duo, Gallagher and Lyle recorded a total of eight albums: Benny Gallagher and Graham Lyle, Willie and the Lapdog, Seeds, The Last Cowboy, Breakaway, Love on the Airwaves, Showdown and Lonesome No More. All these were issued on A&M; except for the last, which was released on Mercury. The most successful of these was 1976's gold-selling Breakaway, which was produced by David Kershenbaum and yielded the British Top 10 hits \\"I Wanna Stay With You\\" and \\"Heart on My Sleeve\\", both of which also charted in the US. \\"Heart on My Sleeve\\" was subsequently covered by Bryan Ferry, Judith Durham and Ringo Starr. Two other songs from this album were successful in the US: Art Garfunkel's cover of \\"Breakaway\\", topped the Adult Contemporary chart,Whitburn, Joel (2002). Top Adult Contemporary: 1961‚Äì2001. Record Research. p. 99. and Don Williams took \\"Stay Young\\" to No. 1 on the Country record chart,Whitburn, Joel (2004). The Billboard Book Of Top 40 Country Hits: 1944‚Äì2006, Second edition. Record Research. p. 31. which saw the song receive in excess of one million airplays on American radio. The duo also penned and performed \\"A Heart in New York\\", which was later performed by both Simon & Garfunkel and Garth Brooks in their concerts in Central Park, New York to audiences of 500,000 and 750,000, respectively. The pair's original recording of \\"A Heart in New York\\" eventually appeared on 1991's compilation album Heart on My Sleeve ‚Äì The Very Best of Gallagher and Lyle. As session musicians, Gallagher and Lyle also backed numerous big names on disc, including Eric Clapton, Andy Fairweather Low, Gary Brooker and Fairport Convention. The pair also had a stint in former Faces member Ronnie Lane's folk rock band Slim Chance during 1973/74. Gallagher and Lyle split in 1980. Post-Gallagher and Lyle (1981‚Äì2009) In 1981, Graham Lyle formed his own publishing company, Goodsingle Publishing (later to become goodsingle.com), chiefly to administer his own copyrights, and began writing for other artists. His earliest post-Gallagher & Lyle compositions included the singles \\"Our Love\\" for Elkie Brooks and \\"Listen to the Night\\" for Climax Blues Band. Graham's songs were subsequently recorded by some of the biggest names in music including Michael Jackson and Stevie Wonder, Ray Charles, Diana Ross, Etta James, Patti LaBelle, Anita Baker, Joe Cocker, Wyclef Jean, Fat Joe, Rod Stewart, Tom Jones, The Neville Brothers, Hall & Oates, Kenny Rogers, Crystal Gayle, Jim Diamond, The Judds, Wet Wet Wet, Paul Young, Bucks Fizz, Eros Ramazzotti, and Warren G, but it is for his work with Tina Turner that Lyle is best known. Lyle and Terry Britten won the Song of the Year Grammy for \\"What's Love Got to Do with It?\\" and an Ivor Novello award for another of Tina Turner's major international hits, \\"We Don't Need Another Hero\\", which was recorded for the soundtrack of Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome. Tina would prove to be Lyle's biggest money-spinning act; he would co-write another 3 US Hot 100 entries and 6 more British Top 40 hits for her, including 1989's British No.8 hit \\"I Don't Wanna Lose You\\" in collaboration with Albert Hammond. Another high earner for the Lyle-Britten partnership was \\"Just Good Friends\\", which was recorded by Michael Jackson on his multi-million selling album \\"Bad\\" in 1987. Jim Diamond scored a British and Australian No.1 in 1984 with \\"I Should Have Known Better\\", which he wrote with Lyle. Wet Wet Wet's \\"If I Never See You Again\\", co-written by Lyle and Britten, reached No.3 in the UK in 1997. Between 1986 and 1988, Lyle co-authored 3 US Country chart-toppers: \\"Maybe Your Baby's Got the Blues\\" for The Judds,Whitburn, Joel (2004).

Lyle's recordings after 1980 were rare, but included an album with Tom McGuinness, credited to the Lyle McGuinness Band: Acting on Impulse (1983), as well as a solo portfolio album, Something Beautiful Remains (2003). A solo single, \\"Marley\\", was issued on Red Bus in the UK in 1983, while \\"Taking Off\\" ‚Äì a TV advertising jingle, co-written with prolific session keyboardist Billy Livsey and credited to the Lyle-Livsey Band ‚Äì was released on the Dolphin label in 1984, but only in Eire, where it became a Top 20 hit. In 1997, Lyle co-wrote and produced 2 British Top 20 hits for Conner Reeves: \\"My Father's Son\\" (No.12) and \\"Earthbound\\" (No.14). The former song was covered by Joe Cocker. More recently, Lyle performed his composition \\"One Woman\\" at the United Nations in New York (www.un.org/webcast/) on 24 February 2011 to launch their \\"U.N.Woman\\" project. Reunion with Benny Gallagher (2009‚Äì2018) The seeds for a reunion with Benny Gallagher were sown in 2007 when he and Lyle, as session musicians, appeared on an album by Canadian singer-songwriter Chris Tassone; this was recorded at London's Abbey Road studios. In April 2009, soon after Lyle's official retirement, the two Scots attended the opening of the Largs Heritage Centre. The following year, the duo re-formed. In October 2010, the pair staged two charity concerts in Largs in aid of Haylie House, a residential care home in the town. The following month, they received the Tartan Clef for Lifetime Achievement at a ceremony in Glasgow. In June 2011 they performed alongside Midge Ure, Jim Diamond and Marti Pellow as part of 'The Big Gig', an all-star charity concert at Glasgow's Barrowland nightclub. In September of that year, the duo appeared at the outdoor MOARE Festival in Faversham, Kent, which was headlined by former Average White Band stalwart Hamish Stuart. 2012 saw Gallagher and Lyle undertake their first tour since 1979, consisting of 9 dates at 8 Scottish venues. Their two dates at The Green Hotel in Kinross, a large golf resort, earned them the Mundell Music Award for Best UK Performance of the year. In March 2016, Gallagher and Lyle performed together at the Belfast Nashville Songwriters' Festival. In November 2016, the duo returned to The Green Hotel in Kinross for four concerts. The summer of 2017 saw the duo perform as part of the 'Byre at The Botanics' season in St Andrews, and also at the Belladrum Festival in Inverness and the Albany Theatre in Greenock. In March 2018, the duo returned to Belfast to perform once more at the Belfast Nashville Songwriters' Festival. The duo has been inactive since then, following the announcement on Facebook on 13 March 2018 that Benny Gallagher's and the duo's fan pages were to be closed down. Stage musical Caledonia USA, a musical based on the songs of Gallagher and Lyle, was staged in Largs in April 2016.

In 1896 the new local court house was erected adjacent to the old infirmary. In 1901 the cost of running the hospital was investigated by Dr Thomas Henry Lovegrove in his role as Principal Medical Officer for Western Australia and president of the Central Board of Health. The doctor's salary with house, an orderly's salary and the maintenance of patients (including drugs) were estimated at nearly ¬£300 per year. Only 17 patients were treated in 1901‚Äì2. Seriously ill patients were usually taken to Northam hospital, which was much better equipped and only away. Lovegrove concluded that building the hospital was premature and in 1902 it was closed, with the hospital staff being dismissed and most of the fittings and fixtures being sent to a new hospital in Katanning, Western Australia. An epidemic of diphtheria flared up in the district in late 1906 and so in the following year a wing of the hospital reopened.

It is located in the city of Ufa, the Republic of Bashkortostan, Russia. Construction Construction of the bridge began in 1886 and was completed in 1888. The bridge allowed passage for trains across the Belaya River in the direction of Ufa and made possible the construction of the main railway line up to Chelyabinsk (1892). The design was made by Prof. Nikolai Beleloubski, in compliance with the technical rules of 1884. All steelwork elements of the bridge were manufactured at the famous Votkinsk ironworks (now the Votkinsk Machine Building Plant) in Udmurtia, where starting from 1871, open hearth furnaces began to be widely used for the first time in Russia that made it possible to produce rails for the country's railroad network. The bridge consisted of 6 spans, each of 109-meter (358 feet) bowstring arch through trusses with double lattice girders. This design involved careful and exact alignment of truss members and chords manufactured of cast iron that was regarded as a progressive building material for its time. Beleloubski also proposed an innovative constructive solution: the transverse floor-beams of trusses were connected by hinges to bottom chords. Such a type of structural support was considered to be ground-breaking in the days of Beleloubski, because it allowed to reduce secondary stresses in trusses. This design received the Gold medal at the Edinburg Exposition 1890, and later came to be known as \\"the Russian support method\\". 400 px On 8 September 1888, the bridge was solemnly opened to traffic by Minister of Railway Transport, admiral Konstantin Posyet. A pedestrian path was immediately opened on the bridge. For this purpose, special foot sidewalks were made of wood (subsequently the movement of pedestrians was forbidden). The piers were reinforced by starlings (cutwaters) pointing upstream, to break up pieces of ice floating downstream during the annual spring thaw. 270 px In June 1919, the battles of the Russian Civil War took place directly around the town of Ufa. Striving to keep their control over the town at any cost, the retreating troops of Admiral Kolchak detonated the sixth right-bank span of the bridge. One end of the truss fell into the river and was strongly deformed. But this didn't help the Whites to manage their goal, because the famous 25th Rifle Division of Chapaev captured the town on 9 June 1919. With the retreat of Kolchak in Siberia, the assault troops of the Red Army advanced further, while their rear units remained near Ufa on the other bank of the Belaya. Meanwhile, the crossing was in urgent need of rehabilitation. Since there were no adequate facilities or equipment available, manual labor was the only hope. It was decided to use winches to raise the fallen truss back into place. Inch by inch, step by step. Perhaps this is how the heavy stones were raised to the height of the rising pyramids of Egypt. But nobody seemed to care about the times of Antiquity. Ufa rail bridge1919 The restoration works involved approximately 2,500 builders, workers and railway engineers. Day by day, week after week made their work. And the iron mass of the bridge buttressed by scaffolds from a beach didn't towered so hopelessly above the Belaya anymore. As a result, the bridge was successfully restored in that same year by temporarily establishing the damaged truss, followed by a complete overhaul, during which it was replaced with a new structure designed by Prof. Lavr Proskouriakov in compliance with the rules of 1907. Proskouriakov designed the largest rail bridges in Russia over the Yenisey and Amur rivers. Thanks to careful preparation and extraordinary guidance, the bridge builders carried out the replacement of the damaged span with minimal traffic disruption ‚Äî in just 11 hours. It took 7 hours for pushing the old truss span off the piers with the use of jacking system, and 3 hours 45 minutes for putting the new one in place. On October 10, 1919, Vladimir Lenin sent a congratulatory telegram to the bridge-building crew to express his appreciation for their hardwork.  Renovation  There is an old data sheet of the bridge in the archives of the Ufa City Maintenance of Way, which contains the following entry made in 1928: > \\"...Trains with double headed E class steam locomotives and American gondola > cars are not permitted to cross the bridge, during the passage of single > headed E class steam locomotives, the maximum speed shall not exceed 8 km > per hour (5 miles per hour)\\". In the 20th century, the bridge was strengthened and modified several times. Between 1937 and 1939, the span structures were strengthened with oversize removal and addition of reinforcing metal up to 4 per cent of the weight of the span structures. Between 1949 and 1951, the bridge was renovated by the work train 417. On the cutwater side of the piers, pylons for a second track were erected, which were surmounted by unified span structures (designed by Proektstalkonstruktsia in 1944 for class N-7 loads). The replacement of outdated 'tsarist' span structures with advanced ones for class S-14 loads was done by \\"Transstroimost\\" (open joint-stock company) during the period 1991-2001. Thus, by 2001, all the bridge's spans have been equipped with contemporary steelwork elements, so there is no need to be concerned about the strength of the structure and safety of the crossing.  Bridge across the Ufa River  Ufa rail bridge across the Ufa River carries double tracked rail lines over the Ufa River. It is also located in the city of Ufa, near the station of Urakovo (Shaksha). 270 px Its design and history were almost the same as the bridge over the Belaya River. It was built and \\"cured\\" almost the same 2 years later. It was also designed by Prof. Nikolai Beleloubski in compliance with the technical rules of 1884, but had only three spans, each 109 metres (358,432 ft) long. During the Civil War in 1919, the third left- bank span of the bridge was blown up by the Kolchak troops, and collapsed. The explosion was carried out by artillery firing on cars with explosives previously established in the span. In 1920, the destroyed structure was replaced with a new one designed by Prof. Proskouriakov in compliance with the technical rules of 1907. Between 1939 and 1940, the span structures were strengthened with oversize removal and addition of reinforcing metal up to 4 per cent of the weight of the span structures. Between 1951 and 1952, renovation work on the bridge was carried out by the work train ‚Ññ414. On the cutwater side of the piers, pylons for a second track were erected; these were surmounted by unified span structures (designed by Ghiprotrans in 1931 for class N-7 loads). The replacement of outdated 'tsarist' span structures with advanced ones for class S-14 loads was done by \\"USK MOST\\" (open joint-stock company) during the period 2001-2002. 600 px Interesting facts * When the bridge was completed in 1888, an artificial channel was dug out to straighten the course of the Dyoma River. It begins approximately 100 metres (329 ft) downstream of the present-day highway bridge near the cafe 'Goldfish', and runs towards the Belaya directly. The river channel was straightened in order to avoid duplication of bridge crossing over the Dyoma River. In fact, the Dyoma formerly emptied itself into the Belaya a few kilometres downstream, into its present oxbow lake, which had been the main channel until 1854. The present-day course of the Belaya River, which now girdles about Nizhegorodka (the Lower city) was then a wide duct, exceedingly low, in fact fordable in many places. The area that surrounds now Kozorez village was a big island then. * The first color pictures of the rail bridge across the Belaya were taken by Sergey Prokudin-Gorsky in 1910. Photography was carried out by the method of registering on a single glass plate three separate black and white images taken through the blue, green and red filters. * Slightly further upstream of the bridge lies a small island that changes annually its outlines, becoming a peninsula in the summer. The emergence of the island is connected to the fact that two barges carrying bread sank in this place at the beginning of the 20th century, which formed the basis for further sedimentation.

Establishment The division began being raised in September 1916 by the Provisional Government of National Defence, as part of its efforts to raise its own army for service alongside the Allies on the Macedonian front. These efforts entailed the establishment of four infantry divisions to be recruited in the areas controlled by the government (Crete, the Aegean islands, and Macedonia). The Serres Division (ŒúŒµœÅŒ±œÅœáŒØŒ± Œ£ŒµœÅœÅ·ø∂ŒΩ), under Colonel Nikolaos Christodoulou, was the first division to be formed, as it could draw on the limited forces already available to the Provisional Government: the remnants of the disbanded IV Army Corps who had fled the Bulgarian advance and the Corps' capitulation to Thasos. These were officers and men from the 6th Infantry Division's 17th and 18th infantry regiments and the 6th Mountain Artillery Battlion; 7th Infantry Division's 2/21 Cretan Regiment, and IV Corps' 7th Field Artillery Regiment. The division's manpower was completed by volunteers, both from within Greece and from Greek communities abroad (Constantinople, Asia Minor, Thrace, and the Dodecanese), as well as recruits mobilized‚Äîsometimes by force‚Äîby the Provisional Government. Macedonian front, 1916‚Äì1918 The 1st Serres Regiment (1Œø Œ£œçŒΩœÑŒ±Œ≥ŒºŒ± Œ£ŒµœÅœÅ·ø∂ŒΩ) under Major Georgios Mavroudis was formed from the 17th and 2/21 Regiment, as well as the depot of the 9th Infantry Division. On 24‚Äì28 November, it assembled under French command at Axioupoli. On 1 December, two of its battalions assumed a front sector at Fanos. The 2nd Serres Regiment (2Œø Œ£œçŒΩœÑŒ±Œ≥ŒºŒ± Œ£ŒµœÅœÅ·ø∂ŒΩ) under Major Charalambos Tseroulis formed two of its battalions from the 18th Regiment's men, as well as taking over the \\"National Defence Battalion\\" (Œ§Œ¨Œ≥ŒºŒ± ·ºòŒ∏ŒΩŒπŒ∫·øÜœÇ ·ºàŒºœçŒΩŒ∑œÇ) that had already been deployed on the front in the Strymon River sector. The rest of the regiment also went to the same sector, under British command. However, after an attack by its 1st Battalion in the Neos Skopos area resulted heavy casualties (13 dead, 104 wounded), the entire regiment was withdrawn from the front and sent to the Fanos area; numerous desertions occurred at that time. The 3rd Serres Regiment (3Œø Œ£œçŒΩœÑŒ±Œ≥ŒºŒ± Œ£ŒµœÅœÅ·ø∂ŒΩ) was formed by one battalion from the 2/21 Regiment, one battalion of Cretan volunteers, and one battalion of volunteers from Samos and Asia Minor. Its formation was delayed, and it was not until the end of the year that the entire division assembled to the south of Axioupoli.

The band has played over 300 shows, 1 European tour, 5 festivals (Beeckestijn Pop, Occultfest, Strudelfest, Bashfest and Metalcon) and have released a successful music video on YouTube titled Corruption. Being the young band they are, State of Negation has left a great impression with both audience and professionals: ‚ÄúYoung, talented and an incredible sense of performance!‚Äù With the coming of their debut EP, Project Payback, released in early 2013, they made quite a step forward by doing support for Suicide Silence in Patronaat, Haarlem, leaving a great impression and convincing many people of their talent. The band's main musical influences are Lamb of God, Trivium and Machine Head, which listeners will definitely hear back in both music and lyrics, which are based on political issues, personal experiences, religion and a hint of rebellion. History State of Negation was formed in the summer of 2010 as just a fun project consisting of Casper Leijen, Mike van Bekkum, Pim Nijssen, Tristan Jacobs and Sang-Jae Kouwenberg. Sang-Jae left the band in 2011 but before he left he did contribute on their Single \\"Corruption\\". He was replaced by drummer Mike de Vries who contributed on both their EPs. Pim Nijssen left in 2014 and was replaced by Maurice ter Velde. After playing 30 shows together with bands like Purest of Pain, Pound, Gottlieb and Die for the Purpose of Living they were selected out of 41 bands to get a change to win the Dutch Metal 2011. Among others, State of Negation has shared the stage with The Charm The Fury, Ethereal, Suicide Silence, 3rd Machine, Purest of Pain, Divine Sins, Illucinoma and Onslaught. The video for Corruption was made available online on 22 June 2011 on YouTube and is featured as a Bonus Track on Project Payback and has had over 6500 views. As of 4 March 2014 State of Negation has replaced guitarist Pim Nijssen who left 14 February 2014 with guitarist Maurice ter Velde who introduced himself in a band posted YouTube video. September 2014 State of Negation cancelled future shows stating they will explain this later. They posted of 24 September 2014 officially that their drummer Mike de Vries left the band. They were unclear about having a replacement or not but assured that they wouldn't disband. On December 11 there was shown some art on their Facebook page with an unknown person named Dennis among the band. This later turned out to be their new drummer. On January 29, 2015 State of Negation officially introduced their new drummer to the audience: Dennis kraakman. Before this he already played some gigs with the band and was in favour of his performance. On April 3, 2015 State of Negation officially announced they're break-up as a result from continuous problems like the departure of Mike de Vries and not being able to spend enough time with the band. The band had the following to say about this: > \\"...But the last year has been a difficult one for us.We‚Äôve had to let go 2 > bandmembers, cancelled some promising shows and we‚Äôve been struggling a lot > with investing time into the growth of this band. All of us have a busy > daily life and while we‚Äôve all done our best to keep State our number 1 > priority, it has become increasingly hard to focus our time...\\" State of Negation would play their final concert on 10 April 2015 in Sugarfactory Amsterdam headlining the 'Shatter The Universe event'. They gave away all of their merchandise for free and played all of their songs including a song originally written for the studio album that would never be made. This song is called \\"The Human Realm\\" which was also made a shirt of. =Project Payback= State of Negation recorded their debut EP without drummer Sang-Jae Kouwenberg who had previously worked with them on \\"Corruption\\" It was released on February 1, 2013.

The school is run by Major Redfern Kelly, whose secretary Jennifer Evans wonders why it took Conway four months to come inquire about his son. Conway explains that he had been in Pakistan the past few months on a business project and only recently found out that the boy's mother, now deceased, had sent him to this exclusive academy with the $10,000 tuition. He asks to see his son's records and to speak to a student, Crip Hastings, who might have witnessed the boy's death. Jennifer is having an affair with the married Kelly and warns the major not to let Conway speak to the Hastings boy. Three cadets begin to harass Conway, attempting to provoke him into a fight. They taunt Crip as well, warning him to say nothing. Conway learns that his son was accidentally killed by the cadets in a brutal initiation rite. On the boat home, Jennifer pretends to help, but has arranged an ambush. It backfires as she falls into shark-infested waters while Conway sets the boat ablaze with Kelly aboard.

The name comes from Mattenburg as it was the place where the millers used to store flour in Matten (silos). The street runs from Ostertorstra√üe in a southwesterly direction curving slightly westwards before reaching the Tiefer near the river. Sidestreets include Kolpingstra√üe, Hinter der Balge and Schnoor. The street follows the old city wall which forms the rear of the houses on the eastern side, sometimes being used as part of their foundations. Many of the buildings to the south of Kolpingstra√üe are old listed buildings, several of which have been restored. Schnoorviertel Redevelopment In the 1980s and 1990s, both sides of the Marterburg to the north of Kolpingstra√üe were redeveloped with residential and commercial buildings designed by Wolfram Goldapp and Thomas Klumpp. They sought to contribute to the character of this part of the old town by introducing the Postmodern style. The colourful, playfully conceived frontages contrast with the plain office buildings in the surroundings. The 27 houses included in the project have shops or offices on the ground floor with apartments in the upper storeys. Although the buildings have been criticized by some on the grounds of pseudoindividuality, most locals appreciate them and visitors count them among the city's attractions. Antique Museum The Antikenmuseum im Schnoor located at No. 55-58 Martenburg exhibits one of Germany's finest collections of Greek vases with pieces from 560 BC to 350 BC, all from Athens. Legend There is an old legend which purports to explain the name \\"Marterburg\\". It is said that at the beginning of the 10th century, a horde of Huns invaded the city, setting fire to the cathedral. They were frightened away by a thunderstorm, some of them seeking refuge in the narrow streets of the old town. But the housewives on either side of the street poured boiling oil on them from the upper windows, causing them all to suffer a martyr-like death.

Being completely decentralized means that no one is able to shut it down, as there is no single point to attack. The system uses end-to-end encryption to safeguard communications. It is based on both BitTorrent and Bitcoin-like protocols and is considered a (distributed) Twitter clone. Overview Twister is a Twitter-like microblogging platform that utilizes the same blockchain technology as Bitcoin, and the file exchange method from BitTorrent, both based on P2P technologies. Twister is experimental software in alpha phase, implemented as a distributed file sharing system. User registration and authentication is provided by a Bitcoin-like network, so it is completely distributed and does not depend on any central authority. Distribution of posts uses Kademlia distributed hash table (DHT) network and BitTorrent-like swarms, both provided by libtorrent. Included versions of both Bitcoin and libtorrent are highly patched, and intentionally not interoperable with the already existing networks. Miguel Freitas, aiming to build a censor- resistant public posting platform, began development on Twister in July 2013 to address the concerns of free speech and privacy. Building off the work of Bitcoin and Bittorrent, he was able to have the core working by October 2013. Lucas Leal was hired to create HTML and CSS for the user interface, with Miguel writing required JavaScript code. 2,500 user accounts were registered in the first six days of operation. As a completely decentralized network, no one is capable of incapacitating Twister since there is not a unique point of attack to the system. Twister uses end-to-end encryption to protect the communications. Furthermore, Twister is designed to prevent other users from knowing your GSM localization, IP address, and who you are following. Users can publish public messages as with other microblogging platforms, but when they send direct messages and private messages to other users, these are protected from unsolicited access.  History  The Brazilian computer engineer and programmer, Miguel Freitas, started developing the new social network after learning about the massive spy programs of the USA's National Security Agency (NSA) as revealed by the NSA whistle-blower Edward Snowden. He started to worry about the accessibility of that amount of information under the control of a single company under American jurisdiction. According to Freitas, Twitter has been the social network that has helped the most to promote democracy and to organize protests, as the magazine 'Wired' claims. He believes that massive surveillance by the likes of the NSA makes it dangerous to provide personal information to the social networks that currently exist. For this reason he decided to build a new system based on privacy-preserving technology. Freitas used to believe that in the future, social networks would be based on decentralized protocols and with no central point of control. But on learning that existing social networks were already massively compromised by the state he began to take action with the development an alternative service based closely on Twitter. After a while, Miguel and his developer, Lucas Leal, considered the alpha version of the application for Android, Linux and OS X. The versions for Windows and iPhone aren‚Äôt planned, but, since it is open source, any of them is free to migrate the application for other operating systems. Even though the project is in this moment in alpha phase, Brian Armstrong, co-founder of Coinbase, believes that it is a great example of how the open protocol of Bitcoin can be used with diverse purposes.  Technology = Protocols = Twister is a distributed system, it works as a peer-to-peer program. Unlike other decentralized networks (like pump.io / Identi.ca, StatusNet / GNU social or Diaspora), it doesn't require you to use your own server or doesn‚Äôt require you to trust on a third one in order to use it.  Bitcoin  This is achieved through the bitcoin protocol (not through the net used by the cryptocurrency). Basically, the protocol handles the register of users and the accesses. In the same way the miners verify the transactions on the bitcoin network to secure that no one makes a double spent, Twister network verifies the users names and that the messages belonging to a specific user are really from that user.  BitTorrent  The messages are driven through the BitTorrent protocol. This allows keeping a distribution system of a great number of messages along the network in a fast and efficient way; and also, allows the users to receive notifications almost instantly about new messages and alerts ‚Äì all of it without the necessity of a central server. Since Twister uses end-to-end encryption, if intercepted the private direct messages cannot be read by any other person apart from the addressee. The code used is the elliptic curve cryptography (different from the one used by NSA) that is used in Bitcoin. It is thought to give a security level similar to a RSA code of 3072 bits. The data isn‚Äôt stored anywhere, so it can‚Äôt be used by any other cut. As a consequence, if you lose your entry password, it is impossible for you to access your private messages. Because it is a peer-to-peer system, there isn‚Äôt a central server from which your publications may be compiled (see PRISM). As Freitas explains, the system is designed in a way that the users can‚Äôt know if the other is online, their IP address, or what messages have been read. This information isn‚Äôt registered anywhere. Despite this, Freitas warns to the users that anonymity may not be total depending on the circumstances. = Platforms = thumbnail Twister was developed under the Linux environment. Freitas has migrated successfully the system to Android and OS X. Another long-term interesting objective would be moving the whole cryptographic code of the implementation to the interface of the user of the browser. This way, the users would be capable of accessing Twister through any client platform that they use, choosing any third server and still maintaining the security of their private passwords at all times.  Functionality  The first Twister prototype is intended for reproducing the basic characteristics of any microblogging platform. Including: * Search of users and profiles of navigation * Follow / Unfollow * Sending of text messages limited to 140 characters * Broadcasting and answering messages * Browsing through mailing routes, mentions, hashtags and direct messages (private) The private messages require the addressee to be follower of the speaker, which is a common requisite in most of the existing platforms. Some other characteristics can be difficult to implement in a completely decentralized system, requiring more effort. This includes the arbitrary register of the words in the posts and the recompilation of hashtaghs to find out the main tendencies.  Security  Twister uses the same parameters of elliptic curves as Bitcoin: secp256k1. This isn‚Äôt the curve that was usually implicated by the NSA, called sec256r1. A 256 bits of Public-key cryptography (no comprometido), ECC must proportionate a security similar to a key RSA of 3072 bits (at least that is what is said by the experts) . They usually stimulate the people who try to break the security in the systems with something that everyone desires, money. There are millions of $ USD on the table, coded with keys secp256k1 Bitcoin. The direct application of messages encoding is based on an example code that was published on the Internet by Ladar Levison of Lavabit. It is known that Ladar took his service down because he denied cooperating with the US government that allows the control of all its clients. = Decentralized Net = Twister is a platform of microblogging peer-to-peer. This means that the communication is established between computers without going through a central node that would be the one who recorded the information. There is not a company behind that provides the server or the machinery used, and that can detect in that case the conversations. = Censored = People who run a node can delete your posts in the DHT, but not block your account. = Completely private = Due to the fact that the messages are sent directly from a user to another, without going through a central node, and also, in an encrypted way, ‚Äì from beginning to end, it is encrypted on the exit and decrypted on the arrival ‚Äì they travel in a private way through the web as a black-box. Besides, the IP directions are also protected. = Anonymity = In this application, our IP (the direction of our machine to go into the internet) is not recorded at any moment avoiding being followed by some entity or company. According to Freitas, this guarantees the anonymity but does not mean that our IP won‚Äôt be detected from the ISP (Internet service provider) but that the content of the message won‚Äôt be visible except for some spy that knows how to decrypt breaking the algorithms. In order to be 100% anonymous, you would have to use a browser that masks the IP such as Tor or another one similar protecting more against spies.

Simco said in 1984 that \\"It has been strongly influenced by the geology and topography of the area, particularly by the south-west/north-east boulder clay ridge along which the parish boundary runs.\\" There is currently no public access to Hanger Wood.  History  Before the construction of Stagsden Golf Course, which lies directly to the west of the wood, trial excavations uncovered several features that were evidence of a late Iron Age and Romano- British settlement: a ditch-surrounded enclosure was found, along with pits, gullies, a possible hearth, pottery and an animal burial. Cropmarks showing two rectilinear enclosures north-east of Hanger Wood and adjacent to the parish boundary with Kempston Rural could also be seen; these probably had similar Iron Age or Romano-British origin. The woodland was cleared to a great extent through the Iron Age and Romano-British periods; before clearance the natural vegetation had been woodland. In medieval times Hanger Wood was managed through a common field system, which persisted till the 19th century. The wood is referred to as early as the year 1200, in the Middle Ages, Hanger Wood provided timber and underwood for Stagsden. Hanger Wood's antiquity is shown by the rich and diverse number of species, an indicator of ancient woodland, and by its sinewy boundaries, especially at the south-western end of the wood. The south-east boundary is of special historical interest, due to its location along the line of a boundary that is ancient and possibly even pre-historic. The parish of Stagsden was enclosed in 1838, leading to a large re-organization of the previous field boundaries, although some evidence of the old system still persists.  Site of Special Scientific Interest  Described by Natural England as a Site of Special Scientific Interest having \\"one of the best remaining examples of wet ash-maple woodland in Bedfordshire\\", Hanger Wood is an ancient semi-natural woodland that retains characteristics of its coppice-with-standards historic management regime; the wood is located on poorly drained soils of boulder clay and was notified as an SSSI in 1988 under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. Hanger Wood's canopy is dominated by mature penduculate oak (Quercus robur) and ash (Fraxinus excelsior) standards, with midland hawthorn (Crataegus laevigata) as well as hazel (Corylus avellana) coppice dominating the shrub layer. Wayfaring tree (Viburnum lantana) and spindle (Euonymus europaeus) are largely restricted to the margins of the wood, whilst blackthorn (Prunus spinosa) can be found forming dense thickets. The ground flora is dominated by bluebell (Hyacinthoides non-scripta) and dog's mercury (Mercurialis perennis), whilst in drier areas bramble (Rubus fruticosus) can be found. Supported by the wood's rides, plants of marshy grassland communities are found, such as false fox-sedge (Carex otrubae), angelica (Angelica sylvestris), valerian (Valeriana officinalis), meadowsweet (Filipendula ulmaria) and pendulous sedge (Carex pendula). Other plants common only in ancient woodlands that are also found in Hanger Wood include herb paris (Paris quadrifolia, a species uncommon in Bedfordshire), wood millet (Milium effusum), wood melick (Melica uniflora), yellow archangel (Lamiastrum galeobdolon), wood anemone (Anemone nemorosa) and wood sedge (Carex sylvatica).

He was elected Badshah Sahib (king) of Swat by a loya jirga held at Kabal in November 1918, and was recognized by the British authorities as ruler and formally installed as WƒÅli of Swat in Saidu Sharif on 3 May 1926. He ruled from 1918 to 1949, when he abdicated in favour of his eldest son, Miangul Jahan Zeb.  Early life and struggle for power  Miangul Sir Abdul Wadud was born in Saidu Sharif in 1881 in a powerful Safi tribe. He was the elder son of Miangul Abdul Khaliq, and grandson on the maternal side of Aman ul-Mulk, Mehtar of Chitral. He was educated privately. In 1915, when the tribes of Upper Swat elected Sayed Abdul Jabbar Shah as their king, he opposed the election and went into exile at Dalbar from 1915-1916. Abdul Jabbar could not defend the territory in a counterattack on Nawab of Dir in 1916. Anarchy ensued. Abdul Wadud returned and took up arms against Abdul Jabbar in 1916. As a result, the Jirga of Swat decided to oust Abdul Jabbar king and appointed Abdul Wadud, a grandson of the Akhund of Swat, to replace him in 1917. Abdul Wadud established his rule in Swat and annexed Buner and Chakesar to his dominion. By 1923, he controlled most of the Swat area.  WƒÅli of Swat  Abdul Wadud was proclaimed the WƒÅli of Swat in 1926 with an annual allowance of 10,000 rupees from the government of India. He had three wives, eight daughters and four sons. Though he was elected king and was locally known as \\"Bacha\\" or \\"Badshah\\", meaning \\"king,\\" the British authorities only granted him the title of WƒÅli, which refers to a religious ruler. Abdul Wadud wanted the title of king but was denied by the British political authorities on the basis that no ruler in India was a king, and that only the King-Emperor in Britain had the right to be styled in such a manner. Abdul Wadud acceded to Pakistan in late 1947. He abdicated in favour of his eldest son, Miangul Jahan Zeb, on 12 December 1949. Jahan Zeb ruled Swat until its merger with Pakistan in 1969.

More than 20 sculptors, both internationally renowned and newcomers, took part. Symposium The first action undertaken by the Greek Marble Initiative was to present one of the biggest symposiums of sculpture in Greece, as a continuous project producing sculptures of marble. In addition to marble, some of the finest bronze sculptors found their way to the project. By the official date that the symposium ended, 26 sculptors had joined the initiative. They produced a total of 58 monumental and more than 200 smaller pieces, constituting a world record of output for a contemporary sculpture symposium. Legacy Although 22 August 2013 was officially the conclusion day, some of the sculptors continue working, giving birth to new pieces on the premises of Myrœå Antiques House, where the symposium took place.

He is the former Prosecuting Attorney of Spokane County, Washington. He is prominently known as the prosecuting attorney in the 1981 rape trial of Kevin Coe. After Coe was convicted of a series of rapes in Spokane's South Hill neighborhood, Spokane County Superior Court Judge George Shields sentenced him to a Life sentence, plus 75 years. Three months later, Coe's mother was arrested for attempting to solicit a \\"hit man\\" to murder Shields and make Brockett an \\"addlepated vegetable in diapers for the rest of his life\\" . The rape case became the subject of Jack Olson's book, Son: A Psychopath and his Victims, which was later adapted into the 1991 film, Sins of the Mother (1991 TV film). After his retirement, Brockett served as an attorney with the Spokane, Washington law firm of Phillabaum, Ledlin, Matthews & Sheldin, PLLC. As of 2015, Brockett is retired from law practice.  Personal background  Brockett was born on July 8, 1936 in Chicago, Illinois. When he was six years old, the family moved to Los Angeles and then Santa Barbara, California, before arriving in Spokane in 1947. He attended Lewis and Clark High School, graduating in 1954, and Gonzaga University School of Law, graduating with a Bachelor of Laws (LLB) in 1961. He is married to the former Jean Corigliano, and together they had five children. As of 2015 they now have 13 grandchildren and 9 great-grandchildren. On January 8, 1987, his daughter was reported missing after failing to return to the Ellensburg, Washington airport in a Cessna 150 that she and her friend had rented. After families and friends of the two women continued searching, the plane was found two months later, and Lisa Brockett and her friend Christine Karstetter, who was flying the plane, were found dead in the wreckage in a rugged ravine located 15 miles from the Ellensburg airport.  Professional background  Following his graduation from Gonzaga Law School in 1961, Brockett became a Spokane County Deputy Prosecuting Attorney, serving in that capacity until 1969. Upon the 1969 retirement of the incumbent Prosecuting Attorney George Kain, Brockett was appointed by the Spokane County Board of Commissioners to replace Kain as the Prosecuting Attorney. He was subsequently elected to the position by voters in 1970. He was re-elected several time as he continued to serve in this capacity until the end of 1994, when he retired. He entered private practice with Phillabaum, Ledlin, Matthews & Sheldon, PLLC in 1997. = Prominent cases and book = Donald Brockett was involved in the cases of Kevin Coe, Billy Worl, Al Hegge, and three death penalty cases. He argued many cases in the Supreme and Appellate courts of Washington and argued a case, Aldinger v. Howard, 427 U.S. 1, (1976) in the United States Supreme Court. In 2015 he published the book \\"The Tyrannical Rule of the U.S. Supreme Court, How the Court has violated the Constitution.\\" To see more about the book and to order it go to the website criticalbookspublications.comedits by me, Donald C.

Wrap with Love is an Australian charitable organisation, founded in 1992 by Sonia Gidley-King, OAM, to produce knitted wraps (used as blankets) as gifts for people who have exposed to the cold and susceptible to hypothermia and especially those who have experienced loss and trauma as a result of war. The wraps are knitted, transported and assembled by volunteers. Over 30,000 volunteers around Australia have been involved in the project and more than a quarter of a million woollen wraps have been produced. The wraps are created by knitting 28 equally sized squares in garter stitch, sewn together into blankets of 4 x 7 squares. Although simple, this formula allows for an almost unlimited variety and the resulting wrap is a unique possession for its final owner. Some wraps incorporate a single stylised kangaroo as a symbol of their origin. Knit-in Detail of knitted wrap square with kangaroo motif In 2003, ABC Sydney Radio Station 702 ABC Sydney and ABC Local Radio created the \\"knit in\\", so named after the \\"sit-in\\" form of direct action protest, to support the movement and increase awareness of the Wrap with Love cause. Presenter Angela Catterns is credited with the \\"Knit-In\\" idea. Other knitting events have been held at a variety of community halls and local libraries across the country. Collection and distribution Finished wraps are collected by over twenty non-denominational and non-political aid agencies and taken to a warehouse in Alexandria, New South Wales from where they are distributed to other charities working directly with communities in need. For example, as of 2012 World Vision Australia had distributed to Armenia, Romania, Afghanistan, Mongolia, Zambia, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, Laos and Thailand. In 2013 they distributed a further 10,180 hand-knitted blankets and wraps to Burundi, Malawi, Mongolia, Swaziland, Uganda and Zimbabwe.

Written in 1860‚Äì62, it is the second and, at an average duration of 25 minutes, the largest piece from Six Pi√®ces pour Grand Orgue. It is dedicated to the composer Charles-Valentin Alkan.  Background  The Six Pi√®ces are an important work of the composer, marking the beginning of the second period of his career and predicting the flowering in his later creative life. His long struggle on the comic opera Le Valet de ferme (1851‚Äì1853) ended with a disastrous failure of the production and a disappointment, which paralysed Franck‚Äôs activity as a composer for several years. The influence of the phantastic new Cavaill√©-Coll organ at Sainte-Clotilde, Paris, for which he was appointed first organist in 1859, encouraged him to resume composing. Japanese composer Akio Yashiro found out that, in comparison to the c major Fantaisie Op.16 (Six Pi√®ces, No. 1), Franck now makes extensive use of all possibilities of the organ.Although Yashiro wrote the name of church as Church of Saint-Sulpice inconsistently, this is assumed to be Saint-Clotilde from the view of Franck's history as an organist. Grande pi√®ce symphonique is written in a single movement, which may be divided into three parts, the second of them being the Andante with a scherzo-like middle section. This feature of the work, sometimes referred to as \\"organ symphony\\", has induced comparison with his later chef-d‚Äô≈ìuvre, the Symphony in D minor. Yashiro regarded this work as prototype of the symphony, based on the following four reasons: # Unity of the cyclic form, ‚Äúth√®me cyclique‚Äù # Similarity of the cyclic themes in both works # Scherzo is embedded in the slow movement # Conclusion with \\"joy of faith\\" in parallel major. In addition, Yashiro pointed out that this work shares several features with some of composer's later masterpieces. The work‚Äôs dedicatee, the virtuoso pianist and composer Charles Valentin Alkan, had written a symphony for solo piano a few years earlier, as part of the Douze √âtudes dans tous les tons mineurs, Op. 39, published in 1857, which also included the celebrated concerto for solo piano. Franck highly praised Alkan and arranged some of his piano pieces for organ.e.g. \\"Prelude and Payer\\", 1889. The score was published as part of the ‚ÄúSix pi√®ces pour Grand-Orgue‚Äù by Mme. Maeyen-Couvreur, Paris. Around 1878, there was a reissue by Durand.  Structure  Although the work is written as a single movement, it can be divided into three parts. In this section, the work is going to be analyzed as consisting of three movements. = First movement = Andantino serioso 4/4 F-sharp minor The work starts with an introduction, presenting the thematic material, which will determine the piece. Excerpt 1 \\\\relative c' { ew PianoStaff << ew Staff { \\\\key fis \\\\minor \\\\time 4/4 \\\\tempo \\"Andantino serioso\\" \\\\clef bass \\\\set crescendoText = \\\\markup { \\\\italic { Rall } } \\\\set crescendoSpanner = #'text \\\\override DynamicTextSpanner #'style = #'dotted-line fis,8 a cis a fis e d cis b d fis d b a gis fis eis d' eis, fis g d' g, gis a d fis\\\\< a gis cis bis gis' gis1\\\\fermata\\\\\\\\! } ew Staff { \\\\key fis \\\\minor \\\\time 4/4 \\\\clef bass 8 4 8 8 4 8 8 4 8 8 4 8 [ ] 1\\\\fermata _\\\\markup {(pedal)} } >> } Excerpt 2 \\\\relative c' { ew PianoStaff << ew Staff \\\\with { \\\\remove \\"Time_signature_engraver\\" } { \\\\key fis \\\\minor \\\\time 4/4 << { \\\\voiceOne gis8 ^\\\\markup {\\\\italic {Quasi ad libitum. } }( eis4 cis8 cis4 bis)  a'8( fis4 dis8 \\\\times 2/3 { dis[ eis cis~] } cis4\\\\fermata) } ew Voice { \\\\voiceTwo gis2. fis4  bis8 a4 fis8 fis4 eis } >> } ew Staff \\\\with { \\\\remove \\"Time_signature_engraver\\" } { \\\\key fis \\\\minor \\\\time 4/4 \\\\clef bass 8( 4 8 4 )  8( 4 8 4 \\\\fermata) } >> } Excerpt 3 \\\\relative c' ew Staff \\\\with { \\\\remove \\"Time_signature_engraver\\" } { \\\\key fis \\\\minor \\\\time 4/4 << { \\\\voiceOne cis'8 b8\\\\rest e2 fis8 gis gis4 cis,2 dis8 e e4 dis8 cis cis4 bis4 } ew Voice { \\\\voiceTwo e,8 s8 cis'2 b4 a1 r8 fis16( gis a4) r8 fis16( gis a4) } >> } Excerpt 1 is played two times on Grand Orgue, and is answered by excerpt 2 on R√©cit. Excerpt 1 then time appears on pedal and Grand Orgue, accompanied by excerpt 3. After a brief climax in the introduction, the first subject of the sonata form appears (excerpt 4), which ties the whole work as a cyclic theme. Yashiro pointed out the similarity between this theme and that of Franck‚Äôs symphony in D minor. Excerpt 4 \\\\relative c { ew Staff { \\\\key fis \\\\minor \\\\time 2/2 \\\\clef bass \\\\tempo \\"Allegro non troppo e maestoso\\" << { r2 d4. cis8 a' r gis r fis2 ~ fis8 r r4 d4. cis8 e r d r cis2 ~ cis8 r r4 d4. cis8 b r a r gis r fis r a2 b2 bis8 r cis2. cis8 r d2. d8 r eis,2. } >> } } A chorale-like second subject is introduced in A major after contrapuntal expansion of the first subject, as in traditional sonata form. A recapitulation of excerpt 2 follows and the concluding triplet is extended, forming a streaming accompaniment to excerpt 4, this time played in the Positif. Finally, the recapitulation begins with the first subject in the pedals, followed by the second subject in F-sharp minor. Excerpt 2 then reemerges and ends with a profound, lingering echo (molto lento, fermata). = Second movement = Andante 4/4 B major The movement starts with a graceful melody (excerpt 5) deduced from excerpt 3, frequently switching between Positif and R√©cit. Excerpt 5In the second bar of middle stave, the note b is tied to following note. ew StaffGroup \\\\with { systemStartDelimiter = #'SystemStartBar } << ew GrandStaff << ew Staff \\\\relative c' { \\\\key b \\\\major \\\\time 4/4 \\\\tempo \\"Andante\\" dis'4\\\\p( e fis4.) b,8( dis4 e8.[ eis16] fis2) fisis4( gis8.[ dis16] eis4 fis8.[ b,16] dis4 e8.[ cis16] b!2) } ew Staff \\\\relative c' { \\\\key b \\\\major \\\\time 4/4 \\\\clef bass 4( 2 << { \\\\voiceOne b4~ cis8.[ cisis16] s2 s1 s4 cis8.[ e16] 2 } ew Voice { \\\\voiceTwo fis,4 2 4 4 fis2 } >> } >> ew Staff \\\\relative c' { \\\\key b \\\\major \\\\time 4/4 \\\\clef bass b,1~ b1 dis4 gis, cis fis, fisis fis b2 } >> The conclusion of the melody of excerpt 5 is interrupted by a scherzo (Allegro, 2/4, B minor). It is filled with rapid semiquavers derived from the cyclic theme (excerpt 4). The end of the scherzo part, which in itself comprises a ternary form, leads into a shortened recapitulation of excerpt 5 in B major. = Third movement = The third movement begins with a recapitulation of themes from the previous parts, in a similar way as Beethoven did in the finale of his ninth symphony. As with Beethoven, a recitativo from the basses (i.e. the pedals), formed from motifs of excerpt 4, links the reappearances of the theme from the introduction (excerpt 1 in G minor), the scherzo theme in B-flat major and the Andante theme in C major).

Biography Adelaide's parents were Count Otto of Savoy and his wife Adelaide of Susa from the Arduinici noble family. Her maternal grandparents were Margrave Ulric Manfred II of Turin and Bertha of Milan. Adelaide was the younger sister of Bertha of Savoy, who was betrothed to the future king Henry IV of Germany in 1055. According to the Europ√§ische Stammtafeln genealogy, she first was married to Count Guigues I of Albon, though this assumption seems highly unlikely. Actually Adelaide, around 1060/62 and aged about ten, married the Swabian duke Rudolf of Rheinfelden. In 1069 Rudolf attempted to repudiate Adelaide for an alleged affair with Count Werner of Habsburg.Hlawitschka, ‚ÄòZur Herkunft,‚Äô pp. 191ff; . In 1071 Adelaide cleared herself of the accusation of adultery in the presence of Pope Alexander II. Rudolf was required to reconcile with Adelaide.Previt√©-Orton, Early History, p. 232 At the same time, Henry IV attempted to repudiate her sister Bertha, also without success. In 1077, an assembly of revolting German princes elected Rudolf anti-king. He was crowned by Archbishop Siegfried I of Mainz on March 26, with Adelaide as his consort. When the Great Saxon Revolt broke out, Adelaide remained in Swabia, defending her husband's lands, whilst Rudolf campaigned against Henry IV in Saxony.Bernold, Chronicon, a.1077, 289; Meyer von Knonau, Jahrb√ºcher, III, pp. 38f. Adelaide died during the Easter period of 1079, apart from her husband at Hohentwiel Castle. She was buried in the monastery of St. Blasien. Issue With Rudolf, Adelaide had at least four children: * Agnes of Rheinfelden, married Berthold II of Z√§hringen * Adelaide of Rheinfelden, married King Ladislaus I of Hungary * Bertha of Rheinfelden, Countess of Kellm√ºnz, married Ulrich X, Count of Bregenz * Otto (died young) * Berthold of Rheinfelden (disputed) NotesReferences *E.

The son of the governor of Bust, Maymandi was raised as the foster brother of the Ghaznavid prince Mahmud, and would first start his administrative career as the head of the department of correspondences of Khorasan. He would thereafter rapidly rise to higher offices, finally becoming the vizier of the Ghaznavid dynasty in 1013, which would last until 1024, when he was arrested due to the great amount of wealth that he had gained, which the suspicious Mahmud disliked. However, after a brief civil war, which ended in 1030, Maymandi was freed by Mahmud's son Mas'ud I, who offered him the chance of becoming vizier again. He first rejected the offer, but later accepted in 1031. Maymandi's second vizierate would only last one year, when he died at Herat. He was succeeded by Ahmad Shirazi.  Biography = Origins and early career = Mahmud receiving a robe of honor from the Abbasid caliph al-Qadir, thus legitimizing Mahmud as an independent monarch. Ahmad Maymandi's father, Hasan Maymandi, was from a town named Maymand in Zabulistan, a region known for its popular traditions about the mythological Iranian warrior Rostam. Hasan was the governor of Bust under Mahmud's father, Sabuktigin, whose kingdom was then a vassal state of the Samanids, who were the lords of Khorasan, and ruled much of the region through their vassals. During Hasan's governorship of Bust, Sabuktigin crucified him, an action which Sabuktigin later regretted. Maymandi was the foster brother and school-fellow of Mahmud, who was also from Zabulistan on his maternal side. Maymandi began his administrative career in 994 as head of the department of correspondence during Mahmud's governorship of Khorasan under his Samanid overlords. Maymandi was later promoted to chief accountant and head of the military department. He was also appointed as governor of Bust and Rukhkhaj. Sabuktigin died in 997, and was succeeded by his son Ismail as the ruler of the Ghaznavid dynasty. Mahmud, who had more administrative experience than his brother, claimed the throne for himself, and the following year managed to defeat his brother and gain control over the Ghaznavid dynasty. Mahmud quickly began increasing his independence from the Samanids, and eventually divided the Samanid state with the Karakhanids, ending the Samanid dynasty. = First vizierate and downfall = The first vizier of Mahmud was a Persian named Abu'l-Hasan Isfaraini. In 1010, following Isfaraini's downfall and imprisonment, Maymandi was appointed governor of Khorasan and tax-collector of the region. During his governorship, he was praised by the inhabitants of the region, and managed to hand out extensive funds to Mahmud, whose financial demands were never moderate. Two years later, Maymandi was finally appointed as the vizier of Mahmud. Map of Khorasan, Transoxiana and Tokharistan. Maymandi quickly began centralizing the Empire, and restored Arabic as the administrative language of the Empire (Isfaraini had made Persian as the administrative language). However, according to the historian Richard N. Frye, Maymandi was not successful in his effort to change the administrative language to Arabic. Maymandi's enemies included Altun Tash, Hasanak Mikali (who later succeeded Maymandi as the vizier of the Empire) and the sister of Mahmud. Among his few supporters were Prince Mas'ud I, Arslan Jadhib, Abu Nasr Mushkan, and probably the former Iranian dynast Abu Nasr Muhammad, whom Maymandi, in the words of the historian Houtsma, \\"did all in his power to mitigate the degradation of his fall.\\" In 1017, Maymandi and Mahmud agreed to invade Khwarazm, then under native Iranian Ma'munid dynasty. According to Ghaznavid sources, the reason for Mahmud's invasion of the region was to avenge the murder of his brother-in-law Ma'mun II, but according to modern sources he used the latter's death as an excuse to expand Ghaznavid rule over the Oxus River. In the same year, the Ghaznavid army deposed the Ma'munid ruler Abu'l-Harith Muhammad, and Altun Tash was appointed as the governor of the region. During the early 1020s, Maymandi urged Mahmud to invade Jibal, which was then under the control of the young Buyid ruler Majd al-Dawla. However, the real ruler of the region was Majd al- Dawla's mother Sayyida Shirin, which was already known by the neighbors of the Buyids, including the Ghaznavids. Mahmud, however, did not agree with him, because he did not feel his empire threatened because of a woman ruling in the region. In 1024, because Maymandi had gained a great amount of wealth during his career as a vizier, Mahmud removed him from his office, confiscated his property, and had him imprisoned at Kalinjar in India. While the nobles who opposed Maymandi urged Mahmud to execute his former vizier, Mahmud chose instead to spare Maymandi. = Second vizierate and death = Coin of Mas'ud I. When Mahmud died in 1030, the Ghaznavid dynasty fell into civil war; his two sons Mas'ud I and Muhammad Ghaznavi both claimed the Ghaznavid throne. Mas'ud managed to emerge victorious during the civil war, and ordered the release of Maymandi. He met him at Balkh and offered him to become his vizier. Maymandi first refused, but later agreed and began his second career as vizier in 1031. He received full control over financial affairs and the postmasters and inspectors of the empire. Although not being near as wealthy as he used to be during his first vizierate, he delivered food and money to the needy, and sent several expensive gifts to Mas'ud in order to avoid the jealousies which resulted in his fallout with Mahmud. Maymandi then took revenge against some of his enemies, while forgiving the rest of them, including Hasanak, who Maymandi tried but failed to save from getting executed. In the same year, Maymandi approved Mas'ud's decision to appoint Ali Daya as the commander-in- chief of the army of Khorasan. He also appointed Abu Sahl Zawzani as the chief administrator of the army. Maymandi died on 31 December 1032 at Herat, and was succeeded by Ahmad Shirazi as vizier. Maymandi had a son named Abd al-Razzaq Maymandi, who also gained the vizier office. He also had another son named Sa'id Maymandi, who had a son named Mansur ibn Sa'id who also like Maymandi, occupied high offices.  Legacy  Statue of Ferdowsi, celebrated as the most influential figure in Persian literature, and whose work was sponsored by Maymandi in the Ghaznavid court. Maymandi was one of the leading statesman of his age, and was commemorated by his biographers, who praised him for his cunning discretion in dealing gently with his enemies who had good relations with Mas'ud, his policy towards the intrusion of the Seljuqs, his disapproval to Mas'ud's offensive in India, his management of the Khwarazm affair, and his proficiency at making appointments. Maymandi was also praised by poets, such as Farrukhi Sistani, who noted the similarities between Maymandi and the celebrated Buyid vizier Sahib ibn Abbad. Both were men of learning and were indicated as ideal secretarial figures, and were known to have been hospitable with poets. Farrukhi Sistani also wrote fifteen panegyrics in honor of Maymandi, whilst the poet Unsuri wrote two in his honor. Maymandi, together with Mahmud, created a major centre of Persian culture in Ghazni which was the successor to Samanid Bukhara. Utbi, who was a helpful associate of Maymandi, praised him in appreciation for his support. According to 12th-century poet Nizami Aruzi, Maymandi had even attempted to back the later-to-be celebrated Persian poet Ferdowsi when he tried to obtain Mahmud's patronage for the Shahnameh, which would later become the national epic of Iran. Maymandi reportedly also backed the Iranian scholar al-Biruni against Mahmud, however this has been disputed. Abu Sahl Hamdawi, a man of letters and patron of poets, who served in high offices under the Ghaznavids, was originally a student of Maymandi. Maymandi was harsh and merciless with his civil servants, and was committed to the preservation of the state. The contemporary historian Bayhaqi describes him in his final days as baneful harsh with his taxmen, while at the same time he grieves him as one \\"with whom bravery, honesty, ability, and greatness all passed away\\".

In other words, an MMOFPS is a real-time, online gaming experience to be played within a massive in-game area which features many simultaneous players in a first- person shooter fashion. These games provide large-scale, sometimes team-based combat. However, due to the inherent fast-paced, strategic nature of this genre, players must rely on their physical coordination and cognition, and thus, there is an emphasis towards player skill rather than player statistics, as no number of in-game bonuses, or similar, will compensate for a player's inability to aim and think tactically.

He was the son of a wealthy brewery owner from whom he inherited his fortune. He was brought up in a prosperous family of Quakers, but converted to Protestantism. Although he was an excellent student at Cambridge University, he did not earn any degree. He devoted his life and wealth to Christian evangelism. He committed himself to a life of tramp and a recluse, minimising his entire expenditure on his own welfare. This was due to his strong premillennialism that when the Gospel of Jesus is spread to the entire world, then the Second Coming of Christ would happen. He was the benefactor to the success of Baptist Missionary Society and London Missionary Society, thereby becoming the principal factor in the spread of Protestantism, modernisation and formal education in the remotest parts of the world. Early life Robert Arthington was born on 20 May 1823 in Hunslet Lane, Leeds. He was the only son among four children of Robert Arthington and Maria n√©e Jowitt. His father was a successful brewery owner. Both his parents were committed members of the Society of Friends and were the leading figures in Leeds. He studied at Cambridge University with excellent academic record. Following his mother and two of his sisters, he left the Society of Friends and joined the South Parade Baptist Church in 1848. Robert Sr. closed his business in 1846 to live a life of temperance, though he refused to sell it. Both the parents died in 1864 leaving an inheritance of ¬£200,000 to Robert Jr. Investments and achievements Robert Arthington never started his own business in spite of his huge fortune. Instead, he invested his wealth, mostly in British and American railways, which catapulted him to greater wealth. He used his riches to the strengthening of missionary works. He contributed massively to Baptist Missionary Society (BMS) of London, and also to London Missionary Society (LMS). It was only because of his philanthropic deeds that many remote parts of the world received Christianity. =BMS Congo Mission= One of Arthington's achievements was his contribution of ¬£1,000 to BMS to launch Congo Mission in 1877. A steamer Peace was purchased from Arthington's initial donation of ¬£4,000 in 1880 and additional ¬£1,000 in 1882. The project was to advance the mission at Congo River possibly up to LMS Tanganyika Mission, which was also funded by Arthington. In 1884 he gave another ¬£2,000 to BMS for extension of the mission as far as Kisangani. In 1892 he added ¬£10,000 to the fund so that the mission can reach Upper Nile region. It was further reported that Arthington was an anonymous donor of ¬£5,000 to the Church Missionary Society to enhance mission expedition in Uganda. =Arthington Aborigines Mission= Arthington established his own Arthington Aborigines Mission in 1889 for evangelisation of tribal people in northeast India. Two British missionaries J.H. Lorrain and F.W. Savidge. They started teaching and preaching the Mizo tribes of Mizoram in 1894. They helped to create the written language of the natives, textbooks, dictionaries, and vernacular Bible (in parts). This was the origin of Christianity and formal education among the Mizos (Mizoram remains the most Christian state and second highest literacy rate in India). However, due to conflicting Arthington's impatience and their method of evangelism, they left the Arthington mission in 1898 to set up their own field in Arunachal Pradesh. Arthington then turned his attention to the Kond people of Orissa, which resulted in mass conversion. The same mission also sent William Pettigrew from Edinburgh to Manipur in 1894. However, the Raja of Manipur forbid him to preach among Meiteis in the Imphal. He worked with great success among the remote tribes such as Tangkhul Nagas and Kukis. =Hospitals= A memorial at a hospital in India Arthington made a total donation of ¬£20,000 to the Leeds Hospital for Women and Children during his lifetime. In recognition of his charity a new hospital at Cookridge was named Robert Arthington Hospital. He financed the hospital and was opened in May 1905. It was running until 2008. Personal life Following his father's lifestyle, Arthington spent his life in strict moderation as a bachelor. He bought a plot of land in Headingley Lane from Misses Marshall 1868 and built a large stone house there. He moved from Hunslet to this house at 57 Headingley but occupying only a single room. He cooked his own meals, wore the same cloth for seventeen years and made friends with students who were in need. He slept on a chair, wrapping himself with his coat. He did not allow anyone accesses to his room, except special visitors. He would not even light the room for visitors, as he believed that \\"it was possible to speak as well in the dark as you could in the light\\". He limited his weekly expenditure to half crown. This self-imposed austerity and eccentricity earned him a nickname \\"Headingley Miser\\". By his restricted expenditure he could contribute large amounts of money to Christian missions for global evanglisation. He even willed his estate worth about five million dollars to the missions. His ideology was led by premillennialism that the spread of Christianity would hasten the Second Coming of Christ as foretold in the Gospel. His temperance commitment was most likely influence by a letter from a missionary, which was found among his belongings after his death. The missionary wrote, \\"Were I in England again, I would gladly live in one room, make the floor my bed, a box my chair, another my table, rather than the heathen should perish for the lack of knowledge of Jesus Christ.\\" Arthington lived more or less like this. Death and legacy Robert Arthington died on 9 October 1900. In his deathbed, he requested to have read to him the Sermon on the Mount and Psalm 72. After the reading, he said, \\"Yes, it is all there ‚Äì all!\\" The inscription on his tombstone bears \\"Robert Arthington, His life and wealth was devoted to the spread of the Gospel among the Heathen.\\" Arthington had prepared his last will and testament on 9 June 1900. He bequeathed a major portion of his estate to Christian missions, and only one-tenth of it to his first cousins, or if they were deceased, to their children. His will was poorly drafted, therefore, took the High Court of Chancery to approve it after five years, in 1905. Further, because of outstanding claims from the family, the actual distribution of the property took another five years. By then the monetary value had risen to ¬£1,273,894. Twenty-one first cousins received ¬£111,000 to be equally divided. Nine-tenth of the money was then shared by BMS (fifth portion) and LMS (fourth portion), with the amounts of ¬£466,926 and ¬£373,541 respectively. The will specified that preference should be given to the Gospel of Luke, Gospel of John, and Acts of the Apostles to be available in vernacular languages. The bequest was to be used within twenty-five years. Alfred Henry Baynes, the General Secretary of BMS, became the trustee until his death in 1914. He fervently pursued evangelisaion of Africa as was the over-riding zeal of Arthington. The LMS on the other hand extended their mission to China and India, in addition to Africa. A town called Arthington founded on 15 December 1869 was named after him. It is a small town in Liberia along the Saint Paul River, located northwest of the capital city of Monrovia. In 1868 Arthington financed the voyage of fifteen families of American slaves from South Carolina, Savanna and Georgia to Liberia. After settlement with the native inhabitants they were given the present Arthington.

On 8 April 1481, Pope Sixtus IV issued the papal bull Cogimur iubente altissimo, in which he called for a crusade against the Turks, who occupied Otranto in southern Italy. The Pope's intention was that, after recapturing Otranto, the crusaders would cross the Adriatic and liberate Vlor√´ (Valona) as well.

They grow naturally in New Caledonia, New Guinea, the Moluccas, and in Australia in the Northern Territory and north- eastern Queensland. Some species grow from understorey trees up to large trees in the natural habitats of rainforests, some species grow up to smaller shrubs in drier forests and in Australia two rare species occur, only known from sandstone rocky outcrops. In Australia, the very restricted north-eastern Queensland endemic species D. saxatilis has official recognition of its risk of extinction in the wild by the Queensland state government's official \\"vulnerable\\" species conservation status. Naming and classification In 1861 European science formally named and described this genus and its New Caledonia type species D. campanulata, authored by the French botanists Adolphe-Th√©odore Brongniart & Jean Antoine Arthur Gris.

History Architects Oldham, Boas and Ednie Brown designed the Toodyay Motor Garage for Doust, and it was built by local firm A James & Co. at a cost of ¬£1,200. Vernon Hamersley \\"in the presence of a hundred or so residents\\" officially opened the building in February 1927. It was built as a single storey garage workshop with a prominent Art Deco style parapet. It appears that the business did not prosper as it was advertised in a mortgagee sale notice in 1928. It is described as: In 1928 the garage was taken over by Ken Somers, who ran the business until his death in 1939. He offered a variety of taxi and self-drive services. A daily service to and from Perth was available, and cars could be hired with or without drivers. In March 1932 the Toodyay Cycle Club was formed at a meeting of cyclists at the garage. Somers was the inaugural president. In 1939 Somers died, aged 44 years, from serious burns received in a fire at the garage. After his death the property was offered for sale at auction on 18 July 1940, but it appears that it did not sell and it remained closed until 1945. The property was again offered for sale (by tender) in September 1945. Brothers Charles Herbert Prince and Saul Prince bought the unoccupied garage premises after their return from the war and operated a business under the name of Prince Brothers. Saul Prince sold his share to Arthur Booth and the business operated as Prince and Booth. In addition to mechanical services, fuel supplies and numerous agencies (including International Harvester Co., Goldbrough Mort & Co, Mortlock Bros. and Western Assurance), in 1946 Prince and Booth started the Toodyay Garage and Passenger Service, a daily bus passenger service to Perth. On 2 June 1947 the Toodyay Garage and Passenger Service commenced using a new International powered parlour coach (Miss Toodyay) on its daily Toodyay-Perth service. The old bus, Recco, was farewelled after travelling 140,000 miles in two years. Radio was installed in Miss Toodyay to entertain the passengers on the two-hour journey. On 8 February 1950 Miss Toodyay II (a Panhard diesel made in France) arrived, having been driven to W.A. from Melbourne. It was the only one of its kind in Australia, and was a -ton vehicle (with pale blue and cream interior) able to carry 37 passengers. Two months later, on 18 April, the company announced a reduction of its service to Perth via the Red Hill Road to Tuesdays only due to the bad state of the road. An additional service was offered from 1947 when a hay baling machine worked by only two men and capable of baling 27 tons of hay a day was purchased by Prince & Booth. In 1951 Prince and Booth sold the bus service, Toodyay Garage and Passenger Service, to the Western Australian Government Railways and Miss Toodyay II made its last run to Perth on 28 January at 6 pm. It was noted in the press that: In 1953 the Toodyay Road Board approved Prince & Booth's plans and specifications for the erection of a lubritorium adjacent to the Toodyay Garage on Stirling Terrace. : L. R. Ayling & Co. In the early 1950s Prince sold his share of the business to Booth and it then operated as A Booth & Co. In 1955 it was taken over by Ron Gronow and Leo Ayling, and in 1957 became L.R. Ayling & Co. It was operated by Ayling until his death in 1980 and was then sold to Murray Buchan. The business was subsequently sold to Michael Guest (Guest Agencies) and Russell and Keith Chrimes (Toodyay Towing Service, Toodyay Auto Centre). the building continues to operate as a garage, with the original fa√ßade little changed and the original shop windows having been retained.

It was recorded during 1985 and 1986 but remains unreleased. Background Following the commercial success of Hartman's hit single \\"I Can Dream About You\\", and the album of the same name, in 1984, Hartman soon began recording his second album for the MCA. Continuing his writing with songwriting partner Charlie Midnight, the new material was marked by Hartman's desire to create an edgier recording. However, when the new album was presented to MCA, they felt the songs did not suit Hartman's image and subsequently shelved the album. Despite this, a small number of vinyl test pressings were created by the company in 1986. In recent years, the songs from the album have circulated unofficially on the internet, courtesy of Hartman's close friend Glenn Ellison. White Boy was not the first product of Hartman's to suffer rejection from MCA as the I Can Dream About You album also had songs that were never released. These songs, written by Hartman and Midnight, were rejected due to what MCA considered the edginess of the music and lyrics. After White Boy was shelved, Hartman returned to writing and producing for others until his death in 1994. His final studio album, New Green Clear Blue, an instrumental new age album, was released in 1989. Speaking to the Mohave Daily Miner in 1989, Hartman revealed: \\"It seemed to be a natural period when I wanted to stop doing pop records; it came with a falling-out between my record company and me. One of the quotes I heard was that they expected me to crank out 10 songs like \\"I Can Dream About You.\\" White Boy is known to have definitely featured nine particular tracks via Ellison's tape, all written by Hartman and Midnight, although other recordings were produced around the time and these may have been intended to end up on the album, including \\"The War is Over\\" and \\"Shadow Boxing\\". Only one song from the album was released officially and this was \\"Waiting to See You\\", which ended up being featured on the original motion picture soundtrack for the 1986 film Ruthless People. It was released as a single in the UK, the Netherlands and Japan only, and managed to peak at No. 34 in the Netherlands. \\"Waiting to See You\\" and another song from the album, \\"I'm Only Foolin' Myself\\", were both performed in 1986 by Hartman on the UK TV show Rock Around the Dock. English musician Paul Young ended up recording a version of \\"I'm Only Foolin' Myself\\" for his 1991 compilation From Time to Time ‚Äì The Singles Collection. Stemming from the song's inclusion on the compilation, it was also issued as a CD single in the Netherlands by Columbia Records, and also a promotional 7\\" vinyl single in Spain. Young's version was produced by Hartman and mixed by Tom Lord-Alge, while Hartman also provided backing vocals. In an interview with Midnight on memories of Hartman for his official fan site, one question asked about the making of the album and why it was never released. Midnight revealed: When asked if he had a favorite composition on the official fan site, Glenn Ellison stated: \\"Gosh ‚Äì there are so many, some of which were on the \\"Whiteboy\\" project that has never been released. \\"Circle of Light\\" comes to mind as a brilliant and moving track. I have a tape of the whole project and it was some of their best work.

Structure=Stem cells= Haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) reside in the medulla of the bone (bone marrow) and have the unique ability to give rise to all of the different mature blood cell types and tissues. HSCs are self-renewing cells: when they differentiate, at least some of their daughter cells remain as HSCs, so the pool of stem cells is not depleted.This phenomenon is called asymmetric division. The other daughters of HSCs (myeloid and lymphoid progenitor cells) can follow any of the other differentiation pathways that lead to the production of one or more specific types of blood cell, but cannot renew themselves. The pool of progenitors is heterogeneous and can be divided into two groups; long-term self-renewing HSC and only transiently self-renewing HSC, also called short-terms. This is one of the main vital processes in the body. =Development= In developing embryos, blood formation occurs in aggregates of blood cells in the yolk sac, called blood islands. As development progresses, blood formation occurs in the spleen, liver and lymph nodes. When bone marrow develops, it eventually assumes the task of forming most of the blood cells for the entire organism. However, maturation, activation, and some proliferation of lymphoid cells occurs in the spleen, thymus, and lymph nodes. In children, haematopoiesis occurs in the marrow of the long bones such as the femur and tibia. In adults, it occurs mainly in the pelvis, cranium, vertebrae, and sternum. Function Haematopoiesis (from Greek Œ±·º∑ŒºŒ±, \\"blood\\" and œÄŒøŒπŒµ·øñŒΩ \\"to make\\"; also hematopoiesis in American English; sometimes also haemopoiesis or hemopoiesis) is the formation of blood cellular components. All cellular blood components are derived from haematopoietic stem cells. In a healthy adult person, approximately 1011‚Äì1012 new blood cells are produced daily in order to maintain steady state levels in the peripheral circulation.Semester 4 medical lectures at Uppsala University 2008 by Leif Jansson All blood cells are divided into three lineages. * Red blood cells, also called erythrocytes, are the oxygen-carrying cells. Erythrocytes are functional and are released into the blood. The number of reticulocytes, immature red blood cells, gives an estimate of the rate of erythropoiesis. * Lymphocytes are the cornerstone of the adaptive immune system. They are derived from common lymphoid progenitors. The lymphoid lineage is composed of T-cells, B-cells and natural killer cells. This is lymphopoiesis. * Cells of the myeloid lineage, which include granulocytes, megakaryocytes and macrophages, are derived from common myeloid progenitors, and are involved in such diverse roles as innate immunity and blood clotting. This is myelopoiesis. Clinical significance=Stem cell transplant= A stem cell transplant is a transplant intended to replace the progenitor hematopoietic stem cells Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the transplantation of multipotent hematopoietic stem cells, usually derived from bone marrow, peripheral blood, or umbilical cord blood. It may be autologous (the patient's own stem cells are used), allogeneic (the stem cells come from a donor) or syngeneic (from an identical twin). It is most often performed for patients with certain cancers of the blood or bone marrow, such as multiple myeloma or leukemia. In these cases, the recipient's immune system is usually destroyed with radiation or chemotherapy before the transplantation. Infection and graft-versus-host disease are major complications of allogeneic HSCT. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation remains a dangerous procedure with many possible complications; it is reserved for patients with life-threatening diseases. As survival following the procedure has increased, its use has expanded beyond cancer to autoimmune diseases and hereditary skeletal dysplasias; notably malignant infantile osteopetrosis and mucopolysaccharidosis.

He was born into a musical family in Vienna. It was of Galician origin. His father and his older brother Max (born 1896) both played the violin. His father was an excellent violin teacher, and gave his sons their first lessons on that instrument. He also taught Sigmund Feuermann (1900‚Äì1952). From the age of 10, Wolfsthal studied for six years with famed Hungarian violin teacher Carl Flesch, and at age 16 started to perform in public. His debut was on April 7, 1916 with Berliner Philharmoniker conducted by Camillo Hildebrand (1876‚Äì1953). There he performed the Concerto for 2 Violins in D minor, BWV 1043 by Johann Sebastian Bach with his teacher Carl Flesch, who then encouraged him to gain some experience as an orchestral player to make him a more disciplined ensemble player. In that capacity, he played in the first performance of Ein Heldenleben by Richard Strauss, and in the first recording of Moli√®re's Le bourgeois gentilhomme by Strauss, conducted by the composer in Berlin (see below). Academy of Music in Berlin in 1928, where Wolfsthal was a professor between 1926 and 1931 Wolfsthal then moved to Bremen, where he succeeded Georg Kulenkampff (1898‚Äì1948) as concertmaster. Later he moved to the Swedish capital Stockholm and then back to Berlin as concertmaster of one of the two outstanding orchestras in the German capital in the interwar period, the Berlin State Opera orchestra (the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra was the other), where he became a prot√©g√© of Richard Strauss, who often conducted this orchestra (see above). When he was only 26, he was made a violin professor at Music Academy in Berlin. Some of his students were Szymon Goldberg (1909‚Äì1993) and Marianne Liedtke, who later named herself Maria Lidka (1914‚Äì2013) after emigrating to United Kingdom. Wolfsthal gave the premiere of Karl Weigl's 1928 Violin Concerto. He played in a distinguished string trio with cellist Emmanuel Feuermann and violist and composer Paul Hindemith in which his pupil Goldberg succeeded him after his death and led the group in recordings for Columbia of Beethoven's Serenade Op. 8 and Hindemith's String Trio No. 2. Wolfsthal had already made some recordings in the 1920s. In 1928, he became deputy head of orchestra of Krolloper Berlin, which was led by Otto Klemperer. There he took part in the premiere of Kammermusik No. 5, op. 36 no. 4 by Hindemith. He formed a trio with pianist Leonid Kreutzer and cellist Gregor Piatigorsky. The latter recommended him as a violin teacher to the young Marianne Liedtke. But when Wolfsthal was engaged to accompany young piano virtuoso Vladimir Horowitz, his lack of discipline betrayed him when, while performing for Piatigorsky's manager, he abruptly stopped accompanying in midstream and started to improvise, laughing boyishly. He married Olga, the former wife of George Szell, who bore him a daughter. After attending a funeral in Berlin in the winter of 1930, he caught a cold which escalated to pneumonia several weeks later and took his life at only 31. His wife later married the cellist Benar Heifetz (1899‚Äì1974). Wolfsthal's sound has been described as \\"tightly concentrated\\" and \\"sweet\\"; his style--which eschewed portamenti--as having a \\"spruce modernity\\". Reviewing Wolfsthal's 1929 recording of Beethoven's Violin Concerto, the Penguin guide to compact discs wrote of his \\"breathtaking mastery, making one regret that this pupil of Carl Flesch died in his early thirties.\\"  References External links *Beethoven.

Background  Lukis was born in La Grange, Saint Peter Port, Guernsey. He was the youngest of the four children of Sarah (n√©e Collings; 1749‚Äì1816) and Captain John Lukis (1753‚Äì1832). His father was a member of the Royal Guernsey militia who made a fortune in the \\"slightly murky world\\" of privateering and importing expensive wine. Already in his youth Lukis became interested in natural history, and probably attended Elizabeth College.  Career  He was strongly influenced by his elderly relative, the botanist Joshua Gosselin (1739‚Äì1813), who took him to his first excavation at a recently discovered artificial cavern. The experience triggered a lifelong passion for the protection of the island's heritage. He became a member of the Society of Antiquaries of London on 28 April 1853, but never published in the Society's journal, Archaeologia. Like his father, he served in the island's militia, becoming a colonel and aide-de- camp to the island's last governor William Keppel.  Family  On 17 February 1813, Lukis married his first cousin, Elizabeth Collings (1791‚Äì1865). They had three daughters and six sons, some of whom inherited his interests. John Walter Lukis (1816‚Äì1894), his second son, was a mining engineer and excavator; the eldest daughter, Louisa Collings, was a lichenologist; his third son, William Collings Lukis, was an antiquarian and archaeologist; the fifth son, Fran√ßois du Bois Lukis (1826‚Äì1907), was a lieutenant and archaeologist. His youngest daughter, Mary-Anne (1822‚Äì1906), provided watercolour sketches of Lukis' artefacts. Lukis died at the house he was born in. Lukis' collection was donated by his son Fran√ßois du Bois to the Guernsey Museum, and forms its nucleus. His living descendants include the actor Adrian Lukis; Christopher Beaumont, 23rd Seigneur of Sark.

However, despite the Tsar‚Äôs fondness for Maria, a feud took place between her and her family and the tsar's mother, which lasted for several years. During one court function Maria vomited and collapsed, which caused whispers through the court that despite her apparent good health during the brideshow. She became frequently ill, and many suspected she had been poisoned, a common practice in the Russian court at the time. The perpetrator may have been Tsar Michael's mother the dowager empress because of their families feuds, or possibly by one of the many other royal families rejected in the brideshow who wanted their daughter to be chosen as Tsarina instead. Whatever the case, Maria's illness was cited as proof of inability to bear children and she and her family were exiled to Siberia, though her father was later appointed governor of Vologda. The Tsar, who had allegedly become very close to Maria during her six-week stint as Tsarina, swore never to wed again, but at the insistence of his advisors he married Maria Dolgorukova in 1624.

He became recognized as an expert on finance. He was governor of the Banque de France from 1863 to 1864, then Minister-President of the Conseil d'Etat (Council of State) from 1864 to 1869. In his later years he devoted himself to historical studies, publishing many works on medieval and modern finance. Early years 1813‚Äì1848 Adolphe Vuitry's family originated in Champagne and the Ardennes. An ancestor named Pierre Vuitry (1672‚Äì1732) is described as a farm worker from Machault, near to Vouziers. His great- grandfather, also Pierre Vuitry, was a tax collector and his grandfather was an advocate in Paris. By the end of the Ancien R√©gime the family was prosperous and influential. Their position was not damaged by the French Revolution. Adolphe's father Martin Vuitry (1786‚Äì1879) was named Engineer of Sens in the Yonne department in 1810, where he married Amable Lousie Hardy in 1812. His father pursued a political career from 1823, and was a liberal deputy under the July Monarchy. Adolphe Vuitry was born in Sens on 31 March 1813. He studied at the lyc√©e in Sens, the Coll√®ge Sainte-Barbe in Paris, and the Lyc√©e Louis-le-Grand. He was a brilliant student. While studying mathematics he enrolled in the Faulty of Law of Paris, and at the age of eighteen sat his first legal examination. At almost the same time he was accepted by the √âcole Polytechnique. At first he studied engineering (bridges and roads) but then transferred to the study of law. He obtained the title of Doctor of Law in 1838. He began work in the office of the barrister Jean- Baptiste Teste. He did not plead many cases, and soon left the court to join the administration. In 1839 he became a member of the office of Jean-Baptiste Teste, now Minister of Justice and Religious Affairs, and retained his position when the portfolio passed to Alexandre-Fran√ßois Vivien in 1840 and then to Nicolas Martin du Nord in 1841. In 1840 he married Marie-Caroline- Jenny Bret (1820‚Äì1905). He was named head of the first section of the Department of Religious Affairs in 1841, and was promoted to deputy director in 1844. Vuitry resigned in 1846 to join the Council of State, where he was attached to the litigation section. He held this post through the February Revolution of 1848, protected by Achille Fould. The revolution caused him \\"deep regrets\\" but did not affect his career. Second Republic and Empire 1848‚Äì1870 After the 1848 revolution Vuitry was recalled to the Council of State and reappointed to the litigation section. From 26 April 1851 to 26 October 1851 Vuitry was Deputy Secretary of State for Finance under Achille Fould. In that time he made only two speeches before the Legislative Assembly, one on savings banks and the other on packet boat concessions in the Mediterranean. In this short period he learned a great deal, and became recognized as a financial expert. By decree of 13 December 1851 Vuitry was appointed a member of the Administration section of the Advisory Committee to the Finance Committee. He also participated in a committee that drafted the statutes of Cr√©dit Foncier de France. On 25 January 1852 Vuitry was appointed Councillor of State, Division of Finance. He was part of a minority that opposed the confiscation of the property of the House of Orleans, and would be suspected of Orleanism throughout his subsequent career. He was rapporteur on most bills related to finance, was signatory to the explanatory notes of the main financial laws from 1855 to 1863, defended the regime's budgets to the House and responded to questions on the budget from deputies. On 18 May 1857 he made an important speech on extension of the privileges of the Bank of France. He was promoted to President of the Finance section on 24 June 1857. Vuitry was elected a member of the Academy of Moral and Political Sciences in 1862. He was appointed Governor of the Bank of France on 15 May 1863, replacing Charles Le B√®gue de Germiny. On 28 September 1864 he was replaced by Gustave Rouland. During his term of office he faced a crisis in 1863‚Äì1864, offered special facilities to the Treasury and ended the case of the Bank of Savoy. On 28 September 1864 Vuitry returned to the Council of State as Minister-President. Under his leadership the political power of the Council grew, while he remained loyal to the emperor. He continued to defend the financial measures of the government in the House in face of violent attacks by opponents of the empire in 1864 and 1865. On August 4, 1867, by Imperial Decree, Vuitry was elevated to the Grand Cross of the Imperial Order of the Legion of Honor. Vuitry resigned from the Council of State on 17 July 1869 in protest against the increasingly liberal policies of the regime. He was appointed to the Senate by decree on 21 July 1869. Vuitry was General Counsel of the Yonne department from 1852 to 1870. After 1865 he chaired the departmental assembly. Later years 1871‚Äì1885 Following the Franco-Prussian War (19 July 1870 ‚Äì 10 May 1871) and the fall of the empire, Vuitry was chairman of the board of the Compagnie du Paris-Lyon-M√©diterran√©e from 25 August 1871 to 15 November 1878, and then honorary president. He served as a director of the Nationale insurance company. He spent his last years engaged in historical studies. Vuitry was made an Officer of the Legion of Honour in 1858 and a Commander in 1860. He was awarded the Grand Cross of the Legion of Honour in 1867. Vuitry died in the priory of Saint-Donain in Marolles-sur- Seine in the department of Seine-et-Marne on 23 June 1885 aged 72. He is buried in the P√®re Lachaise Cemetery. His son-in-law, Henri Germain, was founder and chairman of Cr√©dit Lyonnais. Vuitry was an indefatigable worker, and had a great store of knowledge. He was a good speaker, but lacked aggression. He disliked the passionate and emotional debates in the House, and was nervous when he had to speak there. But he excelled in other roles, and was always calm, polite and thoughtful in meetings of the Council of State. Writings Some of Vuitry's writings from his time in office are reported in: *Souvenir.

In order to avenge his brother, Sayf marched towards Ghazna in 1148, and scored a victory at the Battle of Ghazni while Bahram fled to Kurram.C.E. Bosworth, The Later Ghaznavids, 113-114.

Sayf and Majd ad-Din Musawi were captured and later crucified at Pul-i Yak Taq. After Sayf's death, he was succeeded by his brother Baha al-Din Sam I, who continued building Firuzkuh, and prepared an army to march towards Ghazna to avenge the death of his two brothers, but died shortly of natural causes before he reached the city.

It is the twelfth prelude and fugue in the second book of The Well-Tempered Clavier, a series of 48 preludes and fugues by the composer. Analysis=Prelude= The prelude is 70 bars long, and is written in theme and variations form. The theme is 28 bars long and written in binary form. It is followed by several variations in different keys, and ends with a variation in the home key. Below is the opening sentence of the prelude: The opening sentence of the prelude. The first four measures of this sentence has two voices leading the melody in thirds, and another voice leading the bass line. After four measures, only two voices continue. One voice plays the root of a chord, while the second voice plays a broken chord around it. This continues like so for another four measures, and ends with an imperfect cadence. After this, the sentence is repeated, except modulating to E major at one point and ending on a perfect cadence. Together, these two sentences create a compound period, and the first part of a small binary. Following the compound period, the second part of the small binary starts. It consists of one voice playing broken chords and two other voices leading a melody, and is eight measures long. A perfect cadence in A major concludes the small binary, and thus ending the theme of the prelude. The prelude ends with a two-measure codetta, which consists of a perfect cadence in the home key. =Fugue= The fugue is 85 bars long, and is written for 3 voices. Below is the 4-measure subject of the fugue: The first four bars of the fugue. Just like most fugues in the baroque period, the subject is then repeated in the middle voice in the dominant key (C minor), and then repeated once more in the lowest voice, again in the home key. This final repetition of the subject is followed a small episode that consists of a descending fifths sequence. This is followed by the development of the fugue, which has many additional repetitions of the subject in various voices and keys, and occasionally episodes with the same descending fifths sequence as before in between. After the final repetition of the subject in the tonic key, the descending fifths episode is repeated as a codetta, which concludes the fugue.

It was released on 4 September 2013 through Smaller Recordings in Japan, Search and Destroy Records in Europe and The End Records worldwide. It was produced by Yasuo Matsumoto and Kenya Yamamoto. Background and promotion The album was recorded at Machine Shop Studios in New York City in January 2013 and will be released mainly through The End Records and Sony Music. Prior to the release of the album, the band released three music videos: \\"We Are the Future\\", \\"Eclipse\\" and \\"The Evolution\\". Critical reception The album received positive reviews from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album has an average score of 67 out of 100 based on 4 reviews, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Alternative Press rated the album 3 out of 5 and said: \\"While their contemporaries may opt for subtler synth lines and catchy riffs, Crossfaith use programming as intensely as metal technicality on Apocalyze. Programmer Tamano Terufumi breaks out dubstep tropes like low-end wobbles and drops, but don't expect glowing hula hoops over jumpkicks in a Crossfaith pit anytime soon. The electronics leave you feeling more like you're inside a violent arcade game than on a dance floor, clean vocals are scarce and the closest thing you get to a slow song is \\"Counting Stars\\"‚Äîan illusion created by dreamy female guest vocals. That energy makes it feel like there's too much going on, leading to songs blending structurally, downplaying hooks. But the chaotic nature of Apocalyze is what Crossfaith want to showcase, perhaps at the sacrifice of the broader audience they could reach.\\" Blabbermouth.net gave the album a score 8/10 and saying: \\"While CROSSFAITH may take some listener acclimation with all of their tenacious electronic rakes, Apocalyze is nevertheless a creative and energetic album that grows strength with repeated listens. This album will excite metalcore freaks like it's the dawn of a new era. Like their contemporaries MUCC and DIR EN GREY, this band isn't afraid to dabble, tinker and stretch boundaries largely borrowed from the western sanction. While BORIS continues to reign over the Japanese metal scene in their own modest way, CROSSFAITH will appeal to a broader audience. For certain, expect to hear these guys jacking up a video game or two in the near future.\\" Dead Press! scored the album 9 out of 10 and said: \\"Apocalyze has undoubtedly raised the bar exceedingly high, and it wouldn't be unfair to view their position on the metalcore heap rather insurmountable. Seeing these songs come into their own in a live setting is a mouth watering prospect, although it would be wise for venues to re-enforce their foundations now before it's too late. 'We Are The Future' indeed.\\" Scrussel from KillYourStereo gave the album 82 out of 100 and said: \\"Crossfaith's brand of metal fused with electronic elements is an effective mix, and one that isn't too overdone that is just becomes a mess. Apocalyze hits that perfect ratio, creating a hybrid of sound that may not be fresh or unique but is easily enjoyable. What sets this album apart from others in the genre are refreshing and innovative ideas and some killer riffs that will keep you coming back over and over.\\" Sam Dignon of Rock Sins rated the album 9 out of 10 and said: \\"Having built up a reputation as one of the most exciting live bands around over the past year, Crossfaith have fast become one of the most talked about bands on the Metalcore scene. Dance and electronics have been a part of Metalcore for a while now but no one has been able to master it quite like Crossfaith. Whilst most bands tended to just throw in the odd electronic section in, Crossfaith completely balance the two elements out, making Apocalyze one of the most refreshing Metalcore albums in recent years.\\" Track listingPersonnel Credits adapted from AllMusic.

The small, narrowly umbilicate shell has a conical shape. It is excessively variable in coloration, the following patterns are most usual: (1) whitish with longitudinal broad or narrow red or crimson flames reaching to the periphery, the ground-color and base dotted with red. The flames are frequently interrupted in the middle by a dotted zone. (2) the ground-color is clear yellowish or whitish, the lirae dotted with red. This pattern frequently shows short flames of red under the sutures. (3) the entire surface is purplish black, the umbilicus green-tinged. Except the last variety, all are whitish around the umbilicus. In all, the inside of the umbilicus and the columella are tinged with green. The spire is elevated, conical, rather obtuse. The sutures are impressed. The five to six whorls are convex. They are encircled by lirae, usually 5 or 6 in number on the penultimate whorl, but very variable. The body whorl shows a prominent rib at the periphery, convex beneath. The aperture is quadrangular, delicately ribbed within and iridescent, green predominating. The columella is arcuate above, then straight and oblique, terminating near the base in a slight denticle. This is a beautiful little species, usually either flamed with dark red or dotted all over with pink. The ground-color sometimes has a green cast, or is pink.Tryon (1889), Manual of Conchology XI, Academy of Natural Sciences, Philadelphia Distribution This marine species is endemic to Australia and occurs off Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania.

Burevestnik was the organ of the Petrograd Federation of Anarchist Groups. The newspaper was founded in November 1917 (seven months after the founding of the Petrograd Federation). Burevestnik was primarily distributed in Vyborg district, Kronstadt, Kolpino and Obukhovo. It had a readership of around 25,000. This newspaper was one of several publications with the name Burevestnik, a name originating in Maxim Gorky's poem Song of the Stormy Petrel. Burevestnik was edited by Apollon Karelin, Iosif Bleikhman, Abba Gordin and V. L. Gordin. Amongst the writers of Burevestnik there were two distinct tendencies; the moderate tendency of Karelin and the radical tendency of the Gordin brothers. The former represented the line of Peter Kropotkin, the latter group being adherents of Mikhail Bakunin.Avrich (2005), pp. 174-176. As the capital of Russia was shifted from Petrograd to Moscow, the Moscow newspaper Anarkhiia replaced Burevestnik as the most important anarchist communist publication in the country.Avrich (2005), p. 179. In the midst of the ongoing revolution, Burevestnik called for immediate expropriation of private property. It advocated that the homeless and the poor should appropriate homes themselves. In an February 1918 article (which was cited in The New York Times), Burevestnik appealed to hall guards to stop protecting the rich and allow the poor to take control over the latter's residences and palaces. It pleaded to the Petrograd workers to reject the leadership of the Bolsheviks. For example, in an April 1918 article it compared the Bolsheviks to the Black Hundreds. The article, published on the front page, carried the title \\"We have come to the limit!\\". It denounced attacks on the anarchist movement. However, the newspaper also rejected the parliamentary factions (Mensheviks, Cadets, SRs, etc.). The newspaper applauded the dissolution of the Constituent Assembly in January 1918.

It was built in the sixteenth century to house knights of the Order of Saint John from the langue of Provence. It now houses the National Museum of Archaeology. The First Auberge Detail of Auberge de Provence as represented in seventeenth century map Auberge de Provence started being built between 1571 and 1574 under the direction of the Maltese architect Girolamo Cassar. Prior to its construction, the Langue of Provence had been housed in the Auberge d'Auvergne et Provence in Birgu. The first auberge was built in an Italianate style, with the building surrounding three sides of a yard and garden, and with an open loggiato (covered exterior gallery) and passegiatoia (open balcony) around the courtyard connecting all the wings of the building. The ceremonial halls and common rooms overlooked Strada San Giorgio (now Republic Street) while the habitation quarters of the new Knights overlooked Strada Pia (now Melita Street). The wing overlooking Strada Carri (now Cart Street) housed the quarters of the Bailiff who was in charge of the Langue. The building was furnished with a kitchen, oven, slaughter house and stables. In 1584, the Langue decided to build a first floor above the existing auberge.  The Seventeenth and Eighteenth Century Alterations  By the 1630s, the Langue of Provence had decided to reconstruct the auberge and works were on course to demolish parts of the building. The old fa√ßade was to make way for a new one which included spaces for shopfronts, as was the trend in the Baroque Period. The creation of new commercial spaces coincided with a period in which the Order was striving to commercialise public spaces and create revenue streams. Early nineteenth century version of lithograph print representing the Auberge de Provence During this time, the garden of the auberge was reduced in size with the sale to third parties of the two plots on Strait Street. The architect behind the project and the design of the new fa√ßade was Captain Antonio Garsin. The design of the new fa√ßade was a clear proponent of the French classical style. The creation of street-level shop fronts also changed the dynamics of the use of the building. The common areas and halls used by the Knights where now relocated to the first and second floor of the building. It was also during this period that the Gran Salon took shape. By 1788, in the context of the financial turmoil caused by the French Revolution, the Langue had to sell the surviving stretch of garden accessible from Strait Street to generate some revenue. The architect chosen to undertake this project was Stefano Ittar. With the arrival of the French in 1798, the building‚Äôs function as an Auberge came to an end. The building was converted by the occupying French into apartments for the officers of the ‚Äúreggimento dei cacciatori‚Äù and their families.  The Union Club Alterations  282x282px During the early British Period the former auberge was divided into multiple properties and sublet by the colonial government for various purposes. The earliest use of the building was as a military barracks, as a department for the Military Commission. It also hosted the Thorn‚Äôs Hotel. The new divisions introduced residential and commercial uses, including an auction house, various shops and a social club. The frequency of structural alterations to the building steadily increased in the course of the 19th century, although they tended to be on a smaller scale and of a more contained nature. One of the earliest interventions during this period was done by the Maltese architect Michele Cachia in 1800, who was called in to do some restoration works. In 1826, parts of the auberge were leased out to the garrison and maritime officers to serve as a social club where to hold balls and events. This came to be known as the Malta Union Club. Amongst its members the Union Club had personalities such as the writer Sir Walter Scott, British Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli and also Prince George of Wales (afterwards King George V. The building was included on the Antiquities List of 1925 together with the other auberges in Valletta. During World War II, buildings located close to the auberge were destroyed by aerial bombardment, but the auberge itself was not hit and only suffered minor damages. Since Auberge d'Auvergne and Auberge de France were both destroyed during the war, Auberge de Provence is the only surviving French auberge in Valletta. On 12 August 1955, the lease to the Malta Union Club was terminated. In 1958 the auberge was opened as the National Museum, housing the Archaeological Collection on the ground floor and Fine Arts on the first floor. In 1974, the Fine Arts collection was transferred to Admiral House and the auberge became the National Museum of Archaeology. The auberge is listed on the National Inventory of the Cultural Property of the Maltese Islands.  The Gran Salon  Archival image of the Gran Salon The Gran Salon is one of the most memorable and elegant halls in the Maltese Islands. It originally served as a refectory and banqueting hall, where the Knights sat at long tables according to seniority. Under the British it served as a ball room and banqueting hall for the upper echelons of the British Colonial administration. It is not clear when the Gran Salon was decorated. Documentary evidence has indicated that the site was already heavily painted during the Knights period. The current pictorial scheme is a later addition and is decorated in the Pompeian floral style. This current painting scheme likely dates to the British Period. Research has established that the artist used two very particular pigments, emerald green and chrome yellow, both in the lower and central areas. These pigments help to possibly date the existing decorative scheme. The two colours are known to have been used since 1814 and 1816 respectively. Chrome yellow was only used for approximately 90 years due to its toxicity. Therefore, the wall paintings are likely to have been executed during the nineteenth century. Ongoing conservation works have also revealed the signature and date of the artist carrying out restoration after World War II. Mr. Francis Borg was commissioned to repair the war damage, two years after the end of the war in 1947. His signature can be found on the east wall. The Conservation of the Gran Salon is partly sponsored by Bank of Valletta.  Commemorative Coins  In 2013, the Central Bank of Malta issued a new numismatic coin depicting the Auberge de Provence. The obverse of the coin shows the emblem of Malta with the year of issue, 2013. The reverse features the fa√ßade of the Auberge de Provence.

He also works bands like Severe Dementia, Kral and The Joint Family. He is the founding member of the rock band AvoidRafa. Biography=Beginnings= Due to his father's job posting, he was born in Libya, he was the youngest child of his family, and is the younger brother of Saadi Muktafi, a guitarist and the founding member of the band Kral. He spent most of his early childhood in Libya. After returning to Bangladesh at the age of 5, he got admitted to Maple Leaf International School in Dhaka, Bangladesh. He was pushed to learn Nazrul Geeti,a local genre of song and harmonium during his childhood, but he scarcely had any interest in music back then. =Musical career= To master the art of mixing and mastering of sounds, Rafa used to read any and every book he could come across regarding this field of work in which he was engaged, then experimented on modifying/remixing a few songs, and in the course of time he learned how to master this technique. As a result, in 2006 he, along with Kamal composed the song 'Protirup' (mixed and mastered by him) which was featured in the mixed album 'Underground'. At the same time he did his first TV commercial soundtrack for the well reputed apparel brand 'Ecstasy'. In addition he met Fuad al Muqtadir and began working with him professionally as a co-producer and as a session musician too. In the same year he joined the death metal band Severe Dementia as a drummer and producer. Right after joining the band he produced a single called 'Demented Mentation' and also went for his first ever tour to India with them. In 2007 Aurthohin's two more singles 'Hollow' & 'Nirbodh' from the albums 'Live Now' and 'Underground 2' respectively got released. 'Hollow' was his first ever composition and then came Nirbodh. These were also mixed and mastered by him. At the same year, Shuvo, Aurthohin's longtime Drummer left the band for personal reason and Rafa eventually took the stick. In course he also produced the first international EP of 'Severe Dementia' named 'Epitaph of Plassey' which got released in the studio album 'Rise of the Eastern Blood' in the label 'Demonstealer Records' along with two other bands from Pakistan and India. This EP comprised five songs where he worked as a producer and the drummer, vocal, guitarist and sound engineer. He was also one of the judges in the band hunt competition 'Grameenphone Drockstars-2'http://www.grameenphone.com/about-us/media-center/press- release/2007/107/grand-finale-drockstars-2-held and produced the full-length album 'Apostrut Juddho' of the winning band 'Powersurge' which got released in the label of G series in 2008. In 2008 after a long break of 5 years Aurthohin released their 5th Studio Album 'Aushomapto 1'. There for the first time Rafa sang some melodious soft numbers for Aurthohin. The three renowned songs 'Kadbe Bisshoye'(punk rock),' Anmone'(rock) and 'Nikrishto'(heavy metal) were composed by him. In 'Kadbe Bisshoye' he played the guitar solo which gave him the public recognition as a guitarist from then. His two more singles 'Pichu Hata' and ' Smriti Charon' were released in the album 'Kromannoy' ‚Äìa mixed album produced by Fuad and co-produced by him. After this, he joined 'FnF' (Fuad & Friends) as a drummer. As of Severe Dementia, he produced the single 'Credence of Fort William' which got released in the album 'Metal Farm Vol-6'. This album got released by a Thai label 'Metal Farm' and also got featured in an anime. The single of Kral 'Song for Jewel Bhai' got released in the album 'Rock-101'-a prominent band mixed album co‚Äìordinated by Iqbal Asif Jewel. Some of the songs of that album were mixed and mastered by him. He produced a TV commercial for Grameenphone which was the theme song for the independence day concert of 2008. 2009 was a moderately eventful year for him as he formed his starchild 'The Joint Family' to experiment with his unexplored abilities. Through this project, he created some ambient and progressive tracks as he claims these two to be his favourite genres of music with some psychedelic touch. The first track of this project 'Rebulation' was released in the album 'Rock 202'. He also co‚Äìproduced the full-length album 'Fuad feat. Kona' (Label: G series, 2009).He also went to do shows in the USA that year as a solo artist. In 2010, he worked as a producer for the first time for the album 'Rafa feat. Topu ‚Äì She Ke'. He released the single 'Ektu Brishti' in the album 'The Hit Album too. Also two of the singles of The Joint Family 'Bhaar' & 'The Bicycle Day' were released in the albums 'Aashor' & 'Rock-404' respectively and the single 'Shonga Shongjom' of Kral in 'Rock-505'. In the meantime he kept on doing his own studio production works along with gigs with all his bands. The year 2011 was rather busy for him. His solo production work 'Ontorip' got released in 2011 where 'Sharmin' gave her voice. Another production work, 'Aundormohol' got released which featured 'Tanjib' as the vocal. He mixed and mastered the first album 'Oporajeyo' of the band 'Mechanix' and the latest studio album of Aurthohin ' Aushomapto-2 '. Presumably, the last single of The Joint Family 'Vision of a Mind's Garden' got released in 'Rock-707' that year. Throughout 2012 he appeared in several stage shows which began with his presence in 'Guitarfest 2012'. With Severe Dementia he went for his second band tour at Nepal. They were the headliners of that concert naming 'Ides of March' which was organised by 'KTM rocks'. He released the music video of The Bicycle day, some days after the tour. He also made a guest appearance in the video 'Agnisnan' of 'Powersurge'. He worked as a producer in that song as well. In addition, he officially started his own company 'Hotbox Entertainment' where he also included video production with his primary field of work. The beginning of 2013 kicked off with his appearance in the then most hyped up event with a few other renowned artists for the campaign 'Go Free(Cholo Bohudur), for GrameenPhone (Telenor). He directed his first documentary 'Chol Chol Chol' which was a tribute to 'Shahbagh movement'. It was quite a success for him as his first visual work. In the same year, Rafa disbanded 'The Joint Family' and joined 'Cryptic Fate' as a drummer. He appeared in the video 'Akromon' right after joining his new band. Meanwhile, he did a few shows and TV commercial soundtracks and started working on his solo album. He has been the front man in the show 'Rhythm & Strings' which was the most anticipated show that year. In January 2014, he composed one of the native versions of 'FIFA 2014' official soundtrack. At present, Rafa is working on his solo album. He formed his own band in the name of AvoidRafa with some of the very talented musicians in Bangladesh music industry, namely Pavel on bass, Samir Hafiz on guitars and Jeffrey on drums. He is also engaged with Aurthohin, Cryptic Fate and Severe Dementia, doing concerts and shows. On 6 October 2015, Rafa officially part ways with Aurthohin.

Biography Gjebrea was born on April 20, 1923, in the city of Gjirokast√´r of a father from the well-known local Gjebrea family, and a mother from Ka√ßanik, Kosovo. She had gone to the Mother Queen Women's Institute, where she had studied along with Nexhmije Hoxha, and Liri Belishova. She later was arrested in 1942, but freed for lack of proof, and subsequently joined the National Liberation Movement, first as a youth secretary of Berat, and then as commanding staff of the Vth Attacking Brigade. =Investigation for immoral behavior, trial and death= On February 16, 1944 an investigation for immoral behavior and breach of the partisan morals took place in Ramic√´, Vlor√´. According to the verbals of the investigation, partisan Zaho Koka, a former shephard, and Gjebrea admitted only to having kissed and fondled one another, whereas Ramadan Xhangolli, envoy of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Albania, accused them of having had intercourse. Zaho Koka claimed that he didn't know that at the time of the facts Gjebrea was the fianc√©e of Nako Spiru. On March 4, 1944 the court condemned Gjebrea to death, but pardoned Koka, although it demoted him within the Party. Gjebrea was executed two days later on March 6, 1944, in front of 400 partisans of the 5th Attacking Brigade. Three partisans (two male and one female) shot, all three of them, in the air, their first bullet. At that point Gjebrea yelled at them Don't shoot me on the back. I expect your bullets to be different. Shoot at me!, at which point they shot at her, and Gjebrea fell, dead. Liri Belishova, who later became the wife of Nako Spiru, witnessed in a 2010 interview that the martial court followed the order by Enver Hoxha to execute Gjebrea. According to Belishova, the order of Hoxha was based on recommendations of Dusan Mugosa, envoy of Josip Broz Tito to assist the Albanian National Liberation Movement. She also said that Gjebrea had an intelligence and eloquence that was unmatched by other Albanian women involved in the National Liberation Army, and that before joining the National Liberation Army she had been the only woman to participate in the actions of the city guerillas. In December 2013, the \\"Shqiptarja\\" magazine published for the first time the personal diary of Gjebrea.

According to Egyptologists Kim Ryholt, J√ºrgen von Beckerath and Darrell Baker, he was the second king of the dynasty, reigning from 1800 BC until 1796 BC.K.S.B. Ryholt: The Political Situation in Egypt during the Second Intermediate Period, c. 1800 ‚Äì 1550 BC, Carsten Niebuhr Institute Publications, vol. 20. Copenhagen: Museum Tusculanum Press, 1997  Identity  There is a debate between Egyptologists on whether or not Sekhemkare Sonbef is the same king as Sekhemkare Amenemhat V, fourth ruler of the 13th Dynasty. Indeed, Sonbef called himself \\"Amenemhat Sonbef\\"; this can be a double name, but can also be a filiation Son of Amenemhat Sonbef, which both Ryholt and Baker see as evidence that Sonbef was a son of Amenemhat IV and a brother of Sekhemre Khutawy Sobekhotep, the founder of the 13th Dynasty. Thus, they see Sonbef and Amenemhat V as two different rulers, an opinion also shared by J√ºrgen von Beckerath. Ryholt and Baker further posit that Sonbef's and Amenemhat's rules were separated by the ephemeral reign of Nerikare, while von Beckerath believes it was Sekhemre Khutawy Pantjeny who reigned between the two.J√ºrgen von Beckerath: Untersuchungen zur politischen Geschichte der Zweiten Zwischenzeit in √Ñgypten, Gl√ºckstadt, 1964J√ºrgen von Beckerath: Chronologie des pharaonischen √Ñgyptens, M√ºnchner √Ñgyptologische Studien 46.

Dynastie) Teil 1 : Die 12. Dynastie, in Orientalia 57 (1988)New arrangement of the 13th dynasty, on digital Egypt. Franke and others regard \\"Amenemhat Sonbef\\" as a double name.

Although, as a king of the early 13th Dynasty, Sonbef certainly reigned from Itjtawy in the Faiyum, the only contemporary attestations of him are from south of Thebes. These include a scarab seal of unknown provenance, a cylinder seal from the Amherst collection and now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art,Cylinder seal of Amenemhat Senbef at the MET Museum. and two inscribed blocks from El-Tod where he appears under the name Sekhemkare. Two Nile records are also attributable to him, one from Askut and dated to his year 3, and the other from Semna in Nubia, dated to his year 4. A further, much damaged record from Semna and dated to a year 5 may also belong to him. The ownership of these Nile records is still in doubt however, as they only bear the prenomen Sekhemkare, which Amenemhat V also bore.

Its origins date to the year 1400, but it was rebuilt in the Gothic style in 1590 with additions in 1610. Since 1973, it has been a listed building. History Dating from the time around 1400, the Spitzen Gebel is the oldest town houseSpitzen Gebel, Bremen tourist board, retrieved 16 January 2014 and the last of its kind in Bremen. The building has served as both a shop and a private residence over the centuries. Its Low German name stems from the pointed gable crowning its facade. It was a wine house, a butcher's shop and a tavern until in 1913 it became an office for the Vereinigten Klaviertr√§ger (united piano movers). As a result, the older residents of Bremen still remember it as the Klaviertr√§gerhaus (piano movers' house). The building has been altered on several occasions. The projecting bay windows, a popular feature in Bremen, and the east doorway were added in 1590. The main doorway was completed in 1610. In 1944, the building suffered serious war damage. A watercolour from 1945 shows a ruined brick building although the characteristic gable can still be seen. By 1950, the house had been fully restored under the guidance of architects Herbert Anker (1908‚Äì1987) and Bernhard Wessel (1904‚Äì1976). A restaurant soon opened inside. Heritage The building is considered important for the city's heritage and it is listed. A bronze sculpture Fietje Balge by the sculptor Bernd Altenstein was erected in the street outside in 2007. A nearby plaque explains the history of the River Balge which once passed nearby.Plaque about Balge, Wikimedia commons, retrieved 23 March 2014 Strange tradition Today's tavern practices a tradition that goes back to 1913 when the piano movers used the premises. As they were not permitted to drink at work, they filled an old lamp with schnapps and took a slurp from time to time without anyone noticing. Today tourists in particular enjoy taking a Sluk ut de Lamp (swig from the lamp) when they visit the bar. The schnapps is made from a centuries-old Swedish recipe which is still a family secret.

It is a setting of a biblical benediction, followed by an extended \\"Amen\\". Rutter scored the piece for four vocal parts (SATB) and organ. He composed it in 1981 for the memorial service of Edward T. Chapman, the director of music at Highgate School, London, with whom he had studied when he attended the school. It was published by Oxford University Press in 1981, in the anthology Oxford Easy Anthems, edited by David Willcocks. Text \\"The Lord bless you and keep you\\" is a setting of the Priestly Blessing, also known as the Aaronic blessing, from the Book of Numbers in the Bible (). The blessing, sung or spoken, is used at the conclusion of worship, baptism, ordination, marriage, and other special occasions in Christian worship. =Other settings= In 1900, Peter Lutkin composed a setting for a cappella choir. Music Rutter's setting is for four vocal parts (SATB) and organ. Marked \\"Andante espressivo\\", the music is in G-flat major and common time. It takes about minutes to perform. Rutter also wrote an arrangement for soprano, alto and keyboard in F major and a version for choir and orchestra. In \\"The Lord bless you and keep you\\", Rutter keeps the music restrained and simple. The accompaniment first rests on a pedal point; long chords in the bass change only every half bar, while broken chords in steady quavers add colour. The first line of the text is sung by the sopranos alone, then repeated by all voices, starting in unison but expanding to harmony on the words \\"The Lord make His face to shine upon you\\". \\"The Lord lift His countenance upon you\\" is sung twice in two-part homophony, first soprano and alto, then tenor and bass. \\"And give you peace\\" appears three times, softer each time from mp to pp, first in the soprano, then in the tenor, and finally in unison in all voices. A polyphonic \\"Amen\\" grows to the climax of the music both in range and in intensity, then gradually softens and, after a \\"molto rallentando\\", reaches the final long chord. Performances Rutter has chosen this work to represent his compositions in workshops. It was part of the celebration of the 100th birthday of the Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother in 2000, and was sung by the choir of St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle at the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex in 2018. =Recordings= The piece has been recorded several times, for example ending a collection of Rutter's choral works performed under his direction by the Cambridge Singers and the City of London Sinfonia. It also concluded the 2010 recording of the composer's Requiem by Polyphony and the Bournemouth Sinfonietta, conducted by Stephen Layton. In his notes to that recording, the composer described his musical aims: \\"I happen not to believe in erecting needless barriers between composer and listener: given a choice between critical approbation and a chance of touching the hearts of people outside the limited circle of contemporary music aficionados, I know which I prefer.\\"  References  Category:Compositions by John Rutter Category:1981 compositions Category:Choral compositions Category:Priestly Blessing ","title":"The Lord bless you and keep you"},{"id":"41612788","title":"1999 South American Cross Country Championships"},{"id":"41612798","text":"GREGOR is a solar telescope, equipped with a 1.5 m primary mirror. located at the Teide Observatory on Tenerife in the Canary Islands.

In the early 1990s he moved to Preston for work and became politically active in the local labour movement. In Preston he continues to be politically active. He is the co-ordinator of the local Stop the War Coalition. He organised a solidarity day in Preston for victims of the Asian Tsunami and has led campaigns against hospital privatisation, Islamophobia, the wars in the Middle East and support for local trade unionists on strike. In May 2007 he was re-elected to Preston council and held his seat until May 2011, when he lost it to Labour. In December 2010 Michael Lavalette proposed a motion to Preston City Council calling for opposition to cuts, job losses and privatisations. This motion had the backing of the local trades council and of 'Preston Against Cuts'. 5 Labour councillors had voted and spoken in favour of this motion at these meetings. When it came to the full council meeting however, all the Labour councillors voted against this motion, and for an amendment supporting 'fairer' cuts backed by the Liberals and Tories.Socialist Worker 8 January 2011 http://www.socialistworker.co.uk/art.php?id=23498 In May 2012 he contested the seat again as a Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition supported candidate and was re-elected.

Origins The alliance grew out of local Socialist Alliances formed by the Socialist Party, Alliance for Workers' Liberty, Independent Labour Network and independent socialists from 1992 onward. They gradually coalesced into the national Network of Socialist Alliances. The Welsh Socialist Alliance was closely allied to the SA but had separate origins. The Socialist Alliance was named and expanded in 1999 when other Trotskyist groups including the Socialist Workers Party, the International Socialist Group and Workers Power joined, as did the formerly separate London Socialist Alliance. In the 2002 local elections, the alliance gained one councillor in Preston, Lancashire. The Socialist Alliance had fraternal relations with the Scottish Socialist Party. Contraction and dissolution In late 2001, the Network of Socialist Alliances was transformed into a one-member-one-vote political party called the Socialist Alliance (a title already registered for electoral purposes). The Socialist Alliance was riven by political disagreements. The Socialist Party left the Alliance in 2001 (after the conference that adopted one member one vote) while Workers Power left in 2003. In 2003, the SWP, supported by the ISG, led the SA into an alliance with George Galloway and other figures involved in the Stop the War Coalition, to form the Respect Coalition. A minority of the SA objected to the way this decision was carried out and argued that the SWP were using their block vote to push their line. Many of these dissidents objected to Respect on principle and all objected to the way the decision to join it was carried out, many forming the Socialist Alliance Democracy Platform. In late 2004, some Socialist Alliance member organisations, which had remained outside Respect, joined with the Socialist Party and the Alliance for Green Socialism to establish the Socialist Green Unity Coalition. As the SWP switched its priorities to working within Respect, the Socialist Alliance became virtually moribund and was formally wound up in February 2005. In March 2005, a few groups and former members of the SA who did not join Respect met as the Socialist Alliance (Provisional). On 12 November 2005, most of the provisional grouping (independent members, and members of the Alliance for Workers' Liberty, Alliance for Green Socialism, the Communist Party of Great Britain (Provisional Central Committee), the Democratic Socialist Alliance, Democratic Socialist Alliance the Republican Communist Network (Scotland), the Revolutionary Democratic Group, the Socialist Unity Network, the United Socialist Party, and the Democratic Labour Party met again and claimed the name of the Socialist Alliance for a re- founded political organisation, registered with the Electoral Commission. In 2007, this small group entered into a mutual affiliation with its largest supporting organisation, the Alliance for Green Socialism.

It was wound down in 1981. It was relaunched in 1992, but merged into Unite Against Fascism in 2003. 1977‚Äì1982 In its first period, 1977‚Äì1982, the Anti-Nazi League was launched directly by the SWP; it was effectively its front organisation. Many trade unions sponsored it, as did the Indian Workers Association (then a large organisation), and many members of the Labour Party, including MPs such as Neil Kinnock. According to socialist historian Dave Renton, the ANL was \\"an orthodox united front\\" based on a \\"strategy of working class unity\\", as advocated by Leon Trotsky. Critics of the ANL, such as Anti-Fascist ActionFighting Talk no.22 October 1999 argue that the ANL's co-operation with \\"bourgeois\\" groups who work closely with the state, such as Searchlight magazine and the Labour Party, rule out this description, making it a classic popular front. Most of the ANL's leafleting and other campaigns in the 1970s were in opposition to far right groups which it claimed were not just racist but fascist, such as the National Front, an organisation led by John Tyndall who had a long history of involvement with openly fascist and Nazi groups. The ANL also campaigned against the British Movement which was a more openly Hitlerite grouping. The ANL was linked to Rock Against Racism in the 1970s, which ran two giant carnivals in 1978 involving bands such as The Clash, Stiff Little Fingers, Steel Pulse, Misty in Roots, X-Ray Spex and Tom Robinson, attended by 80,000 and then 100,000 supporters. Alongside the broad \\"marches and music festival\\" focus of the ANL, in 1977 the SWP also formed regional fighting groups, initially in Manchester and then elsewhere, known as \\"squads\\" to both safeguard the ANL's broad, populist activities, though aggressive stewarding, and also to fight the National Front street gangs whenever the opportunity arose.Steve Tilzey and Dave Hann No Retreat 2003 Although the SWP leadership eventually turned against this \\"dual track\\" approach to anti- fascism ‚Äì expelling many leading \\"squadists\\" in a purge in late 1981 ‚Äì it is said to have proved an effective strategy during the ANL's early years from 1977 to 1979.Steve Tilzey and Dave Hann No Retreat London: Milo Books, 2003; Sean Birchall Beating the Fascists' London: Freedom Press, 2010. =Blair Peach killing= In April 1979, an ANL member, Blair Peach, was killed following a demonstration at Southall against a National Front election meeting. Police had sealed off the area around Southall Town Hall, and demonstrators trying to make their way there were blocked. In the ensuing confrontation, more than 40 people (including 21 police) were injured, and 300 were arrested. Bricks were allegedly hurled at police, who described the rioting as the most violent they had handled in London. Peach was among the demonstrators. During an incident in a side street 100 yards from the town hall, he was seriously injured and collapsed after being struck on the head, allegedly by an unauthorised weapon used by a member of the police Special Patrol Group. Peach died later in hospital. An inquest jury later returned a verdict of misadventure, and no police officer was ever charged or prosecuted, although an internal police inquiry at the time and not released officially for 30 years, thought he had been killed by an unidentifiable police officer.Paul Lewis \\"Blair Peach killed by police at 1979 protest, Met report finds\\", theguardian.com, 23 April 2010 A primary school in Southall bears his name. =Closing of the ANL= In 1981, with the eclipse of the National Front and collapse of the British Movement, the initial incarnation of the ANL was wound up. Some elements within the ANL opposed the winding up of the organisation, including some members of the SWP. After being expelled from the Socialist Workers Party some of these elements formed Red Action and with others organised Anti-Fascist Action. 1992‚Äì2004 In the early 1990s, the far right, and in particular the British National Party (BNP) was resurgent both electorally and in terms of racial attacks (from 4,383 in 1988 to 7,780 three years later).Guardian, 20.2.93 Anti-Fascist Action, now the longest established national anti-fascist organisation in the UK at that time, organised well-attended events in October 1991 ‚Äì a Unity Carnival in East London attracting 10,000 people and a march through Bethnal Green attracting 4,000 people ‚Äì prompting other left-wing groups to launch anti-racist and anti-fascist organisations, including the Anti-Racist Alliance (ARA) in November and the re-launch of the ANL two months later.Keith Popple (1997) \\"Understanding and tackling racism among young people in Britain' in Keith Popple, Jan Laurens Hazekam, eds, Racism in Europe: A Challenge for Youth Policy and Youth Work, London: UCL Press, p.20 When the National Front and the British National Party had been led by John Tyndall, his record of involvement in openly neo-Nazi groups made it far easier to assert that the National Front and BNP were fascist or neo-Nazi in nature. Similarly, Tyndall's convictions for violence and incitement to racial hatred provide ample grounds for the ANL to claim both organisations were racist.Sandra Laville and Matthew Taylor, \\"A racist, violent neo-nazi to the end: BNP founder Tyndall dies\\", The Guardian, 20 July 2005. After 1992, the ANL and other anti-fascists argued that the BNP remained a Nazi party irrespective of the fact that under the leadership of Nick Griffin it adopted what the ANL described as the 'Dual Strategy' of cultivating respectability in the media while retaining a cadre of committed fascists. This position was countered by BNP members who claim that their party is increasingly democratic in its nature. An investigation by The Guardian newspaper (22 December 2006) affirmed the ANL's view that the BNP remains a fascist party. ANL's relaunch was criticised by other anti-racists. The recently launched broad-based Anti-Racist Alliance said: \\"The ANL is an exercise in nostalgia. These people are living off the glory of a few years in the late 1970s, when we're setting up a long-term challenge to racism in Europe, an anti-racist organisation that will live in the community and in the mainstream of political life.\\" ARA's chair Ken Livingstone used his column in The Sun to denounce the ANL as an SWP front. Anti-fascist magazine Searchlight criticised the \\"politics of deceit being practised by the SWP\\", accusing the ANL of deliberately exaggerating the danger posed by the BNP.Paul Anderson \\"Anti-Racists at Odds\\" New Statesman & Society, 15 October 1993 In 1993, the ANL organised a demonstration, attended by up 15,000 people (and marred by police provocation and violence)Transpontine Racist Murder in SE London 8 January 2012 at the BNP's bookshop in Welling, in the wake of the killing nearby of black teenager Stephen Lawrence, attended by Stephen's mother Doreen Lawrence; ARA held a rival protest in central London on the same day.Andrew Hosken, Ken: The Ups and Downs of Ken Livingstone, Arcadia Books, 10 April 2008: Chapter 18: 1985‚Äì1994. Ken and the rise of Socialist Action, 1985‚Äì1994, p.265< However, Doreen Lawrence came to realise that the ANL was a \\"front for the Socialist Workers Party\\". She later wrote that \\"the various groups that had taken an interest in Stephen's death were tearing each other apart and were in danger of destroying our campaign which we wanted to keep focused and dignified\\", and Doreen and Neville Lawrence wrote to both the ANL and ARA to demand that they \\"stop using Stephen's name\\".Doreen Lawrence, And Still I Rise, Seeking Justice for Stephen, Faber and Faber, 2006, pii7 ANL worked with Love Music Hate Racism (based on the earlier Rock Against Racism), from 2002 onwards. In 2004, the ANL affiliated with the National Assembly Against Racism to relaunch as Unite Against Fascism. The ANL National Organiser at the time of the creation of Unite Against Fascism was Weyman Bennett, a member of the Central Committee of the Socialist Workers Party as was Julie Waterson, its previous National Organiser.\\"Julie Waterson (1958‚Äì2012)\\", Socialist Worker, No.2329, 17 November 2012 2018 In August 2018, the Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell called for a revival of \\"an Anti-Nazi League-type cultural and political campaign\\" following a number of far-right and racist incidents in the UK, including fascist attacks on a socialist bookshop by members of the far-right and UKIP, marches in favour of far-right activist Tommy Robinson and high-profile Islamophobia in the Conservative Party. This \\"welcome and timely\\" call to action was supported in a Guardian letter signed by the league's founders, which included former Labour minister Peter Hain, political activist Paul Holborow and leading musicians from Rock Against Racism.

It began in a few European countries in the 1920s and eventually spread around the world. It was at its most significant shortly before and during World War II, where the Axis powers were opposed by many countries forming the Allies of World War II and dozens of resistance movements worldwide. Anti-fascism has been an element of movements across the political spectrum and holding many different political positions such as anarchism, communism, pacifism, republicanism, social democracy, socialism and syndicalism, also including some centrist, conservative, liberal and nationalist viewpoints. Origins With the development and spread of Italian Fascism, i.e. original fascism, the National Fascist Party's ideology was met with increasingly militant opposition by Italian communists and socialists. Organizations such as the Arditi del PopoloGli Arditi del Popolo (Birth) and the Italian Anarchist Union emerged between 1919 and 1921, to combat the nationalist and fascist surge of the post-World War I period. In the words of historian Eric Hobsbawm, as fascism developed and spread, a \\"nationalism of the left\\" developed in those nations threatened by Italian irredentism (e.g. in the Balkans, and Albania in particular). After the outbreak of World War II, the Albanian and Yugoslav resistances were instrumental in antifascist action and underground resistance. This combination of irreconcilable nationalisms and leftist partisans constitute the earliest roots of European anti-fascism. Less militant forms of anti-fascism arose later. For instance, during the 1930s in Britain, \\"Christians ‚Äì especially the Church of England ‚Äì provided both a language of opposition to fascism and inspired anti-fascist action\\". Michael Seidman argues that traditionally anti-fascism was seen as the purview of the political left but that in recent years this has been questioned. Seidman identifies two types of anti-fascism - revolutionary and counterrevolutionary (Seidman uses counterrevolutionary in a neutral sense, noting it is generally thought of as a pejorative). Revolutionary anti-fascism was expressed amongst communists and anarchists, where it identified fascism and capitalism as its enemies and made little distinction between fascism and other forms of authoritarianism. It did not disappear after the Second World War but was used as an official ideology of the Soviet bloc, with the \\"fascist\\" West as the new enemy. Counterrevolutionary anti-fascism was much more conservative in nature, with Seidman arguing that Charles de Gaulle and Winston Churchill represented examples of it and that they tried to win the masses to their cause. Counterrevolutionary antifascists desired to ensure the restoration or continuation of the prewar old regime and conservative antifascists disliked fascism's erasure of the distinction between the public and private spheres. Like its revolutionary counterpart, it would outlast fascism once the Second World War ended. Seidman argues that despite the differences between these two strands of anti-fascism, there were similarities. They would both come to regard violent expansion as intrinsic to the fascist project. They both rejected any claim that the Versailles Treaty was responsible for the rise of Nazism and instead viewed fascist dynamism as the cause of conflict. Unlike fascism, these two types of anti-fascism did not promise a quick victory but an extended struggle against a powerful enemy. During WW2, both anti-fascisms responded to fascist aggression by creating a cult of heroism which relegated victims to a secondary position.Seidman, Michael. Transatlantic Antifascisms: From the Spanish Civil War to the End of World War II. Cambridge University Press, 2017, pp.1-8 However, after the war, conflict arose between the revolutionary and counterrevolutionary anti- fascisms; the victory of the Western Allies allowed them to restore the old regimes of liberal democracy in Western Europe, while Soviet victory in Eastern Europe allowed for the establishment of new revolutionary anti-fascist regimes there.Seidman, Michael. Transatlantic Antifascisms: From the Spanish Civil War to the End of World War II. Cambridge University Press, 2017, p.252 History Anti-fascist movements emerged first in Italy, during the rise of Mussolini, but soon spread to other European countries and then globally. In the early period, Communist, socialist, anarchist and Christian workers and intellectuals were involved. Until 1928, the period of the United front, there was significant collaboration between the Communists and non-Communist anti- fascists. In 1928, the Comintern instituted its ultra-left \\"Third Period\\" policies, ending co-operation with other left groups, and denouncing social democrats as \\"social fascists\\". From 1934 until the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact, the Communists pursued a Popular Front approach, of building broad-based coalitions with liberal and even conservative anti-fascists. As fascism consolidated its power, and especially during World War II, anti-fascism largely took the form of Partisan or Resistance movements. =Italy: against Fascism and Mussolini= Flag of the Arditi del Popolo, a militant anti- fascist group founded in 1921 In Italy, Benito Mussolini's Fascist regime used the term \\"anti-fascist\\" to describe its opponents. Mussolini's secret police was officially known as Organizzazione per la Vigilanza e la Repressione dell'Antifascismo (OVRA), Italian for \\"Organization for Vigilance and Repression of Anti-Fascism\\"). In the Kingdom of Italy in the 1920s, anti- fascists‚Äîmany from the labor movement‚Äîfought against the violent Blackshirts and against the rise of the fascist leader Benito Mussolini. After the Italian Socialist Party (PSI) signed a pacification pact with Mussolini and his Fasces of Combat on 3 August 1921,Charles F. Delzell, edit., Mediterranean Fascism 1919-1945, New York, NY, Walker and Company, 1971, p. 26 and trade unions adopted a legalist and pacified strategy, members of the workers' movement who disagreed with this strategy formed the Arditi del popolo. The General Confederation of Labour (CGL) and the PSI refused to officially recognize the anti-fascist militia, while the Communist Party of Italy (PCd'I) ordered its members to quit the organization. The PCd'I organized some militant groups, but their actions were relatively minor, and the party maintained a non- violent, legalist strategy. The Italian anarchist Severino Di Giovanni, who exiled himself to Argentina following the 1922 March on Rome, organized several bombings against the Italian fascist community. The Italian liberal anti-fascist Benedetto Croce wrote his Manifesto of the Anti-Fascist Intellectuals, which was published in 1925.David Ward Antifascisms: Cultural Politics in Italy, 1943‚Äì1946 Other notable Italian liberal anti-fascists around that time were Piero Gobetti and Carlo Rosselli.James Martin, 'Piero Gobetti's Agonistic Liberalism', History of European Ideas, 32, (2006), pp. 205‚Äì222. Badge of a member of the Concentrazione Antifascista Italiana, 1931. Concentrazione Antifascista Italiana (Italian Anti-Fascist Concentration), officially know as Concentrazione d'Azione Antifascista (Anti-Fascist Action Concentration), was an Italian coalition of Anti-Fascist groups which existed from 1927 to 1934. Founded in N√©rac, France, by expatriate Italians, the CAI was an alliance of non-communist anti-fascist forces (republican, socialist, nationalist) trying to promote and to coordinate expatriate actions to fight fascism in Italy; they published a propaganda paper entitled La Libert√†. An Italian partisan in Florence, 14 August 1944. Between 1920 and 1943, several anti-fascist movements were active among the Slovenes and Croats in the territories annexed to Italy after World War I, known as the Julian March.Milica Kacin Wohinz, Jo≈æe Pirjevec, Storia degli sloveni in Italia : 1866‚Äì1998 (Venice: Marsilio, 1998)Milica Kacin Wohinz, Narodnoobrambno gibanje primorskih Slovencev : 1921‚Äì1928 (Trieste: Zalo≈æni≈°tvo tr≈æa≈°kega tiska, 1977) The most influential was the militant insurgent organization TIGR, which carried out numerous sabotages, as well as attacks on representatives of the Fascist Party and the military.Milica Kacin Wohinz, Prvi antifa≈°izem v Evropi (Koper: Lipa, 1990)Mira Cenƒçiƒç, TIGR : Slovenci pod Italijo in TIGR na okopih v boju za narodni obstoj (Ljubljana: Mladinska knjiga, 1997) Most of the underground structure of the organization was discovered and dismantled by the Organization for Vigilance and Repression of Anti-Fascism (OVRA) in 1940 and 1941,Vid Vremec, Pinko Toma≈æiƒç in drugi tr≈æa≈°ki proces 1941 (Trieste: Zalo≈æni≈°tvo tr≈æa≈°kega tiska, 1989) and after June 1941 most of its former activists joined the Slovene Partisans. During World War II, many members of the Italian resistance left their homes and went to live in the mountains, fighting against Italian fascists and German Nazi soldiers. Many cities in Italy, including Turin, Naples and Milan, were freed by anti-fascist uprisings. =Slovenians and Croats under Italianization= The anti-fascist resistance emerged within the Slovene minority in Italy (1920‚Äì1947), whom the Fascists meant to deprive of their culture, language and ethnicity. The 1920 burning of the National Hall in Trieste, the Slovene center in the multi- cultural and multi-ethnic Trieste by the Blackshirts, was praised by Benito Mussolini (yet to become Il Duce) as a \\"masterpiece of the Triestine fascism\\" (). The use of the Slovene language in public places, including churches, was forbidden, not only in multi-ethnic areas, but also in the areas where the population was exclusively Slovene. Children, if they spoke Slovene, were punished by Italian teachers who were brought by the Fascist State from Southern Italy. Slovene teachers, writers, and clergy were sent to the other side of Italy. The first anti-fascist organization, called TIGR, was formed by Slovenes and Croats in 1927 in order to fight Fascist violence. Its guerrilla fight continued into the late 1920s and 1930s. By the mid-1930s, 70,000 Slovenes had fled Italy, mostly to Slovenia (then part of Yugoslavia) and South America. The Slovene anti-fascist resistance in Yugoslavia during World War II was led by Liberation Front of the Slovenian People. The Province of Ljubljana, occupied by Italian Fascists, saw the deportation of 25,000 people, representing 7.5% of the total population, filling up the Rab concentration camp and Gonars concentration camp as well as other Italian concentration camps. =Germany: against the NSDAP and Hitlerism= 1928 Roter Frontk√§mpferbund rally in Berlin. Organized by the Communist Party of Germany the RFB had at its height over 100,000 members The specific term anti-fascism was primarily used by the Communist Party of Germany (KPD), which held the view that it was the only anti-fascist party in Germany. The KPD formed several explicitly anti-fascist groups, such as the Roter Frontk√§mpferbund (formed in 1924 and banned by the social democrats in 1929) and the Kampfbund gegen den Faschismus (a de facto successor to the latter).Eve Rosenhaft, Beating the Fascists?: The German Communists and Political Violence 1929-1933, Cambridge University Press, 25 Aug 1983, pp.3‚Äì4Heinrich August Winkler: Der Weg in die Katastrophe.

In 1932 the KPD established the Antifaschistische Aktion as a \\"red united front under the leadership of the only anti-fascist party, the KPD\\". Under the leadership of the committed Stalinist Ernst Th√§lmann, the KPD primarily viewed fascism as the final stage of capitalism rather than as a specific movement or group, and therefore applied the term broadly to its opponents, and in the name of anti-fascism the KPD focused in large part on attacking its main adversary, the centre-left Social Democratic Party of Germany, whom they referred to as social fascists and regarded as the \\"main pillar of the dictatorship of Capital.\\"Braunthal, Julius (1963). Geschichte der Internationale: 1914‚Äì1943. Vol. 2, p. 414. Dietz. The movement of National Socialism, which grew ever more influential in the last years of the Weimar Republic, was opposed for different ideological reasons by a wide variety of groups, including groups which also opposed each other, such as social democrats, centrists, conservatives and communists. The SPD and centrists formed the Reichsbanner Schwarz-Rot-Gold in 1924 to defend liberal democracy against both the Nazi Party and the KPD, and their affiliated organizations. Later mainly SPD members formed the Iron Front which opposed the same groups.Siegfried Lokatis: Der rote Faden. Kommunistische Parteigeschichte und Zensur unter Walter Ulbricht.

The civil war was fought between the anarchist territories, stateless lands that achieved workers' self-management, and capitalist areas of Spain controlled by the autocratic Nationalist faction The historian Eric Hobsbawm wrote: \\"The Spanish civil war was both at the centre and on the margin of the era of anti- fascism. It was central, since it was immediately seen as a European war between fascism and anti-fascism, almost as the first battle in the coming world war, some of the characteristic aspects of which - for example, air raids against civilian populations - it anticipated.\\" In Spain, there were histories of popular uprisings in the late 19th century through to the 1930s against the deep-seated military dictatorships. of General Prim and the Primo de la Rivieras These movements further coalesced into large-scale anti-fascist movements in the 1930s, many in the Basque Country, before and during the Spanish Civil War. The republican government and army, the Antifascist Worker and Peasant Militias (MAOC) linked to the Communist Party (PCE),De Miguel, Jes√∫s y S√°nchez, Antonio: Batalla de Madrid, in his Historia Ilustrada de la Guerra Civil Espa√±ola. Alcobendas, Editorial LIBSA, 2006, pp. 189‚Äì221. the International Brigades, the Workers' Party of Marxist Unification (POUM), Spanish anarchist militias, such as the Iron Column and the autonomous governments of Catalonia and the Basque Country, fought the rise of Francisco Franco with military force. The Friends of Durruti, associated with the Federaci√≥n Anarquista Ib√©rica (FAI), were a particularly militant group. Thousands of people from many countries went to Spain in support of the anti- fascist cause, joining units such as the Abraham Lincoln Brigade, the British Battalion, the Dabrowski Battalion, the Mackenzie-Papineau Battalion, the Naftali Botwin Company and the Th√§lmann Battalion, including Winston Churchill's nephew, Esmond Romilly.Boadilla by Esmond Romilly. The Clapton Press Limited, London. 2018. Notable anti-fascists who worked internationally against Franco included: George Orwell (who fought in the POUM militia and wrote Homage to Catalonia about his experience), Ernest Hemingway (a supporter of the International Brigades who wrote For Whom the Bell Tolls about his experience), and the radical journalist Martha Gellhorn. The Spanish anarchist guerrilla Francesc Sabat√© Llopart fought against Franco's regime until the 1960s, from a base in France. The Spanish Maquis, linked to the PCE, also fought the Franco regime long after the Spanish Civil war had ended.See \\"Wolf Moon\\" by Julio Llamazares, Peter Owen Publications, London 2017 =France: against Action Fran√ßaise and Vichy= Demonstration in Paris in 1934. A sign reads \\"Down with fascism\\" Maquis members in 1944 In the 1920s and 1930s in the French Third Republic, anti-fascists confronted aggressive far-right groups such as the Action Fran√ßaise movement in France, which dominated the Latin Quarter students' neighborhood. After fascism triumphed via invasion, the French Resistance () or, more accurately, resistance movements fought against the Nazi German occupation and against the collaborationist Vichy r√©gime. Resistance cells were small groups of armed men and women (called the maquis in rural areas), who, in addition to their guerrilla warfare activities, were also publishers of underground newspapers and magazines such as Arbeiter und Soldat (Worker and Soldier) during World War Two, providers of first-hand intelligence information, and maintainers of escape networks. =United Kingdom: against Mosley's BUF= The rise of Oswald Mosley's British Union of Fascists (BUF) in the 1930s was challenged by the Communist Party of Great Britain, socialists in the Labour Party and Independent Labour Party, anarchists, Irish Catholic dockmen and working class Jews in London's East End. A high point in the struggle was the Battle of Cable Street, when thousands of eastenders and others turned out to stop the BUF from marching. Initially, the national Communist Party leadership wanted a mass demonstration at Hyde Park in solidarity with Republican Spain, instead of a mobilization against the BUF, but local party activists argued against this. Activists rallied support with the slogan They shall not pass, adopted from Republican Spain. There were debates within the anti-fascist movement over tactics. While many East End ex-servicemen participated in violence against fascists, Communist Party leader Phil Piratin denounced these tactics and instead called for large demonstrations.Phil Piratin Our Flag Stays Red. London: Lawrence & Wishart, 2006. In addition to the militant anti-fascist movement, there was a smaller current of liberal anti-fascism in Britain; Sir Ernest Barker, for example, was a notable English liberal anti-fascist in the 1930s.Andrezj Olechnowicz, 'Liberal anti-fascism in the 1930s the case of Sir Ernest Barker', Albion 36, 2005, pp. 636‚Äì60 =United States, circa World War II= American singer-songwriter and anti-fascist Woody Guthrie and his guitar labelled \\"This machine kills fascists\\" There were fascist elements in the United States in the 1930s such as the Friends of New Germany, the German American Bund, the Ku Klux Klan, and Charles Coughlin.https://web.archive.org/web/20180124131225/http://www.traces.org/americanbund.htmlChip Berlet, Matthew Nemiroff Lyons (2000).

During the Second Red Scare which occurred in the United States in the years that immediately followed the end of World War II, the term \\"premature anti-fascist\\" came into currency and it was used to describe Americans who had strongly agitated or worked against fascism, such as Americans who had fought for the Republicans during the Spanish Civil War, before fascism was seen as a proximate and existential threat to the United States (which only occurred generally after the invasion of Poland by Nazi Germany and only occurred universally after the attack on Pearl Harbor). The implication was that such persons were either Communists or Communist sympathizers whose loyalty to the United States was suspect.Premature antifascists and the Post-war world , Abraham Lincoln Brigade Archives Bill Susman Lecture Series. King Juan Carlos I of Spain Center at New York University, 1998. Retrieved 9 August 2009. However, the historians John Earl Haynes and Harvey Klehr have written that no documentary evidence has been found of the US government referring to American members of the International Brigades as \\"premature antifascists\\": the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Office of Strategic Services, and United States Army records used terms such as \\"Communist\\", \\"Red\\", \\"subversive\\", and \\"radical\\" instead. Indeed, Haynes and Klehr indicate that they have found many examples of members of the XV International Brigade and their supporters referring to themselves sardonically as \\"premature antifascists\\". Anti-fascist Italian expatriates in the United States founded the Mazzini Society in Northampton, Massachusetts in September 1939 to work toward ending Fascist rule in Italy. As political refugees from Mussolini's regime, they disagreed among themselves whether to ally with Communists and anarchists or to exclude them. The Mazzini Society joined together with other anti-Fascist Italian expatriates in the Americas at a conference in Montevideo, Uruguay in 1942. They unsuccessfully promoted one of their members, Carlo Sforza, to become the post-Fascist leader of a republican Italy. The Mazzini Society dispersed after the overthrow of Mussolini as most of its members returned to Italy. =Burma, World War II= The Anti-Fascist Organisation (AFO) was a resistance movement against the Japanese occupation of Burma and independence of Burma during World War II. It was the forerunner of the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League. The AFO was formed at a meeting in Pegu in August 1944 held by the leaders of the Communist Party of Burma (CPB), the Burma National Army (BNA) led by General Aung San, and the People's Revolutionary Party (PRP), later renamed the Burma Socialist Party. Whilst in Insein prison in July 1941, CPB leaders Thakin Than Tun and Thakin Soe had co-authored the Insein Manifesto, which, against the prevailing opinion in the Burmese nationalist movement led by the Dobama Asiayone, identified world fascism as the main enemy in the coming war and called for temporary cooperation with the British in a broad allied coalition that included the Soviet Union. Soe had already gone underground to organise resistance against the Japanese occupation, and Than Tun as Minister of Land and Agriculture was able to pass on Japanese intelligence to Soe, while other Communist leaders Thakin Thein Pe and Thakin Tin Shwe made contact with the exiled colonial government in Simla, India. Aung San was War Minister in the puppet administration set up on 1 August 1943 which also included the Socialist leaders Thakin Nu and Thakin Mya. At a meeting held between 1 and 3 March 1945, the AFO was reorganised as a multi-party front named the Anti- Fascist People's Freedom League.Haruhiro Fukui (1985) Political parties of Asia and the Pacific, Greenwood Press, pp108‚Äì109 =Poland, World War II= Proclamation of the Anti-Fascist Bloc (15 May, 1942) The Anti-Fascist Bloc was an organization of Polish Jews formed in the March 1942 in the Warsaw Ghetto. It was created after an alliance between leftist-Zionist, communist and socialist Jewish parties was agreed upon. The initiators of the bloc were Mordechai Anielewicz, J√≥zef Lewartowski (Aron Finkelstein) from the Polish Workers' Party, Josef Kaplan from Hashomer Hatzair, Szachno Sagan from Poale Zion-Left, Jozef Sak as a representative of socialist-zionists and Izaak Cukierman with his wife Cywia Lubetkin from Dror. The Jewish Bund did not join the bloc though they were represented at its first conference by Abraham Blum and Maurycy Orzech. =After World War II= Anti-fascist graffiti in Trnava, Slovakia The anti-fascist movements which emerged during the period of classical fascism, both liberal and militant, continued to operate after the defeat of the Axis powers in response to the resilience and mutation of fascism both in Europe and elsewhere. In Germany, for example, in 1944, as Nazi rule crumbled, veterans of the 1930s anti-fascist struggles formed \\"Antifaschistische Aussch√ºsse,\\" \\"Antifaschistische Kommittees\\" or \\"Antifaschistische Aktion\\" groups (all typically abbreviated to Antifa). Use of the term The Christian Democratic Union of Germany (CDU) politician Tim Peters notes that the term is one of the most controversial terms in political discourse. Michael Richter, a researcher at the Hannah Arendt Institute for Research on Totalitarianism, highlights the ideological use of the term in the Soviet Union and the Eastern bloc, in which the term fascism was applied to Eastern bloc dissidents regardless of any connection to historical fascism, and where the term anti-fascism served to legitimize the ruling government.

He died from injuries received in the Elliot Junction rail accident, forcing a by-election early in 1907. Electoral history Black had been Liberal MP for the seat of Banffshire since the 1900 General Election. The seat had been Liberal since they gained it in 1837. They had easily held the seat at the last election, with an increased majority; Alexander Black Candidates The local Liberal Association selected 31-year-old Walter Waring to defend the seat. Waring was the son of Charles Waring, former Liberal Member of Parliament for Poole. He was unsuccessful Liberal candidate in Wigtonshire in the 1906 general election. The Conservatives chose 39-year- old William Whitelaw as their candidate. Whitelaw was elected at the 1892 general election as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Perth, but lost his seat at the 1895 general election and was defeated when he stood again in 1900. He was a director of the Highland Railway (HR) since 1898, and Chairman of the HR since 1902. Campaign Polling Day was fixed for 16 February 1907. Result The Liberals held the seat with a slightly reduced majority; Walter Waring The Liberal vote share of 67.3%, though less than in 1906, was higher than any other Liberal vote share since before 1885.

He soon formed his own dance band, The Lollipops, and first recorded for Goldband Records in Lake Charles in 1957. As a singing drummer, Lil' Bob's band played Louisiana's dance halls and clubs in the 1960s. They recorded for various small local labels during the early and mid-1960s, before beginning a longer relationship with the La Louisianne label in 1965.

According to Red Pepper magazine, UAF was set up by the Socialist Workers Party and the National Assembly Against Racism. Among the union leaders backing UAF, according to Weyman Bennett, were Billy Hayes Communication Workers Union, Andy Gilchrist and Mick Shaw of the Fire Brigades Union, Mark Serwotka of the PCS public service workers' union, and Christine Blower and Kevin Courtney of the NUT.Weyman Bennett Anti-fascism and the spirit of the united front Socialist Review 385, November 2013 In 2005, the anti-fascist magazine Searchlight disaffiliated from UAF after an argument over tactics to defeat the BNP.

It claims the support of organisations representing labour, teachers, and rights activists. In November 2007, UAF organised a rally of over 1,000 people when BNP leader Nick Griffin and holocaust denier David Irving spoke at the Oxford Union. On 9 June 2009, UAF demonstrated against a BNP press conference given by Griffin and Andrew Brons outside the Palace of Westminster following their election as MEPs. Demonstrators marched towards the group with placards, chanting anti-Nazi slogans, and threw eggs at Griffin, forcing the abandonment of the press conference. Members of the press were also hit. The protesters also kicked Griffin's car and beat it with placards as he was led away from the scene. Two members of the public were hospitalised as a result of the demonstration. Griffin claimed that the attack was carried out with the backing of the Labour Party. The following day, UAF demonstrated at the BNP's next attempt to hold a press conference at a pub in Miles Platting, North Manchester. They chanted anti-fascist slogans and tried to drown out Griffin by playing Bob Marley songs at high volume. One protester was arrested after spitting in the direction of a car belonging to a BNP member. In January 2010, when the Pendle branch of the UAF removed a wreath from the War Memorial in Nelson that was laid down by Councillor Adam Grant, a former soldier and current British National Party member, Richard MacSween of the Pendle UAF said, \\"The BNP have left a wreath and we have removed it because we don't approve of fascism.\\" In response, Councillor George Adam, from the Nelson and District branch of the Royal British Legion, said: \\"I'm annoyed ‚Äì they have no right to remove that wreath. The BNP is a legitimate political party and they have a right to lay down a wreath just as any other members of the public do.\\" BNP Councillor Brian Parker added: \\"It's disgusting, and it's theft.\\" Arrests and violence On 19 August 2009, police arrested 19 protesters during a demonstration by UAF against the BNP's Red, White and Blue Festival in Codnor, Derbyshire. Four people were charged, three with public order offences and one with unlawfully obstructing the highway. On 22 October 2009, the UAF demonstration against Nick Griffin's appearance on the BBC's Question Time programme resulted in injuries to three police officers. UAF national officer and (then) SWP National Secretary Martin Smith was found guilty of assaulting one of the police officers at South Western Magistrates' Court, London, on 7 September 2010. He was sentenced to a 12-month community order, with 80 hours' unpaid work, and was fined ¬£450 pending an appeal. On 20 March 2010, demonstrations from UAF and the English Defence League (EDL) in Bolton led to violent confrontations and the arrest of at least 55 UAF supporters, including the UAF protest organiser Weyman Bennett, on suspicion of conspiracy to commit violent disorder. At least three EDL supporters were also arrested, and two UAF members were taken to hospital with a minor head and a minor ear injury. After Bennett was charged and released, he accused the police of being hostile to anti-racists and called for an inquiry into the police's actions that day. The police, while criticising the EDL for \\"vitriolic name-calling\\" blamed people predominantly associated with UAF for provoking violence and said that they \\"acted with, at times, extreme violence\\". All charges against Weyman Bennett were eventually dropped. In response to this news he was quoted as saying: \\"This is a victory for anti-fascists and for the right to protest. I‚Äôm proud to say that the threat of these charges has not deterred any of us from continuing to stand up against the EDL. I can now continue my work without this serious false allegation hanging over me. It is imperative we continue to protest to protect our multi-racial communities.\\" On 30 August 2010, violence occurred in Brighton, East Sussex, during a UAF protest against a march organised by a group called the English Nationalist Alliance.

It is time the UAF campaigned against the Islamist far right as well as against the EDL and BNP far right.\\" The journalist Andrew Gilligan has claimed that the UAF's reluctance to tackle Islamism is that several of its own members are supporters of such extremism. The UAF's vice-chairman, Azad Ali, is also community affairs co-ordinator of the Islamic Forum of Europe, which Gilligan describes as \\"a Muslim supremacist group dedicated to changing 'the very infrastructure of society, its institutions, its culture, its political order and its creed from ignorance to Islam'\\". Nigel Copsey, Professor of Modern History at Teesside University, wrote that Ali's association with IFE made UAF \\"[run] the risk of turning a blind eye to Islamist extremism\\". Ali was suspended as a civil servant in the Treasury after he wrote approvingly on his blog of an Islamic militant who said that as a Muslim he is religiously obliged to kill British soldiers in Iraq, in 2009. According to Gilligan, Michael Adebolajo, one of the murderers of Lee Rigby in 2013, spoke \\"on the margins\\" of a 2009 UAF demonstration in Harrow. Secretary Weyman Bennett responded by saying that Adebolajo was not an official speaker.

The two-disc, cross-licensed \\"various artists\\" compilation contains 32 tracks culled from a variety of musical sources, including dub, exotica, free jazz, and field recordings. Toop compiled the recordings to serve as both a historical survey of ambient music and an aural companion to his 1995 book Ocean of Sound: Aether Talk, Ambient Sound and Imaginary Worlds. Ocean of Sound was released in January 1996 by Virgin Records. It was well received by music critics and finished fourth in the voting for The Village Voices annual Pazz & Jop poll. The album later went out of print.  Background  Toop in 2015 In 1995, David Toop published his second book, Ocean of Sound: Aether Talk, Ambient Sound and Imaginary Worlds, which examined music as a medium for deep mental involvement. In the book, Toop said that ambient music can be defined as music listened for relaxation or music that \\"taps into the disturbing, chaotic undertow of the environment\\". As an aural companion to the book, Toop curated the compilation album Ocean of Sound, which would also serve as a historical survey of ambient music. The album was released in January 1996 by Virgin Records. It later went out of print, which music journalist Michaelangelos Matos said was because such cross-licensed compilation albums \\"seldom stay available for very long\\".  Music  Brian Eno (2012) produced three of the album's songs. Ocean of Sound is a two-disc, cross-licensed \\"various artists\\" compilation that contains 32 tracks culled from a variety of musical sources, including dub, exotica, free jazz, and field recordings. According to AllMusic's John Bush, all of the songs compiled for the album recapitulate the theme of the book‚Äî\\"that Les Baxter, Aphex Twin, The Beach Boys, Herbie Hancock, King Tubby and My Bloody Valentine are all related by their effect on sound pioneering.\\" In an interview for Perfect Sound Forever, Toop explained why he included free jazz on an album of ambient music, which is commonly thought of as background music: Toop programmed the recordings for the album so that they would segue into one another. Ocean of Sound begins with songs by Jamaican dub producer King Tubby, American jazz keyboardist Herbie Hancock, and English electronic musician Aphex Twin, respectively, before transitioning to compositions by Claude Debussy, John Cage, the Beach Boys, and Peter Br√∂tzmann, as well as an audio recording of Buddhist monks. Toop programmed the Velvet Underground's 1968 song \\"I Heard Her Call My Name\\" so that its muted feedback would segue into an underwater recording of bearded seals barking.  Critical reception  Reviewing for The Wire in 1996, Peter Shapiro said he was impressed by how Ocean of Sound highlighted musical similarities among its disparate artists, calling it a manifestation of the book's discussion and \\"a remarkable collection of great music\\". The Independent wrote that \\"Toop navigates smoothly between the various strands that have contributed to the current techno/'fourth-world' style of ambient-pop\\", because he used sources such as Oriental music, minimalism, and classical composers. Michaelangelo Matos from the Chicago Reader viewed it as an idyllic compilation whose songs segued fluently because of Toop's aesthetic, while noting they could also stand alone as interesting, if not excellent, separate pieces: \\"Ocean of Sound is one of those records that have something to teach even the most jaded music fan about how to listen to music.\\" AllMusic's John Bush recommended the album to any \\"wide-ranging ambient fan\\" and said that it illustrates the ideas in Toop's book \\"beautifully\\". Ocean of Sound was voted the fourth best compilation of 1996 in the Pazz & Jop, an annual poll of American critics published by The Village Voice. Robert Christgau, the poll's supervisor, named it the year's best compilation in his own list for the Pazz & Jop. In Christgau's Consumer Guide: Albums of the '90s (2000), he deemed it a \\"gorgeously segued 32-track tour of trad ambient\\" with recordings that were smaller representations of larger generational concerns such as disorder and anxiety: \\"For Toop, it answers a need that's both postmodern and millennial, synthesizing insecurity and hope, 'bliss' and 'non-specific dread.'\\" Alt URL In a 2011 list for Spin, Chuck Eddy named Ocean of Sound the most essential album of ambient music, writing that its 32 tracks \\"flowed into each other like the seven seas\\".

By European standards, the Di√†logos is a significantly large car with a width, height and standard wheelbase of , as a result of its interior designed to combine the concepts of a perfect atmosphere, a living room, and stress-free driving. Under development since August 1996, the Di√†logos was designed by the company's in-house Centro Stile Lancia under chief designer, Mike Robinson, who described the concept as \\"a futuristic design, a next-generation car, with a flavor of the past\\". Distinctive body features include front styling dominated by a large grille, and the absence of side central pillars with the rear doors opening backwards, to evoke the design of the Lancia Aurelia saloon of the 1950s.Di√†logos interiorThe interior is sumptuously appointed with body-moulding seats trimmed in \\"nabuk\\", said to be similar to chamois leather. In addition, the front seats of the Di√†logos swivel through 90¬∞ to help access into the cabin, and by 180¬∞ to form a sofa facing the rear seats. Other interior features includes: a steering wheel and instrument panel located at the centre for ease of access but that can slide on either side depending on the prevailing driving direction; 2 screens fitted in the back of the front seats; a tactile thin film of softwood bonded to a layer of resin and foam for the dashboard and some other areas; a personal electronic key, known as the \\"Ego Card\\", which allows the car to adapt to an individual's needs associated with seat position, multi-zone climate control settings, steering-wheel and pedal position; automatically opening driver's door upon approaching the car. Mechanically, although not equipped with an engine, the Di√†logos is said to feature an active differential and adjustable drive-torque distribution to both axles as well as advanced multilink suspensions. For example, the front suspension uses a virtual steering axis, with the said axis passing through the center of the front wheels thus claimed to result in potholes or uneven surfaces not causing the wheel to vibrate or turn. The rear suspension too uses a virtual pitch center such that, when riding over an obstacle, the wheel moves back to reduce interference transmitted to the body. In terms of driving technologies the Di√†logos has: fully adaptive headlights that respond to driving conditions; adaptive cruise control; adaptive semi-automatic transmission; anti-collision and lane departure systems; voice control for many systems; exterior cameras. Lancia later adapted and introduced many of the above technologies for mass production, on its Lancia Thesis saloon, which was launched in 2001 and whose exterior styling was based on that of the Di√†logos. Although a wagon concept was also designed, it was never produced to full scale. Lancia Giubileo In 2000, a one-off version named Giubileo was built and gifted to Pope John Paul II as part of the Catholic church's Great Jubilee celebrations. It was powered by a 3.0L Alfa Romeo V6 engine and was valued at 1.5 million. References Di√†logos ","title":"Lancia Dialogos"},{"id":"41613286","text":"is a Japanese artist.

Design and development The VT-16 Orlik was designed by Jiri Matejƒçek and is a high-wing monoplane of all-wood construction, except that the skin is stabilized with polystyrene foam. Its wing has a single spar structure with a forward torsion box; the whole wing is plywood skinned and foam filled, allowing the ribs to be comparatively widely spaced. In plan it is straight- tapered with blunt tips; there are 3¬∞ of dihedral. It has conventional plain ailerons and spoilers at mid-chord, which extend both above and below the wing. At the time of its first flight in August 1959 it was a Standard Class glider with a span. Later aircraft had and spans but it was the 16 m version that went into series production. The fuselage of the Orlik is a semi- monocoque of deep oval cross-section, tapering to the tail. The single-seat cockpit, placed just ahead of the wing, is covered by a side-hinged blown canopy. Its tail is conventional with a straight-edged, ply-covered and foam- filled all-moving tailplane, fitted with an anti-balance tab, mounted on top of the fuselage and ahead of the small fin which is constructed in the same way. The fabric-covered, balanced rudder is broad and taller than the fin, reaching down to the keel. Overall, the vertical tail has almost upright straight edges and a blunt tip. The Orlik has a fixed, semi-recessed monowheel ahead of the wing leading edge, assisted by a small tail bumper. Operational history 25 VT-16 Orliks were produced in the first series production run, going to Czech gliding clubs. The Orlik also set several new Czech national gliding records during 1962. 15 VT-16s and 48 VT-116s remain on the Czech civil aircraft register in 2010, though some are disassembled.

This lake is located in the La Tuque (urban agglomeration), in Mauricie, in Quebec, in Canada. The area around the lake is mostly administered by the Zec Kiskissink.  Geography  South shore of Lake Ventadour is located at 20 km (in direct line) at the northeast of the town of Lac-Edouard, 60.6 km east of La Tuque downtown and 63 miles southwest of Lac Saint-Jean. Lake Ventadour has the shape of a duck in flight, landing to the west, seen in profile. The spout is positioned to the north, which is also the mouth of the lake. This lake has a length of 4.6 km in the north-south direction and a maximum width of 1.3 km (at the level of two bays).

Even when both are painting violent crime narratives, G Rap‚Äôs delivery often manages to maintain its coolness while Necro is characteristically uptight and strained in comparison.

Subject matter and dramatic lyricism aside, the beats only cement a droning effect that sets disappointingly early. Necro's fanbase will undoubtedly rush to the album as a source of more material to pore over, and for many of them, Kool G Rap will be a vaguely familiar extra. The casual fan or those keeping up with G Rap's late career output might find a handful of songs worth mining, but without a previous investment in the over-the-top style, listening through is a test of endurance.

History and development In 1987, construction began on creating a new Bentalls department store and shopping centre. This new development was to include a five level department store and a four level adjoining shopping centre including over 100 retail units. The development took five years to complete and was built in two phases, allowing the existing department store to trade throughout the development period on a reduced footprint. The first phase, the 'new' department store opened in July 1990. The completed shopping centre was opened in November 1992 by Edward Bentall (descendant of Frank Bentall) and Nick Price from Norwich Union with a floor area of .

He is best known for his architectural photography publications and exhibitions, which have been shown internationally. Sexton was born in 1954 in Atlanta, GA, and currently resides in both New Orleans, Louisiana, and Walton County, Florida.  Career  Sexton began photographing as an undergraduate at Emory University. After graduating from Emory in 1975, he moved to San Francisco and enrolled in classes at the San Francisco Art Institute. Sexton's first photographic book project, American Style: Classic Product Design from Airstream to Zippo, was published by Chronicle Books in 1987. Sexton's second book The Cottage Book, which documented the tradition of cottage living in the San Francisco Bay area, cemented book projects as a mainstay of his career. He was featured in a 1989 New York Times article on the expanding cottage architecture trend. Collaborating with architectural historian Randolph Delehanty, Sexton also authored In the Victorian Style, showcasing San Francisco's domestic Victorian architecture. Sexton moved to New Orleans, Louisiana, in 1991, where he worked with Delehanty on New Orleans: Elegance and Decadence, a photo essay with extended captions characterizing New Orleans‚Äô rich history. The book has remained consistently in print since its first publishing. In 1997, Sexton curated the exhibit Sidney Bechet: A World of Jazz 1897-1997 for the Bechet Centennial Committee, which commemorated the centennial of jazz musician Sidney Bechet's birth. Sexton's Terra Incognita monograph of Gulf Coast landscapes received critical acclaim, including a 2008 award from Louisiana Cultural Vistas magazine and a review in the Village Voice. Terra Incognita is accompanied by a traveling exhibit, which has been displayed at the Ogden Museum of Southern Art, the Walter Anderson Museum of Art, the Polk Museum of Art, the Southeast Museum of Photography, and the Pensacola Museum of Art.

Pauli Ernesti Blomstedt, more commonly known as P. E. Blomstedt (1 August 1900 Jyv√§skyl√§ ‚Äì 3 November 1935, Helsinki), was a Finnish architect and designer, who worked first in the Nordic Classicism style and then turned to Functionalism. Both his father, Yrj√∂ Blomstedt, and younger brother, Aulis Blomstedt, were also well-known architects.  Life and career  Finnish Language Adult Education Centre, Helsinki, 1927 and extension, 1959. Blomstedt graduated from secondary school in Jyv√§skyl√§ in 1918, and then started studies in architecture at Helsinki Technical University, graduating in 1922. He first worked as an architect for Armas Lindgren, and later for Bertel Jung as well as working as an assistant to Gunnar Taucher in the City of Helsinki building department. It is a matter of dispute how great an input Blomstedt had in the design of the Finnish Language Adult Education Centre in Helsinki (1927), a key example of the Nordic Classicism style in Finland, usually credited to Taucher ‚Äì and which was later extended in the Functionalist style by Blomstedt's brother Aulis Blomstedt.Entry ‚ÄùPauli E. Blomstedt‚Äù in Simo Paavilainen (ed.), Nordic Classicism, 1910‚Äì1930, pp. 92‚Äì93. Finnish Museum of Archiotecture, Helsinki, 1982. Blomstedt also worked with Taucher on the design of the M√§kel√§nkatu municipal workers‚Äô housing, another key example of the Nordic Classicism style in Finland. In 1924 Blomstedt married architect M√§rta von Willebrand, who had been his fellow student, and who would also become a well-known architect. In 1926 they set up their own architectural firm. They had two children:Yrj√∂ Blomstedt (1926-1994), who became a professor of history at the University of Helsinki and Benita Pasanen (1924-2016), who became the director of the Oulu City Library. Among Blomstedt's first independent designs were Defence Corps buildings in Jyv√§skyl√§ and H√§meenlinna, but these were never realised. During the 1920s Blomstedt took part in a number of architectural competitions and made his breakthrough, aged 26, in 1926 after winning the competition for the design of Liittopankki (Union Bank) House in Helsinki, completed in 1929. At the same time, he also won the competition for the design of the Finnish Savings Bank in Helsinki, completed in 1930. Both these buildings were designed in the Nordic Classicism style prominent at that time, which had overtaken the Jugendstil style dominant for prominent buildings in Helsinki at the turn of the century. His buildings from that time are said to be characterised by a ‚Äúpassionate expressiveness‚Äù, with his bank designs having something in common also with the American office building style of Louis Sullivan. Blomstedt wrote several articles for both Finnish professional journals and newspapers, mainly on the topic of town planning. In his article \\"The Town Planning issues in the Greater Helsinki city centre\\" he opposed the grand plan by Eliel Saarinen for the Helsinki city centre, according to which the area of T√∂√∂l√∂nlahti would be filled in with buildings along a new grand avenue and the city's main railway station moved northwards to Pasila. Blomstedt argued that the area should be retained as a park area. Hotel Pohjanhovi Hotel, 1936. Interior, Hotel Pohjanhovi Hotel, 1936. Blomstedt's breakthrough works in the Functionalist style were the Finnish Savings Bank in Kotka (1935) and the Pohjanhovi Hotel and restaurant in Rovaniemi (1935, destroyed in the Lapland War). A significant design not realised was his entry titled \\"Ruotsinsalmi‚Äù for the architectural competition for the design of Kotka City Hall (won by another Functionalist proposal by Erkki Huttunen). In 1933 Blomstedt took part in the architectural competition for the Temppeliaukio Church in Helsinki. His proposal was considered too utopian to be implemented. However, in the 1960s a new competition was held and the winning entry by Timo and Tuomo Suomalainen was similar to that of Blomstedt.Rectification to the design history of the Temppeliaukio Church From 1933 Blomstedt became the official architect for Alko, which holds the alcoholic beverage retailing monopoly in Finland. He designed their shop and restaurant interiors, including the Pohjanhovi Hotel and restaurant in Rovaniemi. Blomstedt's final building design, the Kannonkoski Church, was completed in 1938, three years after his premature death, under the direction of his wife M√§rt√§ Blomstedt together with architect Matti Lamp√©n. In addition to his architectural work, Blomstedt also designed tubular steel furniture. An exhibition on the life's work of Blomstedt was held at the Museum of Finnish Architecture in 1972, with over 450 drawings on display. Buildings by P. E.

The slide still blocked the original road as of early 2020, although temporary bridges allow one-way traffic around the slide and into the park. The slide is a natural phenomenon, and resulted from the erosion dynamics of the river valley. The slide began on April 29, 2006, and initially the highway remained open, with active monitoring and occasional temporary closures. By May 28, the road was closed permanently, stopping access to the park from Mariposa and severely impacting the local economy. Many park employees reside in Mariposa, and for several months a two-hour trip (one way) was required to get to work in the park. Revenue via the hospitality market dropped extensively, which included wages, profits to small business owners, and county government income from occupancy taxes. A State of Emergency was declared in June 2006 for Mariposa County. The downstream temporary bridge Initially two temporary bridges were built in August 2006. While this detour alleviated a significant portion of the economic impact to the area, vehicles over 28 feet could not use it. In June 2008, new temporary bridges which could accommodate longer vehicles were constructed. The detour via the bridges is one-way, controlled by traffic lights. At the height of the tourist season, this has sometimes resulted in significant delays. The temporary bridges access a road grade, on the north side of the river, which is a vestige of the Yosemite Valley Railroad. Repair of the highway was on permanent hold due to the encroachment of an endangered species into the slide area. In 2012, Assemblymember Kristin Olsen authored legislation that would allow the California Department of Fish and Game to do an initial take of the Limestone Salamander and place it in an Ecological Reserve. The legislation paved the way to restoring this important access route to Yosemite. Known officially as Assembly Bill No. 1973, it passed both houses of the California State Legislature and was signed into law by Governor Jerry Brown on July 13, 2012. After considering the option of a tunnel, CalTrans settled on a rock shed design in 2014. Ferguson Rock Shed The Ferguson Project located in the Merced River Canyon on Highway 140 into Yosemite National Park will result in the longest structure of its kind in State of California and only the second to be completed in the State. The Ferguson Project Team was formed in 2008 to work toward developing the Ferguson Project that will restore full access through the Merced River Canyon in Mariposa County, California. After completion of all necessary environmental studies, and receiving feedback from local government agencies, the U.S. Forest Service, the U.S. Department of Interior, the public and other stakeholders, the Ferguson Project team completed the environmental document and project report in early 2014. The team recommended that the Rock Shed Alternative move forward in final design. The project construction will be in two distinct construction projects. Phase 1: Will remove the existing talus material and install cable drapery to minimize additional rock fall. Work will begin in spring 2015. Phase 2: Will construct a 750-foot rockshed structure on the same alignment. Throughout the duration of the both phase 1 and phase 2 Highway 140 is expected to stay open ‚Äì there are no closures scheduled. The project is expected to be completed by summer 2020.

The mouth of the lake is at the top of the left arm of the V. River outlet of Lake Lescarbot is 3.2 km long (measured by water) and flows to the south of Lake Kiskissink.Geographical audit conducted on December 27, 2013 by historian Ga√©tan Veillette (Saint-Hubert, QC) from the website of Google Map. Lescarbot lake is located near (west side) of the boundary waters between the M√©tabetchouane River and Bostonnais River.  Toponymy  The origin of the name is related to Marc Lescarbot, a Frenchman born at Versins in Picardy, in 1570, a scholar, lawyer, traveler, writer, broker. He came to settle in Port Royal, Annapolis Royal, Nova Scotia, in 1606. However, in 1607, he had to return to France because of the revocation of the monopoly of the fur trade held by Pierre du Gua de Monts.

It is based on the novel of the same name by Eleanor Henderson. The film stars Asa Butterfield as Jude Keffy-Horn, the protagonist of the story. The film premiered at the 2015 Sundance Film Festival on January 23, 2015. The film was released in a limited release and through video on demand on August 14, 2015 by Screen Media Films. Plot Sixteen-year-old Jude Keffy-Horn (Asa Butterfield) is living in Vermont with his adoptive mother Harriet (Julianne Nicholson) and adoptive sister Prudence (Nadia Alexander). In December 1987, Jude and his best friend, Teddy (Avan Jogia), spend their time doing drugs and dreaming about moving to New York City to escape their small home town. Jude‚Äôs permissive hippy father, Les (Ethan Hawke), lives in New York City where he grows and sells marijuana. Les' girlfriend Diane (Emily Mortimer) has a daughter Eliza (Hailee Steinfeld) who buses to Vermont for New Year's Eve. Teddy and Jude meet Eliza at the bus station and take her to a New Year's Eve party. Jude is beaten up outside the party, while Teddy and Eliza talk and have sex in a locked bathroom after Eliza introduces Teddy to cocaine, which they both snort. When they part for the night, Teddy asks Eliza to find his straight edge brother Johnny in New York City and check on him since Johnny doesn't have a phone. Eliza heads back to NYC on the bus while Teddy and Jude head home, stopping to huff Freon. When Harriet awakens she finds Jude unconscious and Teddy dead and frozen after both of them pass out in the yard. Eliza finds Teddy‚Äôs half-brother in Alphabet City, Johnny (Emile Hirsch), and discovers he is not only straight edge but also a Hare Krishna devotee. She tells him to call home because Teddy is worried. When he calls, his drug addict mom answers and tells him about Teddy's death. Eliza discovers she's pregnant with Teddy's baby, and when she tells Johnny and Jude, they decide to keep it a secret. Even though Johnny is a still closeted gay, he eventually proposes to Eliza out of guilt and loyalty to his deceased half-brother. They tell her mother that the baby is his and that they are going to be married. Since Eliza is under 18 and her mother refuses to sign for her to be legally married, the two have a marriage ceremony in the Hare Krishna temple. They borrow Les' van and, because her mother is still against the pregnancy, take Eliza to stay with Harriet while Johnny's band Army of One goes on tour. Jude becomes the new guitar player when Rooster, the original guitar player (whom it is implied Johnny has had a secret relationship with) quits. They come back from tour, and Johnny goes back to New York City, leaving Eliza feeling abandoned. She also confides in Jude that she thinks Johnny may be in love with someone else. Jude, while on tour, overhearing a telephone call between Johnny and Rooster, realizes it is Rooster whom Johnny wants to be with. Realizing it is not his secret to tell, he does not tell Eliza but stops feeling guilty for being in love with her. After realizing they care for each other, Jude and Eliza start a relationship. Jude and Eliza take a bus back to New York where they plan to raise the baby. They go to NY to confront Johnny. He reveals he's been in communication with Teddy's biological father, and that he wants the baby to be given to Teddy's father. Eliza is outraged feeling betrayed because she wants to raise the baby and runs out of the apartment into the middle of the Tompkins Square Park Riots where she goes into labor. Jude chases after her and comforts her after finding her in the chaos. Later, after Eliza gives birth at the hospital, she asks Jude to hold her baby boy. As the film ends, Johnny throws Teddy‚Äôs ashes into the river with Rooster beside him, while Jude narrates from ten years later about how Eliza is in Brooklyn starting her own family and how he too is going to be a father. The closing shot is of Eliza and Teddy's now 10-year-old son happily playing in a park. Cast * Asa Butterfield as Jude Keffy-Horn, a teenage boy who is trying to reconnect with his father in 1988 Manhattan after his best friend Teddy dies of a drug overdose and hypothermia.

She remarked, \\"I read the book and I loved how human the characters were and how flawed, yet well- meaning, they were, which I think is a very truthful thing about most people. I loved that era in New York. I thought it was such an exciting time for me, so there was a personal connection. It was this time when New York was really scruffy and dangerous, and there was crime, violence, crack, and AIDS ‚Äì a lot of very horrible things, but also excitement and creative opportunity. You could be an artist and live in Manhattan in a squat and pay no rent. It seems inconceivable right now.\\" In addition, Berman also was interested in the parenting aspect of the story, adding, \\"One of the things in the book that‚Äôs so interesting ‚Äì and I had friends like this ‚Äì are people who were raised by parents who were hippies and didn‚Äôt give them a lot of rules and boundaries. The question is, how do you rebel against the people who invented rebellion? [Laughs] Because youth is about rebelling. I think there‚Äôs an element of that in straight edge, which became very popular around that time with young people who were rebelling against what they thought was screwing up their parents. There was something seductive and rebellious about being sober and not being promiscuous [Laughs].\\" Hailee Steinfeld was announced to be in talks for the role of Eliza in October 2013, and was cast in December of that year. Asa Butterfield and Ethan Hawke were cast earlier before Steinfeld. Emile Hirsch, Julianne Nicholson, Emily Mortimer and Nadia Alexander were cast in early 2014. Avan Jogia was cast as Teddy in early February 2014. Filming started in New York City on January 27, 2014 and ended on March 3, 2014.

The film went on to premiere at the Provincetown International Film Festival on June 17, 2015. The film was released on August 14, 2015 in a limited release and through video on demand.

The idea of ordaining a woman rabbi is highly controversial in Orthodox Jewish communities, so the title ‚Äúmaharat‚Äù was created on her behalf.

As the President, she is believed to be the first woman and first lesbian to lead a Jewish congregational union, and the first female rabbi and first lesbian to lead a Jewish seminary; the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College is both a congregational union and a seminary. * 2013: On October 27, 2013, Sandra Roberts became the first woman to lead a Seventh-day Adventist conference when she was elected as president of the Southeastern California Conference. However, the worldwide Seventh-day Adventist church did not recognize this because presidents of conferences must be ordained pastors and the worldwide church did not recognize the ordination of women. * 2013: Jean A.

It is found on the seabed at abyssal depths of or more. Around 1996, its numbers in the Porcupine Abyssal Plain in the northeastern Atlantic increased dramatically from a few individuals per hectare to over six thousand per hectare, a phenomenon that became known as the \\"Amperima event\\". Distribution and habitat Amperima rosea is a small sea cucumber growing to a length of between . It occurs on the sediment-covered seabed of the deeper parts of the Pacific, Indian and Atlantic Oceans, including the Porcupine Abyssal Plain in the northeastern Atlantic. Behaviour Amperima rosea is a detritivore and feeds on phytodetritus by sifting through the sediment on the seabed. The phytodetritus is the remains of phytoplankton from shallow water locations which drifts down like snow or under certain conditions sinks rapidly to the sea floor. Amperima rosea breeds at any time of year. The eggs are small (less than 200Œºm in diameter) and lack much yolk indicating that larval development is likely to be planktonic. The species displays a high level of fecundity and it is likely that mass spawning takes place after some external stimulus such as a sudden increase in food supply. Amperima event In the mid-1990s in the Porcupine Abyssal Plain, the density of Amperima rosea on the seabed increased from pre-1995 levels of two or three individuals per hectare to over six thousand per hectare, and this new high population level was maintained in subsequent years. During the same period other species of sea cucumber in the area also increased in number but decreased in average size and the brittle star Ophiocten hastatum also had an explosive increase in population density. The rate at which 100% of the surface layer of the seabed was completely turned over was reduced from two and a half years to six weeks. The increase in density of the sea cucumbers has been linked to a greater abundance of phytodetritus and this in turn may be due to higher surface water temperatures caused by climate change. The rapid increase in sea cucumber populations as a response to increased food supply may have reduced the build- up of organic materials in the sediment which would otherwise have occurred.

Alric was a member of the Arduinici dynasty, the son of Manfred, marquis of Susa, and his wife Prangarda. His brother Ulric Manfred succeeded to his father's titles. With Ulric's help, Emperor Henry II invested Alric as bishop of Asti in 1007 or 1008 in opposition to Peter, who had supported Arduin's claims against the emperor.Vergano, 'Alrico' Alric was confirmed as bishop by Pope John XVIII, without the approval of Arnulf II, archbishop of Milan. To appease Arnulf, Ulric and Alric were required to walk barefoot carrying (respectively) a dog and a bible to the Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio in Milan before humbling themselves before Arnulf.Hamilton, 'Inquiring into adultery,' pp. 21ff. Alric made many donations to monasteries and other religious institutions, both on his own and with his brother and Ulric's wife, Bertha of Milan. Alric was a loyal supporter of the next archbishop of Milan, Aribert.

This lake is marking the former northwestern boundary of the lordship of Batiscan, which was once the property of Jesuits.  Geography  Lake Vlimeux is located mainly in the territory of rank 1 Saint-Roch-de- M√©kinac, some in row 2, and the part in Sainte-Th√®cle is included in the range II South Western Lejeune Township. This lake is located 4.3 km (direct line) east of Saint-Maurice River, 3.5 km (direct line) north of Second Lake Roberge, 6.4 km (direct line) south of the church of Saint-Joseph-de-M√©kinac and 6.4 km (direct line) west of Lake Jesuit. Lake Vlimeux covers 1.1 km2 and is 2.1 km long. This lake has three sections, the respective width: southern part (300 m.), Long bay with a 100 m wide central part (450 m) and northern part (700 m). Five tributaries of Lake Vlimeux, three islands and peninsulas give it a very irregular contour. The shape of the lake resembles a tree whose height is facing south. The lake Vlimeux receives the water from lake Pleau and Lake Elizabeth, located to the south. The lake Vlimeux draining from the north into the creek Vlimeux, which crosses the Little lake Vlimeux. Both lakes are spaced by 150 meters. Possessed by the Government of Qu√©bec, a dam is arranged at the mouth of Little Lake Vlimeux. Thence Vlimeux Creek flows north and cut three woodlots west end of the territory of Sainte-Th√®cle (row 1 Southwest). The stream continues his journey in the territory of Trois-Rives, branching off to the northwest, draining the rows I and II, and will flow into the Mekinac River, which in turn flows west to empty into the Saint-Maurice River.  Toponymy  \\"Lake Vlimeux\\" appears on a map of the Lejeune Township in 1881. The name \\"Lake Vlimeux\\" appears in the 1914 in edition of \\"Dictionary of rivers and lakes in the province of Quebec\\". This gazetteer designation has undergone several variations on forest maps such as Villemieux and Vilimieux.Publication \\"Names and places of Quebec\\", the Geographical Names Board, published in 1994 and 1996 as an illustrated dictionary printed and under a CDROM made by Micro-Intel in 1997 from this dictionary. In 1959, the Commission de toponymie du Qu√©bec (Geographic Board of Qu√©bec) has standardized this case under the name \\"Lake Venimeux\\". This name appears in the \\"Gazette officielle du Qu√©bec\\" in 1969 and \\"Gazette officielle du Qu√©bec\\" in 1978. Finally, the Geographical Names Board of Qu√©bec changed his mind by restoring the old form, the toponym \\"Lake Vlimeux\\" was officially registered on January 31, 1980 the Bank of place names in Commission de toponymie du Qu√©bec (Geographical Names Board of Quebec) given that the toponym \\"Lake Vlimeux\\" was well established in the regional dialect. In the ancient language of French-Canadians, the term \\"vlimeux\\" evokes the unpredictability, malicious, mischievous, mocking or \\"ratoureur\\" a person to reach his ends subtly, sometimes making use of indirect means to deceive. The Wikdictionnaire attributed quasi-synonyms such as: playful, \\"ratoureux\\", comic, inconvenient or tanning. Seeking to know the etymology of the term, some researchers argue the thesis that the toponym \\"vlimeux\\" would be a derivative of \\"poisonous\\". Moreover, in modern parlance, the term usually has a pleasant or nice, used in addressing children connotation. However, use of the term \\"Vlimeux\\" for naming a place is unusual.
