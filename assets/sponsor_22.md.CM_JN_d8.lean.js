During its existence from 1985 to 2002, it was routinely criticized for its severity (often labeled \\"draconian\\") and its effects on the local music scene and industry. After several unsuccessful attempts to repeal it through lobbying and later court action, it was finally repealed and replaced with the All-ages Dance Ordinance. History From 1977 to 1985, teen dances were unregulated in Seattle. Activities at underage clubs were attracting the attention of the public and a club called The Monastery was particularly notorious for allegations of sexual abuse, child prostitution, and drug and alcohol use. The Monastery was run by George Freeman and was ostensibly a non-profit church of the Universal Life Church, whose dance events were \\"religious services\\". During daytime hours it was a youth center that attracted runaways and homeless youth. The Teen Dance Ordinance (TDO) was conceived and passed the City Council on July 29, 1985 to stop abuses at underage clubs. It was amended in 1988. Key among its provisions were: * Age limits: Underage dances (allowing those under 18 to attend) may only admit patrons age 15-20 unsupervised. Anyone younger would require a parent or guardian chaperone and anyone older would need to be accompanying a youth under 18. * Security requirement: Two off-duty police officers were required on premises, with one off-duty officer outside to patrol the area. * Insurance: $1,000,000 in liability insurance was required; * Exemptions: Non- profits and schools were exempt from these restrictions.Licata, Nick. Urban Politics #92. Seattle City Council, Office of Councilman Nick Licata. September 9, 2000. Retrieved June 20, 2006. With these requirements, teen dances outside of schools were virtually banned in the city, as no promoter would undertake the costs involved. For a city the size of Seattle, shows that would only allow 15- to 20-year-olds could not draw a large enough crowd for the event to break even. In addition to the $1 million insurance bond, hiring off-duty officers was a huge expense. The non-profit exemption meant the ordinance did not apply to the Monastery; it was closed using pre-existing civil abatement laws. In the 15 years of the ordinance, almost no one applied for a promoter's license for youth events, and no one has been prosecuted with it. While the ordinance only regulated \\"dances,\\" the distinction between a concert and a dance was not outlined by law, and the police were accused of defining a dance so liberally that the dancing done in the audience of a concert was enough to qualify the entire event as a \\"dance.\\" All-ages concerts were thus subject to being shut down by police who were vigilant in making sure promoters did not skirt the law. As a result, some nationally touring acts refused to do shows in Seattle because they insisted on all-ages audiences. With Seattle becoming an epicenter for alternative rock and the grunge scene in the early 1990s, teens had to go to neighboring cities to attend concerts and dances.Vogel, Jennifer. Guilty Feet. Mother Jones. March 1999. Retrieved June 20, 2006, Proponents of the TDO said that the ordinance ensured the safety of underage patrons and discouraged gatherings where youth consumed drugs and alcohol. They also invoked the memory of the Monastery, where they said adults preyed upon vulnerable kids susceptible to offers of drugs or quick cash. Excluding adults from underage youth would, in their eyes, create a \\"bubble of safety.\\"Paynter, Susan. Repeal teen dance law? Let's sit this one out. Seattle Post-Intelligencer. August 7, 2000. Retrieved June 20, 2006. The repeal of the ordinance was a key goal of JAMPAC, a musicians' and promoters' political action committee founded by Krist Novoselic of Nirvana. Since its founding in 1995, the group lobbied the City Council to repeal the TDO.Russel, Deborah. Nirvana Bassist Forms Artist, Fan Action League in Seattle Billboard Magazine. February 18, 1995. Retrieved June 20, 2006. The ordinance was a focal point for a vocal young activist community in Seattle, notably those consolidated as The All Ages Music Organization, and later by the Music and Youth Task Force, which allowed for youth and public officials to meet regularly to find resolution to conflicting points of view.Howland Jr., George. A time to dance . The Seattle Weekly. May 15, 2002. Retrieved June 20, 2006. A new ordinance proposed to replace the TDO was passed by the City Council in 2000, however it was quickly vetoed by Mayor Paul Schell. The veto caused JAMPAC to launch a suit against the City of Seattle, claiming that the TDO's virtual outlawing of dance infringed on the First Amendment right to free expression. A judge however ruled for the City on JAMPAC's suit in May 2002, claiming there was no infringement on the First Amendment and that the matter is a political one for the Council to decide, not the courts. Nevertheless, during the course of the suit, Schell was voted out of office (in the aftermath of the disastrous WTO meetings of 1999) and the new mayor Greg Nickels, a proponent of the bill, resubmitted the ordinance to the Council. The new All-ages Dance Ordinance, written by members of the Music and Youth Task Force, was passed on August 12, 2002, replacing the TDO. All-Ages Dance Ordinance The new provisions of the All-Ages Dance Ordinance (AADO) eased on restrictions to accommodate new youth events. They include: * a definition of a dance as an event where dancing is the primary activity intended * allowing all-ages events to occur absent any alcohol served * requiring only the requesting of off-duty officers at an event, to be granted by the Seattle Police Guild * elimination of the $1 million insurance requirementHowland Jr., George. Slow Dance. The Seattle Weekly. August 14, 2002 The new rules, while more liberal than before, still disappointed many activists who pushed for the TDO's repeal. They viewed the new ordinance as only moderate changes to the rules and not liberal enough to actually encourage all ages shows. Proponents of the TDO also criticize the new AADO, saying the new all-ages events are now ignored by the police, and that the new law is confusing and ignored by unlicensed promoters. Raves have also been points of criticism; they have now been classified as concerts and are outside the scope of the ordinance while frequent use of MDMA by attendees have been reported.Chan, Sharon Pian.

The division between these two suborders represents a very deep evolutionary divide between two very different types of turtles. The physical differences between them, although anatomical and largely internal, are nonetheless significant, and the zoogeographic implications of them are substantial. The Pleurodira are known more commonly as the side-necked turtles and the name Pleurodira quite literally translates to side neck, whereas the Cryptodira are known as hidden-necked turtles. The Pleurodira turtles are currently restricted to freshwater habitats in the Southern Hemisphere, largely to Australia, South America, and Africa. Within the Pleurodira, three living families are represented: Chelidae, also known as the Austro-South American side-necked turtles, the Pelomedusidae, also known as the African mud terrapins, and the Podocnemididae, also known as the American side-neck river turtles. However, they are a cosmopolitan clade across the Cretaceous and Cenozoic, and even occurred in marine environments across the world. Definition and description The Pleurodira are identified by the method with which they withdraw their heads into their shells. In these turtles, the neck is bent in the horizontal plane, drawing the head into a space in front of one of the front legs. A larger overhang of the carapace helps to protect the neck, which remains partially exposed after retraction. This differs from the method employed by a cryptodiran, which tucks its head and neck between its forelegs, within the shell. The different methods of bending the neck require completely different anatomies of the cervical vertebrae. All extant turtles studied so far have eight vertebrae in the neck. In the Pleurodira, these vertebrae are narrow in cross-section and spool-shaped with biconvex centra on one or more of the cervicals. These centra act as a double joint, allowing a large degree of sideways movement and providing a means of folding the neck onto itself in the lateral plane. Conversely, in the Cryptodira, the neck bones are wide and flat. The biconvex centra in some of the cryptodiran cervicals allow the neck to fold onto itself in the vertical plane. Pleurodirans also differ from cryptodirans in the emarginations of their skulls. Skull emargination provides room and anchorage for the jaw muscles. The connection points and the position of the emarginations relate to different bones of the skull. Another difference is in the arrangement of the bones of the shell and the scutes overlaying them. Pleurodiran turtles have 13 scutes on the plastron of the shell, whereas cryptodiran turtles have only 12. The extra scute is called the intergular and is at the front of the plastron between the gular scutes. Pelomedusid turtles also possess mesoplastra, further differentiating this group.  Family: Chelidae  One of the three families that still lives in this suborder is the family Chelidae. This family contains 14 genera with a total of 61 species, and they are distributed among Australia, New Guinea, and South America. This group of Testudines characteristically have dorsoventrally flattened skulls and shells and are known for long snake like necks. This family is unique for having a specially adapted strategy for catching prey. While the majority of the family Chelidae are omnivores there are 17 species that are carnivores. Those carnivores are Chelus fimbratus and species of the Chelodina genus. This special strategy is referred to as a gape-suck mechanism. This mechanism is when the turtle first opens its mouth little by little at first. Then, when the turtle is within striking range of the prey, it will open its mouth completely sucking in water at such a rate that the current into its mouth is too strong for prey to escape and engulf the prey within 0.004 seconds. This strategy also circumvents issues to quick capture of underwater prey. These issues include: resistance to rapid movement in water, pressure-waves due to rapid strike, and rapid water intake when feeding.

It was invented by Raoul Grimoin-Sanson and it simulated a ride in a hot air balloon over Paris. It represented a union of the earlier technology of panoramic paintings and the recently invented technology of cinema. It worked by means of a circulatory screen that projects images helped by ten synchronized projectors. Grimoin- Sanson began experimenting with movie cameras and projectors in 1895 and was in contact with other early researchers such as √âtienne-Jules Marey. He patented the Cin√©orama on 27 November 1897.  History  Inside of the projection booth In 1893, kinetoscope from Thomas Edison had been causing an enormous speculation between the other inventors, engineers and philosophers about the future of theater and narration. This invention let a single spectator see an image moving through a little spy hole in the top part. In the United States, Edison's new device was protected with patents and impeccable lawyers; but in other parts of the world he was not able to protect it. This way, loyal to the epoch's spirit, an electric engineer from England named Robert W. Paul was making its own fame with the reproduction of copies based on pirated designs. Raoul Crimoin-Sanson, another French inventor, was on a trip to England. He was part of a small but growing group of cinema enthusiasts that had heard about the copy of the kinetoscope made by Paul, so they all decided to go after their own. When both their paths finally met, Sanson discovered that Robert Paul was not only making copies of kinetoscopes, but he was also working on a way to project them in a screen, a revolutionary idea which Sanson had also been thinking about. Without hesitation, Raoul Crimoin-Sanson made an order. Many people had watched though that small spy hole to see an image moving, but only few had imagined it would ever be projected on a wall. Sanson and Paul had talked about it at length about where was the world of \\"image moving\\" or \\"motion picture\\" going, comparing notes with their ideas about a visual future. Paul was inspired by the science- fiction of movement (HG Wells). He imagined the public being surrounded by projected images to create a \\"moving image trip through time and space\\". Decades before the arrival of the cinematographic industry, Paul presented a patent for his idea. All kinds of tricks, constructions and projections of images were used so that the public could \\"feel a physical feeling\\" of movement through time and space. He was probably the first visionary of Virtual Reality. Robert Paul went on to invent the first commercial cinema projector in Great Britain, but his vision of a \\"moving image's journey through time\\" would never come to fruition. The meeting with Paul should have been inspirational for Raoul Sanson as he returned to France with his own kinetoscope and immediately began to work on his own method to project images on a screen. Less than a year later, that was precisely achieved. A demonstration of his Phototachygraphe machine was made to journalists from all over France. It was 1897 when the combination of two shots together in something similar to \\"a sequence\\" was not even a thoughtful reality, the film industry was decades away. The \\"moving image\\" or \\"motion picture\\" was not on anyone's radar, only a few bourgeois thinkers had paid attention. and yet, in France, Sanson was imagining an immersive and incredible future. The obtaining of motion pictures projected on a screen was just the first step in his real vision. The movie cameras were barely working, and he was already thinking about the combination: \\"If it is possible to project on a single screen, why is it not possible to project on multiple screens?\\". Within three years, the best investors, inventors, thinkers and entrepreneurs in the world would arrive to Paris for the magnificent \\"Universal Exhibition\\" in 1900. It was destined to mark the beginning of a century of technological progress. Sanson had made a name for himself with the device \\"Photoachygraphe\\", and this way convinced some investors to support his idea. The Cin√©orama was born. His idea consisted in the public being housed in a basket of a hot air balloon for a large-scale reproduction. Below the basket there was a projection room made to measure which housed 10 synchronized projectors arranged in a circle. Each one of them projected on a giant screen, resulting in an overwhelming 360-degree motion picture surrounded by a surprised audience. However, there was a problem in the projection room. To make the machine work, the projection operator was put up in a narrow wooden box next to 10 huge and inefficient projection lamps. In just a few seconds of turning on the machine, the temperature in the projection room would raise hastily. Surprisingly, the projection operator achieved three days of projections with applause, but on the fourth day, he fainted because of the heat, causing concern to the authorities for the possibility of a fire. This incident was a complete disaster for the company \\"Sanson's Cineorama\\". A year later, the company was totally bankrupt and their material was sold on 1901. Sanson left the cinema industry and got into the cork industry, falling into historical and cultural oblivion. Nevertheless, while his company died, the idea of immersive cinema had been born.  Technical aspects  Cin√©orama consisted of 10 synchronized 70 mm movie projectors, projecting onto 10 9x9 meter screens arranged in a full 360¬∞ circle around the viewing platform. The platform was a large balloon basket, capable of holding 200 viewers, with rigging, ballast, and the lower part of a huge gas bag. Camera platform The film to be shown was made by locking together 10 cameras with a single central drive, putting them in an actual balloon, and filming the flight as the balloon rose 400 metres above the Tuileries Gardens. On projecting the film, the experience was completed by showing the same film backwards, to simulate a descent. Some references describe a much longer experience, involving a trip to England, Spain, and the Sahara, but it is unclear whether the complete plan was realized. Cin√©orama lasted only three days at the Exposition. On the fourth day it was shut down by the police for safety reasons. Extreme heat from the projectors' arc lights, in the booth below the audience, had caused one workman to faint, and the authorities were worried about the possibility of a deadly fire. Cin√©orama was never shown again, but a modern version, Circle-Vision 360¬∞, was introduced at Disneyland in 1955 and continues in use today at other Disney properties.

According to this reference, she was \\"the third daughter of the late Dr. Congreve of Peckham\\". The family moved to South Australia in 1852, started a school at Mount Barker and on 16 February 1860 Matilda married the Rev. Ephraim Evans, a Baptist minister, who died 6 April 1863. In 1860 Mrs Evans opened a school at Angaston which was still in existence in 1868. She wrote her first story, Marian; or the light of Some One's Home while she was at Mount Barker and it appears to have been immediately successful. The British Museum catalogue records an edition published at Bath in 1860, a second edition was published by John Darton and Company in 1861, and another edition published by Sampson Low appeared in the same year. Evans had chosen as a pseudonym Maud Jean Franc, but in her later books variations in the spelling of both Maud and Jean appeared. Her second book Vermont Vale came out in 1866 and during the next 19 years 13 other volumes were published. She died of peritonitis in 1886 and was survived by two sons. The elder, Henry Congreve Evans (died 1899) was leader of the staff of the Adelaide Advertiser and author of the libretto of Immomeena: an Australian Comic Opera published in 1893. The younger, William James Evans, was joint author with his mother of Christmas Bells, a collection of short stories published in 1882. He also published in 1898 Rhymes without Reason and died in 1904. The stories of Maud Jean Franc were often reprinted. A collected edition in 13 volumes was published in 1888 and 40 years after. They are pleasantly told tales somewhat sentimental and rhetorical in style, sincerely religious and didactic in theme.

The first in the Boogiepop series, it was released in 1998 by MediaWorks and won the fourth Dengeki Game Novel Contest. A manga adaptation by Kouji Ogata began serialization in 1999. It is licensed in English by Seven Seas Entertainment under the title Boogiepop Doesn't Laugh. The story takes place in an unnamed Japanese city, and follows five students at Shinyo Academy as they try to piece together the puzzle of a new drug and recent disappearances among the student populace. While the teachers believe them to only be runaways, the female students whisper among themselves about the urban legend Boogiepop, who is said to be a shinigami.  Explanation of the novel's title  The titles used in the Boogiepop Series can typically be separated into multiple titles. The full, Japanese title of this novel is Boogiepop wa Warawanai Boogiepop and Others. Typically the translation of Boogiepop wa Warawanai is either Boogiepop Doesn't Laugh or Boogiepop Doesn't Smile; the publishers of the manga of the same name chose to use the Boogiepop Doesn't Laugh translation. This refers to the character Boogiepop, who is usually described with a deadpan expression, and is never seen to laugh or smile. Boogiepop and Others simply refers to the character Boogiepop, and the 'other' characters.  Plot summary  When waiting for his girlfriend, Touka Miyashita, to arrive, Keiji Takeda sees a ragged looking man stumbling through the town. A short man in a black cloak speaks with the other man after he collapses, then berates the crowd for not helping. When the police arrive, the two escape, but what shocked Takeda most of all was that the cloaked man has the face of his girlfriend. The following day, Miyashita acts as if nothing had happened the previous day. Takeda sought to speak with her after school, but instead spots the cloaked man. Confronting him, the stranger introduces himself as Boogiepop. Boogiepop claims to be a split personality, who has emerged to protect the world. Boogiepop explains to Takeda that Miyashita is unaware of his existence, and would modify her memories to explain the blank periods. Boogiepop has appeared this time to face a man-eater hiding in the school. Through their discussions, the two come to accept each other, and become friends. In the end, Boogiepop appears to Takeda in Miyashita's school uniform, and explains that the crisis was over, so he would disappear. To the end, Takeda is sure that Boogiepop is merely Miyashita's repressed possibilities, rather than a monster-fighting hero. Kazuko Suema has an unusual interest: criminal psychology. Despite this interest, she had little interest in the rumours the other girls talk about in class, about a shinigami named Boogiepop. While walking home with her friend, Kyoko Kinoshita, Kinoshita is attacked by Nagi Kirima, The Fire Witch. Kirima interrogates her about something, but stops when she realizes that she had only caught a 'normal' person; a drug-user. Suema confronts Kirima about this, but was told to let go of the events of five years ago ‚Äì but Suema had never told anyone about that! Unable to let things happen without her being aware of them again, Suema searches for Kirima's house, and confronts her. However, Kirima reveals little about what she is doing, and only tells her that Boogiepop had saved her five years ago. Masami Saotome joins a group date with Akiko Kusatsu. Late in the night, he drops a tablet into her drink; when she falls ill, he tells the others that he will get her home. Taking her to an abandoned building, he signals for Manticore to come; she turns the corpse into her loyal slave. Two months prior, Saotome had found the corpse of Yurihara at school, before himself being attacked by Manticore. Rather than panic or fight back, he told Manticore it would be better off leaving him alive and taking the form of Yurihara. In time, the two were deeply in love with each other, as they hatched their plan to conquer the world. As their experiments in controlling people begin to fail, and Nagi Kirima seems to be investigating too close, the relationship between Saotome and Manticore strains, until Naoko Kamikishiro came upon them, calling for Echoes. Manticore kills Kamikishiro, but for Saotome, this was the missing link: he has a plan to solve their problems. Akio Kimura receives a letter telling him that Naoko Kamikishiro was dead. Two years ago, when they were in High School, he met Kamikishiro when she was confessing her love to Shirou Tanaka. Returning to his hometown to investigate the origin of this letter, Kimura runs into Touka Miyashita. Miyashita tells him that he should get over the disappearance of Kamikishiro, but Kimura tells her that an alien had taken Kamikishiro into space with him. Kamikishiro had told Kimura that she had met an alien named Echoes, who had been sent to evaluate humanity, but he had been cloned. His clone was now somewhere in their town, and he was looking to kill it before it killed the humans. As Kimura and Miyashita go their separate ways, Miyashita ‚Äì but at the same time not Miyashita ‚Äì tells him that Kamikishiro had \\"done her duty\\". Shirou Tanaka approaches Kei Niitoki about the disappearance of Naoko Kamikishiro. Masami Saotome suggests they ask Nagi Kirima, a friend of Kamikishiro. Unable to find her around the school, Saotome suggests summoning her over the school's PA. Recognising a trap, Kirima cut the lights to the PA room, and knocked out the three students with a stun gun. When they came to, they were presented to Echoes, who indicated that they were normal humans. After they were released by Echoes, Saotome stabbed him in the throat with a poison-filled mechanical pencil before Manticore attacked. Saotome then slashed Kirima's throat, killing her. By the time Niitoki comprehended the situation, Echoes was being defeated by Manticore. However, he points to the sky, and transforms into light. Echoes directs the beam of light towards Manticore, but Saotome intervenes; he just barely saves her, but was killed instead. Hoping to take this chance to escape, Niitoki runs, but Manticore pursues. Hearing someone whistling Die Meistersinger von N√ºrnberg, she heads towards the sound. Niitoki trips, but Manticore becomes trapped in a wire. Niitoki's savior has the face of Touka Miyashita, but claims to be Boogiepop. While Manticore is trapped, Boogiepop calls for Tanaka to shoot it with an arrow; an arrow to the head finishes the creature. Finally, Kirima rises from the dead, apparently resurrected by Echoes as he left.  Characters  ; The shinigami whispered of among the female students of Shinyo Academy, but is his origin truly of the supernatural, or is he merely an alternate personality of his 'host', Touka Miyashita? ; A being who took upon the form of the final stage of human evolution.

Film adaptation  Boogiepop and Others was adapted into a live-action film with the same name, which was released in Japan March 11, 2000. The film was directed by Ryu Kaneda, and starred Sayaka Yoshino as Miyashita/Boogiepop. MediaWorks, Hakuhodo and Toei Video were also involved in the production of the film. The director, Kaneda, said he did not wish to simply depict modern children as they were. \\"Here, the characters that appear on screen embrace all of their loneliness, and that's something that doesn't change in any era.\\" He continues, \\"I thought perhaps I should turn it into the message that, no matter what, we must express our 'sense of isolation from deep inside that won't let us smile.'\\"Ryu Kaneda (2000-03-11) Directors Commentary, Boogiepop and Others He encouraged the actors to adapt their characters, and allowed ad-libbing.Sayaka Yoshino (2000-03-11) Making of Boogiepop: Director Kaneda Ryu, Boogiepop and Others Asumi Miwa's role as Naoko Kamikishiro was considered the most demanding of all. Her scenes were shot in quick succession, so she finished before the rest of the cast.Kai Hirohashi (2000-03-11) Making of Boogiepop, Boogiepop and Others Miwa considered the scene where she meets Echoes for the first time to be the most demanding of all.Asumi Miwa (2000-03-11) Making of Boogiepop: Story #2 Naoko & Akio, Boogiepop and Others Sayaka Yoshino gave up her summer break to appear in the film, and had to perform in Boogiepop's \\"sauna suit\\" in days reaching 35 ¬∞C (95 ¬∞F). With the actors performing entire days in full sun, cool packs had to be brought in to keep them going. Maya Kurosu spend two months in training for her role as Kirima Nagi, so that she could perform in the action scenes. The climax, filmed from September 15, 1999 (the 25th day of filming), was the greatest challenge. 50 shots had to be taken in 2 days, all at night. A Typhoon reached the Kant≈ç Metropolitan area on that day, but against the forecasts it cleared up before they were due to begin filming. At 6pm, they were ready to begin. = Notable differences = Although the manga and light novel are near identical in plot and character, the live-action movie differs in some areas of character development and interaction. Suema develops an infatuation for Kirima after their first encounter in the movie, but this aspect of their relationship is absent in the original novel. Saotome notes that over time Manticore had become like the original Yurihara Minako, and so wondered who had really been consumed. The light novel and manga portray Manticore's personality as being dominant with no trace of the original Yurihara Minako remaining besides her adopted physical form. The movie also shows how Miyashita and Takeda began dating when Miyashita gave Takeda a watch for his birthday, an element to their relationship which was not covered in the light novel or manga. = Music = The soundtrack for Boogiepop and Others, titled Music Album Inspired by Boogiepop and Others, was composed and arranged by Yuki Kajiura and featured a wide range of musical styles including jazz, pop, and piano. Each of the original songs composed represented a theme from the movie, such as the song \\"Forget-me-not\\" thematically representing Naoko Kamikishiro and Kimura Akio. A Boogiepop version of the classical overture to Wagner's \\"Die Meistersinger von N√ºrnberg\\" was included on the album as an additional bonus track, arranged by Yoshihisa Hirano and conducted by Orie Suzuki. The soundtrack was originally released in Japan by Media Factory on 25 March 2000. It was published in North America by AnimeTrax and released by Right Stuf International as a single disc CD on 30 April 2002. Anime adaptation Marking the 20th Anniversary of Kouhei Kadono's original novel debut, an anime television series adaptation was announced at the Dengeki Bunko 25th Anniversary & New Work Unveiling Stage. The series was directed by Shingo Natsume and written by Tomohiro Suzuki, with animation by Madhouse. Hidehiko Sawada provided the character designs, while Kensuke Ushio composed the series' music. The series aired from January 4 to March 29, 2019, and was broadcast on AT-X and other channels. The series ran for 18 episodes. Myth & Roid performed the series' opening theme song \\"shadowgraph,\\" while Riko Azuna performed the series' ending song \\"Whiteout.\\" Crunchyroll streams the series. Named Boogiepop and Others, the series adapts not only the titular novel, but also Boogiepop Returns: VS Imaginator, Boogiepop at Dawn, and Boogiepop Overdrive: The King of Distortion. The anime adaptation of Boogiepop and Others received mostly positive reviews from Western journalists. Rose Bridges of Anime News Network reviewed the first four episodes, giving them an A- and writing, \\"If Boogiepop and Others can keep this up, it might be a truly stellar adaptation. I just hope it doesn't blaze so fast through these novels for us to keep up.\\" Natasha H. of IGN wrote that while Boogiepop and Others doesn't have the \\"surreal and Lynchian horror\\" of Boogiepop Phantom, Boogiepop and Others \\"still holds its ground as a spooky and unnerving look into the emptiness of the human soul in contrast to society. Instead of going for a bleak first-person perspective, Boogiepop and Others presents alienation in from a third-person point of view. The result is an ongoing, chaotic, and jumbled narrative that leaves more questions than answers, until the very answer arrives, where things slowly are explained.\\" Brittany Vincent of Syfy wrote that \\"if you're in the mood to kick off a lengthy journey through a sometimes obtuse but wholly satisfying narrative that explores the supernatural, split personalities, and plenty of allegory, give Boogiepop and Others a chance. Don't expect it all to make perfect sense right away, but let it wash over you. You'll be glad that you did.\\" Thrillist included the series on their list of the \\"Best Anime of 2019,\\" writing that the series \\"could be best described as a slow-burn supernatural mystery thriller dotted with adrenaline-spiking sequences of horror, action, and suspense set against a backdrop of stunning metropolitan vistas.\\"  Themes  Issues relating to growing up and change are central to the Boogiepop series.DVD commentary featuring Jeff Thompson, Crispin Freeman, and Rachael Lillis (2001) Boogiepop Phantom Evolution 2 The narrative style demonstrates how different people observe different truths.DVD commentary featuring Jeff Thompson and Joe DiGiorgi (August 2001) Boogiepop Phantom Evolution 1  Allusions/references  = Allusions/references to other works = Kadono regularly references Western music ‚Äì especially rock ‚Äì in the Boogiepop series. This is mostly in the chapter titles, but also in the names of characters. In this novel, two of the character's names are musical references: \\"Echoes\\" is the name of the 23 minute closing track to the Pink Floyd album Meddle and the Manticore is a reference to the album Tarkus, as made evident in the third novel when Spooky E mentions that Tarkus was searching for the Manticore. This novel included three direct music references, with Kamikishiro singing \\"Life Is Brief\\" from Akira Kurosawa's Ikiru, Saotome telling us that he is a big fan of The Doors, and Boogiepop mentioning Atom Heart Mother to Takeda. The five chapters are also references to music: Romantic Warrior was the best-selling album by Return to Forever, \\"The Return of the Fire Witch\\" was a single from the King Crimson album Epitaph, \\"No One Lives Forever\\" was a single released by Oingo Boingo ‚Äì Saotome begins singing this at the end of the chapter ‚Äì and \\"Heartbreaker\\" most likely refers to a Grand Funk Railroad song from their album On Time, seeing as Kadono states it to be the 'BGM' of his Afterword. In the second narrative, the students discuss The Village of Eight Graves; the first novel of the Kousuke Kindaichi series, which was later remade as a movie. Another literary reference comes from Boogiepop's hat being likened to Maetel's from Matsumoto Leiji's Galaxy Express 999. = Allusions/references from other works = The anime series Boogiepop Phantom uses many characters from Boogiepop and Others, and makes repeated references to the ending of the novel. In Boogiepop Returns: VS Imaginator Part 1, Boogiepop compares an opponent with Manticore. = Allusions/references to actual history, geography and current science = The novel touches on the theme on cloning, with Manticore being a clone of Echoes. The novel touches on psychology, with Takeda being convinced that Boogiepop is a split personality rather than a supernatural being, meanwhile, Boogiepop reaffirms itself as a manifestation of the collective unconscious from Carl Jung, which is the reason why it only chases those who choose a path that diverge with it and ultimately becomes an enemy of the world, one that could disrupt the natural flow of human cognition. Then there is Suema, with her interest in psychology, who adds elements to the chapter she narrates. In the second narrative, some students ask Suema about The Village of Eight Graves and she mentions its connection to the Tsuyama massacre. She also discusses the use of hydrocyanic acid gas as a chemical weapon. When they first meet, Kamikishiro and Kimura go to a MOS Burger.  Critical reception  The Boogiepop and Others novel won the fourth Dengeki Game Novel Contest in 1997. The novels English release has received favourable reviews, though these have mostly focused on the translation, which has been cited as \\"a standard against which future Japanese novel translations are judged\\". It has also received praise for ripping \\"the rules of narrative wide open\\", especially for how it allows the characters to grow on the reader. The English release of the live-action film has met mixed reception. Whilst the characters and plot were well received, the special effects and costumes have been described as \\"campy\\", but \\"par for the course of something of this level and budget\\". It has been primarily recommended to fans of Boogiepop Phantom, so as to gain \\"a complete understanding of the Boogiepop events\\".

Through bioconversion of biomass to a mixed alcohol fuel, more energy from the biomass will end up as liquid fuels than in converting biomass to ethanol by yeast fermentation. The process involves a biological/chemical method for converting any biodegradable material (e.g., urban wastes, such as municipal solid waste, biodegradable waste, and sewage sludge, agricultural residues such as corn stover, sugarcane bagasse, cotton gin trash, manure) into useful chemicals, such as carboxylic acids (e.g., acetic, propionic, butyric acid), ketones (e.g., acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, diethyl ketone) and biofuels, such as a mixture of primary alcohols (e.g., ethanol, propanol, n-butanol) and/or a mixture of secondary alcohols (e.g., isopropanol, 2-butanol, 3-pentanol). Because of the many products that can be economically produced, this process is a true biorefinery.Advanced Biomass Refinery ‚Äì Third-Generation 2007 (video) EPA Presentation on the processApplication College Station, Texas) The process uses a mixed culture of naturally occurring microorganisms found in natural habitats such as the rumen of cattle, termite guts, and marine and terrestrial swamps to anaerobically digest biomass into a mixture of carboxylic acids produced during the acidogenic and acetogenic stages of anaerobic digestion, however with the inhibition of the methanogenic final stage. The more popular methods for production of ethanol and cellulosic ethanol use enzymes that must be isolated first to be added to the biomass and thus convert the starch or cellulose into simple sugars, followed then by yeast fermentation into ethanol. This process does not need the addition of such enzymes as these microorganisms make their own. As the microorganisms anaerobically digest the biomass and convert it into a mixture of carboxylic acids, the pH must be controlled. This is done by the addition of a buffering agent (e.g., ammonium bicarbonate, calcium carbonate), thus yielding a mixture of carboxylate salts. Methanogenesis, being the natural final stage of anaerobic digestion, is inhibited by the presence of the ammonium ions or by the addition of an inhibitor (e.g., iodoform). The resulting fermentation broth contains the produced carboxylate salts that must be dewatered. This is achieved efficiently by vapor-compression evaporation. Further chemical refining of the dewatered fermentation broth may then take place depending on the final chemical or biofuel product desired. The condensed distilled water from the vapor-compression evaporation system is recycled back to the fermentation. On the other hand, if raw sewage or other waste water with high BOD in need of treatment is used as the water for the fermentation, the condensed distilled water from the evaporation can be recycled back to the city or to the original source of the high-BOD waste water. Thus, this process can also serve as a water treatment facility, while producing valuable chemicals or biofuels. Because the system uses a mixed culture of microorganisms, besides not needing any enzyme addition, the fermentation requires no sterility or aseptic conditions, making this front step in the process more economical than in more popular methods for the production of cellulosic ethanol. These savings in the front end of the process, where volumes are large, allows flexibility for further chemical transformations after dewatering, where volumes are small. Carboxylic acids Carboxylic acids can be regenerated from the carboxylate salts using a process known as \\"acid springing\\". This process makes use of a high-molecular-weight tertiary amine (e.g., trioctylamine), which is switched with the cation (e.g., ammonium or calcium). The resulting amine carboxylate can then be thermally decomposed into the amine itself, which is recycled, and the corresponding carboxylic acid. In this way, theoretically, no chemicals are consumed or wastes produced during this step.Williamson, S.A. 2000. Conversion of carboxylate salts to carboxylic acids via reactive distillation. M.S. Thesis Ketones There are two methods for making ketones. The first one consists on thermally converting calcium carboxylate salts into the corresponding ketones. This was a common method for making acetone from calcium acetate during World War I.Yeh, H. 2002. Pyrolytic decomposition of carboxylate salts. M.S. thesis The other method for making ketones consists on converting the vaporized carboxylic acids on a catalytic bed of zirconium oxide.Ingram, D. 2002. Ketonization of acetic acid. B.S. student report. Alcohols =Primary alcohols= The undigested residue from the fermentation may be used in gasification to make hydrogen (H2). This H2 can then be used to hydrogenolyze the esters over a catalyst (e.g., copper chromite),Bradley, M.W., Harris, N., Turner, K. 1982. Process for Hydrogenolysis of Carboxylic Acid Esters WO 82/03854, Nov. 2011 which are produced by esterifying either the ammonium carboxylate salts (e.g., ammonium acetate, propionate, butyrate) or the carboxylic acids (e.g., acetic, propionic, butyric acid) with a high-molecular-weight alcohol (e.g., hexanol, heptanol).Preparation of esters by reaction of ammonium salts with alcohols. From the hydrogenolysis, the final products are the high-molecular-weight alcohol, which is recycled back to the esterification, and the corresponding primary alcohols (e.g., ethanol, propanol, butanol). =Secondary alcohols= The secondary alcohols (e.g., isopropanol, 2-butanol, 3-pentanol) are obtained by hydrogenating over a catalyst (e.g., Raney nickel) the corresponding ketones (e.g., acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, diethyl ketone).Aldrett-Lee, S. 2000. Catalytic hydrogenation of liquid ketones with emphasis on gas‚Äìliquid mass transfer. PhD dissertation Drop-in biofuels The primary or secondary alcohols obtained as described above may undergo conversion to drop-in biofuels, fuels which are compatible with current fossil fuel infrastructure such as biogasoline, green diesel and bio-jet fuel. Such is done by subjecting the alcohols to dehydration followed by oligomerization using zeolite catalysts in a manner similar to the methanex process, which used to produce gasoline from methanol in New Zealand. Acetic acid versus ethanol Cellulosic-ethanol manufacturing plants are bound to be net exporters of electricity because a large portion of the lignocellulosic biomass, namely lignin, remains undigested and it must be burned, thus producing electricity for the plant and excess electricity for the grid. As the market grows and this technology becomes more widespread, coupling the liquid fuel and the electricity markets will become more and more difficult. Acetic acid, unlike ethanol, is biologically produced from simple sugars without the production of carbon dioxide: C6H12O6 ‚Üí 2 CH3CH2OH \\\\+ 2 CO2 (Biological production of ethanol) C6H12O6 ‚Üí 3 CH3COOH (Biological production of acetic acid) Because of this, on a mass basis, the yields will be higher than in ethanol fermentation. If then, the undigested residue (mostly lignin) is used to produce hydrogen by gasification, it is ensured that more energy from the biomass will end up as liquid fuels rather than excess heat/electricity.Eggeman, T., Verser, D., and Weber, E. (2005), An Indirect Route for Ethanol Production US Department of Energy 3 CH3COOH \\\\+ 6 H2 ‚Üí 3 CH3CH2OH \\\\+ 3 H2O (Hydrogenation of acetic acid) C6H12O6 (from cellulose) \\\\+ 6 H2 (from lignin) ‚Üí 3 CH3CH2OH \\\\+ 3 H2O (Overall reaction) A more comprehensive description of the economics of each of the fuels is given on the pages alcohol fuel and ethanol fuel, more information about the economics of various systems can be found on the central page biofuel. Stage of development The system has been in development since 1991, moving from the laboratory scale (10 g/day) to the pilot scale (200 lb/day) in 2001. A small demonstration-scale plant (5 ton/day) has been constructed and is under operation and a 220 ton/day demonstration plant is expected in 2012.

A group of tourists walks along the fortress walls (2006). Samnyeon Sanseong Fortress (literally \\"Three-Years' Mountain Fortress\\") is the ruins of a Silla fortress and wall that was built beginning in the year 470. The fortress was reconstructed in 486. The ruins are located in present-day Boeun, South Korea. During the Three Kingdoms Period the town of Boeun-eup, located two kilometers from the fortress, was known as Samnyeon-gun or Samnyeonsan-gun and it is believed by some that the fortress gets its name from the town. However, the Samguk Sagi relates that the fortress was completed in three years (Korean, sam nyeon), and that the fortress derived its name from this fact. This account also suggests that the nearby town derived its name from the fortress, rather than vice versa. The Annals of Joseon Dynasty show that the fortress was known as Ojeong Sanseong Fortress and was used during the Joseon Dynasty, probably because the fortress is located atop Mount Ojeongsan. The fortress has been registered by the South Korean government on the tentative list of sites awaiting approval as a UNESCO World Heritage site. Although parts of the old wall have survived to this day, it is undergoing a major reconstruction by the Korean government. It is also listed as Korean Historic Site No.235. The walls of Samnyeon Sanseong Fortress measured over 1,680 meters or 1,880 meters in length, depending on the reference source. They were built by alternating rows of slim and flat stones placed in horizontal and vertical layers. This method of construction resulted in a very strong wall structure. The walls of the fortress, built on vertical cliffs, combine to create an impenetrable wall which ranged from thirteen to twenty meters in height. The width of the walls ranged from five to eight meters. The walls of stone also incorporated ramparts of mounded earth. Other notable features of the ruins include four gates, seven Ongseong (curved guard bastions), two sluice gates and five wells. The four gates, located approximately equidistantly measure at about 4.5 meters in length. The Ongseong, or guard posts, were placed in areas most vulnerable to attack and were 25 meters in circumference and 8.3 meters in height. A large pond was once inside the fortress and was used as an important water source although only the outline of the pond remains today. The fortress is valuable because it shows what building techniques were employed by the Silla during the late fifth century. Additionally, Samnyeon Sanseong Fortress exhibits the characteristics typical of a Korean mountain fortress. There are two general classifications of Korean-style mountain fortress. The Pokok style is a fortress which surrounds the valley while the Teimeui style is a fortress where the walls are built around the peaks of the mountain, sometimes described like a folding screen across the mountain. This fortress follows the Teimeui tradition. The fortress occupied and protected a strategic location and is credited with helping Silla to achieve the unification of Korea. During the late seventh century, Silla used the fortress as a base to attack Baekje to the west while also preparing for advances against Goguryeo to the north. The fortress was pivotal in securing the Han River Valley, the central part of the Korean peninsula. The reputation of the fortress is such that it is said that Wanggeon, the first king of Goryeo, failed in his attempt to take the fortress 918. Excavations in 1983 of artifacts from the Three Kingdoms period up to the Joseon Dynasty give clues as to when the fortress was occupied and used. Thousands of tombs also surround the fortress. Another notable feature of the fortress is the presence of engraved calligraphy on a boulder at its entrance, writing that has been attributed to Kim Saeng.

In the picture above, the wind blowing North in the northern hemisphere creates a surface stress and a resulting Ekman spiral is found below it in the water column. Ekman transport is part of Ekman motion theory, first investigated in 1902 by Vagn Walfrid Ekman. Winds are the main source of energy for ocean circulation, and Ekman Transport is a component of wind-driven ocean current. Ekman transport occurs when ocean surface waters are influenced by the friction force acting on them via the wind. As the wind blows it casts a friction force on the ocean surface that drags the upper 10-100m of the water column with it. However, due to the influence of the Coriolis effect, the ocean water moves at a 90¬∞ angle from the direction of the surface wind. The direction of transport is dependent on the hemisphere: in the northern hemisphere, transport occurs at 90¬∞ clockwise from wind direction, while in the southern hemisphere it occurs at a 90¬∞ counterclockwise.Colling, pp 42-44 This phenomenon was first noted by Fridtjof Nansen, who recorded that ice transport appeared to occur at an angle to the wind direction during his Arctic expedition during the 1890s.Pond & Pickard, p 101 Ekman transport has significant impacts on the biogeochemical properties of the world's oceans. This is because they lead to upwelling (Ekman suction) and downwelling (Ekman pumping) in order to obey mass conservation laws. Mass conservation, in reference to Ekman transfer, requires that any water displaced within an area must be replenished. This can be done by either Ekman suction or Ekman pumping depending on wind patterns. Theory Ekman theory explains the theoretical state of circulation if water currents were driven only by the transfer of momentum from the wind. In the physical world, this is difficult to observe because of the influences of many simultaneous current driving forces (for example, pressure and density gradients). Though the following theory technically applies to the idealized situation involving only wind forces, Ekman motion describes the wind-driven portion of circulation seen in the surface layer.Colling p 44Sverdrup p 228 Surface currents flow at a 45¬∞ angle to the wind due to a balance between the Coriolis force and the drags generated by the wind and the water.Mann & Lazier p 169 If the ocean is divided vertically into thin layers, the magnitude of the velocity (the speed) decreases from a maximum at the surface until it dissipates. The direction also shifts slightly across each subsequent layer (right in the northern hemisphere and left in the southern hemisphere). This is called the Ekman spiral.Knauss p 124. The layer of water from the surface to the point of dissipation of this spiral is known as the Ekman layer. If all flow over the Ekman layer is integrated, the net transportation is at 90¬∞ to the right (left) of the surface wind in the northern (southern) hemisphere. Mechanisms There are three major wind patterns that lead to Ekman suction or pumping. The first are wind patterns that are parallel to the coastline. Due to the Coriolis effect, surface water moves at a 90¬∞ angle to the wind current. If the wind moves in a direction causing the water to be pulled away from the coast then Ekman suction will occur. On the other hand, if the wind is moving in such a way that surface waters move towards the shoreline then Ekman pumping will take place. The second mechanism of wind currents resulting in Ekman transfer is the trade winds both north and south of the equator pulling surface waters towards the poles. There is a great deal of Ekman suction at the equator because water is being pulled northward north of the equator and southward south of the equator. This leads to a divergence in the water, resulting in Ekman suction, and therefore, upwelling. The third wind pattern influencing Ekman transfer is large-scale wind patterns in the open ocean. Open ocean wind circulation can lead to gyre-like structures of piled up sea surface water resulting in horizontal gradients of sea surface height. This pile up of water causes the water to have a downward flow and suction, due to gravity and the concept of mass balance. Ekman pumping in the central ocean is a consequence of this convergence of water. Ekman suction Ekman Suction is the component of Ekman transport that results in areas of upwelling due to the divergence of water. Returning to the concept of mass conservation, any water displaced by Ekman transport must be replenished. As the water diverges it creates space and acts as a suction in order to fill in the space by pulling up, or upwelling, deep sea water to the euphotic zone. Ekman suction has major consequences for the biogeochemical processes in the area because it leads to upwelling. Upwelling carries nutrient rich, and cold deep- sea water to the euphotic zone, promoting phytoplankton blooms and kickstarting an extremely high-productive environment. Areas of upwelling leads to the promotion of fisheries, in fact nearly half of the world's fish catch comes from areas of upwelling. Ekman suction occurs both along coastlines and in the open ocean, but also occurs along the equator. Along the Pacific coastline of California, Central America, and Peru, as well as along the Atlantic coastline of Africa there are areas of upwelling due to Ekman suction, as the currents move equatorwards. Due to the Coriolis effect the surface water moves 90¬∞ to the left (in the South Hemisphere, as it travels toward the equator) of the wind current, therefore causing the water to diverge from the coast boundary, leading to Ekman suction. Additionally, there are areas of upwelling as a consequence of Ekman suction where the Polar Easterlies winds meet the Westerlies in the subpolar regions north of the subtropics, as well as were the Northeast Trade Winds meet the Southeast Trade Winds along the Equator. Similarly, due to the Coriolis effect the surface water moves 90¬∞ to the left (in the South Hemisphere) of the wind currents, and the surface water diverges along these boundaries, resulting in upwelling in order to conserve mass. Ekman pumping Ekman Pumping is the component of Ekman transport that results in areas of downwelling due to the convergence of water. As discussed above, the concept of mass conservation requires that a pile up of surface water must be pushed downward. This pile up of warm, nutrient-poor surface water gets pumped vertically down the water column, resulting in areas of downwelling. Ekman pumping has dramatic impacts on the surrounding environments. Downwelling, due to Ekman pumping, leads to nutrient poor waters, therefore reducing the biological productivity of the area. Additionally, it transports heat and dissolved oxygen vertically down the water column as warm oxygen rich surface water is being pumped towards the deep ocean water. Ekman pumping can be found along the coasts as well as in the open ocean. Along the Pacific Coast in the Southern Hemisphere northerly winds move parallel to the coastline. Due to the Coriolis effect the surface water gets pulled 90¬∞ to the right of the wind current, therefore causing the water to converge along the coast boundary, leading to Ekman pumping. In the open ocean Ekman pumping occurs with gyres. Specifically, in the subtropics, between 20¬∞N and 50¬∞N, there is Ekman pumping as the tradewinds shift to westerlies causing a pile up of surface water. Mathematical derivation Some assumptions of the fluid dynamics involved in the process must be made in order to simplify the process to a point where it is solvable. The assumptions made by Ekman were:Pond & Pickard p. 106 * no boundaries; * infinitely deep water; * eddy viscosity, A_z\\\\,\\\\\\\\!, is constant (this is only true for laminar flow. In the turbulent atmospheric and oceanic boundary layer it is a strong function of depth); * the wind forcing is steady and has been blowing for a long time; * barotropic conditions with no geostrophic flow; * the Coriolis parameter, f\\\\,\\\\\\\\! is kept constant. The simplified equations for the Coriolis force in the x and y directions follow from these assumptions: : \\\\frac{1}{\\\\rho}\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\tau_x}{\\\\partial z} = -fv,\\\\, : \\\\frac{1}{\\\\rho}\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\tau_y}{\\\\partial z} = fu,\\\\, where \\\\tau\\\\,\\\\\\\\! is the wind stress, \\\\rho\\\\,\\\\\\\\! is the density, u\\\\,\\\\\\\\! is the east‚Äìwest velocity, and v\\\\,\\\\\\\\! is the north‚Äìsouth velocity. Integrating each equation over the entire Ekman layer: :\\\\tau_x=-M_yf,\\\\, :\\\\tau_y=M_xf,\\\\, where :M_x=\\\\int^z_0 \\\\rho u dz,\\\\, :M_y=\\\\int^z_0 \\\\rho v dz.\\\\, Here M_x\\\\,\\\\\\\\! and M_y\\\\,\\\\\\\\! represent the zonal and meridional mass transport terms with units of mass per unit time per unit length. Contrarily to common logic, north‚Äìsouth winds cause mass transport in the east‚Äìwest direction.Knauss p. 123 In order to understand the vertical velocity structure of the water column, equations and can be rewritten in terms of the vertical eddy viscosity term. :\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\tau_x}{\\\\partial z} = \\\\rho A_z \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial z^2},\\\\,\\\\\\\\! :\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\tau_y}{\\\\partial z} = \\\\rho A_z \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 v}{\\\\partial z^2},\\\\,\\\\\\\\! where A_z\\\\,\\\\\\\\! is the vertical eddy viscosity coefficient. This gives a set of differential equations of the form : A_z \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial z^2}=-fv,\\\\,\\\\\\\\! : A_z \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 v}{\\\\partial z^2}=fu.\\\\,\\\\\\\\! In order to solve this system of two differential equations, two boundary conditions can be applied: * {(u,v) \\\\to 0} as {z \\\\to -\\\\infin}, * friction is equal to wind stress at the free surface ( z=0 \\\\,\\\\\\\\!). Things can be further simplified by considering wind blowing in the y-direction only. This means is the results will be relative to a north‚Äìsouth wind (although these solutions could be produced relative to wind in any other direction):Pond & Pickard p.108 : \\\\begin{align} u_E&=\\\\pm V_0 \\\\cos\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{4} + \\\\frac{\\\\pi}{D_E}z\\\\right)\\\\exp\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{D_E}z\\\\right),\\\\\\\\\\\\ v_E&= V_0 \\\\sin\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{4} + \\\\frac{\\\\pi}{D_E}z\\\\right)\\\\exp\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{D_E}z\\\\right),\\\\end{align} where * u_E\\\\,\\\\\\\\! and v_E\\\\,\\\\\\\\! represent Ekman transport in the u and v direction; * in equation the plus sign applies to the northern hemisphere and the minus sign to the southern hemisphere; * V_0= \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{2}\\\\pi\\\\tau_{y\\\\eta}}{D_E\\\\rhof};\\\\,\\\\\\\\! * \\\\tau_{y\\\\eta}\\\\,\\\\\\\\! is the wind stress on the sea surface; * D_E = \\\\pi\\\\left(\\\\frac{2A_z}{f}\\\\right)^{1/2}\\\\,\\\\\\\\! is the Ekman depth (depth of Ekman layer). By solving this at z=0, the surface current is found to be (as expected) 45 degrees to the right (left) of the wind in the Northern (Southern) Hemisphere. This also gives the expected shape of the Ekman spiral, both in magnitude and direction. Integrating these equations over the Ekman layer shows that the net Ekman transport term is 90 degrees to the right (left) of the wind in the Northern (Southern) Hemisphere. Applications * Ekman transport leads to coastal upwelling, which provides the nutrient supply for some of the largest fishing markets on the planetKnauss p 125 and can impact the stability of the Antarctic Ice Sheet by pulling warm deep water onto the continental shelf. Wind in these regimes blows parallel to the coast (such as along the coast of Peru, where the wind blows out of the southeast, and also in California, where it blows out of the northwest). From Ekman transport, surface water has a net movement of 90¬∞ to right of wind direction in the northern hemisphere (left in the southern hemisphere). Because the surface water flows away from the coast, the water must be replaced with water from below.Mann & Lazier p 172 In shallow coastal waters, the Ekman spiral is normally not fully formed and the wind events that cause upwelling episodes are typically rather short. This leads to many variations in the extent of upwelling, but the ideas are still generally applicable.Colling p 43 * Ekman transport is similarly at work in equatorial upwelling, where, in both hemispheres, a trade wind component towards the west causes a net transport of water towards the pole, and a trade wind component towards the east causes a net transport of water away from the pole. * On smaller scales, cyclonic winds induce Ekman transport which causes net divergence and upwelling, or Ekman suction, while anti-cyclonic winds cause net convergence and downwelling, or Ekman pumpingPond & Pickard p 295 * Ekman transport is also a factor in the circulation of the ocean gyres. Ekman transport causes water to flow toward the center of the gyre in all locations, creating a sloped sea-surface, and initiating geostrophic flow (Colling p 65). Harald Sverdrup applied Ekman transport while including pressure gradient forces to develop a theory for this (see Sverdrup balance).

Dutcher (born November 27, 1962) is an American attorney and former politician who served as the Minnesota State Auditor from 1995 ‚Äì 2003 as both a Republican and Democrat (DFL). She was the first woman to serve as Minnesota State Auditor. Life and career Judi Dutcher was born in Michigan in 1962. Her father, Jim Dutcher, was the head basketball coach of the University of Minnesota from the mid-1970s to mid-1980s. She received a B.A. in Political Science and in English Literature from the University of Minnesota in 1984, and her Law Degree from the Law School in 1987. After practicing as a prosecutor in the Twin Cities for several years, and serving as a referee in Hennepin County Conciliation Court, then-Governor Arne Carlson, approached her about running for state auditor as a member of the then Independent Republican Party in 1994 (the state Republican party was known as the Independent Republican Party from November 1975 to September 1995). Dutcher had previously not been a member of either party. However, she accepted, and ran in the Arne Carlson mold of a centrist Republican; liberal on social issues, and conservative on fiscal issues. She won the Republican Party nomination for Auditor, and in November 1994, became the first pregnant woman ever elected to statewide office in the United States. Dutcher gained recognition for her office's special investigations into malfeasance and was reelected in 1998, receiving more votes than any other candidate for constitutional office in Minnesota that year. In January 2000, she announced that she was switching to the DFL party, saying that she felt uncomfortable as a pro-choice on abortion, pro-gay rights woman in the Republican Party. She was given a speaking slot at the 2000 Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles, and supported Vice President Al Gore and Senator Joe Lieberman. In 2001, Dutcher announced that she was creating an exploratory committee to run for Governor of Minnesota. She entered the race in early 2002, with State Senator Becky Lourey as her main opponent for the DFL endorsement. State Senate Majority Leader Roger Moe entered the race a few months later, setting up a three-way-fight for the DFL endorsement. At the convention, Lourey dropped out after the second round of balloting and endorsed Dutcher. However, Dutcher did not have the support of 60% of the delegates needed for the endorsement, and Roger Moe had the momentum after several more rounds of balloting. Dutcher withdrew her bid for governor, and endorsed Moe. Dutcher decided not to seek reelection to the auditors office, and rejected calls from the Independence Party of Minnesota to run under their banner. Dutcher's term as auditor expired in January 2003. Roger Moe lost the governor's race to Tim Pawlenty in November 2002. Currently, Dutcher is the CEO of the Bentson Foundation. It is a Tax-Exempt Charitable Corporation started in 1956 by Larry and Nancy Bentson.  2006 campaign for Lieutenant Governor  Dutcher had disclaimed interest in running for office again, but had created speculation that Minnesota Attorney General Mike Hatch would choose her as his running mate for Lieutenant Governor after she strongly endorsed him and spoke on his behalf at the 2006 DFL state convention. Perhaps not surprisingly, Hatch named her as his running mate on June 25, 2006. In the final stage of the campaign, Dutcher made headlines for a political gaffe in which she responded to then KSAX-TV reporter Corey Poppe's question on E85 ethanol by saying \\"What's E85?\\" Hatch attributed part of his loss to that remark, noting that he lost heavily in southern Minnesota counties where E85 production facilities are located. However, Hatch later regretted the comment attributing the loss to the E85 comment, and he took responsibility for the loss. The Star Tribune and WCCO TV made separate analyses of the comment, and found that it had little impact on the race. However, the gaffe did lead to Hatch calling a reporter a \\"Republican whore\\" a few days later, which dominated the news cycle leading up to the election.

In English, WWW is the longest possible three-letter abbreviation when spoken, requiring six to nine syllables, depending on how it is pronounced, whereas the twelve letters in \\"World Wide Web\\" are pronounced with three syllables. The English writer Douglas Adams once quipped: Tim Berners-Lee rejected suggestions to change the World Wide Web name over pronunciation issues, arguing that this peculiar feature of the name would make it memorable. As his invention gradually gained ubiquity, it came to be called simply the Web. English pronunciation In standard English pronunciation, www is pronounced by individually pronouncing the names of the letters ( or double-u double-u double-u). However, in colloquial speech the name of the letter W is sometimes shortened. In some parts of the United States, the l is often dropped and the u reduced, for , whereas in the Southern United States W is reduced to two-syllables, . The form dub-dub-dub has long been used occasionally worldwide,\\"...the great dub- dub-dub debate...\\" but is the most common abbreviation used in New Zealand.\\"...you can quote your address as being dub-dub-dub YourBusinessName dot co dot nz...\\", 26/06/2013, Julie South, Waikato Times\\"...pronounced dub, dub, dub in this neck of the woods...\\", July 2, 2008, Myrddin Gwynedd, nzherald.co.nz\\"Dub Dub Dub arrives (in practice)\\", The Story of New Zeand's Internet, 1991 An abbreviation W3 ( \\"double-u cubed\\") is inspired from mathematical notation for exponentiation (W raised to the 3rd power). Many of the original papers describing the World Wide Web abbreviated it this way, and the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) was named according to this early usage. The original W3C logo had a superscript 3 and the consortium's domain name is still \`www.w3.org\`. Other languages In Afrikaans, Dutch, German, Polish and other languages, this problem doesn't occur because the letter W is already uttered as a single syllable. In some languages, such as Danish, Estonian, Finnish, Norwegian, and Swedish it is common practice to say \\"ve\\"(v) instead of \\"dobbelt-ve\\" in abbreviations, so \\"www\\" becomes \\"ve, ve, ve\\". This is also used by Romanian, Serbian, etc. In Danish, it is also usual to say \\"tre gange dobbelt-ve\\" (\\"three times double u\\"). In many languages which give the letter W a name that translates to \\"double V\\", each w is substituted by a v, so www is shortened to \\"vvv\\" instead. Another practice is to use a numeric shortcut that translates w-w-w as triple W. * In Standard Mandarin of China, is called \\"sƒÅn double u\\" which means three w (3w). * In Taiwanese Mandarin, is pronounced as \\"triple w\\" in English. * Japanese uses a transliteration of the English pronunciation ‚Äì ' („ÉÄ„Éñ„É´„ÉÄ„Éñ„É´„ÉÄ„Éñ„É´). * \\"v√©, v√©, v√©\\" in both Czech and Slovak (Literally means vvv.

Early life Maurice Charles O'Connell was born in Ireland in 1768. He had had a distinguished career in the army. New South Wales In 1809, he came with the newly appointed Governor of New South Wales Macquarie to Sydney in charge of the 73rd Regiment of Foot. There, in May 1810, O'Connell hastily married widow Mary Putland, the daughter of the deposed former governor William Bligh, shortly before Bligh's return to England. O'Connell also had a commission as Lieutenant-Governor, and so acted when Macquarie was absent in Tasmania in the latter part of 1812. O'Connell was then on good terms with Macquarie, who, in November of that year, strongly recommended that his salary should be considerably increased. Although William Bligh had departed, his daughter, now Mary O'Connell, had not forgiven those who had deposed her father, creating tensions between her husband and others in the colony. O'Connell became involved in the quarrel and in August 1813 Macquarie in a dispatch to Lord Bathurst stated that, \\"though lieutenant-colonel O'Connell is naturally a very well disposed man . . . it would greatly improve the harmony of the country . . . if the whole of the officers and men of the 73 regiment were removed from it\\". On 26 March 1814 O'Connell and his regiment were transferred to Ceylon. He attained the rank of major-general in 1830 and was knighted in 1835.  Return to New South Wales In 1838, Maurice O'Connell returned to Sydney in command of the forces and was appointed a member of the New South Wales Legislative Council. He was senior member of the executive council when, the question of the rights of Bligh's daughters to certain land granted to Bligh in 1806 having been again raised, Governor Gipps found himself in an extremely delicate position. The matter was settled by compromise in 1841. O'Connell was acting-governor of New South Wales from 12 July to 2 August 1846. Later life Maurice O'Connell died in Sydney on 25 May 1848, and received a full military funeral at St James' Church.

It was discovered on 15 August 1923, by Russian astronomer Vladimir Albitsky at the Simeiz Observatory on the Crimean peninsula. The assumed C-type asteroid has a rotation period of 10.2 hours and measures approximately in diameter. It was named after German astronomer Heinrich Olbers (1758‚Äì1840).  Orbit and classification  Olbersia is a non- family asteroid from the main belt's background population. It orbits the Sun in the central asteroid belt at a distance of 2.4‚Äì3.2 AU once every 4 years and 8 months (1,699 days; semi-major axis of 2.79 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.15 and an inclination of 11¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. The asteroid's observation arc begins at Uccle Observatory in 1935, twelve years after its official discovery observation at Simeiz.  Naming  ;Honoring Olbers This minor planet was named after Heinrich Olbers (1758‚Äì1840), a physician and amateur astronomer from Bremen in northern Germany. He discovered the main-belt asteroids 2 Pallas and 4 Vesta as well as six comets, and was the first to compute the orbit of comets with a certain degree of accuracy. Olbers' paradox is named after him, as is the lunar crater Olbers. The official naming citation was published by Paul Herget in The Names of the Minor Planets in 1955 (). ;The road to 1000 1001 Gaussia was named as part of trio honoring the events surrounding the discovery of Ceres in 1801. Carl Friedrich Gauss who computed the orbit of Ceres had 1001 Gaussia named for him, 1000 Piazzia for Giuseppe Piazzi (who had discovered Ceres) and finally 1002 Olbersia for Olbers. Olbers recovered Ceres after it has passed behind the Sun and returned. In the next few years only three more astronomical bodies were found between Mars and Jupiter, Pallas, Juno, and 4 Vesta, and it would be 37 years before another asteroid was found, 5 Astraea in 1845. Olbers discovered Pallas and Vesta also. No asteroids were found in 1846, planet Neptune was, but after that more asteroids were found every year including over 300 by the 1890s, when the advent of astronomical photography further increased the rate of discovery in coming decades. In the years between 1845 and 1891, 6.9 minor planets were discovered each year, but the rate went to 24.8 from 1891 to 1931. In that time an additional 1191 asteroids were discovered, and the number of numbered minor planets reached well over 1000. The 1000th asteroid was approved in 1921, and the ten thousandth in 1989.  Physical characteristics  Olbersia is an assumed C-type asteroid. This is one of the common asteroid types, as of the late 1980s, 75% of known asteroids.Gradie et al. pp. 316‚Äì335 in Asteroids II. edited by Richard Binzel, Tom Gehrels, and Mildred Shapley Matthews, Eds. University of Arizona Press, Tucson, 1989, = Rotation period and poles = Lightcurve-based 3D-model of Olbersia In October 2007, a rotational lightcurve of Olbersia was obtained from photometric observations by French amateur astronomer Pierre Antonini. Lightcurve analysis gave a well-defined rotation period of hours with a brightness variation of 0.38 magnitude ().

The principle of sufficient reason is a powerful and controversial philosophical principle stipulating that everything must have a reason or cause. Schopenhauer revised and re-published it in 1847. The work articulated the centerpiece of many of Schopenhauer's arguments, and throughout his later works he consistently refers his readers to it as the necessary beginning point for a full understanding of his further writings. Background =Historical= In January 1813, after suffering their disastrous defeat in Russia, the first remnants of Napoleon's Grande Arm√©e were arriving in Berlin. The sick and wounded quickly filled up the hospitals and the risk of an epidemic grew high. A patriotic, militaristic spirit inflamed the city and most of the populace, philosophers and students included, entertained the hope that the French yoke could be violently thrown off. All this rapidly became intolerable to Schopenhauer who ultimately fled the city, retreating to the small town of Rudolstadt near Weimar. It was here, from June to November of that year, while staying at an inn, that the work was composed. After submitting it as his doctoral dissertation he was awarded a PhD from the University of Jena in absentia. Private publication soon followed. \\"There were three reviews of it, commending it condescendingly. Scarcely more than one hundred copies were sold, the rest was remaindered and, a few years later, pulped.\\"Safranski, pg. 156. Among the reasons for the cold reception of this original version are that it lacked the author's later authoritative style and appeared decidedly unclear in its implications. A copy was sent to Goethe who responded by inviting the author to his home on a regular basis, ostensibly to discuss philosophy but in reality to recruit the young philosopher into work on his Theory of Colors. In 1847 Schopenhauer rewrote and enlarged the work, publishing a new edition. This is the version of the work that is read today. \\"There the lines of thought are firmly pursued, linking up with his main work; there a challenge is issued to philosophical tradition, and there is no curb on attacks against the philosophical spirit of the age.\\"Safranski, pg. 157. =Philosophical= Schopenhauer‚Äôs epistemology, by direct admission, begins with Immanuel Kant's theory of knowledge. Schopenhauer proclaimed himself a Kantian who had appropriated his predecessor's most powerful accomplishment in epistemology, and who then claimed to have merely extended and completed what Kant botched or had left undone.German Realism: The Self-Limitation of Idealist Thinking in Fichte, Schelling and Schopenhauer [PDF] from seu.edu.cn G Z√∂ller ‚Äì The Cambridge Companion to German Idealism, 2000 In Schopenhauer‚Äôs point of view, Kant‚Äôs chief merit lies in his distinction between the thing in itself and the phenomenal world in which it appears, i.e., the world as we represent it to ourselves. What is crucial here is the realization that what makes human experience universally possible to begin with without exception, is the perceiving mind. The intellect synthesizes perceptions from raw sensations to consequently abstract modified concepts built upon formed perceptions. Schopenhauer appropriates Kant‚Äôs forms of sensibility (space, time, and causality) and expands them into what he calls the understanding: > To know causality is the sole function of the understanding, its only power, > and it is a great power embracing much, manifold in its application, and yet > unmistakable in its identity throughout all its manifestations. Conversely, > all causality, hence all matter, and consequently the whole of reality, is > only for the understanding, through the understanding, in the understanding. > The first, simplest, ever-present manifestation of understanding is > perception of the actual world. This is in every way knowledge of the cause > from the effect, and therefore all perception is intellectual.The World as > Will and Representation volume I 11 Thus, our understanding does not exist independent of our ability to perceive and determine relationships anchored in experience itself. Not only what we think in the abstract, but also our very perceptions are completely intellectual and subjectively determined via extraction, new formation, and modified formulation. Already we have the philosophical grounds for Nietzsche‚Äôs perspectivism, though given in different language: representation (Vorstellung). One may also translate \\"Vorstellung\\" as the English word \\"idea\\" ‚Äì indeed, Schopenhauer himself provides this translation from Kant's similar use of \\"Vorstellungen.\\" However, this \\"idea\\" is semantically distinct both from the Platonic Idea (which Schopenhauer insists be expressed with the German \\"Ideen\\") and from Berkeley's use of \\"idea.\\" The world as representation Schopenhauer‚Äôs central proposition is the main idea of his entire philosophy, he states simply as ‚ÄúThe world is my representation.‚Äù The rest of his work is an elaborate analysis and explanation of this sentence, which begins with his Kantian epistemology, but finds thorough elaboration within his version of the principle of sufficient reason. This is responsible for providing adequate explanations for any ‚Äòthing,‚Äô or object that occurs in relation to a subject of knowing; of any representation possible there is always a possible question of 'why?' that one can address to it. It amounts to what Schopenhauer has done, in his view, to extend and complete what Kant began in his Critique of Pure Reason. The four classes Four classes of explanation fall under the principle‚Äôs rubric. Hence, four classes of objects occur always and already only in relation to a known subject, according to a correlative capacity within the subject. These classes are summarized as follows: *Becoming: Only with the combination of time and space does perceptual actuality become possible for a subject, allowing for ideas of interpretation, and this provides the ground of becoming judgment. This is the law of causality, which is, when considered subjectively, intellectual and a priori-linked understanding. All possible judgments that are inferences of a cause from an effect‚Äîa physical state any subject infers as caused by another physical state or vice versa‚Äîpresumes this as primary ground for the expected potentials of such judgments. The natural sciences operate within this aspect of expanding principles. Schopenhauer proposed a proof of the a priori of causality (i.e. that the universe indeed operates, at least in general, as causal instead of just being perceived so a posteriori, due to the repeatability of sequences) that remains different from Kantian Theory. Proof relies on the intellectuality of perceived things (representations)--these are produced by \\"projecting causality backwards in time,\\" from physical excitations of cells and nerves (this is the afferent role of the intellect, or brain)--and is apparently influenced by the medieval philosopher Witelo and his work on optics and the psychology of seeing.See Schopenhauer's argument online *Knowing: This class of objects subsumes all judgments, or abstract concepts, which a subject knows through conceptual, discursive reason rooted in the ground of knowing. The other three classes of objects are immediate representations, while this class is always and already composed of fixed representations of representations. Therefore, the truth-value of concepts abstracted from any of the other three classes of objects is grounded in referring to something outside the concept. Concepts are abstract judgments grounded in intuitions of time and space, ideas of perception (causality apparent in the outer world), or acts of direct will (causality experienced from within). That conceptions are easier to deal with then representations; they are, in fact, to these almost as the formula of higher arithmetic to the mental operations which give rise to them and which they represent, or as logarithm to its number (please researching scientific creativity for more understanding, i.e Simonton's \\"chance configuration theory/ 1988\\", Simontons random permutations have a strong relations with him in this class). This class makes language (in the form of abstract judgments that are then communicable) possible, and as a consequence, all the sciences become possible. *Being: Time and space comprise separate grounds of being. These a priori (prior to experience) forms respectively allow for an ‚Äúinner,‚Äù temporal sense and an ‚Äúouter,‚Äù spatial sense for the subject; subjectively, these are the forms of pure sensibility‚Äîthey make sensations possible for a subject. The first makes arithmetic possible, and is presupposed for all other forms of the principle of sufficient reason; the other makes geometry possible. Time is one dimensional and purely successive; each moment determines the following moment; in space, any position is determined only in its relations to all other positions [fixed baselines] in a finite, hence, closed system. Thus, intuitions of time and space provide the grounds of being that make arithmetical and geometrical judgments possible, which are also valid for experience. *Willing: It is possible for a subject of knowing to know himself directly as ‚Äòwill.‚Äô A subject knows his acts of will (efferent actions) only after the fact, in time. Action then, finds its root in the law of motivation, the ground of acting, which is causality, but seen from the inside (afferent perception). In other words, not only does a subject know his body as an object of outer sense (efferently), in space, but also in an inner sense (afferently), in time alone; a subject has self-consciousness in addition to knowing his body as an idea of perception (afferent-efferent processes/a priori-a posteriori correlations). Why does a subject act the way he does? Where a sufficient motive appears in the form either of an intuition, perception, or extracted abstract conception, the subject will act (or react) according to his character, or ‚Äòwill.‚Äô E.g., despite all plans to the contrary. When the actual moment comes to act, we do so within the constituents of the rhetorical situation (the various representations presented within subjective experiences) and may be often surprised by what we actually say and do. The human sciences find their ground in this aspect of the principle. Conclusion Different rules govern the possible explanations for representations of the four classes and ‚Äúevery explanation given in accordance with this guiding line is merely relative. It [the principle of sufficient reason] explains things in reference to one another, but it always leaves unexplained something that it presupposes,‚Äù and the two things that are absolutely inexplicable are the principle itself and the ‚Äúthing in itself‚Äù,The World as Will and Representation volume I 81 which Schopenhauer connects with the will to live. The principle, in another point of view, provides the general form of any given perspective, presupposing both subject and object. The thing in itself, consequently, remains forever unknowable from any standpoint, for any qualities attributed to it are merely perceived, i.e., constructed in the mind from sensations given in time and space.Schopenhauer's Naturalization of Kant's a Priori Forms of Empirical Knowledge R Wicks ‚Äì History of Philosophy Quarterly, 1993 ‚Äì JSTOR Furthermore, because the concepts we form from our perceptions cannot in any way refer with any validity to anything beyond these limits to experience, all proofs for the existence of God or anything beyond the possibility of experience fall away under the razor of Kant‚Äôs critique. Kant termed this critical or transcendental idealism. Important to note here is that ‚ÄúTranscendental‚Äù does not refer to knowing the unknowable, but rather it refers to the a priori intellectual conditions for experience. This intuition of the a priori understanding is a modern elucidation of the postmodern expression \\"always already\\":The philosophy of Schopenhauer A. Schopenhauer ‚Äì 1928 ‚Äì The Modern library time and space always and already determine the possibilities of experience. Additionally, Schopenhauer distinguishes from this something he calls a \\"spurious a priori\\": cultural perspectives (ideologies) one is born into that determine one's relationship to experience, in addition to the forms of space and time.Parerga and Paralipomena II 15 He considers these false because it is possible to investigate and uncover their grounds, leading to a reorientation that regards the phenomena of experience as source material of new knowledge, rather than one's always already prejudices about phenomena. Payne's summary In his Translator's Introduction to Schopenhauer's The World as Will and Representation, E. F. J. Payne concisely summarized the Fourfold Root. > Our knowing consciousness...is divisible solely into subject and object. To > be object for the subject and to be our representation or mental picture are > one and the same. All our representations are objects for the subject, and > all objects of the subject are our representations. These stand to one > another in a regulated connection which in form is determinable a priori, > and by virtue of this connection nothing existing by itself and independent, > nothing single and detached, can become an object for us. ...The first > aspect of this principle is that of becoming, where it appears as the law of > causality and is applicable only to changes. Thus if the cause is given, the > effect must of necessity follow. The second aspect deals with concepts or > abstract representations, which are themselves drawn from representations of > intuitive perception, and here the principle of sufficient reason states > that, if certain premises are given, the conclusion must follow. The third > aspect of the principle is concerned with being in space and time, and shows > that the existence of one relation inevitably implies the other, thus that > the equality of the angles of a triangle necessarily implies the equality of > its sides and vice versa. Finally, the fourth aspect deals with actions, and > the principle appears as the law of motivation, which states that a definite > course of action inevitably ensues on a given character and motive.

Early life O'Connell was born at Sydney in 1812. His father was Sir Maurice Charles O'Connell, his mother was Mary (n√©e Bligh, formerly Putland) a daughter of Governor William Bligh. He was educated at the high school, Edinburgh; Dublin and Paris. Army career O'Connell entered the army as an ensign at 16 and joined the 73rd Regiment at Gibraltar. In 1835 he volunteered for foreign service as colonel with the British Legion in Spain, which he himself had raised in the county of Cork and other parts of Munster, to sustain the cause of the Spanish Queen and constitution against the insurgent Carlists. Later on he became Deputy Adjutant-General, and ultimately succeeded Sir De Lacy Evans as general of brigade in command of the British Auxiliary Legion in Spain. The Legion was disbanded on 8 December 1837, after taking heavy casualties during the battle of Andoain. Sir Maurice O'Connell was rewarded for his services by having the knighthood of several Spanish orders conferred upon him. On his return to England he was appointed to the 51st Regiment, and afterwards becoming captain in the 28th, was appointed military secretary on the staff of his father in New South Wales in 1835. When the 28th was recalled to England, Sir Maurice sold out, and engaged in pastoral pursuits. He afterwards resigned from the army and took up land. Monument at the grave of Maurice Charles O'Connell. thumb Political career O'Connell was elected a member of the New South Wales Legislative Council in August 1845 for the electoral district of Port Phillip. He was appointed commissioner of crown lands for the Burnett district in 1848, became government resident at Port Curtis (now Gladstone) in 1854, and held this position until 1860. He was nominated as one of the original members of the Queensland Legislative Council in 1860, was a minister without portfolio in the first ministry under Herbert, and introduced in July of that year a bill to provide for primary education in Queensland. Shortly afterwards he was elected president of the legislative council and retained this position until his death. In 1863, O'Connell was one of the founders and original trustees of the Queensland Turf Club, having arranged a land grant of 322 acres of land at Eagle Farm in Brisbane for the purpose of horse racing, now known as the Eagle Farm Racecourse. The other trustees were John Frederick McDougall and George Harris (all three were Members of the Queensland Legislative Council). In 1865 O'Connell, Augustus Charles Gregory and John Douglas applied for a special grant of land to erect a Masonic Hall in Brisbane. This was granted on 15 January 1865. Late life and Legacy O'Connell was knighted in 1871. He was commandant of the local military forces, and on four occasions was acting-governor of Queensland and showed tact and ability in this position. He was president of the Australasian Association, and of the Queensland Turf Club, and was a vice-president of the National Agricultural Association. O'Connell died of cancer in Brisbane on 23 March 1879 at Queensland Parliament House. He was buried in Toowong Cemetery.

History Thagaste was originally a small Numidian village, inhabited by a Berber tribe into which Augustine of Hippo was born in AD 354\\\\. His mother Saint Monica was a Christian and his father Patricius (with Roman roots) was at first a pagan who later adopted Christianity. The city was located in the north-eastern highlands of Numidia. It lay around from Hippo Regius, (modern Annaba), southwest of Thubursicum (Khamissa), and about from Carthage (on the coast of Tunisia). The olive tree that is believed to have been planted by Saint Augustine Thagaste was situated in a region full of dense forest. In antiquity, this area was renowned for its mounts, which were used as a natural citadel against different foreign invaders, including the Romans, the Byzantines, the Vandals, and the Umayyads. During the Roman period, trading increased in the city, that flourished mainly under the rule of Septimius Severus. Thagaste became a Roman municipium in the first century of Roman domination.A municipium was an existing city on which the citizenship had been conferred, while a colony was a new foundation or a community to which Roman settlers had been added. The city was mentioned by Pliny the Elder. As a municipium, Thagaste was settled by a few Roman Italian immigrants, but was mainly inhabited by romanized native Berbers.Nac√©ra Benseddik, Thagaste. Souk Ahras, ville natale de saint Augustin, p. 25 Indeed, Roman historian Plinius (V,4,4) wrote that Tagaste was an important Christian center in Roman Africa. It had a basilica and a Roman Catholic diocese, the latter of which was the most important in Byzantine Numidia. There are three bishops of Thagaste historically known: Saint Firminus, Saint Alipius (friend of Saint Augustine) and Saint Gennarus. There is the tradition that Saint Augustine used to meditate under an olive tree in a hill of Thagaste: this tree is still existing and is the place of reunion even now for the followers of the Augustinian spirituality. The Byzantines fortified the city with walls. It fell to the Umayyad Caliphate toward the end of the seventh century. After centuries of neglect, French colonists rebuilt the city, which is now called Souk Ahras. Other data Currently, philologists and researchers from the Canary Islands (Spain) have linked the Tagaste to Tegueste. The latter derives from *tegƒÉs…ôt, which means \\"humid\\" and is of Guanche origin, which had a Berber origin.

The route connects the town of Panaca to Modena, Utah. SR 319 has been part of the state highway system since at least 1932, and was part of the longer State Route 25 prior to the late 1970s. Route description View from the west end of SR 319 looking eastbound State Route 319 begins at a junction with U.S. Route 93 near Cathedral Gorge State Park. After a short distance, the highway passes through the town of Panaca on F Street. Exiting the town, the route continues eastward about before turning slightly southeast to climb the Panaca Summit. SR 319 turns eastward again as it heads towards the Utah state line. The highway continues northeast as Utah State Route 56 to Modena. History SR 319 was formerly the eastern section of State Route 25. A pathway connecting Panaca and Modena appears on state maps by 1927 as a county road. This route had been improved to a graded highway and designated State Route 25 by 1932. The entire route was paved by 1951. By 1933, State Route 25 was extended westward. It followed US 93/State Route 7 south through Caliente and west to Crystal Springs, where it headed northwest towards U.S. Route 6/State Route 4 ending near Tonopah. The western segment of route underwent numerous realignments over the next few several years, with the western terminus shifting eastward on US 6 to Warm Springs by the time the highway was paved in 1958. Once paved, both parts of State Route 25 remained unchanged until July 1, 1976. On that date, Nevada authorized the renumbering of all its state highways. During that process, the eastern section of SR 25 became the new State Route 319 while the western segment became State Route 375. The changes were first noted on the 1978 edition of the official state highway map.

This motion is similar to the motion of a person when they turn their head on their neck from left to right. In the resulting image, the view seems to \\"pass by\\" the spectator as new material appears on one side of the screen and exits from the other, although perspective lines reveal that the entire image is seen from a fixed point of view. The term panning is derived from panorama, suggesting an expansive view that exceeds the gaze, forcing the viewer to turn their head in order to take everything in. Panning, in other words, is a device for gradually revealing and incorporating off-screen space into the image. Panning should never be confused with tracking or \\"travelling,\\" in which the camera is not just swivelled but is physically displaced left or right, generally by being rolled parallel to its subject. In video technology, panning refers to the horizontal scrolling of an image wider than the display. For 3D modeling in computer graphics, panning means moving parallel to the current view plane. In other words, the camera moves perpendicular to the direction it is pointed. The technique also has limited applications in still photography. In other disciplines, this motion is called yaw. Using panning in still photography Panning shot of a chicken running, at a slow shutter speed of 1/40 second Panning of Porsche 996 GT3 RSR, shutter speed is 1/125 second When photographing a moving subject, the panning technique is achieved by keeping the subject in the same position of the frame for the duration of the exposure. The exposure time must be long enough to allow the background to blur due to the camera movement as the photographer follows the subject in the viewfinder. The exact length of exposure required will depend on the speed at which the subject is moving, the focal length of the lens and the distance from the subject and background. An F1 car speeding along a straight might allow the photographer to achieve a blurred background at 1/250 second, while the photographer might need to go as slow as 1/40 to achieve the same amount of blur for a picture of a running man. The faster shutter speed allowed by fast moving subjects are easier to capture in a smoothly panned shot. With slower moving subjects, the risk is that the panning motion will be jerky, and it is also harder to keep the subject in the same position of the frame for the longer period of time. To aid in capturing panned pictures, photographers use aids such as tripods and monopods, which make it easy to swing the camera along one plane, while keeping it steady in the others.

A typical physical recording console has a pan control for each incoming source channel. A pan control or pan pot (short for \\"panning potentiometer\\") is an analog control with a position indicator which can range continuously from the 7 o'clock when fully left to the 5 o'clock position fully right. Audio mixing software replaces pan pots with on-screen virtual knobs or sliders which function like their physical counterparts. A pan pot has an internal architecture which determines how much of a source signal is sent to the left and right buses. \\"Pan pots split audio signals into left and right channels, each equipped with its own discrete gain (volume) control.\\"Hodgson, Jay (2010). Understanding Records, p.162. . This signal distribution is often called a taper or law. When centered (at 12 o'clock), the law can be designed to send ‚àí3, ‚àí4.5 or ‚àí6 decibels (dB) equally to each bus. \\"Signal passes through both the channels at an equal volume while the pan pot points directly north.\\" If the two output buses are later recombined into a monaural signal, then a pan law of -6 dB is desirable. If the two output buses are to remain stereo then a law of -3 dB is desirable. A law of ‚àí4.5 dB at center is a compromise between the two. A pan control fully rotated to one side results in the source being sent at full strength (0 dB) to one bus (either the left or right channel) and zero strength (‚àí dB) to the other. Regardless of the pan setting, the overall sound power level remains (or appears to remain) constant.AES Pro Audio Reference. Pan Because of the phantom center phenomenon, sound panned to the center position is perceived as coming from between the left and right speakers, but not in the center unless listened to with headphones, because of head-related transfer function HRTF. Panning in audio borrows its name from panning action in moving image technology. An audio pan pot can be used in a mix to create the impression that a source is moving from one side of the soundstage to the other, although ideally there would be timing (including phase and Doppler effects), filtering and reverberation differences present for a more complete picture of apparent movement within a defined space. Simple analog pan controls only change relative level; they don't add reverb to replace direct signal, phase changes, modify the spectrum, or change delay timing. \\"Tracks thus seem to move in the direction that [one] point[s] the pan pots on a mixer, even though [one] actually attenuate[s] those tracks on the opposite side of the horizontal plane.\\"Hodgson (2010), p.163. Panning can also be used in an audio mixer to reduce or reverse the stereo width of a stereo signal. For instance, the left and right channels of a stereo source can be panned straight up, that is sent equally to both the left output and the right output of the mixer, creating a dual mono signal. An early panning process was used in the development of Fantasound, an early pioneering stereophonic sound reproduction system for Fantasia (1940). Stereo-switching Before pan pots were available, \\"a three-way switch was used to assign the track to the left output, right output, or both (the center)\\".Owsinski, Bobby (2006). The Mixing Engineer's Handbook, 2nd Edition, p.20. Cengage. cited in Hodgson (2010), p.161.

The territories can be of different types, such as national and provincial. Several examples exist throughout the world that use other names. In North America, several such places are more commonly known as Four Corners. Usage The word quadripoint does not appear in the Oxford English Dictionary or Merriam-Webster Online, though it has been used since 1964 by the Office of the Geographer of the United States Department of State. and appears in the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, as well as in the World Factbook articles on Botswana, Namibia, Zambia, and Zimbabwe, dating as far back as 1990. History condominium of Moresnet. Moresnet is colored blue, the Netherlands orange, Belgium yellow, and Prussia green. An early instance of four political divisions meeting at a point is in England (attested in the Domesday Book, 1086, and mentioned since 969 if not 772); it combined until 1931 the English shires/counties of Gloucester, Oxford, Warwick, and Worcester. The earliest known quadripoint involving modern nation states existed from 1817 to 1821 where the present Alabama‚ÄìMississippi state line crossed the 31st parallel border between Spain and the United States. During that period, the part of West Florida between the Pearl and Perdido rivers (which Spain still owned but the United States forcibly occupied and annexed in 1810 after belatedly claiming it as part of the Louisiana Territory purchased from France in 1803) was subdivided and allocated partly to the State of Mississippi and partly to the Territory (and later State) of Alabama. There resulted, at the intersection of demarcated boundaries, an international quadripoint of four territories, which in the United States were named (clockwise) Baldwin and Mobile counties of Alabama and Jackson and Greene counties of Mississippi, though Mobile and Jackson Counties were actually still Spanish.Boundaries of the United States and the Several States, Franklin K. Van Zandt, 1976. pp. 22ff, 26f, 100‚Äì107. Between 1839 and 1920 there was a quadripoint at the convergence of Belgium, Prussia/Germany, the Netherlands, and Moresnet at Vaalserberg . Moresnet was never truly a country but rather only a neutral territory or condominium of the Netherlands and Prussia (originally), and of Belgium and Germany (ultimately). Subsequent political changes have restored its quadripartition along municipal lines (Kelmis, Plombieres within Belgium) since 1976 (though it has also enjoyed fivefold partition along municipal lines at times). Four-nation quadripoints =Botswana‚ÄìNamibia‚ÄìZambia‚ÄìZimbabwe= Map showing the Botswana‚ÄìNamibia‚ÄìZambia‚ÄìZimbabwe purported quadripoint (circled) Zambezi River at the junction of Namibia (top left), Zambia (top), Zimbabwe (bottom right), and Botswana (bottom left) While some older sources claimed that a quadripoint existed in Africa,\\"Guinness Book of Records\\", 1979 et seq.; see \\"Shortest Frontier\\" where the borders of Namibia, Botswana, Zambia, and Zimbabwe come together at the confluence of the Cuando (also called Chobe) and Zambezi rivers (approximately ), it is now widely believed that instead, two separate tripoints exist about apart. There have been a few international incidents revolving round this particular quadripoint, or near-quadripoint. In 1970, South Africa (which at the time occupied Namibia) informed Botswana that there was no common border between Botswana and Zambia, claiming that a quadripoint existed. As a result, South Africa claimed, the Kazungula Ferry, which links Botswana and Zambia at the quadripoint, was illegal. Botswana firmly rejected both claims. There was a confrontation and shots were fired at the ferry; some years later, the Rhodesian Army attacked and sank the ferry, maintaining that it was serving military purposes. Ian Brownlie, who studied the case, wrote in 1979 that the possibility of a quadripoint could not be definitively ruled out at that time. In August 2007 the governments of Zambia and Botswana announced a deal to construct a bridge at the site to replace a ferry.\\"Zambia and Botswana reach Kazungula bridge deal.\\" Palapye News blog. Retrieved 12 November 2007. The existence of a short boundary of about between Zambia and Botswana was apparently agreed during various meetings involving heads of state or officials from all four states in the 2006‚Äì10 period, and is clearly shown in the African Development Fund project map. This matches the data kept by the Office of the Geographer under the US Department of State, as depicted in Google Earth. =Cameroon‚ÄìChad‚ÄìNigeria‚ÄìUnited Kingdom= However, a true four-country point did formerly exist in Africa (excluding Kazungula) ‚Äì the only known quadricountry borderpoint (not involving condominial territories) ‚Äì for a period of eight months during 1960 and 1961, in southern Lake Chad, at the location of the present Cameroon‚ÄìChad‚ÄìNigeria tripoint. Upon the 1 October 1960 independence of Nigeria, that borderpoint became common to the latter three countries and the territory of Northern Cameroons, which was still governed under United Nations mandate by the United Kingdom, until it was finally integrated into Nigeria on 1 June 1961. This particular geographical multipoint, though notional since 1908, if not 1891, and definitely fixed and fully agreed since 1931, remains undemarcated to this day.http://prntscr.com/p01ta2 Quadripoints within and between nations Nebraska, from about Gage County to Hall County, showing county lines in black and PLSS township lines in purple. In many parts of the United States county lines are based on PLSS townships and sections. There are occasional jogs in the grid, due to correction lines. Quadripoints can exist at the meeting of political subdivisions of any type(s) or level(s). The most common are in the United States and Canada, where the grid-based Public Land Survey System (PLSS) and Dominion Land Surveys (DLS), respectively, resulted in a large number of quadripoints at the corners of survey units such as DLS townships, PLSS townships, sections, and various other gridded subdivisions. The borders of U.S. counties and towns are often defined by survey townships. There are dozens of quadripoints between U.S. counties, hundreds between U.S. municipalities, and indeed thousands (of usually bilateral ones) on the edges of checkerboard-patterned Indian reservations and other federally reserved territories. But of all the quadripoints that exist, the most noted are a few dozen that are situated on international borders, and about a dozen others involve primary national subdivisions (such as provinces or states). Among the international quadripoints (examples below), a few general types can be distinguished. In the absence of four-country points, three-country quadripoints are perhaps most significant. These combine two divisions of one country with (one each of) two other countries. But there also exist merely binational quadripoints‚Äîof several varieties. Some of these combine two subdivisions of two countries, others three subdivisions of one country with (one of) another; while still others occur at points where international boundaries appear to touch or cross themselves‚Äîwith or without subdivision‚Äîor where an international boundary appears to bifurcate around disputed territories. Also below, by country, are some subnational quadripoints composed of subdivisions. =Algeria‚ÄìMali‚ÄìMauritania= Two districts of Adrar Province, Algeria‚Äînamely Bordj Badji Mokhtar and Reggane‚Äîmeet the Tombouctou Cercle of Tombouctou Region, Mali, and the Bir Mogrein Department of Tiris Zemmour Region, Mauritania. =Andorra= In northern Andorra, the four parr√≤quies or parishes of Canillo, Encamp, La Massana, and Ordino, meet at a quadripoint. =Argentina= The Argentine provinces of La Pampa, R√≠o Negro, Mendoza, and Neuqu√©n may meet at . R√≠o Negro has disputed this since a 1966 resurvey cast the exact boundary convergence into some doubt. =Austria‚ÄìGermany= On the summit of Sorgschrofen peak, the international boundary touches (or crosses) itself at marker number 110, where one Austrian (Tyrolean: Reutte) and two German (Bavarian: Oberallg√§u, Ostallg√§u) municipalities meet at a quadripoint established politically in 1844, cadastrally 1342 or earlier: (in clockwise order) Jungholz (Austria), Pfronten (Germany), Schattwald (Austria), and Bad Hindelang (Germany). =Bangladesh‚ÄìIndia= When almost all of the India‚ÄìBangladesh enclaves were extinguished by the Land Boundary Agreement between the two states, effective after 31 July 2015, which exchanged all first-order exclaves, the following quadripoint(s) was(were) thus also extinguished. The international boundary touched (or crossed) itself at one (or possibly two) locations shared by India (West Bengal state, Cooch Behar district) and Bangladesh (Rangpur Division, Lalmonirhat District). A confirmed instance occurred in Mathabhanga subdivision and a less definite one in Mekhliganj subdivision (of Cooch Behar), involving the Bara Saradubi enclave of Hatibandha thana and the Jote Nijjama enclave of Patgram thana (of Lalmonirhat), respectively. Additional political subdivision did not appear to result in either case. Its (or their) international stature had been intermittent since Mughal times and was a result of the Radcliffe Award of 1947. =Belgium‚ÄìNetherlands= The international boundaries in Baarle between Belgium (dark yellow) and Netherlands (pale yellow), with several enclaves and exclaves The international boundary touches (or crosses) itself, without imparting political subdivision, within the commingled municipalities of Baarle-Nassau (North Brabant, Netherlands) and Baarle-Hertog (Antwerp, Belgium). The peculiar situation, which occurs at Baarle but once (at the touchpoint of Belgian enclaves H1 and H2),http://www.grenspalen.nl/archief/baarle-nassau-in- english.html has existed at least cadastrally since about 1198, but its current international distinction dates only from 1830. =Benin‚ÄìBurkina Faso= Since 2009, Benin and Burkina Faso have jointly administered a neutral zone called Kourou or Koalou that lies tangent to their boundary junction with Togo, producing the sort of tricountry quadripoint that adjoined the defunct Moresnet neutral zone illustrated above. =Canada= The creation of the Canadian territory of Nunavut might have resulted in the creation of a quadripoint between the provinces of Saskatchewan and Manitoba and the territories of Nunavut and Northwest Territories (NWT). Nunavut was officially separated from the Northwest Territories in 1999, though the boundaries had been defined in 1993 by the Nunavut Act and the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement. Both documents define Nunavut's boundary as including the \\"intersection of 60¬∞00'N latitude with 102¬∞00'W longitude, being the intersection of the Manitoba, Northwest Territories and Saskatchewan borders\\". However, the northernmost point of the Manitoba‚ÄìSaskatchewan border as surveyed is slightly off from 60¬∞ north 102¬∞ west, therefore the laws are not perfectly clear about whether the Nunavut‚ÄìNWT boundary, which has not been surveyed, is to meet the others in a quadripoint or not. =Canada‚ÄìUnited States of America= Both of the only known international quadripoints in the Americas occur on the Canada‚ÄìUnited States border along remote mountain crests. One, which joins the Canadian provinces of Alberta (Improvement District Number 4) and British Columbia (Regional District of East Kootenay) with the Montana counties of Flathead and Glacier where the 49th parallel crosses the Continental Divide also unites an international peace park comprising national parks of both countries (Waterton Lakes and Glacier, respectively). It has been a politically important and precisely stipulated international boundary point since 1818; has been monumented since 1876 (now by a hollow metallic obeliskoid marker numbered 272); and has maintained a quadripartite status since 1893.Boundaries of the United States and the Several States, Van Zandt, supra, p. 14, 21 The other of the pair occurs in the international boundary sector known as the Highlands, on the ridge separating the Gulf of Saint Lawrence watershed from the Gulf of Maine watershed, where three minor civil divisions of the state of Maine‚Äînamely Dennistown Plantation, Forsyth, and Sandy Bay Townships, all in Somerset County‚Äîmeet Le Granit Regional County Municipality of the province of Quebec. This quadripoint, which was legally delimited in 1873 and validated in 1895, is marked (like all the corners of the minor civil divisions of Maine) by a brightly painted 8-foot wooden pole.Maine Geological Surveyhttp://docs.unh.edu/ME/attn25nw.jpgPrivate and Special Laws (of Maine) 1895, Chapter 123, dated 5 March 1895, pursuant to Maine State Statutes (Secretary of State's Miscellaneous Papers, IV, p. 53, dated 12 April 1873 =Colombia= There is a subnational quadripoint in Colombia at approximate coordinates , at the confluence of the Up√≠a and Guavio rivers, where the borders of the Boyac√°, Casanare, Meta, and Cundinamarca departments come together. =Croatia= The summit of Risnjak mountain in Primorje-Gorski Kotar County is a meeting point of five municipalities: ƒåabar, Delnice, Lokve, Bakar and ƒåavle, making it a quintipoint. The municipalities of Vrbanja, Drenovci, Bo≈°njaci and Nijemci in Vukovar-Srijem County meet at a quadripoint just south of the A3 motorway, near Spaƒçva. The municipalities of Magadenovac, Marijanci, Valpovo and Ko≈°ka in Osijek-Baranja County meet at a quadripoint on the river Breznica. The municipalities of Krapina, Mihovljan, Bedekovƒçina and Sveti Kri≈æ Zaƒçretje in Krapina-Zagorje County meet at a quadripoint just north of the village of Komor Zaƒçretski. The municipalities of ƒåakovec, Sveti Juraj na Bregu, Selnica and Mursko Sredi≈°ƒáe in Meƒëimurje County share a quadripoint north of the village of ≈Ωi≈°kovec. =Croatia‚ÄìHungary‚ÄìSerbia= At a delimitation point determined partly following World War I and partly following World War II, and indirectly monumented by international pillars 415 and 420 on respective riverbanks, there is on the thalweg (center of downstream navigation channel) of the Danube a trinational quadripoint, where the Hungarian counties of Baranya and B√°cs-Kiskun meet the Croatian county of Osjeƒçko-Baranjska and the Serbian (Vojvodina) District of West Baƒçka (although Croatia continues to claim its former Yugoslav cadastral territory east of the Danube, leaving the quadripoint technically unsettled).downloadable map (English prompts available) http://www.nuim.ie/staff/dpringle/igu_wpm/mladen.pdf =Dominican Republic‚ÄìHaiti= On the border of the Dominican Republic and Haiti, there is a binational quadripoint where two departments of Haiti, Centre and Ouest, meet two provinces of the Dominican Republic, Elias Pina and Independencia, at the ridgeline of a feature that is called the Sierra de Neiba in the Dominican Republic and the Chaine du Trou de l'Eau in Haiti, and which a 19th-century communal boundary followed before the intersecting 20th-century international boundary was created. As well, some to the east along the same ridgeline, the same two Dominican provinces produce a subnational quadripoint where they meet two other Dominican provinces, Baoruco and San Juan. =Gabon= Four provinces (the primary subdivision) of Gabon, namely Moyen-Ogooue, Ngounie, Ogooue-Ivindo, and Ogooue-Lolo, meet at a quadripoint. Moreover at least one instance of four departments (the secondary subdivision), namely Haut-Ntem, Ivindo, Okano, and Woleu, also meet at quadripoint. =Hungary‚ÄìSlovakia= The border between Hungary and Slovakia most probably leads the world in international quadrimunicipal points with no fewer than five, but this border is also unique for hosting the only known pair of linked quadrimunicipal points in the world‚Äîwhich are shared in common by the towns of Skaros, Slovakia, and F√ºz√©r, Hungary, in conjunction with Trsten√© Pri Horn√°de, Slovakia, and Holl√≥h√°za, Hungary, in one case, and Slaska Huta, Slovakia, and Pusztafalu, Hungary, in the other. All these towns are in either the Ko≈°ice Okolie district of the Ko≈°ice region of Slovakia or the Borsod-Aba√∫j-Zempl√©n county of Hungary. =Iraq‚ÄìSaudi Arabia= From 1922 - 1981 Iraq and Saudi Arabia jointly administered a large neutral zone immediately west Kuwait, forming a distinctive diamond shape which create a quadripoint at the Kuwait border. =Jamaica= Four parishes of Jamaica, namely Clarendon, Manchester, Saint Ann, and Trelawny, meet at a quadripoint. =Lithuania‚ÄìPoland‚ÄìRussia= At , there is a trinational quadripoint: to the northwest is Russia (specifically the Russian exclave Kaliningrad Oblast); to the northeast Lithuania; and to the southwest and southeast two voivodeships (provinces) of Poland: Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship and Podlaskie Voivodeship. The quadripoint exists thanks to the way the border between Poland and Russian SFSR was defined in 1945 by the Potsdam Agreement. The new border between Poland and the USSR bisected Germany's former province of East Prussia; the northern part became Kaliningrad Oblast, and most of the southern part is now Warmia-Masuria. =Mauritania= Four regions of Mauritania, namely Adrar, Brakna, Tagant, and Trarza, meet at a quadripoint formed by an intersection of non-cardinally oriented geodesic lines that define their borders. =Mexico= In Mexico there is one precise quadripoint at . The Mojonera de los cuatro estados (\\"Four State Boundary Stone\\") was built to mark the point where Coahuila, Nuevo Leon, San Luis Potosi, and Zacatecas states effectively meet. =Norway‚ÄìSweden= On the border of Sweden and Norway, there is a binational quadripoint where two counties of Norway, Tr√∏ndelag and Nordland, meet two counties of Sweden, V√§sterbotten and J√§mtland, at international boundary marker number 204. Though the marker dates from 1760, the point became a quadripoint in the 19th century and became international upon the dissolution of Sweden and Norway in 1905. =Oman‚ÄìSaudi Arabia‚ÄìYemen= Amid the Empty Quarter of Arabia‚Äîas trilaterally agreed and monumented in 2006 precisely at the intersection of the 19th parallel and 52nd meridian (datum uncertain)‚ÄîOman (governorate of Dhofar) and Saudi Arabia (emirate of Ash Sharqiyah) meet Yemen (and its governorates of Al Mahrah and Hadramawt) in a tricountry quadripoint. =Poland‚ÄìSlovakia= At a secondary summit of Pilsko Peak called G√≥ra Piƒôciu Kopc√≥w, where there is situated a prominent turnpoint on the border of Poland and Slovakia that is evidently demarcated by a primary border marker numbered III/109, there lies a binational quadripoint at which the rural gmina or municipality of Jele≈õnia in ≈ªywiec County of the Silesian Voivodeship of Poland apparently meets three municipalities of N√°mestovo District of ≈Ωilina Region of Slovakia called, respectively, Mutne, Oravsk√© Vesel√©, and N√°mestovo (although it is unclear if the last-mentioned is an outlier of the eponymous district seat or just an unorganized territory of the N√°mestovo District itself).http://www.mapy.cc/beskidy/zywiecki/pilsko.jpg =Russia‚ÄìKazakhstan= A quadripoint is created by Saratov Oblast, Samara Oblast, and Orenburg Oblast from the Russian side of the border and West Kazakhstan Region from the Kazakhstani side.http://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=51.7730&mlon;=50.7682#map=15/51.7730/50.7682 =Suriname= In the Coppename River Suriname enjoys a quadripoint of the districts of Coronie, Para, Saramacca, and Sipaliwini. =Sweden= In 2007, the municipality of Heby was transferred to Uppsala County, causing Heby of Uppsala County to border the counties of V√§stmanland, Dalarna, and G√§vleborg at the junction of Dal√§lven and Norrsundet in F√§rnebofj√§rden. This was previously a county-level tripoint when Heby was a part of V√§stmanland. The point forms approximate right angles. =United Kingdom= Due to changes to the borders and numbers of administrative counties in the last century, no true quadripoint remains in the United Kingdom. But quite apart from the few shire/county quadripoints that have actually existed in England, mistaken claims of an extant one are sometimes made about a place near Stamford where Rutland, Lincolnshire, Cambridgeshire, and Northamptonshire seem to meet at a point (). However, the location actually consists of two tripoints around apart. The village of Four Marks in Hampshire is so named, because historically four adjoining tithings (or parishes) of Medstead, Ropley, Faringdon, and Chawton met there in a quadripoint. =United States= The boundary marker inscribed at the center of the Four Corners Monument, the only state quadripoint in the United States; where Arizona, Utah, Colorado, and New Mexico meet The Four Corners Monument is the only point in the United States where four states meet: Colorado, Utah, New Mexico, and Arizona meet at right angles. The United States first acquired the area now called Four Corners from Mexico after the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War in 1848. In 1863 Congress created Arizona Territory from the western part of New Mexico Territory. The boundary was defined as a line running due south from the southwest corner of Colorado Territory, which had been created in 1861. By defining one boundary as starting at the corner of another Congress ensured the eventual creation of four states meeting at a point, regardless of the inevitable errors of boundary surveying. The monument is centered at . =Void or dispute-pendant quadripoints= A pair of conflicting territorial claims can give rise to a void or dispute-pendant quadripoint: of the territory in dispute and the adjacent undisputed territories of the claimants with a fourth territory (or void area) claimed by neither of them. An international case of such a quadripoint on dry land can be inferred, if not actually found, in a remote area of the Nubian Desert involving both the Hala'ib Triangle and Bir Tawil (about midway between the River Nile and the Red Sea) where the long established but undemarcated international border along the 22nd parallel, as claimed by Egypt, is intersected by a similarly well established administrative boundary preferred and claimed by Sudan as the true international border. Another occurrence‚Äîactually a chain of three such quadripoints linked to two separate unclaimed areas‚Äîis inferred where the southern end of the Alaska sector of the Canada‚ÄìUS border aberrates into two crisscrossing versions or claim lines. These conflicting lines produce, besides two areas of overlapping claims, two small triangles of void or virtual high seas‚Äîone having two pendant quadripoints and the other a third, all identifiable at fairly precise geocoordinates‚Äîas they lurch through the narrows of Dixon Entrance toward their still indefinite boundary termination in the true high seas of the Pacific. Yet another quadripoint of this type exists on the disputed Thai‚ÄìCambodian boundary a short distance northeast of Preah Vihear Temple. And finally, combining the only other two (of the seven known) unclaimed or void areas on Earth, is a seventh dispute-pendant quadripoint, at the South Pole. Being at once a simple bilateral quadripoint and a far more complicated intersection of claim limits (an elevenfold six- country point), the South Pole example combines two parcels of virgin unclaimed land with two parcels of Antarctic Treaty regulated territory (which have been variously claimed, disputed, recognized, ignored, disowned, and reclaimed as national sovereign territory by Argentina, Australia, Chile, France, the United Kingdom, and New Zealand, if not also Norway). But whatever the ultimate disposition of disputed national sovereignty, the intersection and quadripoint of two pristine and disputable territories endures. The void areas meet the polar quadripoint between the 90th and 150th meridian west longitude (Marie Byrd Land) and, again, between the 20th meridian west and 45th meridian east (this latter sector, of indefinite extent, owing to the Norwegian exclusion of the South Pole from Queen Maud Land), while sovereign or treaty-regulated areas converge at the polar quadripoint in the two intervals between the void areas. Multipoints of greater numerical complexity Kuhankuono border marker Quadripoints are exceptional and rare because borders and territories do not normally meet in groups of more than three (viz., at tripoints). Correspondingly and proportionally rarer are points of more than fourfold constituency. Perhaps a dozen quinquepoints of various levels of geopolitical subdivisions are scattered around the world; for example five counties of Florida, United States, meet in the middle of Lake Okeechobee, and the five parishes of Nevis, one of the two islands that make up St Kitts and Nevis, meet on Nevis Peak in the centre of the island. Multipoints of greater than quintuple complexity are exceedingly rare. In Finland near Turku, the borders of six municipalities merge on the same point: P√∂yty√§, Aura, Turku, Rusko, Nousiainen, and Myn√§m√§ki meet on the Kuhankuono border marker in Kurjenrahka National Park. The oldest recorded mention of the point dates to 1381, and the number and identity of municipalities participating has varied. Eight communities of three districts of Papua-New Guinea meet at a single point, at the summit of Mt. Taraka on Bougainville Island, in North Solomons province. The communities are Lato, Motuna-Huyono and Koraru (within Boku district); Makis, Konnou and Wisai (in Buin district); and Bakong and Bakada (in Kieta district). The resulting octopoint is thus a higher-level tripoint as well. In the Philippines, an octopoint exists at the summit of Mayon Volcano, where eight municipalities in Albay meet. In the nearby province of Camarines Sur, the peak of Mount Isarog is a hexapoint. In Northern Ireland, ten townlands meet at the summit of Knocklayd (clearly shown by Ordnance Survey mapping at point 311518 436392). The townlands are, clockwise from north, Broom-More, Tavnaghboy, Kilrobert, Clare Mountain, Aghaleck, Corvally, Essan, Cleggan, Stroan, and Tullaghore. Map of municipalities in the province of Catania, Sicily, Italy Similarly in Italy, the borders of ten municipalities meet on the summit of Mount Etna. These municipalities are Adrano, Biancavilla, Belpasso, Bronte, Castiglione di Sicilia, Maletto, Nicolosi, Randazzo, Sant'Alfio, and Zafferana Etnea. The territory of Bronte touches the summit of Mount Etna from two sides, making this decimunicipal point one of elevenfold complexity, and thus evidently the most complicated geopolitical multipoint anywhere, other than the South Pole.

Play The game was played as night fell upon the region using three separate rooms. In preparation, participants would light 100 andon in the third room and position a single mirror on the surface of a small table. When the sky was at its darkest, guests gathered in the first of the three rooms, taking turns orating tales of ghoulish encounters and reciting folkloric tales passed on by villagers who claimed to have experienced supernatural encounters. These tales soon became known as kaidan. Upon the end of each kaidan, the story-teller would enter the third room and extinguished one andon, look in the mirror and make their way back to the first room. With each passing tale, the room slowly grew darker and darker as the participants reached the one hundredth tale, creating a safe haven for the evocation of spirits. However, as the game reached the ninety-ninth tale, many participants would stop, fearful of invoking the spirits they had been summoning. History While the exact origins of Hyakumonogatari Kaidankai are unknown, it was believed that it was first played amongst the samurai class as a test of courage. In Ogita Ansei's 1660 nursery tale \\"Otogi Monogatari\\" a version of the game was described in which the narrative tells of several young samurai telling tales in the Hyakumonogatari Kaidankai fashion. In the tale, as one samurai finished the one hundredth tale, he began to extinguish the candle when suddenly he sees a giant gnarled hand descend upon him from above. While some of the samurai cowered in fear, a swipe of his sword revealed the hand to be merely the shadow of a spider.http://www.sarudama.com/japanese_folklore/kaidan_modern.shtml A Brief History of Kaidan At first, the game of Hyakumonogatari Kaidankai was popular amongst the aristocratic warrior class, but it soon garnered favorable reputation amongst the working class peasants and town people. With a heightened interest in telling newer and original kaidan, people began scouring the countryside for tales of the mysterious, many of which combined a mixture of ghostly vengeance and elements of karma in Buddhism. A true popular phenomenon, the hype of Hyakumonogatari Kaidankai combined with new printing technology created a boom in the publication of kaidan-themed books collecting appropriate tales from every corner of Japan and China. But it was in 1677 that the first kaidan-shu was published. Known as Shokoku Hyakumonogatari, or 100 Tales of Many Countries, the book earned popularity for having been a compilation of tales from people residing in several countries, and who further claimed each tale was true. Books in this genre often used the term Hyakumonogatari in the title, and the published tale‚Äôs popularity continued long after the fad for the game had faded. In other media The game of Hyakumonogatari Kaidankai became a cult phenomenon in Japan, and while the hype of these tales has receded, many J-horror films and Japanese urban legends can be attributed to the parlour game's influence. Woodblock painter and founder of the Maruyama-Shijo School of Painting, Maruyama Okyo is considered the first artist to offer paintings of the yurei who were frequently cast in kaidan. The telling of the tales in a hyakumonogatari Kaidankai formed the basis of the film, Yokai Monsters: One Hundred Monsters released in 1968. In 2002, Fuji TV released the television program \\"Kaidan Hyakumonogatari\\" using the basis of the game Hyakumonogatari Kaidankai to tell classic Japanese ghost stories. The series starred Naoto Takenaka and showcased 11 episodes, including an episode which focused on the tale of Yuki Onna. The popularity of Hyakumonogatari Kaidankai is not limited to Japan, in the Episode \\"Freshman Fear\\" of the A&E; docu-drama reality television series Paranormal State, members of Penn State Paranormal Research Society play the Ancient Japanese Game of One Hundred Candles during their investigation of a supposed haunting in a student dormitory.

It previously composed of one adversary squadron equipped with the F-5, one CH-46 squadron, one CH-53E squadron, one AH-1W and UH-1N squadron and a maintenance and logistics squadron. MAG-46 fell under the 4th Marine Aircraft Wing and Marine Forces Reserve. Due to a re-organization within Marine aviation, the group was deactivated in 2009. Mission Organize, train and equip individual Marines and combat-ready squadrons and to augment and reinforce the active component when required in order to serve as part of our total force. History Marine Aircraft Group 46 was activated March 1, 1944 as Marine Base Defense Aircraft Group 46 at Marine Corps Air Station El Toro, California. The Group‚Äôs primary mission was to administer and supervise training for combat duty, and other activities of the attached squadrons and detachments. It also trained replacement pilots and crew for Marine squadrons operating in combat areas. MAG-46 was redesignated on November 10, 1944 as Marine Aircraft Group 46. Another redesignation occurred on May 15, 1945 when it was assigned the title of Marine Air Support Group 46. The termination of hostilities in the summer of 1945 was followed by the rapid demobilization. One result of this policy was the deactivation of the group on 15 March 1946. Six years later, a major reorganization within Marine Aviation began. This reorganization coincided with the formation of 4th Marine Division in the reserve. Changes included reactivation of MAG 46. Thus on July 1, 1962, Marine Aircraft Group 46 was reactivated at Grosse Ile, Michigan and moved to Naval Air Station New York in Brooklyn on November 1, 1965. In early 1971, MAG 46 moved back to Marine Corps Air Station El Toro, California and remained there until August 1994 when the Group relocated to its final location at Marine Corps Air Station Miramar, San Diego, CA. From the 90‚Äôs into the new millennium all of MAG-46 flying and support units have answered the call to the Global War on Terrorism.

After an opera career in London and throughout Britain beginning in 1869, Temple joined the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company in 1877. There, he created most of the bass-baritone roles in the Savoy Operas, as follows: Sir Marmaduke in The Sorcerer (1877), Dick Deadeye in H.M.S. Pinafore (1878), the Pirate King in the London production of The Pirates of Penzance (1880), Colonel Calverley in Patience (1881), Arac in Princess Ida (1884), the title character in The Mikado, Sir Roderic in Ruddigore and Sergeant Meryll in The Yeomen of the Guard (1888). He also played the baritone roles of Strephon in the original production of Iolanthe (1882), and Giuseppe in the New York production of The Gondoliers (1890). During the next two decades, Temple played in, or directed, a variety of comic operas, musical comedies and plays, and sang in concerts, both in London and on tour. He also taught acting and directed productions at music schools, primarily at the Royal College of Music. Early life and opera career Temple with Mrs Howard Paul in The Sorcerer Temple was born in London, the eldest son of Richard Cobb, a stockbroker from Yorkshire, and his wife, Eliza Barker. He worked as a bank clerk and cashier and began to sing and act as and amateur.

The next year at St George's Hall, London, he played Mephistopheles in Faust and the King in Maritana, and later sang in oratorio there. The same year, at the Crystal Palace, among other roles, he repeated the King, played Father Tom in The Lily of Killarney, and the Sheriff in Martha.

The following year he gave concerts in London and toured in opera before returning to London to play the role of Pippertrunk in Le Roi Carotte at the Alhambra Theatre, and G√©rome, in L'≈ìil crev√© at the Opera Comique. In 1873, between tours in Dublin and elsewhere and roles in his Crystal Palace Operetta Company, Temple appeared as Larivaudi√®re in the very successful English- language premiere of La fille de Madame Angot, adapted by Farnie, at the Gaiety Theatre in London,Stone, David.

Pinafore In 1875, Temple produced, directed, and appeared as Thomas Brown in, a revival of Arthur Sullivan's one-act comic opera The Zoo, at the Philharmonic Theatre, which was played as an afterpiece to an adaptation of Offenbach's Les G√©orgiennes, with Temple as Rhododendron Pasha. In the same year, Temple again appeared in Breaking the Spell.The Observer, 2 May 1875, p. 1 Among other roles in 1876, he created the role of Buckingham in Alfred Cellier's Nell Gwynne and played the title-role in Cellier's The Sultan of Mocha. At the Globe Theatre he appeared in Edward Solomon's first opera, A Will With Vengeance. The following year, he played the title role in The Marriage of Figaro with great success at the Crystal Palace in the Rose Hersee Opera Company production, with Florence St. John as CherubinoThe Observer, 5 August 1877, p. 3 He also produced his own English version of Offenbach's Genevi√®ve de Brabant as well as playing in various roles in London. D'Oyly Carte years In 1877 Temple was engaged to create the part of Sir Marmaduke Pointdextre in the first production of Gilbert and Sullivan's The Sorcerer at the Opera Comique, produced by Richard D'Oyly Carte. The following year, he created the role of Dick Deadeye in the company's long-running international hit, H.M.S. Pinafore. During the original runs of The Sorcerer and Pinafore, Temple also took parts in the short companion pieces that accompanied these longer works. He played Fred Fancourt in the 1877-78 revival of Dora's Dream, the title role in The Spectre Knight (1878), General Deelah in Cups and Saucers (1878-79), and Selworthy in After All! (1878-79). He also produced an opera season in Dublin in 1879. Temple played the Pirate King in the first London production of The Pirates of Penzance (1880-81). He next created the part of Colonel Calverley in Patience (Opera Comique, 1881), but left the company on 8 October of that year, the day before the piece left the Opera Comique to transfer to the new Savoy Theatre.Classified ad for Patience in The Times, 8 October 1881, p. 6 Temple remained at the Opera Comique where, from October-December 1881, he appeared as King Portico in a revival of W. S. Gilbert and Frederic Clay's comic opera Princess Toto produced by John Hollingshead.\\"Opera Comique\\", The Times, 18 October 1881, p. 4. When Patience moved to the Savoy, John Hollingshead took over the management of the Opera Comique from Carte to produce Princess Toto. He also gave \\"Richard Temple's Dramatic Recital\\" at Peckham in 1881, played in other operetta at the Opera Comique and, in Manchester, created the role of King James in The Lancashire Witches and played Abdallah in Solomon‚Äôs Lord Bateman. Temple as The Mikado of Japan Temple soon returned to the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, creating the role of Strephon in Iolanthe (1882-84), the only Savoy Opera in which he was cast as the romantic hero. During the run of Iolanthe, Temple was also co- director of the Crystal Palace opera season with Faulkner Leigh and August Manns, presenting Maritana, Faust and Il Barbiere di Siviglia.The Observer, 19 August 1883, p. 3 Next, Temple created the role of Arac in Gilbert and Sullivan's Princess Ida (1884) and revisited the role of Sir Marmaduke in the first revival of The Sorcerer (1884-85). He then created his most celebrated role, the Mikado of Japan in The Mikado (1885-87), whom, according to Jessie Bond, he played as \\"suave and oily\\".Joseph, p. 260 In 1887 he created the part of Sir Roderic Murgatroyd in Ruddigore (1887). After revivals of Pinafore, Pirates and Mikado, in which he repeated his original roles, Temple played Sergeant Meryll in The Yeomen of the Guard (1888-89), the final role he would create for Gilbert and Sullivan. During these years, between these Savoy pieces, he played several other opera roles in London, including the title role in Rigoletto. Journeyman actor and director Temple declined the role of Luiz in the next Gilbert and Sullivan opera, The Gondoliers, when it opened at the Savoy in December 1889, but in February 1890 he was one of the replacements rushed to New York for the restaging of The Gondoliers at Palmer's Theatre, taking the role of Giuseppe. Before that he appeared in Trial by Jury and again in Cox and Box and made his debut in music hall. He later appeared in The Gondoliers on tour in the English provinces.The Manchester Guardian, 24 June 1890, p. 8 In July 1890, he left the company again to pursue a directing career. In 1891, he married Annie Marie Davis Watts, with whom he had been living since at least 1881.Marriage licence at Index of Birth, Marriage & Deaths for England & Wales, January ‚Äì March 1891, Kensington, vol 1a, p. 316; 1881 census Temple was back with a D'Oyly Carte touring company briefly the following year, playing Pyjama in The Nautch Girl. Also in 1892, he was appointed to the Royal College of Music, where he directed student productions. He made occasional appearances in London in L' Impresario at the Olympic Theatre (1892), as Lord Silvertop in The Golden Web at the Lyric Theatre in 1893, as George in Miami at Princess's Theatre in 1893, as Sid Fakah in Morocco Bound, with music by Osmond Carr, at the Shaftesbury Theatre and then the Trafalgar Theatre in 1893-94,Moss, Simon. Programme and description of Morocco Bound productions, Gilbert & Sullivan, a selling exhibition of memorabilia, Archive: Other items and starred as Dick in Wapping Old Stairs at the Vaudeville Theatre in 1894, which he also directed and produced. Temple returned to the Savoy and D'Oyly Carte in October 1894, replacing John Coates as Baron Van den Berg in Mirette. In December 1894 at the Savoy, he created the part of Sancho in Sullivan and Burnand's The Chieftain, and later that month played Sergeant Bouncer when a revival of Cox and Box was added to the bill. After a year's absence from the company, he returned to the Savoy briefly in 1896 to give some performances in the title role of a revival of The Mikado, and he also directed the premiere of Charles Villiers Stanford's Shamus O'Brien at the Opera Comique that year, among other directing. He then appeared in the first revival of Yeomen in 1897. In December 1898 he filled in as Sir Marmaduke in The Sorcerer, and in 1899 he played Dick Deadeye again in the third revival of H.M.S. Pinafore at the Savoy. Temple as Sancho in The Chieftain In addition to his theatre work, Temple sang in concerts, especially in the later part of his career. Of his recital at the Steinway Hall in 1903, The Times said, \\"It is unnecessary to say more than that the eminent artist showed how fully he understands the traditions of various schools, such as the German opera of the past ... French op√©ra-comique ... and the Italian buffo style.\\"The Times, 11 July 1903, p. 14 At a later Steinway Hall recital he performed the then avant-garde Enoch Arden to Richard Strauss's music. Temple gave recitals in other venues, including the Queen's Hall.The Times, 15 May 1895, p. 3 He also set himself up as a \\"musical and dramatic\\" reciter. Later years Temple continued to appear in various comic operas and musical comedies, including A Prince of Borneo (1899), billed as \\"an operatic farce\\";The Times, 6 October 1899, p. 11 The Gay Pretenders (1900), with George Grossmith senior and junior, and Frank Wyatt;The Observer, 11 November 1900, p. 6The Times, 12 November 1900, p. 13 and the captain in San Toy on tour in 1901.The Manchester Guardian, 14 May 1901, p. 7 He also played Northumberland in Herbert Beerbohm Tree's production of William Shakespeare's Richard II at Her Majesty's Theatre in 1903,11 September 1903, p. 3 and that Christmas, he was in Little Hans Andersen as King of the Copper Castle, produced by William Greet with members of the Savoy company. In October 1904, Temple appeared briefly on tour in two of his original roles - as Dick Deadeye in Pinafore and Strephon in Iolanthe. He directed Liza Lehmann's The Vicar of Wakefield in 1906‚Äì07, starring Isabel Jay, and also played the role of Burchell.The Musical Times, Vol. 48, No. 767, 1 January 1907, pp. 39‚Äì40The Observer, 16 December 1906, p. 5 In October 1908, he returned to the Savoy to give a few performances as Deadeye in Pinafore in place of Henry Lytton. In March 1909, he played Sergeant Meryll in Yeomen. Beginning in the mid-1890s, Temple devoted much of his time to teaching acting and directing productions at music schools, primarily at The Royal College of Music where he was Professor of Elocution and Acting until the year of his death.\\"Gilbertian Memories\\" in The New York Times, 16 June 1912 He directed many student productions with Charles Villiers Stanford conducting, including Gluck's Orfeo, with the young Clara Butt (1893);The Musical Times, Vol. 34, No. 599, 1 January 1893, pp. 24‚Äì25 the UK premiere of L√©o Delibes' Le roi l'a dit (1895);The Musical Times, Vol. 36, No. 623, 1 January 1895, p. 26 Purcell's Dido and Aeneas (1895);The Musical Times, Vol. 36, No. 634, 1 December 1895, pp. 811‚Äì13 Verdi's Falstaff (1896);The Times, 12 December 1896, p. 10 Wagner's The Flying Dutchman (1898);The Times, 10 December 1898, p. 9 Weber's Euryanthe (1900);The Times, 1 December 1900, p. 14 Fidelio (1902);The Times, 26 November 1902, p. 12 and Schumann's Genoveva, with the young George Baker (1910).The Musical Times, Vol. 51, No. 814, 1 December 1910, pp. 789‚Äì90 For the Royal Academy of Music, he directed Verdi's Un ballo in maschera in 1908.\\"Royal Academy of Music\\", The Times, 1 June 1908, p. 11 At the Academy, as Director of the Dramatic Class,e.g., The Times, 15 December 1909, p. 14; and The Musical Times, Vol. 54, No. 841, 1 March 1913, p. 195 his many students included Eva TurnerThe Musical Times, Vol. 55, No. 857, 1 July 1914, pp. 459‚Äì460 and Darrell Fancourt, who later became well known as Temple's successor in the Gilbert and Sullivan bass-baritone roles.The Musical Times, Vol. 52, No. 815, 1 January 1911, p. 29 At the Royal Academy and the Royal College he taught many other students, including future Gilbert and Sullivan performers George Baker and Clara Dow,The Times, 5 December 1903, p. 14 and Muriel Foster, who became known as an oratorio singer. After an illness of some 18 months, a benefit was held for Temple in September 1912.The Times, 14 September 1912, p. 4 Temple died at Charing Cross Hospital in London the following month at the age of 66. Temple is portrayed by Timothy Spall in the 1999 Mike Leigh film, Topsy-Turvy. His son Richard William Cobb Temple (1872‚Äì1954)Index of Birth, Marriage & Deaths for England & Wales, October ‚Äì December 1872, Camberwell, vol 1d, p. 671 became an actor in Britain and America.

She lived much of her adult life in Britain and, in her final years, was closely associated with the Moroccan city of Marrakesh. Her husband was the oil heir and subsequent philanthropist John Paul Getty Jr. Early life Talitha Dina Pol was born in Java, then part of the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia), daughter of the artists (1905‚Äì88) and Arnoldine Adriana \\"Adine\\" Mees (1908‚Äì1948).Adine Mees at the RKD Her father subsequently married Poppet John (1912‚Äì97), daughter of the painter Augustus John (1878‚Äì1961), a pivotal figure in the world of Bohemian culture and fashion. She was thus the step-granddaughter of both Augustus John and his muse and second wife, Dorothy \\"Dorelia\\" McNeil (1881‚Äì1969), who was a fashion icon in the early years of the 20th century. By Ian Fleming's widowed mother, Evelyn Ste Croix Fleming n√©e Rose, Augustus John had a daughter and Talitha's aunt, Amaryllis Fleming (1925‚Äì1999), who became a noted cellist. Pol spent her early years, during the Second World War, with her mother in a Japanese prison camp. Her father was interned in a separate camp and her parents went their own ways after the war, Pol moving to Britain with her mother, who died in 1948 in The Hague. Pol studied at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA) in London. Writer and journalist Jonathan Meades, who was at RADA several years later, recalled that, after first coming to London in 1964, he saw Pol with her stepmother at Seal House, Holland Park (home of Poppet John's sister, Vivien). Meades thought her \\"the most beautiful young woman I had ever seen ... I gaped, unable to dissemble my amazement\\".Times Magazine, 11 November 2006 In 1988, a former Labour Member of the British Parliament Woodrow, Lord Wyatt recalled, with reference to the \\"success with women\\" of Anthony, Lord Lambton, former Conservative Government Minister, that > ...there was that Talitha Pol who was very pretty and had a little starlet > job in Yugoslavia; and he went and stayed at the hotel and sent her huge > bunches of flowers about every two hours and showered her with > presents.Diary, 15 August 1988: The Journals of Woodrow Wyatt, ed Sarah > Curtis (1998), p 614 Another to come under Pol's spell was the dancer Rudolf Nureyev, who first met her at a party in 1965. According to Nureyev's biographer, Julie Kavanagh, the two were in thrall to each other, to the extent that Nureyev \\"had never felt so erotically stirred by a woman\\" and told several friends that he wished to marry Pol.Julie Kavanagh (2007) Rudolf Nureyev: The Life; Sunday Times, 16 September 2007. Kavanagh surmised that \\"what [Nureyev] was actually seeing was an exquisite, androgynous reflection of himself\\". In the event, Nureyev was unable to attend a dinner party given by Claus von B√ºlow, at which he and Pol were to have been seated next to each other, and so von B√ºlow invited instead John Paul Getty Jr., son of his employer, the oil tycoon Paul Getty. Pol and Getty Jr forged a relationship that led to their marriage in 1966. Marriage to John Paul Getty Pol (right) with John Paul Getty Jr. immediately after their wedding at the City Hall in Rome, 10 December 1966. Pol became the second wife of John Paul Getty, Jr. on 10 December 1966. She was married in a white miniskirt, trimmed with mink. The Gettys became part of Swinging London's fashionable scene, becoming friends with, among others, singers Mick Jagger of the Rolling Stones and his girl-friend Marianne Faithfull. Faithfull has recounted her apprehension, through \\"ingrained agoraphobia\\", about an invitation to spend five weeks with the Gettys in Morocco (\\"but for Mick this is an essential part of his life\\") and how, after splitting from Jagger, she took up with Talitha Getty's lover, Count Jean de Breteuil, a young French aristocrat (1949‚Äì1971). Breteuil supplied drugs to musicians such as Jim Morrison of The Doors, Keith Richards, and Marianne Faithfull, who wrote that Breteuil \\"saw himself as dealer to the stars\\"Robert Greenfield, Exile on Main St.: A Season in Hell with the Rolling Stones, DaCapo Press, 2006, pages 55‚Äì56Stephen Davis, Jim Morrison: Life, Death, Legend, Gotham, 2005, pages 388‚Äì389Faithfull: an Autobiography, 1994, page 195 and has claimed that he delivered the drugs that accidentally killed Morrison'True Confessions' (portrait of Marianne Faithfull by Ebet Roberts) in Mojo, September 2014, page 51. less than two weeks before Talitha's own death in 1971.

However, in later years, he became a philanthropist and, as a U.S. citizen, received an honorary British knighthood in 1986. His luxury yacht, built in 1927 and renovated in 1994, was the MY Talitha G. In July 1968, the Gettys had a son, Tara Gabriel Gramophone Galaxy, who became a noted ecological conservationist in Africa, dropped his third and fourth forenames, and took Irish citizenship in 1999. He and his wife Jessica (a chalet maid he met in Verbier) have three children, including a daughter named Talitha.The Tatler, May 2011, p 111 By 1969, the dissolute lifestyle the Gettys were leading in Italy and Morocco had begun to wear on Talitha, who wished to pursue treatment for heroin and alcohol addiction and return to Britain. Both she and Paul were unfaithful to one another (Paul was having an affair with Victoria Holdsworth, whom he would go on to marry in 1994), and Paul showed no commitment to becoming sober. He agreed to a separation and purchased a house for his wife and son to live in on Cheyne Walk in London. In Early 1970 Talitha was sober and living an active social life in London. Marrakesh photo Talitha Getty is probably best remembered for an iconic photograph taken on a roof-top in Marrakesh, Morocco in January 1969 by Patrick Lichfield. See also Lichfield (1981) The Most Beautiful Women] With her hooded husband in the background, this image, part of the collection of the National Portrait Gallery in London, portrayed her in a crouching pose, wearing a multi-coloured kaftan, white harem pants and white and cream boots. The look seemed stylishly to typify the hippie fashion of the time and became a model over the years for what, more recently, has been referred to variously as \\"hippie chic\\", \\"boho-chic\\" and \\"Talitha Getty chic\\".The Guardian, 24 July 2005 Film career As an actress, Pol appeared in several films, including Village of Daughters (1962) (as a daughter, Gioia Spartaco); an Edgar Wallace mystery, We Shall See (1964) (as Jirina); The System (1964) (as Helga); Return from the Ashes (1965) (as Claudine, alongside Maximilian Schell, Ingrid Thulin and Samantha Eggar); and Barbarella (1968), a sexually charged science-fiction fantasy starring Jane Fonda, in which she had the minor uncredited role of a girl smoking a hookah pipe. Death In the spring of 1971, Talitha Getty asked her husband for a divorce after years of living separately, but Paul Jr. was adamant that he still loved her and pleaded with her to come to Rome for a reconciliation. Her lawyers advised her that divorce proceedings would be easier if Talitha could show that she had attempted to reconcile with Paul, so on 9 July 1971 she flew to Rome. She was found dead on 11 July in the Getty apartment on Piazza d'Aracoeli, allegedly of a heroin overdose. However, her death certificate listed the cause as cardiac arrest, with high levels of alcohol and barbiturates found in her blood.(source: source: 1930‚Äì, Pearson, John, (1995). Painfully rich : the outrageous fortune and misfortunes of the heirs of J. Paul Getty (1st ed.). New York: St. Martin's Press. ). Speculation flared up in the Italian press that Paul's continued heroin usage had caused Talitha to relapse. An autopsy conducted 8 months after her death found traces of heroin in Talitha's system, but this was inconclusive since heroin can persist in the body for many months, and might therefore have pre-dated her sobriety. In January 1973, Italian authorities announced that an inquest would be held into the causes of Talitha's death; they requested that Paul Jr. submit to an interview. Getty was afraid that his continued drug use would lead to arrest and prosecution, so he fled Italy for the UK in February, and never returned. Talitha Getty died within the same 12-month period as Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, Edie Sedgwick and, as noted, Jim Morrison, other cultural icons of the 1960s. Her friend Brian Jones of the Rolling Stones, with whom she had spent time in Marrakesh, had predeceased Hendrix by a little over a year.Getty was slightly older than Morrison and Joplin who were later cited as members of the \\"27 Club\\" of stars who died at that age. Others included Brian Jones of the Rolling Stones in 1969 and Amy Winehouse in 2011, when the 27 Club received renewed attention in the media. Sedgwick was 28 when she died.

Since the pressure increase of the vapor also generates an increase in the condensation temperature, the same vapor can serve as the heating medium for its \\"mother\\" liquid or solution being concentrated, from which the vapor was generated to begin with. If no compression was provided, the vapor would be at the same temperature as the boiling liquid/solution, and no heat transfer could take place. It is also sometimes called vapor compression distillation (VCD). If compression is performed by a mechanically driven compressor or blower, this evaporation process is usually referred to as MVR (mechanical vapor recompression). In case of compression performed by high pressure motive steam ejectors, the process is usually called thermocompression or steam compression. MVR process =Energy input= In this case the energy input to the system lies in the pumping energy of the compressor. The theoretical energy consumption will be equal to E=Q*(H2-H1), where * E is the total theoretical pumping energy * Q is the mass of vapors passing through the compressor * H1, H2 are the total heat content of unit mass of vapors, respectively upstream and downstream the compressor. In SI units, these are respectively measured in kJ, kg and kJ/kg. The actual energy input will be greater than the theoretical value and will depend on the efficiency of the system, which is usually between 30% and 60%. For example, suppose the theoretical energy input is 300 kJ and the efficiency is 30%. The actual energy input would be 300 x 100/30 = 1,000 kJ. In a large unit, the compression power is between 35 and 45 kW per metric ton of compressed vapors. =Equipment for MVR evaporators= The compressor is necessarily the core of the unit. Compressors used for this application are usually of the centrifugal type, or positive displacement units such as the Roots blowers, similar to the (much smaller) Roots type supercharger. Very large units (evaporation capacity 100 metric tons per hour or more) sometimes use Axial-flow compressors. The compression work will deliver the steam superheated if compared to the theoretical pressure/temperature equilibrium. For this reason, the vast majority of MVR units feature a desuperheater between the compressor and the main heat exchanger. Thermocompression =Energy input= The energy input is here given by the energy of a quantity of steam (motive steam), at a pressure higher than those of both the inlet and the outlet vapors. The quantity of compressed vapors is therefore higher than the inlet : Qd = Qs + Qm Where Qd is the steam quantity at ejector delivery, Qs at ejector suction and Qm is the motive steam quantity. For this reason, a thermocompression evaporator often features a vapor condenser, due to the possible excess of steam necessary for the compression if compared with the steam required to evaporate the solution. The quantity Qm of motive steam per unit suction quantity is a function of both the motive ratio of motive steam pressure vs. suction pressure and the compression ratio of delivery pressure vs. suction pressure. In principle, the higher the compression ratio and the lower the motive ratio the higher will be the specific motive steam consumption, i. e. the less efficient the energy balance. =Thermocompression equipment= The heart of any thermocompression evaporator is clearly the steam ejector, exhaustively described in the relevant page. The size of the other pieces of equipment, such as the main heat exchanger, the vapor head, etc. (see evaporator for details), is governed by the evaporation process. Comparison These two compression-type evaporators have different fields of application, although they do sometimes overlap. * An MVR unit will be preferable for a large unit, thanks to the reduced energy consumption. The largest single body MVR evaporator built (1968, by Whiting Co., later Swenson Evaporator Co., Harvey, Ill. in Cir√≤ Marina, Italy) was a salt crystallizer, evaporating approximately 400 metric tons per hour of water, featuring an axial-flow compressor (Brown Boveri, later ABB). This unit was transformed around 1990 to become the first effect of a multiple effect evaporator. MVR evaporators with 10 tons or more evaporating capacity are common. * The compression ratio in a MVR unit does not usually exceed 1.8. At a compression ratio of 1.8, if the evaporation is performed at atmospheric pressure (0.101 MPa), the condensation pressure after compression will be 0.101 x 1.8 = 0.1818 [MPa]. At this pressure, the condensation temperature of the water vapor at the heat exchanger will be 390 K. Taking into account the boiling point elevation of the salt water we wish to evaporate (8 K for a saturated salt solution), this leaves a temperature difference of less than 8 K at the heat exchanger. A small ‚àÜT leads to slow heat transfer, meaning that we will need a very large heating surface to transfer the required heat. Axial-flow and Roots compressor may reach slightly higher compression ratios. * Thermocompression evaporators may reach higher compression ratios - at a cost. A compression ratio of 2 is possible (and sometimes more) but unless the motive steam is at a reasonably high pressure (say, 16 bar g - 250 psig - or more), the motive steam consumption will be in the range of 2 kg per kg of suction vapors. A higher compression ratio means a smaller heat exchanger, and a reduced investment cost. Moreover, a compressor is an expensive machine, while an ejector is much simpler and cheap. As a conclusion, MVR machines are used in large, energy-efficient units, while thermocompression units tend to limit their use to small units, where energy consumption is not a big issue. Efficiency The efficiency and feasibility of this process depends on the efficiency of the compressing device (e.g., blower, compressor or steam ejector) and the heat transfer coefficient attained in the heat exchanger contacting the condensing vapor and the boiling \\"mother\\" solution/liquid. Theoretically, if the resulting condensate is subcooled, this process could allow full recovery of the latent heat of vaporization that would otherwise be lost if the vapor, rather than the condensate, was the final product; therefore, this method of evaporation is very energy efficient. The evaporation process may be solely driven by the mechanical work provided by the compressing device. Some uses =Clean water production (Water for injection)= A vapor-compression evaporator, like most evaporators, can make reasonably clean water from any water source. In a salt crystallizer, for example, a typical analysis of the resulting condensate shows a typical content of residual salt not higher than 50 ppm or, in terms of electrical conductance, not higher than 10 ŒºS/cm. This results in a drinkable water, if the other sanitary requirements are fulfilled. While this cannot compete in the marketplace with reverse osmosis or demineralization, vapor compression chiefly differs from these thanks to its ability to make clean water from saturated or even crystallizing brines with total dissolved solids (TDS) up to 650 g/L. The other two technologies can make clean water from sources no higher in TDS than approximately 35 g/L. For economic reasons evaporators are seldom operated on low-TDS water sources. Those applications are filled by reverse osmosis. The already brackish water which enters a typical evaporator is concentrated further. The increased dissolved solids act to increase the boiling point well beyond that of pure water. Seawater with a TDS of approximately 30 g/L exhibits a boiling point elevation of less than 1 K but saturated sodium chloride solution at 360 g/L has a boiling point elevation of about 7 K. This boiling point elevation represents a challenge for vapor- compression evaporation in that it increases the pressure ratio that the steam compressor must attain to effect vaporization. Since boiling point elevation determines the pressure ratio in the compressor, it is the main overall factor in operating costs. =Steam-assisted gravity drainage= The technology used today to extract bitumen from the Athabasca oil sands is the water-intensive steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) method. In the late 1990s former nuclear engineer Bill Heins of General Electric Company's RCC Thermal Products conceived an evaporator technology called falling film or mechanical vapor compression evaporation. In 1999 and 2002 Petro-Canada's MacKay River facility was the first to install 1999 and 2002 GE SAGD zero-liquid discharge (ZLD) systems using a combination of the new evaporative technology and crystallizer system in which all the water was recycled and only solids were discharged off site. This new evaporative technology began to replace older water treatment techniques employed by SAGD facilities which involved the use of warm lime softening to remove silica and magnesium and weak acid cation ion exchange used to remove calcium. The vapor-compression evaporation process replaced the once-through steam generators (OTSG) traditionally used for steam production. OTSG generally ran on natural gas which in 2008 had become increasingly valuable. The water quality of evaporators is four times better which is needed for the drum boilers. The evaporators, when coupled with standard drum boilers, produce steam which is more \\"reliable, less costly to operate, and less water-intensive.\\" By 2008 about 85 per cent of SAGD facilities in the Alberta oil sands had adopted evaporative technology. \\"SAGD, unlike other thermal processes such as cyclic steam stimulation (CSS), requires 100 per cent quality steam.\\" See also * Cristiani compressed steam system * Slingshot (water vapor distillation system) * Vapor-compression refrigeration References Category:Evaporators Category:Chemical processes Category:Unit operations Category:Water treatment Category:Water technology ","title":"Vapor-compression evaporation"},{"id":"5634657","text":"The National Piers Society (NPS) is a registered charity in the United Kingdom dedicated to promoting and sustaining interest in the preservation and continued enjoyment of seaside piers.

One of the largest national parks in Georgia, Borjomi- Kharagauli National Park includes six municipalities - Borjomi, Kharagauli, Akhaltsikhe, Adigeni, Khashuri and Baghdati - stretching from the resort of Borjomi to the town of Kharagauli. Together with adjacent Borjomi Nature Reserve, the total area is 851 square kilometres, i.e. more than 1 % of the total territory of Georgia. The park was founded in 1995 and officially inaugurated in 2001. Its particular uniqueness is diversity of geographical and ecological zones, landscapes, historical monuments and rich flora and fauna. The park has rapidly developing tourist infrastructure.Borjomi- Kharagauli National Park Administration History Borjomi-Kharagauli National Park The history of the park dates back to Medieval times when it was used primarily by the local aristocracy for hunting. When Georgia lost its independence and became part of the Russian Empire, the Grand Duke Michael Nicolaievich was given the post of Governor General of Transcaucasia. He found the local beauty of the Borjomi park so impressive he decided to build his personal summer residence there. Noticeable changes to the park came when the Grand Duke Michael restricted any lumbering or hunting without permission, thus laying the foundation for the park's future. In 1995, the Borjomi- Kharagauli National Park was endorsed and created with the support of the World Wildlife Fund and the German government, and was officially inaugurated in 2001. Environmental Concerns Borjomi-Kharagauli National Park near resort Borjomi. The Baku‚ÄìTbilisi‚ÄìCeyhan pipeline skirts the edge of this National Park and crosses its watershed. The decision to run the BTC Pipeline near this pristine region drew considerable ire from environmental groups who allege that a leak could disrupt the Borjomi ecosystem. These groups also point out that the area is a source of frequent landslides that could increase the chance of a breach of the pipeline. They also allege that simply building a pipeline in this region will have a negative effect on sales of Borjomi mineral water.

This statute provides the framework by which a new city may become incorporated and provide for its own government by adopting a city charter. It also provides for the method by which an existing city may amend or revise its city charter. History Local units of government in the United States are created by the various states. Such local governments may go by various names in the several states. It is entirely possible for a state to totally abolish any or all local units of government. In the case of Michigan, the state government is specifically restricted under the state's constitution as to how it may interact with local governments and may not alter the boundaries of a local government without a vote by the affected residents. The Home Rule City Act resulted from the provisions of the 1908 state constitution, which called for home rule authority to be conferred upon the various local governments in the state. The 1963 state constitution retained these same home rule provisions. Both constitutions recognized the fundamental integrity of counties, townships, cities, and villages in Michigan. Local governments could no longer be created, abolished, or consolidated without the consent of the electors who reside within the affected territory. Prior to this time, local governments had been created by a special act of the legislature which did not require any consent from those living within the affected territory. Under Michigan‚Äôs Revised Statutes of 1848, there were several classes of cities, the primary distinction among which was population. In nearly every case, however, it was the legislature that had provided a city charter for each city that mandated how each city was to be governed and how its officers were to be chosen. Under the Home Rule City Act, each city was given the ability to make changes to its city charter on its own. The charters that had been previously granted by the legislature continued in force until such time as an affected city took this action. All cities in Michigan are now classified under one class, namely, Home Rule Cities, regardless of the source or origin of the various provisions of their respective city charters. Revising or amending a city charter Under the Home Rule City Act, a city can amend its city charter by a vote of the electors residing within the city. An amendment can be proposed either by the governing body of the city, typically called the city council, or by an initiative petition signed by a certain number of registered voters. A revision of a city charter is a more comprehensive process which replaces the existing charter with a new one. The decision to revise a city charter must be approved by the voters of the city and can be proposed by the city council or by an initiative petition. A special commission is elected to conduct the work of writing a new charter and submitting it to the voters for approval. The commission is not bound to keep any provisions of the current city charter. Provisions of the act The Home Rule City Act specifies certain requirements that every city must contain within its city charter. At the same time, the Act provides for numerous optional charter provisions. In general, any power that is not specifically prohibited by another law for a city to exercise may be included in a city‚Äôs charter.

It appeared no later than the 16th century. The name dates from the 19th century, from \\"coille,\\" derived from cailler (to curdle), referring to milk left after cream extraction (resulting in a lower fat content). Production Traditionally, cancoillote is produced when metton cheese is melted over a small flame, with a little water or milk, and salt or butter added before serving. Sometimes garlic is added as well. Recently there are commercial versions with wine, cumin or other additions. Cancoillotte is typically sold in quantities averaging 200 grams. While cancoillote made from melting pure metton with a bit of water is almost fat- and calorie-free (therefore good for diets, as it can be a good source of calcium without the fat), commercial versions are higher in fat and calories due to the butter added to make it sweeter and softer. On the other hand, the texture of cancoillote varies between pure melted metton and commercial versions. Melted metton is much stickier than the commercial versions.

Centered around the junction of Interstate 45 and Texas State Highway Beltway 8 near George Bush Intercontinental Airport, the area is a classic example of a planned edge city. The initial retail and office development centered around Greenspoint Mall was a project of the Friendswood Development Company during the 1970s and early 1980s.Bivins, Ralph. \\"Exxon mulls move to Greenspoint site.\\" Houston Chronicle. Wednesday December 13, 1989. Business 3. Retrieved on August 3, 2009. Greenspoint is one of Houston's major business districts, with of office space. The district's 2,880 companies host a workforce of nearly 50,000 people. Major flooding events along Greens Bayou, which bisects the district, have put additional pressure on the area's large low-income population; nearly half of Greenspoint residents have an income of under $25,000 per year, well below the Houston median of over $44,000 per year. In order to create new infrastructure, boost public services (particularly safety), and spearhead urban planning, the Texas Legislature created the North Houston District in 1991. This special government entity is bounded by the Hardy Toll Road to the east, Airtex Boulevard to the north, Veterans Memorial Drive to the west, and West Road to the south.\\"Boundary Map .\\" (Full map ) Greenspoint Management District. Retrieved on May 19, 2009. Geography Greenspoint is located at the junction of two major regional highways, Interstate 45 (the North Freeway) and Texas State Highway Beltway 8. The district is only west of George Bush Intercontinental Airport (IAH). The district is straddled by Greens Bayou, a major tributary of Buffalo Bayou which flows from west to east. The bayou was extensively channelized in the 1970s to improve drainage from the then-new airport; however, rapid development within its environs has compromised its ability to handle high-volume rainfall events. Over Construction also overwhelmed the bayou with uncontrolled sewage overflows in the 1970s and 1980s, and the waterway continues to struggle with water quality issues. In 2005, the Houston‚ÄìGalveston Area Council identified Greenspoint as one of the most hazardous communities in Houston for pedestrians.Wall, Lucas, Bill Murphy, and Rosanna Ruiz. \\"Suburbs often are hazardous to walkers / Two recent deaths point to lack of protection for pedestrians.\\" Houston Chronicle. March 29, 2005. A1.  Demographics  The Greater Greenspoint super neighborhood, as defined by the City of Houston, had an estimated population of 42,569 people in 2012. There were 13,859 households, of which 9,235 were family households. Greenspoint is overwhelmingly majority minority. The population is 5% non-Hispanic white, 29% non-Hispanic black, 66% Hispanic, and 1% Asian. In the 2000 Census, the district was 10% non-Hispanic white, 34% non-Hispanic black, 53% Hispanic, 2% Asian, and 1% other. Greenspoint's proportion of black and Hispanic people is significantly greater than that for Houston as a whole; the city was 26% non-Hispanic white, 23% non-Hispanic black, and 44% Hispanic in 2012. Since the 1980s, the proportion of families in Greenspoint has dramatically increased. In 2012, there were 13,859 households, of which 9,235 were family households. Between 1990 and 2010, the number of people under the age of 18 in Greenspoint increased nearly sixfold, indicating the departure of young professionals and their replacement with low-income families in the area's apartment complexes. The proportion of Greenspoint residents under 5 years of age is nearly double the city of Houston's. The Greenspoint area's median household income is significantly lower than the City of Houston's ‚Äì $26,823 versus $44,648 in 2012. Greenspoint's median household income declined slightly between 2000 and 2012 despite a 22% increase in the city's overall median household income during the same period. A plurality (48%) of Greenspoint's residents make less than $25,000 per year. Greenspoint's population has lower levels of educational attainment than the city of Houston as a whole. Only 6% of Greenspoint residents had a bachelor's degree or higher in 2012, compared with 29% of Houston residents. Conversely, 45% of Greenspoint residents have no high school diploma, compared with only 25% of Houstonians overall. History Suburban development first arrived in the area with the construction of Greenspoint Mall by development firm Federated Stores Realty in 1976. By contemporary standards, the mall was state-of-the- art, with the interior designed to mimic an urban streetscape with extensive natural lighting and organic landscaping. Early tenants included Foley's, Montgomery Ward, and Lord & Taylor. The arrival of the mall and its modern suburban amenities catalyzed a wave of development on the greenfield land surrounding it. In 1978, Friendswood Development Company, a subsidiary of oil giant Exxon, purchased hundreds of acres around the mall for the construction of what the Texas Observer described as a \\"world-class suburban business district, a hub for the corporate jet set.\\" The master plan included 5,000 apartment units and eight interconnected office towers. The onset of the 1980s oil glut in the middle of the decade harshly affected Exxon, which cut its workforce by 40%. Greenspoint, faced with a glut of residential and commercial development, quickly lost its luxury appeal and price point. Greenspoint Mall became the apex of a growing crime problem, and by the middle of the decade, motor vehicle theft was endemic to its large surface parking lot. Crime problems in the Mall climaxed with the abduction and murder of Harris County Sheriff's deputy Roxyann Allee at the mall in 1991. After frequent robberies in the parking lot and the infamous murder of deputy Roxyann Allee the mall was nicknamed \\"Gunspoint.\\" In 1998, Goldman Sachs purchased 24 Greenspoint- area apartment complexes, totaling of rentable space, for over $130 million. 15 of those complexes were extensively renovated and merged into a large development known as \\"CityView\\", designed to appeal to higher-income young professionals. Since 2000, Greenspoint has suffered from multiple catastrophic flooding events, largely due to the presence of multiple high-density apartment complexes within the floodplain of Greens Bayou. The bayou overtopped its banks in 2001 (Tropical Storm Allison), 2002, 2003, 2016 (\\"Tax Day\\" floods), and 2017 (Hurricane Harvey). Three-quarters of the district's multi-family housing is located within a floodplain. After Hurricane Katrina struck New Orleans, Louisiana in 2005, large groups of evacuees settled into apartment complexes in the area. In 2017, Greenspoint Mall entered into a contract for sale to an international investment group which seeks to replace the ailing complex with mixed-use development. Despite the overwhelming support from the development company and city council, the locals in the North Houston District strongly opposed the redevelopment of Greenspoint Mall in an effort to save their \\"mall\\". This is one of many occurrences in the past three decades where locals in the North Houston District have stalled development efforts. By 2020 Amazon had established a warehouse in Greenspoint. R.A. Schuetz of the Houston Chronicle stated that a \\"revival\\" in Greenspoint was occurring. In 2019 Florian Martin of Houston Public Media reported that year that the \\"Gunspoint\\" nickname was still in use and that despite an increase in development and a decline in the crime rate, that \\"It‚Äôs Not Quite Houston‚Äôs New Hotspot Just Yet\\".

Following the completion of a comprehensive new corporate campus in Spring, ExxonMobil withdrew completely from Greenspoint, abandoning approximately of office space during the mid-2010s. This move severely impacted the district's office market, which saw its office occupancy rate plummet to 60% in 2015, making it the worst-performing office submarket in Greater Houston. Prior to its move, ExxonMobil had consolidated a variety of departments into the district, including computer operations and exploration. The corporation's investment in Greenspoint had been so substantial that it was responsible for the construction of an entire eight-story office building, Greenspoint Eight, in the mid-1990s. ExxonMobil's presence expanded further in the 2000s, when it leased additional space and spent millions of dollars on infrastructure improvements.Sarnoff, Nancy. \\"ExxonMobil may be frontrunner for Enron Center South building.\\" Houston Business Journal.

It has loose slabs of rough bark near the base of its trunk, smooth pale grey bark above, lance-shaped to egg-shaped adult leaves, flower buds in groups of three, white flowers and barrel-shaped or cylindrical fruit. It is only known in the wild from a few small populations but has been widely planted as an ornamental. Description Eucalyptus morrisbyi is a tree that typically grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. It has smooth, pale greyish, or brown bark, often with slabs of loose rough bark near the base of the trunk. Young plants and coppice regrowth have more or less round, sessile leaves that are glaucous, long, wide arranged in opposite pairs and with usually wavy edges. Adult leaves are lance-shaped to egg-shaped or elliptical, the same shade of dull bluish green to glaucous on both sides, long and wide, tapering to a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged in groups of three in leaf axils on an unbranched peduncle long, the individual buds sessile or on pedicels up to long. Mature buds are pear-shaped to oval, long and wide with a conical to beaked operculum. Flowering occurs in most months, peaking from January to April, and the flowers are white. The fruit is a woody barrel-shaped or cylindrical capsule long and wide with the valves below rim level. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus morrisbyi was first formally described in 1939 by Robert Brett in Papers and Proceedings of the Royal Society of Tasmania. Brett did not give a reason for the specific epithet (morrisbyi) but noted that \\"J. R. Morrisby\\" had planted an avenue of this species. John Robert Morrisby (1832‚Äì1923) gathered seed of the species and planted the species on a farm near Sandford that was still the home of a Morrisby family in 1978. Eucalyptus morrisbyi belongs in the subgenus Symphyomyrtus, section Maidenaria, section Orbiculares. Distribution and habitat Morrisby's gum grows in dry woodland, mostly in gullies between hilly slopes, and mostly in relatively pure stands. It is only known from the wild in the Cremorne area, in two populations on the eastern shore of the River Derwent. Conservation status This eucalypt is unlikely to go extinct because of ornamental plantings, but there is a continuing decline in wild populations. The species is listed as \\"endangered\\" under the Australian Federal Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 and the Tasmanian Government Threatened Species Protection Act 1995. The total population is estimated to number fewer than 2,500 mature plants in no more than five locations. The main threats to the species in the wild include land clearing, climate change, browsing by mammals such as possums, insect browsing, especially by the autumn gum moth (Mnesampela privata), competition, including by the native vine, Cassytha pubescens and introduced weeds including serrated tussock (Nassella trichotoma) and inappropriate fire regimes.

The song was performed second on the night, following Iceland's Birgitta with \\"Open Your Heart\\" and preceding Ireland's Mickey Harte with \\"We've Got the World\\". At the close of voting, it had received 101 points, placing 6th in a field of 26. The song is intended as a sendup of the contest (much in the vein of a previous Austrian entry - Schmetterlinge's Boom Boom Boomerang) and its excesses. Lyrically, it is about farmyard animals and their habits, but also features a number of non sequiturs about Adam and Eve and \\"the African dromedary\\". The thick accent in which the song is delivered also adds to the humour, as even a native German speaker may find it hard to follow the lyrics at times. Musically, the song switches tempo from a simple folk melody during the verse to a singalong chorus before featuring loud guitar chords (to which Poier famously danced in his performance), after which the lyrics record Poier grunting in the manner of a rock star. The performance itself is also memorable, as the animals mentioned in the song were present - in cardboard cut-out form - on stage playing various instruments.

The reservoir was constructed between 1898 and 1904, and is now managed by Yorkshire Water. Fed by the Little Don or Porter River, it is around a mile long, and supplies water for Sheffield and Barnsley via the Langsett Treatment Works.  Construction and statistics  Construction of the reservoir began in 1898, the logistics of getting the workforce and materials to Langsett caused great difficulty as most of them came up from Sheffield. This involved a journey over four different stretches of railway line, the first leg was from Sheffield Midland Station to Deepcar, this was followed by a journey to Stocksbridge on the Samuel Fox and Company private line. From the Samuel Fox steelworks a new one mile long line was built to reach the Underbank Reservoir to join up with the Water Authority track up to Langsett Reservoir.\\"History Of Langsett\\", Jack Branston, (1986) Gives details of construction and reservoir statistics. The reservoir is 125 acres (51 hectares) in area with a depth of 97 feet and has a holding capacity of 1,408 million gallons, making it the largest of the water supply reservoirs in the immediate Sheffield district. The catchment area is the Langsett Moors to the west and this covers an area of 5,203 acres (2,105 hectares). The embankment is 1,156 feet (352 metres) long with a height of 117 feet (35 metres) from the bottom of the old river bed. The embankment is 720 feet (219 metres) wide at the bottom tapering to 36 feet (11 metres) at the top and contains 900,000 cubic yards of infill in the puddle wall and concrete trench, making it one of the largest earth embankments in Great Britain. The minor road (Midhope Cliff Lane) which runs across the embankment is thought to be the longest single carriageway of any reservoir in Great Britain. The embankment road has a sharp bend in it as it joins the A616 main road, this was a last minute change in construction plans, as keeping it straight would have meant the demolition of the Waggon and Horses public house. The reservoir was completed in 1904 when Alderman T.R. Gainsford closed the valve in the Langsett tower and the reservoir started to fill up, he was then presented with a golden key by the engineer William Watts. Local depopulation was used in the early part of the twentieth century to improve the water purity, and six farms were abandoned these included Brookhouse farm and North America farm, the last farmer left around 1907. The ruins of North America remain to the south-west of the reservoir even though it was used for target practice during the Second World War.Information boards at reservoir give details of farms. In 1962 conifers were planted around the reservoir as shown on the map, with the aim of providing a habitat for many species of indigenous wildlife. This plantation is called Langsett Woods. In recent years the woods have been restructured with most of the coniferous trees being felled and being replaced by oak and birch trees in an effort to create a new upland oak woodland. In 2007 a pond was created near Brookhouse Bridge at the western end of the reservoir to help dragonflies, frogs, newts and toads establish new colonies.Information boards at reservoir give details of wildlife and woodland. The Pennine peaks of Pike Lowe (478 m) and Hingcliff Common (358 m) lie to the south and south-west of the reservoir, respectively. The area is used for sheep farming and grouse shooting, and it is popular with walkers, mountain bikers and bird watchers with treecreepers, woodpeckers and owls to be seen in the vicinity.Peak District Education Gives details of reservoir and treatment works. = Langsett water treatment works = The present day Langsett water treatment works were built to replace the older works at Midhope and Langsett reservoirs. The older works used sand filter beds to treat the water, although the water was safe to drink, the sand filters had never been able to remove the brown colouration caused by rainwater falling on the surrounding peat moorland. After much complaining from consumers, it was decided in 1980 to build a completely new treatment works. South Yorkshire Water Authority gave permission in December 1981 to build the works in an old quarry adjacent to the reservoir wall. Worked started in 1983 with water from the new works going into the supply system in July 1986. The works clarify the water by the addition of chemicals before the filtration stage to bring it up to the latest EU standards. The works can produce 60,000 cubic metres (60 million litres) of water per day. In 2017 a ¬£20 million scheme was announced by Yorkshire Water to upgrade the treatment works to further improve the discolouration and remove deposits from the raw water collected from the moors around the reservoir. The work began in September 2017 and will take three years to complete.Yorkshire Water Details improvement to treatment works started in 2017.

History The proposal for a pier was first mooted at the end of 1863, and highly favoured by the town's major landowner, the seventh Duke of Devonshire. It was to have been 1000 feet in length and, at a cost of ¬£12,000, would have been situated at the end of the town's grandest avenue, Devonshire Place. However, the project was delayed and finally abandoned in favour of the present site at the junction of Grand and Marine Parades, thus creating the easterly end of what amounts to a shingle bay. The pier interrupts what would otherwise have been a ribbon development of buildings ‚Äì to the west, high-class hotels, with modest family hotels and boarding houses to the east. The Eastbourne Pier Company was registered in April 1865 with a capital of ¬£15,000 and on 18 April 1866 work began. It was opened by Lord Edward Cavendish on 13 June 1870, although it was not actually completed until two years later.Fire rips through Eastbourne Pier, BBC News, 30 July 2014 On New Year's Day 1877 the landward half was swept away in a storm. It was rebuilt at a higher level, creating a drop towards the end of the pier. The pier is effectively built on stilts that rest in cups on the sea-bed allowing the whole structure to move during rough weather. It is roughly 300 metres (1000 ft) long. A domed 400-seater pavilion was constructed at a cost of ¬£250 at the seaward end in 1888. A 1000-seater theatre, bar, camera obscura and office suite replaced this in 1899/1901. At the same time, two saloons were built midway along the pier. The camera obscura fell into disuse in the 1960s but was restored in 2003 with a new stairway built to provide access. Eastbourne Pier (June 2018) Paddle steamers (such as the PS Brighton Queen and the PS Devonia) operated by P and A Campbell ran trips from the pier along the south coast and across the Channel to Boulogne from 1906 until the outbreak of the Second World War. These were resumed after the war, but the paddle steamers were gradually withdrawn from service. In 1957, the final season was operated by a motor vessel. During the Second World War, part of the decking was removed and machine guns were installed in the theatre providing a useful point from which to repel any attempted enemy landings and a Bofors anti-aircraft gun was sited midway along the length of the pier. In December 1942, an exploding mine caused considerable damage to the pier and nearby hotels; it had been tied to the stanchions by the local police, who were under the mistaken impression that it was fitted with a safety device. In 1943, a detachment of Royal Canadian Engineers fixed camouflage netting over the stanchions to conceal flotillas of small vessels, such as wooden assault landing craft. A George Medal and a British Empire Medal were awarded to two of the engineers who dived into the sea on 3 February 1943 to rescue a comrade who had fallen from a cableway which crossed a 30-foot gap in the structure. Various traditional pier theatres were built over the years but after the last one was destroyed by fire in 1970, it was replaced by a nightclub and bar which remain to this day. On the landward half of the pier stands a fish and chip kiosk, an amusement arcade and a fast food outlet. Further out, as well as the club there is a cafe, a restaurant, a glassblower, a clothes shop and an ice cream shop. The tower at the end of the pier is often used as a viewing point during the annual air show. For more than a decade, the pier played host to the town's annual Birdman competition, which saw competitors jump into the sea in home-made costumes to see who could 'fly' the furthest. In May 2009, the listed building status of the pier was upgraded from Grade II to Grade II*.Culture Six Piers Limited placed Eastbourne Pier up for sale in 2009, with an asking price of ¬£5.5 million. The sale price included a tea room, two bars, an amusement arcade and a nightclub. On 21 October 2015, Abid Gulzar, a local hotelier, bought the pier for an undisclosed price, although it is believed to be less than ¬£5.5 million. Fire The pier suffered a fire on 30 July 2014 that ripped through a large amount of the central domed building. Sussex Police initially said that the fire was not to be treated suspiciously, though later the police said arson was suspected. East Sussex Fire & Rescue Service deployed up to 80 officers to tackle the blaze, which allegedly started in wood panelling in the walls of the games arcade. After fighting the fire through the night, fire officers eliminated the main hotspots and saved two-thirds of the pier with the main arcade being the only large building affected. The outer pavilion was not reached by the fire, which came just two weeks before Eastbourne's largest tourist event on the seafront, the airshow Airbourne. A few days after the airshow, a workman on the pier fell through the destroyed part and died hours later. In popular culture The pier appears in the Agatha Christie's Poirot episode \\"Jewel Robbery at the Grand Metropolitan\\" (although ostensibly, the story is located in Brighton) and in \\"Curtain: Poirot's Last Case\\". It was also featured in the 2001 film Last Orders and the 2008 film Angus, Thongs and Perfect Snogging. The 2010 film Brighton Rock used Eastbourne Pier to stand in for Brighton's Palace Pier. Eastbourne Town FC supporters club \\"Pier Pressure\\" are named in homage to the pier.

At the time of the purchase, Post-Newsweek Stations (owners of Detroit NBC affiliate WDIV-TV, channel 4) owned the Detroit-based Pro-Am Sports System (PASS Sports), which served the local affiliate of the Prime Network. News Corporation announced plans to launch a Fox Sports Net affiliate in Michigan by 1998, and made a surprise bid for, and won, the local cable television rights to NBA games involving the Detroit Pistons. When PASS Sports' respective National Hockey League and Major League Baseball broadcast rights to the Detroit Red Wings and Detroit Tigers franchises came up for renewal, Fox Sports Net made a bid for the contracts and won them both. Fox Sports decided to push the launch date of the new channel forward in time for the beginning of the 1997‚Äì98 NHL season and 1998 MLB season; Fox Sports Detroit began broadcasting on September 17, 1997. Post-Newsweek, meanwhile, concluded that its coverage area was not large enough to support two RSNs and sold the remainder of its Tigers and Pistons contracts, and the contract of sportscaster John Keating, to Fox Sports Detroit. Post-Newsweek shut down PASS Sports on October 31, 1997, leaving Fox Sports Detroit as the sole regional sports network in Michigan. =Studios= From its launch until January 16, 2008, Fox Sports Detroit broadcast its studio shows out of FSN Northwest's facilities in Bellevue, Washington. On October 1, 2009, the network unveiled a new all-digital high definition-capable studio in its Southfield headquarters dubbed the \\"Call Sam Studio\\", named after its sponsor, the Sam Bernstein Law Firm. It serves as the production base of the pre-game/post-game shows Tigers Live, Pistons Live and Red Wings Live, as well the magazine shows of all three teams and all of the channel's other local programming. It was expected that 80% of the shows produced from the studio would be produced and broadcast in HD. The first program to originate from the new studio was Wingspan, a special previewing the 2009‚Äì10 Red Wings season, on October 1. =Tigers, Pistons and Red Wings switch to cable full-time= The channel shared professional team coverage rights with some Detroit area broadcast television stations until the spring of 2008. In March 2008, the channel signed new long-term contracts with the Pistons, Red Wings and Tigers to broadcast more games than in previous years, becoming the exclusive local home of all three teams for the first time until at least 2018. This leaves only the NFL's Detroit Lions as the only local professional sports team in Detroit to have all of its games on broadcast television. =Detroit Lions= On May 21, 2015, the Detroit Lions announced a multi-year broadcast partnership with Fox Sports Detroit and WJBK (Fox 2). Fox Sports Detroit produces the preseason game broadcasts with Fox 2 producing the pre-game and post-game segments. The games air live on Fox 2 and the rest of the Detroit Lions Television Network, with re-airings on Fox Sports Detroit. Fox Sports Detroit also airs Lions Live after regular season games, and Monday head coach press conferences. =New ownership= On December 14, 2017, as part of a merger between both companies, The Walt Disney Company announced plans to acquire all 22 regional Fox Sports networks from 21st Century Fox, including Fox Sports Detroit. However, on June 27, 2018, the Justice Department ordered their divestment under antitrust grounds, citing Disney's ownership of ESPN Inc. On May 3, 2019, Sinclair Broadcast Group and Entertainment Studios (through their joint venture, Diamond Sports Group) bought Fox Sports Networks from The Walt Disney Company for $10.6 billion. The deal closed on August 22, 2019.

Alfred Edersheim (7 March 1825 - 16 March 1889) was a Jewish convert to Christianity and a Biblical scholar known especially for his book The Life and Times of Jesus the Messiah (1883).  Early life and education  Edersheim was born in Vienna of Jewish parents of culture and wealth. English was spoken in their home, and he became fluent at an early age. He was educated at a local gymnasium and also in the Talmud and Torah at a Hebrew school, and in 1841 he entered the University of Vienna. His father suffered illness and financial reversals before Alfred could complete his university education, and he had to support himself.  Conversion and Christian ministry  Edersheim emigrated to Hungary and became a teacher of languages. He converted to Christianity in Pest when he came under the influence of John Duncan, a Free Church of Scotland chaplain to workmen engaged in constructing a bridge over the Danube. Edersheim accompanied Duncan on his return to Scotland and studied theology at New College, Edinburgh, and at the University of Berlin. In 1846 Alfred was married to Mary Broomfield. They had seven children. In the same year he was ordained to the ministry in the Free Church of Scotland. He was a missionary to the Jews at Ia≈üi, Romania, for a year. On his return to Scotland, after preaching for a time in Aberdeen, Edersheim was appointed in 1849 to minister at the Free Church, Old Aberdeen. In 1861 health problems forced him to resign and the Church of St. Andrew was built for him at Torquay. In 1867/8 he cared for the Rev Prof Robert Lee in his home, for the final months of Lee's life.http://www.churchservicesociety.org/sites/default/files/journals/1969-27.pdf In 1872 Edersheim's health again obliged him to retire, and for four years he lived quietly at Bournemouth. In 1875, he was ordained in the Church of England, and was Curate of the Abbey Church, Christchurch, Hants, for a year, and from 1876 to 1882 Vicar of Loders, Bridport, Dorset. He was appointed to the post of Warburtonian Lecturer at Lincoln's Inn 1880-84. In 1882 he resigned and relocated to Oxford. He was Select Preacher to the University 1884-85 and Grinfield Lecturer on the Septuagint 1886-88 and 1888-89. Edersheim was an advocate of gap creationism.McIver, Thomas Allen. (1989).

The expansion of the ancient village of Savyolovo at the beginning of the 20th century was due to the opening there in 1900 of a railway station on a new direct line to Moscow.

At the close of voting, it had received 30 points, placing 21st in the 25-strong field - thus missing out on the final and ensuring that Austria will have to qualify through the semi-final at their next Contest appearance.

In this type of biological interaction, the growth of one partner depends on the nutrients, growth factors, or substrates provided by the other partner. Jan Dolfing describes syntrophy as \\"the critical interdependency between producer and consumer\\". This term for nutritional interdependence is often used in microbiology to describe this symbiotic relationship between bacterial species.Microbiology, by Prescott, Harley & Klein 6th editionHenderson's Dictionary of Biology, by Eleanor Lawrence, 14th edition Morris et al. have described the process as \\"obligately mutualistic metabolism\\".  Microbial syntrophy  Syntrophy plays an important role in a large number of microbial processes. The defining feature of ruminants, such as cows and goats, is a stomach called a rumen. The rumen contains billions of microbes, many of which are syntrophic. One excellent example of this syntrophy is interspecies hydrogen transfer. Some anaerobic fermenting microbes in the rumen (and other gastrointestinal tracts) are capable of degrading organic matter to short chain fatty acids, and hydrogen. The accumulating hydrogen inhibits the microbe's ability to continue degrading organic matter, but syntrophic hydrogen-consuming microbes allow continued growth by metabolizing the waste products. In addition, fermentative bacteria gain maximum energy yield when protons are used as electron acceptor with concurrent H2 production. Hydrogen-consuming organisms include methanogens, sulfate-reducers, acetogens, and others. Some fermentation products, such as fatty acids longer than two carbon atoms, alcohols longer than one carbon atom, and branched-chain and aromatic fatty acids, cannot directly be used in methanogenesis. In acetogenesis process, these products are oxidized to acetate and H2 by obligated proton reducing bacteria in syntrophic relationship with methanogenic archaea as low H2 partial pressure is essential for acetogenic reactions to be thermodynamically favorable (ŒîG < 0). The number of bacterial cells that live on or in the human body, for example throughout the alimentary canal and on the skin, is in the region of 10 times the total number of human cells in it.Crazy Way Microbes Colonize, Control The Human Body interview with Dr. Justin Sonnenburg, assistant professor of microbiology and immunology at Stanford University School of Medicine These microbes are vital, for instance for the digestive and the immune system to function.Microbes and the human body The Microbiology Society online Another example is the many organisms that feed on faeces or dung. A cow diet consists mainly of grass, the cellulose of which is transformed into lipids by micro-organisms in the cow's large intestine. These micro-organisms cannot use the lipids because of lack of oxygen in the intestine, so the cow does not take up all lipids produced. When the processed grass leaves the intestine as dung and comes into open air, many organisms, such as the dung beetle, feed on it. Yet another example is the community of micro-organisms in soil that live off leaf litter. Leaves typically last one year and are then replaced by new ones. These micro-organisms mineralize the discarded leaves and release nutrients that are taken up by the plant. Such relationships are called reciprocal syntrophy because the plant lives off the products of micro- organisms. Many symbiotic relationships are based on syntrophy. = Biodegradation of pollutants = Syntrophic microbial food webs can play an integral role in the breakdown of organic pollutants such as oils, aromatic compounds, and amino acids. Environmental contamination with oil is of high ecological importance, but can be mediated through syntrophic degradation. Alkanes are hydrocarbon chains that are the major chemical component of crude oils, and have been experimentally verified to be broken down by syntrophic microbial food webs. The hydrocarbons of the oil are broken down after activation by fumarate, a chemical compound that is regenerated by other microorganisms. Without regeneration, the microbes degrading the oil would eventually run out of fumarate and the process would cease. This breakdown is crucial in the processes of bioremediation and global carbon cycling. Syntrophic microbial communities are key players in the breakdown of aromatic compounds, which are common pollutants. The degradation of aromatic benzoate to methane produces many intermediate compounds such as formate, acetate, and H2. The build up of these products makes benzoate degradation progressively less favourable. These intermediates can then be taken up and metabolized syntrophically by methanogens to make the whole process more thermodynamically favourable. Studies have shown that bacterial degradation of amino acids can be significantly enhanced through the process of syntrophy. Microbes growing poorly on amino acid substrates alanine, aspartate, serine, leucine, valine, and glycine can have their rate of growth dramatically increased by syntrophic H2 scavengers. These scavengers, like Methanospirillum and Acetobacterium, metabolize the H2 waste produced during amino acid breakdown, preventing a toxic build-up. Another way to improve amino acid breakdown is through interspecies electron transfer mediated by formate. Species like Desulfovibrio employ this method. Metabolic mechanism The main motive behind a syntrophic relation between two bacterial organisms is generalized as a relationship where each participant's metabolic activity cannot independently overcome the thermodynamic pressure of the reaction under standard conditions even when a cosubstrate or nutrient is added into the environment. Therefore, the cooperation of the other participant is required to reduce the intermediate pool size. The Methanobacillus omelianskii culture is a classic example in demonstrating how two separate unfavourable reactions can be carried out by syntrophic interactions. Organism S and organism M.o.H of Methanobacillus omelianskii oxidize ethanol into acetate and methane by a process called interspecies hydrogen transfer. Individuals of organism S are observed as obligate anaerobic bacteria that use ethanol as an electron donor, whereas M.o.H (Methanobacterium bryantii strain M.o.H) are methanogens that oxidize hydrogen gas to produce methane. These two metabolic reactions can be shown as follows: :Organism S: 2 CH3CH2OH + 2 H2O ‚Üí 2 CH3COO‚àí \\\\+ 2 H+ \\\\+ 4 H2 (ŒîG¬∞' = +19 kJ) :Strain M.o.H.: 4 H2 \\\\+ ‚Üí CH4 \\\\+ 2 H2O (ŒîG¬∞' = -131 kJ) Complex organic compounds such as ethanol, propionate, butyrate, and lactate cannot be directly used as substrates for methanogenesis by methanogens. On the other hand, fermentation of these organic compounds cannot occur in fermenting microorganisms unless the hydrogen concentration is reduced to a low level by the methanogens. In this case, hydrogen, an electron-carrying compound (mediator) is transported from the fermenting bacteria to the methanogen through a process called mediated interspecies electron transfer (MIET), where the mediator is carried down a concentration gradient created by a thermodynamically favourable coupled redox reaction.

It was one of the several city walls of Paris built between the early Middle Ages and the mid 19th century. It was 24 kilometers long and roughly followed the route now occupied by line 2 and line 6 of the M√©tro. It crossed the districts of the Place de l'√âtoile, Batignolles, Pigalle, Belleville, Nation, the Place d'Italie, Denfert-Rochereau, Montparnasse and the Trocad√©ro. History Unlike earlier walls, the Farmers-General Wall was not intended to defend Paris from invaders but to enforce the payment of a toll on goods entering Paris (\\"octroi\\") to the Ferme g√©n√©rale. The wall's tax-collection function made it very unpopular: a play on words of the time went \\"Le mur murant Paris rend Paris murmurant\\" (\\"The wall walling Paris keeps Paris murmuring\\") There was also an epigram: Architect Claude Nicolas Ledoux designed its 62 toll barriers in a neo-classical or even classical style.Citizens, Simon Schama, Penguin 1989 p.236 The architecture of the buildings, \\"dens of the Tax Department metamorphosed into palaces with columns\\" according to Louis- S√©bastien Mercier, highlighted the oppression which the wall represented for Parisians. The wall was bordered by a boulevards outside and a chemin de ronde (a raised protected walkway) inside, except between the barri√®re d'Italie (now the Place d'Italie) and the barri√®re d‚ÄôEnfer (now the Place Denfert-Rochereau) where Gobelins, Saint-Jacques and d'Enfer replaced the chemin de ronde inside the wall. In 1787, Lom√©nie de Brienne, Minister for Finance, worried about the very high cost of the construction and considered stopping the work but never actually did so because it was so far advanced. The toll on goods was abolished on 1 May 1791 in the early stages of the French Revolution, but was restored in 1798 by the French Directory. Public perception of the tolls improved under Napoleon. The majority of the toll barriers were destroyed during the expansion of Paris in 1860. At the same time the octroi that had been collected at the wall was abolished. Current remains Some portions of the wall still exist, such as the rotunda of the Barrier of La Villette (now Place de Stalingrad), the Barri√®re du Tr√¥ne (now Place de la Nation), the Barri√®re d'Enfer (now Place Denfert-Rochereau), and the rotunda of Parc Monceau.

It is the most abundantly available raw material on the Earth for the production of biofuels, mainly bio-ethanol. It is composed of carbohydrate polymers (cellulose, hemicellulose), and an aromatic polymer (lignin). These carbohydrate polymers contain different sugar monomers (six and five carbon sugars) and they are tightly bound to lignin. Lignocellulosic biomass can be broadly classified into virgin biomass, waste biomass and energy crops. Virgin biomass includes all naturally occurring terrestrial plants such as trees, bushes and grass. Waste biomass is produced as a low value byproduct of various industrial sectors such as agriculture (corn stover, sugarcane bagasse, straw etc.) and forestry (saw mill and paper mill discards). Energy crops are crops with high yield of lignocellulosic biomass produced to serve as a raw material for production of second generation biofuel; examples include switch grass(Panicum virgatum) and Elephant grass. Dedicated energy crops Many crops are of interest for their ability to provide high yields of biomass and can be harvested multiple times each year. These include poplar trees and Miscanthus giganteus. The premier energy crop is sugarcane, which is a source of the readily fermentable sucrose and the lignocellulosic by-product bagasse. Application =Pulp and paper industry= Lignocellulosic biomass is the feedstock for the pulp and paper industry. This energy-intensive industry focuses on the separation of the lignin and cellulosic fractions of the biomass. =Biofuels= Lignocellulosic biomass, in the form of wood fuel, has a long history as a source of energy. Since the middle of the 20th century, the interest of biomass as a precursor to liquid fuels has increased. To be specific, the fermentation of lignocellulosic biomass to ethanol is an attractive route to fuels that supplements the fossil fuels. Biomass can be a carbon-neutral source of energy in the long run. However depending on the source of biomass, it will not be carbon neutral in the short term. For instance if the biomass is derived from trees, the time period to regrow the tree (on the order of decades) will see a net increase in carbon dioxide in the earth‚Äôs atmosphere upon the combustion of lignocellulosic ethanol. However, if woody material from annual crop residue is used, the fuel could be considered carbon-neutral. Aside from ethanol, many other lignocellulose- derived fuels are of potential interest, including butanol, dimethylfuran, and gamma-Valerolactone.Barbara A. Tokay \\"Biomass Chemicals\\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2002, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. One barrier to the production of ethanol from biomass is that the sugars necessary for fermentation are trapped inside the lignocellulose. Lignocellulose has evolved to resist degradation and to confer hydrolytic stability and structural robustness to the cell walls of the plants. This robustness or \\"recalcitrance\\" is attributable to the crosslinking between the polysaccharides (cellulose and hemicellulose) and the lignin via ester and ether linkages. Ester linkages arise between oxidized sugars, the uronic acids, and the phenols and phenylpropanols functionalities of the lignin. To extract the fermentable sugars, one must first disconnect the celluloses from the lignin, and then use acid or enzymatic methods to hydrolyze the newly freed celluloses to break them down into simple monosaccharides. Another challenge to biomass fermentation is the high percentage of pentoses in the hemicellulose, such as xylose, or wood sugar. Unlike hexoses such as glucose, pentoses are difficult to ferment. The problems presented by the lignin and hemicellulose fractions are the foci of much contemporary research. A large sector of research into the exploitation of lignocellulosic biomass as a feedstock for bio-ethanol focuses particularly on the fungus Trichoderma reesei, known for its cellulolytic abilities. Multiple avenues are being explored including the design of an optimised cocktail of cellulases and hemicellulases isolated from T. reesei, as well as genetic-engineering-based strain improvement to allow the fungus to simply be placed in the presence of lignocellulosic biomass and break down the matter into D-glucose monomers. Strain improvement methods have led to strains capable of producing significantly more cellulases than the original QM6a isolate; certain industrial strains are known to produce up to 100g of cellulase per litre of fungus, thus allowing for maximal extraction of sugars from lignocellulosic biomass. These sugars can then be fermented, leading to bio-ethanol. =Biocomposites= Lignocellulosic biomasses are gaining attention also in the production of biocomposites materials such as particle panels, wood-plastic composites, and cement/geopolymer wood composites. Even though the production of biocomposites material rely mostly on wood resources, in less forest-covered countries or in countries where wood resources are already being overused, it is possible to utilize alternative sources of biomass such as invasive plants, agricultural and sawmills residues for the creation of new \\"green\\" composites. Biocomposites produced with lignocellulosic biomasses as alternative to conventional materials, are attracting the attention because are renewable and cheaper but also because they fit perfectly into the policy of the \\"cascade utilization\\" of the resources.

Its construction was completed in 1861 and was initially used by the Wodeyars, kings of Mysore as their home (when the present Mysore Palace (Amba Vilas Palace) was under construction after the previous palace burned down). It is now used as an art gallery and a function hall. The palace is one of the seven palaces of the royal city of Mysore. History The Jaganmohan Palace was constructed in 1861 by the king Krishnaraja Wodeyar III as an alternate retreat for the royal family. The Mysore Palace, which was the original home of the royal family was burnt down in a fire and the construction of a new palace in its place was started in 1897. Till the new palace was completed in 1912, the Jaganmohan Palace was used by the royals as their home. In 1902, the king Rajarshi Nalvadi Krishnaraja Wodeyar was installed to the Mysore throne, in a ceremony that took place in a pavilion inside the Jaganmohan Palace. This ceremony was attended by Lord Curzon, the then Viceroy and Governor General of India. The palace was used for his daily durbar by the king and also the special Dasara durbar during the dasara period. In 1915, the palace was converted into an art gallery, which was later renamed in 1955 in the name of HH Jayachamarajendra Wodeyar, as the Sri Jayachamarajendra Art Gallery . The early convocations of the Mysore University were also held in this palace. The first session of the Legislative Council of the Mysore state was held here in July 1907. The Legislative Council was then called as the Representative Council and was presided over by the Diwan (Prime Minister of the state). HH Jayachamarajendra Wodeyar converted the palace into a trust and opened it for public viewing. Architecture Jaganmohan Art Gallery The palace is built in traditional Hindu style and has three stories. In 1900, an external facade with a hall behind it was added to the palace. This facade has three entrances and the entablature has religious motifs and miniature temples crafted on it. This mural is the earliest known picture of the Mysore Dasara and has been painted using vegetable dyes. A family tree of the Wodeyars tracing the lineage of the royal family is also painted on a wall. Two wooden displaying Dashavatara, the ten incarnations of the Hindu God, Vishnu is also present in the palace. Art Gallery The art gallery contains one of the largest collections of artifacts in South India. Most of these artefacts are paintings, prominent among which are those by Raja Ravi Varma, some of which demonstrate scenes from the Hindu epics, Ramayana and Mahabharatha. The collection of paintings in the gallery exceed 2000 in number and these belong to different Indian styles of painting like Mysore, Mughal and Shantiniketan. 16 paintings of Raja Ravi Varma were donated to the gallery by Jayachamarajendra Wodeyar. Another important painting present here is the Lady with the lamp which was painted by the artist Haldenkar and is placed in a dark room where it is the only exhibit. This is to give an illusion that the glow of the lamp is illuminating the face of the woman. Some other painters whose works are exhibited here include Nikolai Roerich, Svetoslav Roerich and Rabindranath Tagore and Abanindranath Tagore. There are beautiful paintings by the Ukil brothers -Sharada Ukil, Ranada Ukil and Barada Ukil. Another collection of paintings by a British Army Officer named Col. Scot on the wars between Tipu Sultan and the British army are said to be the only visual representation of the wars. Other exhibits here include weapons of war, musical instruments, sculptures, brassware, antique coins, and currencies. Some other unique artefacts exhibited here is a French clock which has a mechanism in which a parade of miniature soldiers is displayed every hour; beating drums mark the seconds and a bugle marks the minute. Paintings made on a grain of rice which can be viewed only through a magnifier are also displayed here. =Restoration= Temple Office near Jagmohan Palace A new hall was built in 2003 because there was insufficient space available to exhibit all the paintings. The original paintings of Raja Ravi Varma which are over 100 years old are being restored by the Regional Conservation Laboratory (RCL). Syrendri (which had a hole in the canvas), Victory of Meganath and Malabar Lady were some of the paintings of Ravi Varma to be restored. Unscientific stretching of the canvas on which the paintings were drawn was one of the major problems noticed including unprotected exposure to dust, heat and light. Even the murals on the walls had been damaged because of water seepage and these were also restored by RCL. Despite what is mentioned here regarding the restoration of these paintings, recent visits to the Jaganmohan Palace suggest gross neglect. These priceless paintings are ill maintained and incompetently restored. For example, in the painting of Ravana slaying, Jatayu by Raja Ravi Varma the colors used to restore the painting are different from the ones used in the original painting. The painting is also torn and ridden with holes at the bottom. One can only understand the tragic plight of this extremely powerful painting when one visits the palace. Painting the walls of this room has also resulted in damage to the paintings, with the paint from the walls dripping on the uncovered paintings. These paintings which are already in very bad condition are further affected by the abysmally poor lighting and humidity conditions. The painting of the lady holding the lamp by Haldenkar is also poorly exhibited. The windows are covered by a moldy cloth to supposedly give the effect of \\"shade\\" which only ends up ruining the effect due to the poor lighting in the first place. This palace and its contents especially the Ravi Verma paintings are in dire need of attention and very poorly managed. Auditorium Jaganmohan palace also has an auditorium which is used for traditional dance performances, music festivals and other cultural programs mainly during the period of dasara.

When viewed as a whole, it appears to be one image, when in fact the image is made up of hundreds or even thousands of smaller images. When viewed at low magnifications, the individual pixels appear as the primary image, while close examination reveals that the image is in fact made up of many hundreds or thousands of smaller images. Most of the time they are a computer-created type of montage. There are two kinds of mosaic, depending on how the matching is done. In the simpler kind, each part of the target image is averaged down to a single color. Each of the library images is also reduced to a single color. Each part of the target image is then replaced with one from the library where these colors are as similar as possible. In effect, the target image is reduced in resolution (by downsampling), and then each of the resulting pixels is replaced with an image whose average color matches that pixel. In the more advanced kind of photographic mosaic, the target image is not downsampled, and the matching is done by comparing each pixel in the rectangle to the corresponding pixel from each library image. The rectangle in the target is then replaced with the library image that minimizes the total difference. This requires much more computation than the simple kind, but the results can be much better since the pixel-by-pixel matching can preserve the resolution of the target image. Originally, the term photomosaic referred to compound photographs created by stitching together a series of adjacent pictures of a scene. Space scientists have been assembling mosaics of this kind since at least as early as the Soviet satellite missions to the Moon in the late 1950s. The name Photomosaic and an implementation concept were trademarked by Robert Silvers' Runaway Technology, Inc. History 1993 Live from Bell Labs event poster * 1993 Joseph Francis, working for R/Greenberg Associates in Manhattan, is believed to be the inventor of the modern-day computer-generated colour image versions. His Live from Bell Labs poster created in 1993 used computer- themed tile photographs to create a mosaic of a face (Ryszard Horowitz/ Photography and Art Direction, Robert Bowen/ Digital Artist). He went on to create a mosaic for Animation Magazine in 1993, which was repeated in Wired Magazine (November 1994, p. 106). Francis has said on his \\"History of Photo Mosaics\\" webpage that his interest in developing these techniques further was in part stimulated by the work of artist Chuck Close. * 1994 Dave McKean creates an image for DC Comics, a mosaic of a face made from photos of faces, although this is believed to be created manually using Photoshop. * 1994 Adam Finkelstein and Sandy Farrier create a mosaic of John F. Kennedy from parts of Marilyn Monroe pictures. The result was displayed in the Xerox PARC Algorithmic Art Show in 1994. * 1994 Benetton: AIDS - Faces mosaic. Over one thousand young peoples' portraits from all over the word computer-processed spell out the word AIDS. * 1995 The Gioconda Sapiens, a face with ten thousand faces, was presented to the public in April 1995 (Spain, Domus museum). This was the first large photographic mosaic, using photographs of 10,062 people from 110 countries to make the Mona Lisa. * 1995 Adam Finkelstein (published mosaic in Mossy Bits) creates a mosaic of the oil painting American Gothic from images collected from the Web in early 1995. * 1995 Robert Silvers creates an algorithm for generating Photomosaics programmatically and goes on to trademark the term Photomosaic and patent his process for creation of Photomosaics in 1997. Artistic aspects There is debate over whether Photomosaics are an art or mere technique.Silvers (2000) quote: \\"More than anything else people ask me whether Photomosaics are an art or a science. l tell them that Photomosaics, like any art in formative stage, has elements of both.\\" The making of a photomosaic is sometimes parallelled and compared to forms of artistic appropriation, like literary assemblage.Menke (2008) p.232 quote: [In Rudyard Kipling's 1902 science- fiction short story \\"Wireless\\"] we recognize that the tale's marshalling of realistic particulars has also been a systematic importation of details from Keats's poetry and life history [...] The tale's elaborate descriptions were really Keats's pre-scriptions all along. As in a photomosaic image, the elements of the story that make it seem recognizable and real turn out to be chosen from an artificially constrained palette of appropriations; examined closely, each realistic detail reveals itself as a micro-quotation from that collection. Artists such as David Hockney, Christopher Kates and Pep Ventosa have pioneered their own photographic mosaic techniques where multiple photographs are taken of a scene and then pieced together again to create a cohesive image. Trademark and intellectual property of the concept Robert Silvers, a Master's student at MIT, filed for a trademark on the term Photomosaic on September 3, 1996. This trademark was registered on August 12, 2003. Silvers also applied for a U.S. patent on the production of Photomosaics on January 2, 1997, which was granted as in October 2000 and has been assigned to Runaway Technology, Inc. Patent applications in other countries were also filed, and patents granted include , , , and . He is quoted as saying: \\"By being granted this patent in the United States and other countries, we can protect our proprietary innovations and continue to make unique artwork.\\" In September 2008, the Public Patent Foundation filed a formal request with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) to review certain claims in the on photomosaics. The request was granted and a reexamination proceeding ensued. On August 31, 2010, the USPTO issued a Reexamination Certificate confirming the patentability of all claims in the patent which were amended to refer to shape matching (a feature that contributes to the high resolution of photomosaics). There are a number of other commercial companies that create mosaics with photos. Since there has been no litigation of these patents, these companies must therefore either use processes that do not infringe on the particular claimed process, have licenses under the patents, or are infringing those patents but Runaway Technology has chosen not to bring infringement proceedings. Silvers' patent may be regarded as a software patent, a subject over which there is a great deal of debate. For example, states that \\"programs for computers as such\\" are not regarded as patentable inventions. Nevertheless, current practice relating to computer-implemented inventions under the EPC means that a process that provides a technical effect may be patented even if it is implemented by a computer. The UK patent deriving from became the subject of revocation proceedings in July 2006.Using the UK Patents Status Enquiry for EP0852363 provides full details on the current status of the patent. In September 2009, the UK Intellectual Property Office (UK-IPO) decided that the patent should not be revoked and terminated the proceeding. The European patents expired on 31 December 2017. Video mosaic Photographic mosaics are typically formed from a collection of still images. A more recent phenomenon, however, has been video mosaics which assemble video clips rather than still images to create a larger image. The closing credits of the 2005 PlayStation 2 game God of War, for example, incorporates a still image of the main character, Kratos, formed from a number of in-game videos. The term \\"video mosaic\\" also describes a large still image made from adjacent frames of video, such as those from video shots of geographic features like roads or cities. A mosaic of the video's relevant frames replaces the full video, saving time and bandwidth, since the stills are much smaller.

Description The original MegaPixel Display was a monochrome 17\\" monitor displaying 4 brightness levels (black, dark gray, light gray and white) in a fixed resolution of 1120 x 832 at 92 DPI (just shy of a true Megapixel at 931,840 total pixels) at 68 Hz. It integrated a mono microphone, mono speaker, stereo RCA sockets, a 3.5mm headphone socket and a socket for the keyboard (which in turn provided a socket for the mouse). A unique feature was that the monitor was connected to the computer by a single 6 foot cable which provided power, video signals and the aforementioned signals. A severe problem with this setup was that the monitor could not be switched off completely while the computer was powered on. The screen could be switched black but the cathode heater always remained on. This led to extreme screen dimming after some years of use, especially when the computer was not turned off overnight as in a server setup or in a busy software lab. This problem was later rectified with the now ultra rare 4000A model rated at 10,000 hours (~14 months) The display has a stand that allows it to be tilted. The stand also features two rollers that can be used to move the monitor back and forth despite its heavy weight. The stand also provides a place for the keyboard when not in use, freeing up the (real) desktop in front.

The New York Yankees selected him in the 1997 Major League Baseball (MLB) draft from Florida State University. Choate made his MLB debut for the Yankees in 2000, and also pitched for the Arizona Diamondbacks, Tampa Bay Rays, Florida/Miami Marlins, Los Angeles Dodgers, and St. Louis Cardinals. He won the 2000 World Series with the Yankees, beating the New York Mets. As a left-handed relief pitcher, Choate appeared mainly in matchups against left-handed hitters. His pitching style featured a sidearm- delivery style that hid the ball effectively from left-handed hitters, while only marginally so against right-handed hitters. His repertoire featured almost exclusively a sinking fastball and slider combination. Early life and amateur career Choate was born in San Antonio, Texas. He attended Churchill High School in San Antonio, and was a letterman in baseball. He then attended Florida State University, where he was a third team College All-American in 1996 and a second team College All-American and Atlantic Coast Conference All- Star in 1997. In 1996, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Hyannis Mets of the Cape Cod Baseball League. Professional career =Draft and minor leagues (1997‚Äì2000)= Choate was drafted by the New York Yankees in the fifth round of the 1997 Major League Baseball draft and made his professional debut with the Class-A Oneonta Yankees later that season. He split 1998 between the Greensboro Bats and the Tampa Yankees and spent all of 1999 with Tampa before being promoted to the Triple-A Columbus Clippers in 2000. =New York Yankees (2000‚Äì03)= Choate made his Major League debut on July 1, 2000, as a member of the New York Yankees, retiring the only batter he faced in a 6‚Äì1 win over the Tampa Bay Devil Rays at Tropicana Field. In his 22 games for the Yankees that year, Choate had a record of 0‚Äì1 with a 4.76 ERA, and was a part of the World Series-winning club. After a career best 3‚Äì1 record with 3.35 ERA in 2001, he was less effective in 2002 and 2003, playing in just 23 games with a 6.23 ERA. He also spent considerable time in the minors with Columbus. =Arizona Diamondbacks (2004‚Äì07)= The Yankees traded Choate to the Montreal Expos with Nick Johnson and Juan Rivera for Javier V√°zquez on December 16, 2003. The following March 27, the Expos then traded him to the Arizona Diamondbacks for pitcher John Patterson. Choate appeared in 74 games for the Diamondbacks, the most games by a left-handed pitcher in Diamondbacks history and the fourth-highest by any pitcher in franchise history. He also achieved a 2‚Äì4 record with a 4.62 ERA. In 2005 and 2006, Choate played in 90 games. However, he played a vast majority of the 2006 season with Arizona's Triple-A affiliate, the Tucson Sidewinders, playing a key role in the bullpen, by helping them win the Pacific Coast League championship. Choate later signed a minor league contract with the Minnesota Twins on January 9, 2007, but chose to become a free agent on March 24 after being reassigned to a minor league camp three days earlier. He signed a minor league contract to return to the Diamondbacks in April 2007, and was assigned to Tucson. The Diamondbacks purchased his contract from Tucson on June 26, 2007, but he made only two appearances before he was designated for assignment on June 28. =Milwaukee Brewers (2008)= On November 14, 2007, the Milwaukee Brewers signed him to a one-year contract. During spring training 2008, Choate broke a bone in his left hand.Wagner, Andrew. \\"Brewers Notebook: Changing things up.\\" OnMilwaukee.com. 16 June 2008. 19 June 2008. In mid-June, he began his rehab assignment in the minors. He pitched for the first time in the 2008 season for the High-A Brevard County Manatees. He was next moved up to the Triple-A Nashville Sounds. On July 10, Choate was sent outright to the minors. He became a free agent at the end of the season. =Tampa Bay Rays (2009‚Äì10)= Choate signed a minor league contract with the Tampa Bay Rays on January 6, 2009. He earned his first career save on May 29, 2009, against the Minnesota Twins. In 2010, Choate led the American League in appearances with 85 while pitching a total of innings. In two seasons with the Rays, he was 5‚Äì3 with a 3.89 ERA in 146 games. In a span of 97 consecutive appearances from September 10, 2010, to June 12, 2012, Choate allowed one or zero hits each time. =Florida/Miami Marlins (2011‚Äì12)= Choate with the Marlins in spring training, 2011 On December 15, 2010, Choate agreed to a two-year, $2.5 million deal with the Florida Marlins. He was 1‚Äì1 with a 2.16 ERA in 98 games over the next season and a half with the Marlins. Between April 25 and June 13, 2011, Choate did not allow a hit in 20 consecutive appearances, surpassing the record set by Mike Myers 11 years earlier and setting a record which still stands . =Los Angeles Dodgers (2012)= Choate was traded along with Hanley Ram√≠rez to the Los Angeles Dodgers on July 25, 2012, in exchange for Nathan Eovaldi and minor league pitcher Scott McGough. With the Dodgers, he appeared in 36 games and had a 4.05 ERA in innings. His combined totals for the season with the Marlins and Dodgers included 80 appearances, leading MLB, and IP, making him the only player in MLB history with at least 80 appearances and less than 40 IP in a season. =St. Louis Cardinals (2013‚Äì15)= Randy Choate at Opening Day for the St. Louis Cardinals, 2013 On December 7, 2012, Choate signed a three-year, $7.5 million contract with the St. Louis Cardinals. On May 20, 2015, he drew a walk as a hitter for the first time in his career against the New York Mets. He earned his first save with the club in a 1‚Äì0 victory over the Atlanta Braves on July 25, 2015, getting A. J. Pierzynski to ground into a game-ending double play. He became a free agent again when his contract expired after the 2015 season. =Toronto Blue Jays= On March 11, 2016, Choate signed a minor league contract with the Toronto Blue Jays. He was released on March 29. =Second Stint with Dodgers= On June 12, 2016, Choate signed a minor league deal with the Los Angeles Dodgers. In 24 games for the AAA Oklahoma City Dodgers, he had a 5.56 ERA. He was released on September 1, 2016. =Retirement= On February 16, 2017, Choate announced his retirement. Pitching style Featuring a sidearm-delivery style with a repertoire of almost exclusively sinking fastballs and sliders, one of Choate's strengths was inducing ground balls from left-handed hitters with runners on base, especially for double plays. In 2011, Choate's sinker induced a ground ball rate of 71.4%. His slider had broad side-to-side movement, inducing a 19.5% swing-and-miss rate. In 2011 and 2012, he produced 11.31 and 8.84 strikeouts per 9 innings pitched (K/9) rates, respectively, despite his fastball speeds average just to .

Biography In 1881 in B√ºrmoos near Salzburg he used the legal estate of a former glassworks company that went bankrupt four years earlier and he bought a giant moor area. He expanded the factory with four glass ovens, which worked with turf. He also founded a brickyard, which was very successful and which existed throughout the 1970s. Bit by bit he then bought further moor areas in the neighboring Weidmoos and at Ibmer moor, where he also started to cultivate hops. In the middle of the Ibmer area, in Hackenbuch, Upper Austria, he established another glass factory. The turf factory was very unstable because it depended on the weather a lot and the turf supplies drew to a close. Thus Glaser bought a closed sugar factory in North Bohemian Bruex and established a new glass factory. In that factory ovens were heated with coal from an open pit, which made the company independent from weather conditions. After Glaser‚Äôs death in 1916, his son Dr. Hermann Glaser, born on August 18, 1889, took over the glass factory, which experienced a short economic boom after World War I. But then the company missed the update to mechanical flat glass fabrication and the Glaser empire broke down in 1926. In B√ºrmoos, flat glass was produced by a company named Stiassny until the end of 1929, which then bought the holdings. At this point glass fabrication was shut down totally. Eighty percent of the population there was unemployed. Glaser‚Äôs grave is in the Jewish cemetery in Salzburg‚ÄìAigen. His son survived the Holocaust in Shanghai and died on January 10, 1956 in Vienna. In 2006 the first Ignaz-Glaser-Symposium organized by Andreas Maislinger with a focus on integration took place.

The Marvel Universe hosts a number of demons, many of whom are at times at conflict with gods and angels. All possess varying degrees of mystical power, feed upon souls for self-sustenance, and are inclined towards black magic. Demonic origins During the era in which the first single- celled organism formed on Earth, Demiurge achieved consciousness after being formed and coalesced from the Earth's biosphere. As conditions on Earth began to support life, it became aware, and wanting to know itself, the Demiurge split itself into countless aspects, each of which wanted consciousness and to manifest into new entities. These entities later become known as the \\"Elder Gods\\". Most of the Elder Gods later degenerated into demons including: * Belathauzer * Chthon * Set * The Gibborim However, certain demons, such as Lucifer, Kazann and Asmodeus, have other origins, such as originally being angels having fallen from Heaven after a massive failed insurrection against the Judeo-Christian God long before the dawn of humanity, or hailing from other mystical dimensions adjacent to Earth. It is also not uncommon for various gods worshipped throughout Earth's history to degenerate into demonic beings, though the distinction between gods who have degenerated into demons and gods who are merely malevolent is often unclear. For example, during the Fear Itself story arc, Cul Borson, elder brother of Odin, is the Asgardian God of Fear and uses the terror experienced by mortals to restore his youth and vitality, and to gain cosmic levels of power, but he is not classified as a demon or having degenerated from godhood into a demonic existence. However, gods who typically use the life force of other beings, either through personal offerings or as some type of sacrifice, to sustain their powers are usually classified as having degenerated into demons. Aside from the various Elder Gods of the distant past, certain members of various modern pantheons have degenerated into demons. For instance, a large number of the Annunaki are now demonic including Ba'al, Nergal, Ningal and Dagon. Within Marvel's depictions, demons are often hindered by various and very specific rules, rules that not even entities as powerful as Mephisto or Satannish are able to break. While some of them, using Mephisto or Satannish as examples again, have vast powers on a cosmic scale, they are unable to force sentient beings into serving them or making pacts with them; they can use trickery and lies to attain their means, but they cannot physically or mentally force sentient beings into surrendering their souls or otherwise obeying them. They can also use other demons, generally minor underlings, as a means of intimidation or to force sentient beings into serving them. It is possible they can also use other humans to intimidate or force others into their service, counting on ignorance of their demonic limitations to serve them. However, this is not often the case as demons are depicted as malevolent beings who derive great pleasure from tricking and outwitting sentient beings, especially humans, into surrendering their souls to them without threats of intimidation. If a being willingly enters into a bargain, the demonic beings must fulfil their part of the bargain, though the outcome is often not exactly as those offering their souls wanted; there are numerous loopholes that demonic beings exploit in order to get what they want while seemingly fulfilling their part of the deal. For instance, if a human offers his/her soul for immortality, demons can grant the request though the term itself may be open to broad interpretation; if a human being endures forever, then the demons cannot collect that person's soul, though there are still ways around this. For instance, while they may become immortal, immortality does not necessarily mean the same as eternal youth; the bargainer may technically live forever though his/her body will continue to age to the point where the person is essentially trapped within a crippled, withered body. Even if the person still held on through the decades until their body was reduced to bone, their soul would still be bound to its earthly remains forever. In such an instance, a being could call out to the demon, or demons, and request the deal be undone, though their soul is forfeit since the demon fulfilled its end of the bargain. Elder Gods The Elder Gods are the forerunners to the modern gods and demons of Earth. Chthon began devoting itself to the study and manipulation of mystical energies, becoming Earth's first master of black magic.Silver Surfer Annual #2 Gaea came into being and was the \\"Protector of the Emerging Life\\" that began in the seas. Set, the \\"God of the Dead\\", spawned a number of offspring (e.g. \\"Sligguth\\" and \\"Damballah \\"). Oshtur was the goddess of the stars and left Earth early on before the fall of the Elder Gods. She mothered Agamotto, the first Sorcerer Supreme; she is the third member of the mystical Vishanti. Realizing he could increase his own power by consuming the essence of his fellow Elder Gods, Set became the first being on Earth to murder another. By consuming the life energies of a fellow Elder God, Set started down the path of degeneracy. Other Elder Gods quickly began following Set's example, killing each other to gain more power. The more they consumed, the more they hungered for power, becoming insatiable. Many became corrupt and began warring to satisfy the thirst for power, the victor feeding off the others. After millions of years, all the Elder Gods except for Gaea had degenerated to less than their Godhood, becoming demonic in nature. Gaea, fearing the Elder Gods' war with each other would destroy the evolving life on the planet, mated with a reincarnation of the Demiurge and gave birth to Atum, who became dedicated to eradicating his forefathers. Foreseeing the threat Atum was to his existence, Chthon inscribed all the mystical knowledge he had learned through millennia of evil onto parchments to be his touchstone within the Earth dimension; these parchments would later be bound into the book known as the Darkhold. Atum indeed became a threat to the Elder Gods, as he began destroying them for their evil and degradation, absorbing their energies into himself. The energies he absorbed caused him to undergo a metamorphosis into the form of the Demogorge the God- Eater. Many of the Elder Gods fell to Atum and those who were not destroyed fled to other dimensions: Chthon, sensing the end was near, cast a spell that allowed him an escape into another dimension before the Demogorge could slay him. Before he left, Chthon left the parchments containing his mystical knowledge in this dimension. Set, witnessing what Chthon had done, replicated the spell, allowing him and his offspring to escape. Gaea was the only original Elder God permitted to exist on the planet, and she infused her godly essence into the Earth and into all living things - ultimately becoming \\"Mother Earth\\". The Demogorge released the energies he had absorbed, reverting to the form of Atum. He then took residence within Earth's Sun. Over millennia, the energies that the Demogorge had released when he reverted into Atum eventually manifested into a number of different beings: (Note: whether Atum fathered the original founders/creators of Earth's pantheons is speculative, as is whether or not Atum is the creator of Earth's pantheons. Similarly, Gaea was said to be the mother of \\"Ouranus.\\") * Nun * Ouranus * Buri, father to a number of different pantheons of \\"New Gods.\\" (Note: it has been implied that the demonic energies released by the Demogorge after destroying most of the degenerated Elder Gods coalesced and gave rise to demons such as Mephisto, Satannish, Thog the Nether-Spawn, Marduk Kurios (a.k.a. Satan), etc.) To fuel his own power, the Elder God Set, from his pocket dimension, began drawing psychic energy from the dinosaurs, the dominant life forms of Earth. Eventually, Set's continued feeding on the dinosaurs helped bring about significant drops in their population. Gaea knew the dinosaurs were at an evolutionary dead end and allowed Set to continue his feeding, knowing that he was quickly depleting his main supply of energy. Set, aware that Gaea was allowing the extinction of the dinosaurs, became infuriated and commanded the dinosaurs to seek out and kill all mammals (which Gaea had selected as Earth's dominant species over the dinosaurs). Gaea sensed Set's command over the dinosaurs and summoned the Elder God. Set appeared on Earth in physical form for the first time as a giant serpent and attacked Gaea. She summoned her son Atum to protect her. Atum (in his form of the Demogorge) engaged Set in battle and destroyed his head. However, Set was not killed and two heads grew back. Set and Atum battled for decades. Many disasters befell the Earth during this time, some caused by the titanic struggle (which brought about the extinction of the dinosaurs in the Marvel Universe). The mammals were sheltered from the devastation by Gaea. Eventually Set, drained of power, was forced to withdraw from the Earth dimension. By this time, Set had grown seven heads to replace the ones destroyed in battle. With his power all but exhausted, Set could no longer journey to the Earth dimension without aid. The Demogorge reverted to Atum and returned to his dwelling place in the Sun. The Nisanti are a race of god-like beings appearing in Marvel's Runaways series and also appearing in Runaways creator Brian K. Vaughan's series, The Hood. Devils Several demonic entities dwell in extra-dimensional realms referred to as Hell, using humans as pawns and subjects; some have claimed to be Satan in order to exploit humanity's belief in a single being of great evil. Their origins are shrouded in mystery - a few are fallen angels or gods who fell out of favor with their pantheons, whereas some are the descendants of degenerate Elder Gods and others were shaped by the subconscious desires of their earliest worshippers. This category also includes messengers and servants who work for these \\"Rulers of Hell\\"; \\"lesser demons\\" that share the same origins as their masters, but are usually less powerful (although still superior to most mortals). =The Hell-lords= Hell is broken into several smaller kingdoms ruled over by entities who are generally at odds with each other. Most of these entities are devils and those considered powerful enough to be the strongest rulers in Hell are referred as the Hell-lords. Those who currently and have previously borne this identification are: * Asmodeus * Aqquoonkagua * Baphomet * Beelzeboul * Belasco * Blackheart * Hela * Daimon Hellstrom * Krampus * Lucifer * Marduk Kurios * Mephisto * Murray * Olivier * Pluto * Satana Hellstrom * Stonecold * Strong Guy - Strong Guy obtains this status via losing his soul during resurrection and ends up working with Mephisto against the other Hell-lords. * Umar * Thog the Nether-Spawn - Thog is a demon from the extra-dimensional realm of Sominus the Dark Domain who has clashed with the Man-Thing.Fear #11, 13; Man-Thing #1, 21, 22, (vol. 2) #11 * Kx'ulthuum * Johnny Blaze * Xuthl Although Hela and Pluto could claim the title of Hell-lords, because they also rule in other nether realms, some readers have referred to them instead as Death-Gods. =Other devils= * Allatou * Azazel * Dagoth * Damballah * the Demogoblin * the Haazareth Three * Hoss * Ikthalon - The embodiment of man's tendency to resist change, and thus represents frozen stagnation. * Inanna, \\"demoness of inspiration and madness\\" * Kazann * Legion * Ludi * Ningal * Saturnine, servant of Asmodeus * S'ym * Zahgurim, \\"armorer to Satan\\" * Zarathos Extra-dimensional entities Some demons seem to be entirely unrelated to Earth and humanity's past - these creatures are often non- humanoid in form and utterly alien in motivation. They are referred to as Class Three Demons in Marvel's Official Handbook. Demons of this sort include: * Lloigoroth * the N'Garai - the N'Garai are a race of demons created by Chthon, and have come into conflict with the Midnight Sons, the Hulk, and the X-Men. The N'Garai are ruled by Kierrok the Damned. * Shuma-Gorath * the Undying Ones * Asteroth Others Several extra-dimensional mystical beings exist in the Marvel Universe (that do not fall into any of the three preceding categories). They are powerful and evil enough to be considered demons. Beings of this sort include evil mortal beings that have attained great power, as well as beings that have been referred to as demons but whose origins have yet to be definitively defined or revealed. They include: * the Adversary * Amatsu-Mikaboshi * the Beast of the Hand * Cobweb, an alien entity hailing from the Mindscape and archenemy of the Sleepwalker. * the Dark-Crawler * Dormammu * the Elementals (Hellfire, Hydron, Magnum, Zephyr) * Helleyes, a demon who fought both Morbius the Living Vampire and the Defenders * Kathulos * Kindred - A human condemned to Hell who became a demon with a personal vendetta against Spider-Man. * Lilith, sometimes called the Mother of All Demons, is an ancient and powerful being. Imprisoned centuries ago by Atlantean sorcerers, she regained her freedom in modern times. * N'Gabthoth is a demon who has clashed with Doctor Strange. He once served as an agent of Shuma-Gorath. * N'astirh * Rangsabb * Russell Daboia, a Serpent Man/demon hybrid * Shazana * Shialmar * Tiboro * Visimajoris * Xander * Zom =The Octessence= The Octessence is made up of eight powerful principalities (Balthakk, Cyttorak, Farallah, Ikonn, Krakkan, Raggadorr, Valtorr and Watoomb), a number of whom are routinely invoked for the power of spells related to their particular area of magical knowledge. Roughly 1,000 years ago, they disagreed on which of them was the most powerful. To settle the question, they entered into the Wager of the Octessence. Each placed a small fraction of its magical might into a token and then established a temple on Earth to house it. The first human to find and touch the artifact would gain the power and lose his will to the artifact's master, becoming an Exemplar: a creature of focused magical might. When all eight Exemplars appeared, they would perform the Ceremony of the Octessence, the construction of a great magical engine to enslave the will of humanity. Then the Exemplars would divide the world into eighths and each would battle the others (using his own powers and armies made of his enslaved one-eighth of the population) until only one remained. The first artifact uncovered was the Crimson Ruby of Cyttorak, which empowered the Juggernaut. Only years later would the other Exemplars appear. * Balthakk first appeared in X-Men #12 (1965). While meeting to establish the terms of the Wager, it appeared as little more than a free- floating cloud of energy or charged particles. It empowered the Blinding Brazier of Balthakk and through it the Exemplar called Inferno. * Cyttorak first appeared in Dr. Strange (vol. 3) #44, published in 1992, nearly 30 years after its first mention in 1964 (Strange Tales (vol. 1) #124). While meeting to establish the terms of the Wager, it appeared as a semblance of Juggernaut but completely covered in armor. It has involved itself in human activities more than other members of the Octessence, perhaps owing to the early discovery of the Ruby of Cyttorak (referred to as the Crimson Crystal of Cyttorak in the Wager storyline, possibly to avoid confusion with the Ringed Ruby of Raggadorr). Cytorrak's gem lent enormous strength and durability to Cain Marko, transforming him into the Juggernaut. It would be years before Marko's purpose as an Exemplar became known, when the other Exemplars appeared. Marko's betrayal of the other Exemplars contributed to their eventual defeat. * Farallah first appeared in Iron Man (vol. 3) #22. While meeting to establish the terms of the Wager, it appeared as a powerful humanoid with ruminant characteristics: short, coarse, dark fur and spiral horns close to the head like those of certain sheep. A large hump similar to that of a dromedary adorned its back, and its hands ended in very sharp nails or claws. It empowered the Fearsome Fist of Farallah, which granted feral combat skills and superhuman speed and coordination to the Exemplar called Carnivore. * Ikonn first appeared in Dr. Strange (vol. 2) #47 (June 1981) and is the creation of Roger Stern and Gene Colan. It is a powerful mystical entity that Doctor Strange and other sorcerers regularly invoke, most often to produce a powerful spell of illusion-crafting called the Images of Ikonn. Ikonn can create extremely believable illusions and has been titled the \\"Lord of Illusions.\\" It can disrupt reality and if it gains control over a world it can make its illusions real. Meeting to establish the terms of the Wager, it appeared as a greyish insectoid/humanoid adorned with dark greenish spikes and pupil-less grey-green eyes. Each limb ended in four radially arranged claws. It had a proboscis where the mouth would normally be. As with any being so powerful, and especially one versed in illusion, one can only speculate as to what Ikonn's real form would be. For the Wager, it invested power into the Ivory Idol of Ikonn, a token that granted Olisa Kabaki powerful telepathic and mind control abilities as the Exemplar Bedlam. * Krakkan first appeared in Iron Man (vol. 3) #22 during the meeting to decide the terms of the Wager, appearing there as a grey armored figure; this armor possessed a number of long and very sharp blades. It crafted the Kestrel Key of Krakkan. In Thor (vol. 2) #17, Bridget Malone found this key and became the Exemplar called Conquest, the \\"living embodiment of battle.\\" * Raggadorr first appeared in Iron Man (vol. 3) #22 (1999). While meeting to establish the terms of the Wager, it appeared as a creature with a four-armed but otherwise humanoid torso and a blue-colored serpentine lower body. Its face remained concealed behind a heavy blue helm from which projected bluish horns similar to those of a ram. Powerful magicians invoke Raggadorr's name to empower certain of their magical spells, most commonly the Rings of Raggadorr. It empowered the Ringed Ruby of Raggadorr and through it the Exemplar called Stonecutter. * Valtorr appeared at the Wager meeting in the form of a greyish, possibly armored snake possessing a crest of slightly raised overlapping plates or scales. Magicians invoke Valtorr in spells to command vapors and gasses. The Vapors of Valtorr create what amounts to a gaseous extension of the magician's will; these vapors have properties that the magician imparts to them during the casting. The Verdant Vial of Valtorr transformed Stark-Fujikawa employee Yoshiro Hashiman into Decay, an Exemplar with the power to corrupt and destroy with his touch. * Watoomb presented itself as an armored humanoid (or possibly a creature bearing natural armor) with aspects both feline and insectoid, in various shades of yellow, orange and brown. A signature spell is the Winds of Watoomb, which can carry a caster across light-years of space and can even pierce dimensional barriers. Watoomb crafted the Wicked Wand of Watoomb, roughly 30 cm from tip to tip. The ends of this device are carved with the visages of demons. This device granted Nicolette Giroux with a portion of Watoomb's power and will, creating Tempest; Dr. Stephen Strange had possessed the device for years prior to this event without transforming into an Exemplar. =The Fear Lords= The Fear Lords consisted of seven demons that conspired to conquer and rule the Earth through fear. They were opposed by Daredevil, Doctor Strange and the Straw Man (who betrayed them). * D'Spayre * the Dweller-in-Darkness * Kkallakku * The Lurking Unknown * Nightmare * Nox * the Straw Man =The Six-Fingered Hand= The Six-Fingered Hand is a fictional organization in the Marvel Universe. The Six-Fingered Hand was a group of six lesser demons acting as pawns of more powerful demons, including Mephisto. The legion of demons once plotted to merge Earth and Hell, but the Defenders successfully opposed their plan. The six are also responsible for the creation of the Lesser Grey God, a statuette that has the power to reactivate old curses. Members * Avarrish, clashed with the Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)/Zarathos. * Fashima, clashed with the Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)/Zarathos. The mother of Asmodeus Jones. * Hyppokri, tried to merge Hell and Earth.Defenders #96 * Puishannt, clashed with Dracula. * Unnthinnk, clashed with (and possessed) the Man-Thing. * Maya, the sixth and final member of the Six Fingered Hand; was actually a disguised Mephisto who manipulated the rest of the group. =The Lords of the Splinter Realms= This loose collection of various demons (but also wizards and sorcerers) was made up of rulers of the various realms of the Netherworld (most prominently Mephisto, Dormammu, Umar, Nightmare, Surtur, Thog the Nether-Spawn, and Pluto). While normally separated from and opposed to each other, they formed a tenuous alliance against the Archenemy at the request of Magik (Amanda Sefton), the then-ruler of Limbo. The Devil's Advocacy The Devil's Advocacy is a location in the neutral realm where the demons and their affiliations discuss matters of importance at the empty throne of Satan, which no one was up to taking the name or mantle. It is an evil counterpart of the Infinite Embassy (which was created by the Living Tribunal as a meeting place of the different gods). The Devil's Advocacy first appeared in the Fear Itself storyline, where the demons and their affiliations meet to discuss the impact of the rise of the Serpent and what this would mean to them. Cyttorak mentions that the Serpent stole the Juggernaut from him, Dormammu remained silent, the demons of Muspelheim did not speak of Surtur's impending release and Marduk Kurios mocked Mephisto, who tolerated it as he was fond of his children. The rest of the meeting was long and did not achieve a united resolution to the threat of the Serpent.Journey Into Mystery #627 In other media * The demons appear in the video game Marvel: Avengers Alliance. Besides Blackheart, Daimon Hellstrom, Dormammu, Mephisto, Satana and Surtur, the demon foot soldiers consist of Auspex, Bellator, Cusptero, Harpe, Incascia, Inves, Meretrix, Nefaralae, Praefectus, Spiculum, Subcintus, Tetrabrach and Verignis. * Hellstrom and Satana appear in the video game Marvel: Future Fight as playable characters.

In large American and Canadian publicly listed corporations, a company secretary is typically named a corporate secretary or secretary. The company secretary is responsible for the efficient administration of a company, particularly with regard to ensuring compliance with statutory and regulatory requirements and for ensuring that decisions of the board of directors are implemented.What is a Company Secretary? Despite the name, the role is not clerical or secretarial. The company secretary ensures that an organisation complies with relevant legislation and regulation, and keeps board members informed of their legal responsibilities. Company secretaries are the company's named representative on legal documents, and it is their responsibility to ensure that the company and its directors operate within the law. It is also their responsibility to register and communicate with shareholders, to ensure that dividends are paid and to maintain company records, such as lists of directors and shareholders, and annual accounts. In many countries, private companies have traditionally been required by law to appoint one person as a company secretary, and this person will also usually be a senior board member. Roles and responsibilities Company secretaries in all sectors have high level responsibilities including governance structures and mechanisms, corporate conduct within an organisation's regulatory environment, board, shareholder and trustee meetings, compliance with legal, regulatory and listing requirements, the training and induction of non-executives and trustees, contact with regulatory and external bodies, reports and circulars to shareholders/trustees, management of employee benefits such as pensions and employee share schemes, insurance administration and organisation, the negotiation of contracts, risk management, property administration and organisation and the interpretation of financial accounts. Company secretaries are the primary source of advice on the conduct of business and this can span everything from legal advice on conflicts of interest, through accounting advice on financial reports, to the development of strategy and corporate planning. Among public companies in North America, providing advice on corporate governance issues is an increasingly important role for corporate secretary. Many shareholders, particularly institutional investors, view sound corporate governance as essential to board and company performance. They are quite vocal in encouraging boards to perform frequent corporate governance reviews and to issue written statements of corporate governance principles. The corporate secretary is usually the executive to assist directors in these efforts, providing information on the practices of other companies, and helping the board to tailor corporate governance principles and practices to fit the board's needs and expectations of investors. In some companies, the role of the corporate secretary as corporate governance adviser has been formalised, with a title such as Chief Governance Officer added to their existing title. In view of the important roles the company secretary plays in business, PLCs and large companies require the company secretary to be suitably trained, experienced and professionally qualified for these responsibilities. In the UK, the company secretary may be qualified by virtue of examination and membership of the Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators (ICSA.), which is the main qualification specifically for company secretaries. ICSA is the body dedicated to the advancement and recognition of professional administration based on a combination of degree-level studies, carefully vetted experience and sponsorship by two people of professional status. Only a person thus qualified is entitled to be designated a 'Chartered Secretary' or 'Chartered Company Secretary'. The Faculty of Secretaries and Administrators founded in 1930 is the second body of corporate secretaries in the United Kingdom and now has a strong emphasis on equality work and governance and its members are designated 'corporate secretaries' or 'certified public secretaries'. It is expected that company secretaries of publicly quoted companies will be professionally qualified through ICSA, one of the chartered professional bodies in the accountancy profession, or have appropriate training and experience through another body. = India = In India, \\"The Institute of Company Secretaries of India\\" (ICSI)Institute of Company Secretaries of India regulates the profession of company secretaries . ICSI is a statutory professional body which has more than 50,000 associate members. Chartered Secretaries are employed as chairs, chief executives and non- executive directors, as well as executives and company secretaries. Some chartered secretaries are also known in their own companies as corporate secretarial executives/managers or corporate secretarial directors. Chartered Secretaries are the sixth highest paid employees in the UK according to the Office for National Statistics Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings (March 2010). Many corporate secretaries of North American public companies are lawyers and some serve as their corporation's general counsel. While this can be helpful in the execution of their duties it can also create ambiguity as to what is legal advice, protected by privilege, and what is business advice. =United Kingdom= Since 8 April 2008 there has been no legal requirement for a private company in the UK to have a company secretary unless the company's articles of association state otherwise.section 270 Companies Act 2006 If a private company doesn't have a company secretary then the company secretarial duties and responsibilities fall upon the directors of the company. With the increase in the number of social enterprises and community interest companies there is often a demand for a company secretary in the voluntary and community sectors as well as ordinary private trading companies. A public company in the UK must still have a formally appointed company secretary.section 271 Companies Act 2006 The exact responsibilities of the company secretary depend on the size and nature of the company and there is no statutory definition of what these are, but it generally includes some or all of the following:Roles and Responsibilities of a company secretary ::* maintaining the company's statutory registers; ::* updating the records held by Companies House; ::* maintaining the company's registered office; ;;* advising the board of directors on their legal and corporate responsibilities and matters of corporate governance; ::* organizing the company‚Äôs board meetings and annual general meeting; ::* minuting board meetings; ::* ensuring company compliance with legal obligations; ::* managing and storing the company's records, e.g. re investments, property, payroll, insurance, accounting, taxation (VAT, PAYE, Corporation Tax); and ::* liaison between the company and its stakeholders and shareholders =Singapore= In Singapore, The Companies Act, Section 171 Companies Act, Section 171 requires that every business has a Company Secretary that must reside in Singapore. The Secretary has to be appointed within the first 6 months after incorporation. If the company has only one director, he or she cannot be the Corporate Secretary. The responsibilities of the Corporate Secretary include the following: * Preparing board meetings and the Annual General Meeting * Filing Annual returns to ACRA * Amendments to the company Constitution * Maintaining statutory registers * Filing updates with ACRA on matters such as changes of company name or address, issue of shares, changes in directors, shareholders, etc. For public companies, the Secretary must be a registered filing agent or a qualified individual. = Bangladesh = = China = In China, every listed company is required to have a board secretary. According to article 124 of 2005 Company Law, every listed company is required to have a secretary to the board of directors. The responsibilities of board secretary include preparing meetings of shareholders and boards of directors, maintaining company records and shareholders information, dealing with information disclosure etc. Relevant listing rules in China further clarify that the secretary of the Board is a managerial position. Such listing rules discuss duties of board secretary in details. According to ‚ÄúSpecial Provisions of the State Council Concerning the Flotation and Listing Abroad of Stocks by Limited Stock Companies‚Äù, ‚ÄúGuidance for the Articles of Listed Company‚Äù, ‚ÄúStock Listing Rules of the Shanghai Stock Exchange‚Äù and ‚ÄúStock Listing Rules of the Shenzhen Stock Exchange‚Äù, the secretary of the Board is classified as the senior management team. From those listing rules, the board secretary, or the secretary of the board of directors, in China is comparable as the company secretary in many other countries. =South Africa= In South Africa, all public and state-owned company must appoint a company secretary. The roles and responsibilities of the company secretary are defined in the Companies Act, No 71 of 2008. For publicly listed companies, these roles were clarified and expanded by the King IV report. In addition, non-profit companies that have voluntarily adopted the \\"Enhanced Accountability and Transparency\\" provisions of the Companies Act must appoint a company secretary whose role is comparable to that of a public company. =Sri Lanka = In Sri Lanka, the Companies Act, No. 07 of 2007 requires that each registered company has a company secretary. A company secretary is required to be registered with the Department of Registrar of Companies, to function as a company secretary.

He is the son of the late Dan Kelly. Kelly joined his father in the broadcast booth, for a game in November 1988, as Dan Kelly announced his final game, in which the Blues defeated the Flyers for the first time in Philadelphia since January 6, 1972. Kelly joined the Blues' broadcast team for the 1989‚Äì90 season and remained on the job until 1992, when he joined the then-fledgling Tampa Bay Lightning. Three years later, he then joined the Colorado Avalanche, who were moving from Quebec, where they had spent 23 seasons as the Nordiques. He documented two Stanley Cup Championships in Denver, in 1995‚Äì96 and again in 2000‚Äì01. He became well known in Denver for his proclamation, \\"Thank you, thank you, thank you!!!!\\" after a big score by the Avs and,\\"SAVE BY ROY!\\" after a good save from former Avalanche goaltender Patrick Roy. He left the Avalanche after the 2003‚Äì04 season to rejoin the Blues on their telecasts. After the 2004‚Äì05 NHL lockout, he finally got the chance for the second time in 2005‚Äì06. His younger brother Dan P. Kelly was the Blues' radio announcer from 1997 to 2000, before spending the next four seasons with the Columbus Blue Jackets. In addition to the Blues, Kelly also worked the 2006 NHL playoffs on Outdoor Life Network (now NBCSN). During the mid-1990s, he worked on some regional telecasts for the NHL on Fox. Kelly substituted for Mike Haynes, the broadcaster who took over his play-by-play role for the Avalanche, on Altitude Sports and Entertainment during the 2008 playoffs due to Haynes' health problems. Kelly, whose minor league hockey assignments included the St. Catharines Saints and three years with the Adirondack Red Wings, obtained his realtor license during the 2004‚Äì05 NHL lockout.

The rarity of intact Baekje tombs makes this one of the major archaeological discoveries in Korea and a crucial source for the understanding of Baekje, one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea.Kim 1973, 1986; Kim and Pearson 1977. The tomb is located in what is now Gongju, South Chungcheong Province, South Korea. It is Korean Historic Site No. 13. King Muryeong's Tomb is also registered on the South Korean government's tentative list of World Heritage Sites. Excavation The tomb of King Muryeong in Gongju. The tomb was accidentally discovered during water drainage work on the No.5 and 6 tombs in 1971. It had been untouched by grave robbers and thieves for over a millennium, and when it was excavated it was the first time the tomb had been opened since the bodies of the king and queen were interred there fifteen hundred years earlier. The exterior of the tomb looks like an earthen mound, 20 meters in diameter and 7.7 meters () in height. It is believed that the mound was originally larger. Notably, the tomb employed a drainage system. The tomb is based on the southern Chinese prototypes but also incorporates Baekje elements to create a Korean-style tomb. Solely Korean elements of the tomb include the arched shape of the chamber and the brick colour pattern. The style of King Muryeong's tumulus is found only in the Gongju area. While Chinese custom placed tombs in the north, this tomb was placed in the south. However, the king was placed in the east part of the tomb while the queen was placed in west which follows Chinese practice. The main chamber is rectangular and made of black brick. It is 4.2 meters north-south, 2.72 meters east-west, and 3.14 meters () in height. While the north and south walls stand straight, the east and west walls curve inward, creating an arched roof. The south wall has an arch-shaped door which leads to a passageway and entrance of the tomb. The door is 2.9 meters in length, 1.04 meters in width, and 1.45 meters in height (). The east and west walls have two onion-shaped or flame-shaped niches to hold lamps while the north wall has one such niche. The placement of the bricks of the tomb is in alternating rows of lengthwise and widthwise arrangements. The bricks mainly have lotus motifs but other decorations were incorporated as well. Artifacts From the tomb, 2906 objects were excavated and subsequently classified into 108 categories. The most important objects include two pairs of royal diadems made for the king and queen and two stone epigraphs containing valuable inscriptions and dates. The epigraphs give the name and age of the king and queen and dates of their deaths and burials, a rarity for Korean tombs. These dates are also extremely valuable as they corroborate exactly the text of the Samguk Sagi. Other objects include Chinese celadon jars, a copper bowl, gold and silver bracelets and earrings, footrests, bronze mirrors, a ring-pommelled sword, and gilt-bronze shoes. The bier in the tomb was covered by the remains of the wood coffins. The grave goods were placed below the coffins while some of the most important artifacts were placed on the bodies of the king and queen, such as the sword by the king's waist and the diadem ornaments at the heads of both the king and queen.

Daoud was appointed in December 2005, and replaced in December 2006 after the insistence of the British ISAF troops. The U.S. used the warlords to help them hunt Al Qaeda and the Taliban and it is rumored this extended to ignoring their involvement in the production and sale of opium. Appointment as Governor of Helmand Mohammad Daud was born in Helmand in 1957. He studied civil engineering, specializing in irrigation at the famous Kabul polytechnic, graduating in 1980 with a Bachelor of Science. Following that he word to build apartments for the Afghan Ministry of Defense in Kabul, before fleeing to join the resistance in the early 80's. Mohammad Daud was Governor of the southern province of Helmand from December 2005 to late 2006. During his time in Helmand, a province with over 1.5 million people, Daud oversaw the initial engagement with insurgency, the fight against the corrupt narcotics trade, the development of a reconstruction plan for Helmand and the power transfer from warlords to the people of Helmand. The Government of Hamid Karzai After the tragic events of September 2001, Mohammad Daud joined the Administration of Hamid Karzai, as a Director in the office of the newly constituted National Security Council in 2002. In that role, he worked very closely with President Karzai, The National Security Advisor and senior international colleagues as lead on combat prisoner issues, Camp x-ray and the reconciliation commission (PTS) The 1990 In the 1990s Mohammad Daud continued to help the people of southern Afghanistan. He joined the NGO's assisting afghan refugees with food, accommodation and medical assistance, and was elected to head the NGO co- ordination body for southern Afghanistan (SWABAC) and subsequent elected to co-ordinate NGO and UN activity in that area; the first time a non-UN person held that post. The fight against the Soviets Daud fled the hated communist government of Kabul, and joined the resistance in the early 1980s. Daud joined the freedom fighters in Helmand where he quickly rose as the liaison point between field commanders and the leadership in the freedom fighters city of Quetta. It was at that time he assisted the refugees fleeing the soviets. He went into communist controlled southern Afghanistan on a number of occasions, delivering much needed food and supplies to ordinary villagers. The Times of London reported that the British government requested Daoud's appointment. 4,000 British troops were posted to Helmand, following Daoud's appointment. Daoud had requested additional British troops. Radio Free Europe quoted critical comments from journalist Ahmed Rashid, about extraordinary support the Hamid Karzai Presidency was providing Daoud's predecessor: In November 2006 a British Foreign Office official expressed frustration that Afghanistan's President Hamid Karzai had appointed Daoud's predecessor Sher Mohammed Akhundzada to Afghanistan's Upper House; continued to meet with him, and appointed his brother, Amir Muhammad Akhundzada, as Daoud's deputy. During a telephone interview with The Times, following his firing, Daoud said: The Times reported that Daoud's deputy, Amir Muhammad Akhundzada, had also been replaced. They also reported that Daoud declined an appointment to be Governor of Farah Province.

It is involved in folliculogenesis, the process in which primordial follicles develop into pre-ovulatory follicles. Structure & Interactions = Structure = The BMP-15 gene is located on the X-chromosome and using Northern blot analysis BMP-15 mRNA is locally expressed within the ovaries in oocytes only after they have started to undergo the primary stages of development. BMP-15 is translated as a preproprotein that is composed of a single peptide, which contains a proregion and a smaller mature region. Intracellular processing then leads to the removal of the proregion, leaving the biologically active mature region to perform the functions. This protein is a member of the Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-Œ≤) superfamily and is a paracrine signalling molecule. Most active BMPs have a common structure, in which they contain 7 cysteines, 6 of which form three intramolecular disulphide bonds and the seventh being involved in the formation of dimers with other monomers. BMP-15 is an exception to this as the molecule does not contain the seventh cysteine. Instead in BMP-15 the fourth cysteine is replaced by a serine. = Interactions = BMP-15 and GDF9 interact with each other and work synergistically to have similar interactions with the target cell. BMP15 can act as a heterodimer with GDF9 or on its own as a homodimer. In most of the BMP family heterodimers and homodimers form as the seventh cysteine is involved in the formation of a covalent bond, leading the dimerization. However, in the BMP-15 the homodimers form as a non-covalent bond is present between two BMP-15 subunits.  Function  Functions of BMP-15 include * Promotion of growth and maturation of ovarian follicles, starting from the primary gonadotrophin-independent phases of folliculogenesis. * Regulation of the sensitivity of granulosa cells to follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) action, contributing to the determination of the number of eggs that are ovulated. * Prevention of granulosa cell apoptosis. = Folliculogenesis = Folliculogenesis is an important process for the development and maintenance of fertility. Primordial follicles are stored in the ovary and throughout life are activated to go through morphological changes to become preovulatory follicles ready for ovulation, when the oocyte is released into the fallopian tube of the female reproductive tract. BMP-15 main functions are crucial for the beginning of folliculogenesis as seen in Image 1. The primordial follicle is made up of the oocyte and a single layer of flattened granulosa cells. BMP-15 is released from the oocyte into the surrounding granulosa tissue where it binds to two membrane bound receptors on granulosa cells. This promotes granulosa cell proliferation via mitosis. BMP-15 promotes the change of primordial to primary and secondary follicles which are surrounded by several granulosa cell layers but doesn‚Äôt promote transition into preovulatory follicles. Image 1: The stages of folliculogenesis in the ovary. BMP-15 function is crucial to promote proliferation of primordial follicles at stages 1-2 and via the inhibition of FSH receptor expression prevents follicles differentiation into the later stages of development (3-7).BMP-15 prevents differentiation into preovulatory follicle by inhibiting FSH action in granulosa. FSH is released by the anterior pituitary as part of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis and promotes the differentiation of early follicles into later preovulatory ones. BMP-15 prevents this transition by inhibiting the production of FSH receptor mRNA in granulosa cells. Therefore, FSH cannot bind to the granulosa cells, this inhibits FSH dependent progesterone production and luteinization, subsequently granulosa cells do not differentiate. As BMP-15 acts directly on granulosa cells it has an important influence on granulosa function including steroidogenesis inhibition of luteinization and differentiation of cumulus, without which would lead to infertility and lack of folliculogenesis.  Differences between species  The use of mammalian species other than human is often used in research to learn more about human biology. = Sheep = Two breeds of sheep, Inverdale and Hanna, are naturally heterozygous carriers of point mutations in the BMP-15 gene. These point mutations result in higher ovulation rates and larger litter sizes than sheep strains with a wildtype BMP-15 genotype. This super-fertility was mimicked later through immunization of wildtype ewes against BMP-15 using various immunisation techniques. Sheep carrying homozygous alleles for the Inverdale and Hanna BMP-15 mutations are infertile, as they have streak ovaries and the primary stage of folliculogenesis is inhibited. These studies suggest that BMP-15 plays a vital role in the normal regulation of folliculogenesis and ovulation in sheep. = Mice = In mice, the BMP-15 homologue is not as physiologically important. Upon targeted deletion of a bmp15 exon, the mice presented with only subfertility in homozygotes and no clear aberrant phenotype in heterozygotes. The homozygous mutant mice did not suffer from reduced folliculogenesis or impacted follicle progression, unlike in the sheep homologue knockout experiments. The subfertility seen in the homozygous mutant phenotype was attributed to defective ovulation and reduced viability of embryos. Here it can be stated that BMP-15 is not as vital for normal female mouse fertility as it is for sheep. = Humans = Humans display a similar phenotype to the Inverdale/Hanna sheep in regards to female fertility. In women, a mutation in BMP-15 is linked to hypergonadotropic ovarian failure due to ovarian dysgenesis. In this case, the researchers were able to identify that the father of the two sisters displaying this mutation had no documented phenotype associated with the mutation, so BMP-15 appears to only affect females. In slight contrast to the reports on sheep, the women in this study were heterozygous for the BMP-15 mutation but exhibited streak ovaries, a phenotype very similar to the one seen in homozygous mutant ewes. The sisters presented with primary amenorrhea, showing that BMP-15 is also vital to normal human female fertility, concordant with the sheep model. = Current theory = The main theory for this stark difference between mammalian species relates to the number of follicles normally ovulated in each cycle by each species. Humans and sheep are mono-ovulatory, potentially explaining the difference in litter size observed in mutant individuals. As mice are poly-ovulatory, the role of BMP-15 in female mouse fertility may not be as obvious. Clinical relevance Mutations within the gene for BMP-15 have been associated with reproductive complications in females, due to the X-linked nature of the protein. Due to its role in folliculogenesis, mutations can lead to sub-fertility through decreased or absent folliculogenesis. In combination with GDF-9, mutant BMP-15 is also associated with ovulation defects, premature ovarian failure and other reproductive pathologies. BMP-15 defects have been implicated in female sterility, Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) and endometriosis. Women with PCOS have been noted to have higher levels of BMP-15, while missense mutations of the protein have been identified in females with POI. Research has also found inherited mutant BMP-15 to be involved with the pathogenesis of hypergonadotropic ovarian failure. This condition develops due to BMP-15 role in folliculogenesis, and the errors that occur when a mutant gene is inherited. The protein is linked to familial ovarian dysgenesis which results in hypergonadotropic ovarian failure. The importance of BMP-15 in ovulation and folliculogenesis has been highlighted by research into Turner syndrome, a chromosomal abnormality where females are missing a complete or partial X chromosome. Depending on the chromosomal mutation, BMP-15 gene dosage varies and impacts ovarian development in Turner syndrome patients. The gene is thus involved in determining the extent of the ovarian defects present in Turner syndrome. BMP-15 is also present in animals and involved in reproduction, such as in mice and sheep. Reduced levels of BMP-15 in sheep have shown to increase ovulation, leading to larger litter sizes.

Background  The plaintiffs were joint venture partners, subsidiaries of BHP and Esso, who used 3 trunk pipelines for the transportation of gas liquids and crude oil, which formed an \\"integral step in the production of the products sold by the plaintiffs\\". Prior to 1981 the \\"pipeline operation fee\\" under the Pipelines Act 1967 (Vic),Pipelines Act 1967 (Vic). was $35 per kilometre, totaling less than $10,000 for each of the three trunk pipelines. As a result of the Pipelines (Fees) Act 1981 (Vic),Pipelines (Fees) Act 1981 (Vic). for the financial year 1981‚Äì1982 the tax was increased 100 fold to $10 million for the trunk pipelines. The Plaintiffs sought a declaration that the tax imposed was invalid for being an excise duty contrary to section 90.  Decision  Mason J restated the rejection of the narrow view of excise, but noted that the broad view was tempered by the insistence of the Court that there be a strict relationship between the tax and the goods (the criterion of liability approach), and the problem of defining that relationship. He referred to the formulation in Bolton v Madsen,. which \\"has not emerged unscathed from the more recent decisions on s 90\\"; for example, there was Barwick CJ's formulation of a variety of factors in Anderson's Pty Ltd v Victoria.. His Honour notes that section 90 would do very little to add to the powers of the Commonwealth's economic and financial powers, if the States were allowed to circumvent the prohibition in section 90 through the criterion of liability approach. Since section 90 also allows the Commonwealth parliament to granting bounties on goods, it would make little sense for the States to be given the power to burden such production. Thus, overall, Mason J found that the objective of the power, to secure control over taxation of commodities, suggests the broad approach to excise. As for the required relationship, his Honour prefers the substantial effects doctrine ‚Äì there need not be a strict arithmetical relationship between the tax and the quantity or value of the goods sold, and it is sufficient that the tax affects the price of the goods sold. A deciding factor in this case is the factual matrix. It appears that the fee is \\"not merely a fee for the privilege of carrying on an activity\\"; it is an exaction of such magnitude on a step of the production process, and it is a convenient means of applying such a tax. Gibbs CJ made the observation that the States now have a severely restricted ability to tax: the restrictions from section 90, and the imposition of uniform income taxes.

Publication history Tyr first appeared in Journey into Mystery #85 (Oct 1962), and was created by Stan Lee, Larry Lieber and Jack Kirby. Fictional character biography Tyr is the Asgardian god of war. Tyr was renowned throughout Asgard as being the only god brave enough to place his hand in the mouth of the wolf-god Fenris during the latter's binding which Fenris would not allow unless a god placed his hand in his mouth; his left hand is missing as a result, having been bitten off by Fenris, and is now usually covered by a metal cup. He has fought in the defense of Asgard numerous times.Thor: Heaven and Earth #1 (2011) He has several times rebelled against Odin due to his love of battle, and fought Thor due to resentment of Thor's relationship with Sif, and the fact Thor usurped his role as Asgard's greatest warrior. Once he was nearly exiled for this, but Thor pleaded for mercy. At a time before the loss of his hand Tyr is one of the executioners chosen to slay Balder for the crime of ignoring his comrades on the battlefield. Tyr fires an arrow, which is snatched away by an eagle.Journey Into Mystery Vol 1 #106 (July 1964) Tyr battled with Asgardian forces against a false Ragnarok which Odin had engineered to delay the real Ragnarok.Thor #275 He later lost a friendly wager to Thor over whether his strength had declined after battling the Celestials.Thor #302 Tyr later allied with Loki against Odin, and captured the goddess Idunn and her Golden Apples of Immortality, without which the gods would grow old and perish. He unleashed the Midgard Serpent on Earth when it had been strengthened by the Apples, and it is used as a bridge by their army to attack Asgard. With the enemies of Asgard, he followed Odin and the other gods to Earth, where he was betrayed by Loki and defeated by Odin.Thor #324-327 Alongside Beta Ray Bill, the Avengers, the Fantastic Four, and the Asgardian forces, Tyr battled Surtur's demons on Earth. Tyr then returned to Asgard.Thor #350-352, 359 Later, in a battle, Thor references Tyr's ancient homeland and wise 'Hymir', who is often thought of as Tyr's father.Thor #379 (May 1987) Tyr answers the call to the defense of Asgard when it is threatened by the Egyptian death-god Seth. Tyr is part of a small group of Asgardian warriors who petition Odin for the lives of the Warriors Three and their guardsman ally. Odin, influenced by an outside force, angrily dismisses Tyr's groups and declares the Warriors and the guardsman will die for being traitors to Asgard.The Mighty Thor #454 (Nov 1992) During the events of Ragnarok, Tyr fought alongside Beta Ray Bill and the armies of Asgard against Surtur, the Fire Demons, trolls and giants, and perished during battle.Thor Vol. 2 #85 Asgard's return involves a brief stay in the country of Latveria, where its ruler, Doctor Doom murders several Asgardians. Tyr is part of the force leading an attack on Doom's fortress.Thor vol. 3, #605 (December 2009) During the Siege of Asgard, Tyr was present with the Asgardians when news of Volstagg turning himself over to the Broxton authorities reaches Asgard.Thor #607 He assumes command of the Asgardian forces when Balder takes leave. Tyr suffers a personal crisis when it is predicted he will fall in battle. After he sees those who have he rallies himself to return to the front lines where he is seriously wounded by The Hood's Norn stones.Thor #608 Tyr takes control of the spirits of the fallen Asgardians and they pray for someone to lead them to the afterlife. This prayer is answered in the form of Danielle Moonstar, who has regained her old role as a Valkyrie. On her heels come 'Disir', predatory Valkryies from ancient times, who try to feast on the souls of the fallen. Danielle and Tyr fight off the creatures but lose three Asgardians to oblivion. Tyr reassures Danielle she fought well regardless. The \\"survivors\\" are led to an afterlife while Tyr stands behind. Danielle tells him he is not really dead, but close to it.New Mutants vol. 3 #11 (March, 2010) Tyr is later seen, alive and well, investigating the theft of the Golden Apples of Idunn. Said apples help support the long lives and vitality of his fellow gods. Tyr is tricked into thinking the perpetrator is the heroic Amadeus Cho. The real perpetrator is Agamemnon, a former Asgardian that has gone mad with power and the sheer number of years he has lived.Heroic Age: Prince of Power #3 (2010) When an invading army from beyond the universe threatens all the nine realms, Tyr and Balder volunteer to strike directly at the enemy. They suffer in their battle but the army is soon forced back with the assistance of Odin.Thor #615-621 (2010 - 2011) Tyr becomes the commander of Hela's underworld forces.

He ends up drawn into the realm of Valhalla, not as a feasting warrior, but as a kitchen worker.Thor Vol. 5 #2-4 (2018) Powers and abilities Tyr is a member of the race of superhumans known as Asgardians, and therefore has superhuman strength, speed, stamina, durability, agility, and reflexes, and has an extremely long life span and immunity to all Earthly diseases as well as some resistance to magic. Tyr, being the God of War, is not only highly skilled at hand-to-hand combat, but also proficient with all forms of Asgardian weaponry as well. Even after the destruction of Asgard, Tyr has revealed a special ability, a hidden power enabling him to summon forth the \\"Soul of the God of War\\", releasing destructive energies through his severed hand.Thor #613 He usually carries a sword and shield. Tyr once stole the Mace of the Myth-Wars, a weapon once wielded by Odin and possessing powers similar to Thor's hammer Mjolnir, as well as the ability to teleport between adjacent universes, such as Midgard and Asgard. Tyr believed that the enchanted mace was \\"equal to the challenge of mystic Mjolnir\\" and has shown itself capable of knocking back even Thor. During the combat, the Mace is destroyed by Thor using his lightning.Thor vol. 1 #312 In other media =Film= * Clive Russell portrays Tyr in the live-action film Thor: The Dark World.

Biography Antonio Vassilacchi was born of Greek descent on the island of Milos, Greece in 1556. He left very young to settle in Venice. In 1572 Vassilacchi became a pupil of Paolo Veronese and began working on the frescoes in the episcopal palace at Treviso, in the church of Sant'Agata in Padua (Padova), and various churches in Venice. His opportunity came with the great conflagration that nearly devoured the Doge's Palace in Venice in December 1577. Aliense, a compatriot and just a little younger than El Greco, was one of the painters commissioned to decorate the restored Palace. Vassilacchi became a member of 'The Brotherhood of Saint Nicolas of the Greek Nation' (Scuola dei Greci), one of the liveliest 'foreign' communities in Venice, in 1600. In its book of members, the secretary inscribed, between a Cephallonian and a Cypriot, \\"Ant. Vassilachi: 1600:\\". He was also a member of the Brotherhood of Venetian Painters from 1584 and had acquired a sobriquet, 'Aliense'. The name derives from the Latin alienus, meaning stranger, alien, foreign, and was presumably given to Vassilacchi because of his completely alien, that is non-Italian (and not simply non-Venetian), origin. Vassilacchi married three times. The name of his first wife, who bore him his son, Stefano, is not known. Stefano followed in his father's footsteps as a painter and is said to have helped him on the Coronation of Baldwin of Flanders. Conquest of Tyre Oil on canvas, Palazzo Ducale, Venice (1590). He died young, however, before having established a career. Vassilacchi also had two daughters who entered the Nunnery of Santa Chiara (for which Vassilacchi had painted an Annunciation), though it is not known whether they were from his first or second marriage. His second wife, Giacomina, made her will on November 2, 1609, and died six days later. Vassilacchi's last marriage was his most unfortunate. Carlo Ridolfi, his biographer and student,Dictionary of art historians describes a painting by the artist in which he portrays himself carrying his wife, her nurse, her uncle and her son by her previous marriage, on his back. Vassilacchi used to show this picture to his friends and say \\"This is the burden I'll bear till I die\\". Aliense died on Easter's eve, 1629, in his seventy-third year. He was buried with honours in the church of San Vitale two days later. San Vitale is the church on the same square as Vassilacchi's house and he had painted there, a few years earlier (and both aptly named), a Resurrection' and an Ascension. His entry in the official Venetian register reads: 1629, 15 April. Sire Antonio Aliense, painter, aged about 73 years, sick of fever and catarrh these twelve days past. Among his pupils was Tomasso Dollobella. Works Flagellation. Vassilacchi's painting is on the wall of the Chapel of Our Lady of Peace. Formerly it was in the Scuola di Santa Croce at Belluno. His works in the Doges' Palace likely outnumber those by any other single artist, since he painted in all the major halls of the Palace, such as the Hall of the Grand Council (Sala del Maggior Consiglio), the Voting Hall (Sala dello Scrutinio), the Hall of the Senate (Sala del Senato), the Hall of the Council of Ten (Sala del Consiglio dei Dieci), the Hall of the Compass (Sala della Bussola). In 1586, Vassilacchi was asked to paint one of his largest pictures, the 'Resurrection', in the chancel of San Marziale. He gave the preliminary sketch, in chiaroscuro, to Domenico Cresti, the painter of the Crucifixion in the same church. The paintings, restored in 1958, still hang in the same place, across from each other above the marble high altar of the church. In 1591 Vassilacchi was engaged by the Brotherhood of Merchants (Scuola dei Mercanti), and some time later he was working in the church of San Giovanni Elemosinario, just a few metres from the commercial centre of Venice, the Rialto. He painted the Plague of Serpents (1588) in the Church of the Angelo San Raffaele. Behind the facade of the church of San Zaccaria, at least four large works by Aliense are preserved. In 1559 the Benedictine monks of San Giorgio Maggiore decided to renovate their church. They commissioned Palladio to execute the work but at the time of his death, twenty one years later, it was still unfinished. The abbot then summoned Vassilacchi to select the best, in his opinion, preliminary design for the central altar of the church. Adoration of the Magi, c. 1600. Naturally modest and polite, Aliense had a good word to say about all the sketches, which complicated rather than simplified matters. In the end, the up to then judge was asked to design something himself. His sketch was immediately accepted and from it was created the large bronze group of the Four Evangelists Supporting the World and God. In 1594, Aliense, recommended by the Benedictines of San Giorgio Maggiore, undertook to paint the circle of pictures that consist the Life of Christ for the church of San Pietro in Perugia, which belonged to the same Order. The ten paintings still survive in their original setting, together with his monumental \\"Apotheosis of the Benedictine Order\\" which, at 88 square metres (947 square feet), is the second biggest painting in Italy. In 1602 Antonio Vassilacchi began painting in the cathedral church at Sal√≤, while his surviving work‚Äîmainly decorative‚Äîin the Villa Barbarigo, of the senator Giovanni Barbarigo at Noventa Vicentina, near Montagnana, is impressive. His last, in all probability, works are those painted in Santa Maria in Vanzo, Padua.

As fellow members of the Commonwealth of Nations, the United Kingdom and South Africa exchange high commissioners rather than ambassadors, and the high commissioner's office in Pretoria is the high commission rather than the embassy. However, from 1961 to 1994 South Africa was not a member of the Commonwealth, so for that time the British head of mission was an ambassador and his office was the embassy.

He also translated the Biblia Vulgata into Romanian (1760‚Äì1761). Life Petru Pavel Aron was born Bistra in 1709. He studied by the Jesuits in Cluj and later in Trnava where he studied philosophy. He continued his studies of theology in the College of the Propaganda, Rome, where he remained till his doctorate in 1744.

He is the older brother of fellow professional footballer Peter Utaka. Utaka has played for several clubs across three continents, first for Arab Contractors and subsequently Ismaily of Egypt, and then spending a season playing for Al- Sadd of Qatar, before joining RC Lens and later Rennes in France. He has represented Nigeria at two World Cups and three Africa Cup of Nations since his debut in 2002. During his career he has mainly been utilised as a pacy winger making him a very effective element in a team's counter-attacking style of play. He is the founder of the John Utaka Football Academy minna. Club career Utaka was born in Enugu, Nigeria. He first moved to Egypt in 1998, joining Arab Contractors and subsequently Ismaily. While with Ismaily, Utaka earned cult status with the local fans. They used to chant \\"Oh Oh Oh Utaka, Oh Oh Oh Utaka\\" during the matches. He played alongside the likes of Mohammed Barakat, Islam El-Shater, and captain Mohamed Salah Abo Greisha under the guidance of Mohsen Saleh, later appointed coach of Egypt. He joined Al-Sadd of Qatar in 2001 for a fee of $1 million. This was then a record transfer fee in Qatar. where he spent one season. In 2002, he joined French club RC Lens whom he left in 2005 for Rennes. Utaka struggled to make an impact at the start of his Rennes stint. However, he took advantage of the absence of fellow striker Alexander Frei through injury to make his breakthrough. In February 2006, he scored two consecutive hat-tricks, against Lens and Lyon, and as a result received the L'√âquipe's player of the month award. In July 2017, he signed with fourth-tier side CS Sedan. =Portsmouth= Utaka joined Portsmouth on a four-year deal in July 2007, for a fee of around ¬£7 million. He scored his first goal on 11 August 2007 in a game against newly promoted Derby County. Some sources claim he became the club's record signing. On 17 May 2008, Portsmouth won the FA Cup with a 1‚Äì0 victory over Cardiff City. Utaka provided the cross for the winning goal which was scored by Nwankwo Kanu. He went on to have a poor 2008‚Äì09 season but on 27 June 2009 he confirmed he would be staying at the club for at least another season. The salary being paid to Utaka became a talking point in light of Portsmouth's financial issues, with news agencies reporting an alleged ¬£80,000 per week salary for Utaka as a reflection of their financial mismanagement. Utaka hit out at these reports, claiming that he earned only a third of that figure. On 23 January 2010, he scored both goals in Portsmouth's 2‚Äì1 win over Sunderland in the FA Cup 4th Round. =Montpellier= On 29 January 2011, Utaka signed for French first division side Montpellier, agreeing a -year deal for an undisclosed fee. He made his debut for the new club on 26 February coming on as a 70th-minute substitute for Olivier Giroud in a 0‚Äì0 draw with Sochaux. Utaka scored his first goal of the new Ligue 1 season, and his first for the club, against Ajaccio on 21 September 2011, and also provided an assist as Montpellier defeated Ajaccio 3‚Äì1 in Corsica. On 19 February 2012, Montpellier travelled to the Parc des Princes to face league leaders PSG; he headed in an 81st-minute goal from a Giroud cross but a late tap in from Guillaume Hoarau levelled the game at 2‚Äì2 and earned the sides a share of the points. Montpellier played host to Bordeaux six days later and he headed home the only goal of the game in the 80th minute to keep up the pressure on league leaders PSG. On 20 May 2012, in a game marred by stoppages for crowd violence, Utaka scored a brace, his sixth and seventh league goals of the campaign, to secure a 2‚Äì1 victory over Auxerre and win the Ligue 1 title for Montpellier over PSG, for the first time in the club's history. =Sivasspor= On 1 August 2013, Utaka joined the Turkish club Sivasspor on a two-year contract.

Kennedy died the following day at Good Samaritan Hospital. On the final night of the 1968 Republican National Convention in Miami Beach, during a convention-wrapping Thursday night round-table discussion with his fellow NBC floor reporters in the vacated folding chairs on the convention hall floor, Vanocur suggested that the Republicans had \\"kissed off the black vote\\" in 1968, a comment which caused a media uproar in the ensuing week. Vanocur also served as host of First Tuesday, a monthly newsmagazine that premiered in 1969 and continued after Vanocur left the network. His work at NBC earned him a place on the Nixon administration's \\"enemies list\\". After leaving NBC in 1971, Vanocur worked for PBS and as a television writer for The Washington Post. He joined ABC News in 1977 and worked there until 1991, holding various positions, including Chief Diplomatic Correspondent, Senior Correspondent in Buenos Aires, and anchor for Business World, the first regularly scheduled weekly business program.

In 1984, Vanocur moderated the Vice Presidential debate between incumbent George H. W. Bush and Congresswoman Geraldine Ferraro. He was also one of the questioners in the 1992 presidential debate. He made a cameo appearance as himself in the movie Dave and was one of the major performers, again playing himself, in the sci-fi television special Without Warning as one of the main news anchors linking the various scenes together. Vanocur hosted two of the History Channel's primetime series: Movies in Time and History's Business.  Family  Vanocur married his first wife, fashion designer Edith Pick, on March 3, 1956, and they had two sons, Nicholas and Christopher Vanocur.

The song is an emotional ballad, with the lyrics written as a plea to the children of the world, reminding them that they are the future. Due in part to the unfashionable style of the song but also to its subject matter (the song is based around the Beslan school hostage crisis, which is unusual in English language songs), it did not attract a favourable reception prior to the Contest.

Leidholdt is an activist and leader in the feminist movement against violence against women. Since the mid-1970s, she has counseled and advocated for rape victims, organized against \\"the media's promotion of violence against women\\", served on the legal team for the plaintiff in a precedent-setting sexual harassment case, founded an international non- governmental organization fighting prostitution and trafficking in women and children, directed the nation's largest legal services program for victims of domestic violence, advocated for the enactment and implementation of laws that further the rights of abused women, and represented hundreds of women victimized by intimate partner violence, human trafficking, sexual assault, the threat of honor killing, female genital mutilation, forced and child marriage, and the internet bride trade. Leidholdt has lectured internationally on issues of violence against women, and has published articles, book chapters, and two anthologies. Education Leidholdt holds a bachelor's degree from Randolph College (formerly known as Randolph-Mason Woman's College), a masters degree from the University of Virginia, and a J.D. degree from New York University School of Law, where she was a Root-Tilden-Snow scholar. Past career From 1975 to 1977, Leidholdt counseled rape victims as a graduate student at the University of Virginia and, after moving to New York City in 1978, became an activist with the Women's Anti-Rape Coalition, the educational arm of New York Women Against Rape. From 1978 through 1980, she was a member of the New York City Chapter of Women Against Violence Against Women (WAVAW did not have \\"leaders\\"; nor did WAVAW advocate censorship like Dorchen did). Leidholdt is known for her campaigns against pornography and for her suit against Hustler magazine publisher Larry Flynt. In 1979, after Hustler Magazine published an issue whose cover showed a naked female body being fed through a meat grinder, she joined Susan Brownmiller, Dolores Alexander (Past President of the National Organization for Women), and other New York City women's rights leaders in founding the feminist organization, Women Against Pornography (WAP). From 1979 through 1983, she served as a leader and spokesperson for WAP, during which time she joined Gloria Steinem and other feminist leaders in initiating a suit against Hustler and Larry Flynt, appeared on numerous television and radio programs, organized educational events, and spoke in Washington D.C. before the U.S. Attorney General's Commission on Pornography (a.k.a. The Meese Commission) at the commission's invitation. There Leidholdt testified, \\"Pornography perpetuates the devaluation of women. It sexualizes bigotry, promotes rape and undermines women's self esteem.\\" Flynt published an attack on her in the magazine's \\"Asshole of the Month\\" column (July 1985). In 1987, at New York University School of Law, she was the lead organizer of the conference, \\"The Sexual Liberals and the Attack on Feminism\\", and in 1988, she was the lead organizer of the first global conference on trafficking in women and girls. Leidholdt is an opponent of \\"sex-positive feminism\\". Her main argument is that prostitution is exploitative towards women and has historically benefited men, not women. Current career Leidholdt is the Director of the Center for Battered Women's Legal Services at Sanctuary for Families in New York City. Under Leidholdt's leadership since 1994, the Center has become the largest legal services program for domestic violence victims in the country. It has grown from two to twenty-four lawyers and eight support staff members, and has strengthened its advocacy efforts on behalf of under-served populations of women, especially those in New York City's immigrant communities. The Center has spearheaded state litigation that set new legal precedent expanding the protections available to domestic violence victims petitioning for orders of protection and federal litigation preventing child protective agencies from charging battered mothers with \\"engaging in domestic violence\\". Leidholdt also serves as a Board Member of the Coalition Against Trafficking in Women (CATW), which she helped found in 1988. She has represented the Coalition at numerous international meetings, including the World Conference on Human Rights (Vienna, 1993) and the Fourth World Conference on Women (Beijing, 1995). On 6 December 1996, in a special session commemorating the abolition of slavery, Leidholdt and a survivor of sex trafficking together addressed the General Assembly of the United Nations. Leidholdt has taught Criminal Procedure at City University School of Law, and, since 1998, has taught Domestic Violence and the Law at Columbia University School of Law. Activism In 1990, Leidholdt became an associate of the Women's Institute for Freedom of the Press (WIFP). WIFP is an American nonprofit publishing organization. The organization works to increase communication between women and connect the public with forms of women-based media.

Born in Saginaw, Michigan, Tucker graduated from Central Michigan University in 1960. Tucker was one of the first African Americans to work as a television network reporter. He began his career at NBC in 1965 as a general assignment news correspondent, and served as news director at WOR-TV in New York City from 1970 to 1971. He moved to ABC in 1972 and to CBS in 1977, where he worked until his death. He was winner of two Emmy Awards, and made the master list of Nixon political opponents for his reporting. Although Lem Tucker's life was brief, his career accomplishments were memorable. Tucker was the first African American elected to the position of student body president at CMU. That election took place when less than one percent of the student body was black. Previous to his election, only one other African American had been elected to a similar position in the United States. While at Central, Tucker was considered one of the university's top forensic students. He served as a chapter president of Pi Kappa Delta, a national speech honorary fraternity. He won his first Emmy in 1979 for his coverage of black America and his second in 1983 for a series about hunger in America. While working for the networks, he covered numerous major news events, including the Vietnam War, the Kent State University shootings and the Iran hostage crisis. He covered social unrest and riots in Newark, Miami and Harlem. He also reported from the Woodstock Festival. In 1981, he was covering President Ronald Reagan's speech at the Washington Hilton Hotel and witnessed the shooting of the president. He was broadcasting live reports on CBS Radio within minutes of the incident. He was applauded by his colleagues and others in the media for his continuous and thorough coverage, which he provided well into the next morning. During the course of his career, Tucker returned numerous times to his alma mater to speak to students about politics, share reflections on college life and offer insight regarding work as a national network correspondent. Tucker had a keen sense of humor. In an address given to the CMU community in the early 1980s, he told his audience he was amused to have been asked back to speak at the university, given that during his days as student body president, he \\"quibbled a lot\\" with the administration. He said, \\"How rare for me to be given a microphone and be invited to speak at CMU. Now I am on stage in front of administration and applauded.\\" Tucker has one daughter, Linn Carol Tucker. His death in 1991 was due to liver failure. References *Lem Tucker Speaker Series .

Charterhouse, 1973, \\"About the Author\\", pp. 337-8. Early life Sherrill was born in Frogtown, Georgia, and served on a merchant ship off Japan at the end of World War II. He was educated at the University of Texas at Austin. Career Sherrill taught English at schools including Texas A&M; University. A lasting influence was the Syracuse University philosopher Thomas Vernor Smith who preached a commitment to public service. Sherrill was a reporter for the Miami Herald, the Austin American-Statesman, and the weekly Texas Observer. In 1968, he signed the \\"Writers and Editors War Tax Protest\\" pledge, vowing to refuse tax payments in protest against the Vietnam War.\\"Writers and Editors War Tax Protest\\" January 30, 1968 New York Post As the Washington Correspondent and then Corporations Correspondent for The Nation, his efforts landed him on the master list of Nixon's political opponents. He also worked for I. F. Stone as a staff writer for his weekly, but soon parted ways. The Secret Service banned him from the White House for \\"posing a physical threat to the president\\". > \\"During Lyndon Johnson‚Äôs presidency, the Secret Service denied clearance to > Robert Sherrill, a reporter for The Nation who had gotten into physical > fights with government officials.\\" In his later years, Sherrill principally wrote reviews of books about politics and corporate greed, and two reviews antagonized the gay community. In his review of Nicholas von Hoffman's biography of Roy Cohn, Citizen Cohn, he showed no sympathy for Cohn's death from AIDS and in his 1982 favorable review of God's Bullies, he said he preferred to call the author \\"queer\\" rather than use the author's own description of himself as \\"gay.\\" That caused an outcry, Sherrill did not apologize and added \\"I grew up thinking the word [gay] meant happy. For a group to seize the word and apply it to themselves is somewhat grotesque.\\" Sherrill's 1987 article for The New York Times Magazine, \\"Can Miami Save Itself\\", caused a firestorm of factual challenges by Miami officials and Cuban Americans, prompting a 304-word Editor's Note from The New York Times. Sherrill authored several books on politics and society, including his Hubert Humphrey biography The Drugstore Liberal (1968), Military Justice Is To Justice as Military Music Is To Music (1970), The Saturday Night Special (1973), The Last Kennedy (1976) and The Oil Follies of 1970-1980: How the Petroleum Industry Stole the Show (And Much More Besides) (1983). His biography of Lyndon Johnson, The Accidental President had a run on the best seller list. He also wrote Gothic Politics in the Deep South and the textbook Why They Call it Politics: A Guide to America's Government. Court case A decision in 1977 by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit with regard to a civil suit filed by Sherrill against the U.S. Secret Service said that to ensure due process the revocation of a White House press pass must be accompanied by a written decision. It reads, in part: > \\"[...D]enial of a White House press pass to a bona fide journalist violates > the first amendment unless it furthers a compelling governmental interest > identified by narrowly and specifically drawn standards. [....A]ppellants > must publish or otherwise make publicly known the actual standard employed > in determining whether an otherwise eligible journalist will obtain a White > House press pass. [...N]otice, opportunity to rebut, and a written decision > are required because the denial of a pass potentially infringes upon first > amendment guarantees. Such impairment of this interest cannot be permitted > to occur in the absence of adequate procedural due process.\\" Personal life and death Sherrill resided in Washington, D.C., and he retired in Tallahassee, Florida.

Revenue from the trading companies grew from 37 million Egyptian pounds in 2000 to 100 million in 2003. By 2005, the organization had established a network of more than 2,000 farmers and numerous partner organizations in EgyptChristian Seelos and Johanna Mair, Hope for Sustainable Development , pp.2-3 and began increasingly to seek to extend its \\"experience and acquired knowledge\\" to other countries, including India, Palestine, Senegal, Turkey, and - in partnership with the Fountain Foundation - South Africa. History After a stay of 19 years in Austria, Dr. Abouleish returned to Egypt for a cultural trip in 1975. Touched by the deplorable economic and social situation of his country of origin, he decided to begin a project of cultural renewal on the basis of a synthesis of Islam and anthroposophy. Two years later he bought a plot of land in what was, at the time, desert bordering farmland of the Nile valley. The original goal was to develop the land and improve crop yields using biodynamic methods. A thick border of trees was planted to encircle the seventy hectares of land, and trees were planted along all the roads built; a forest was also planted on part of the land. (The initial planting included 120,000 casuarina, eucalyptus and Persian lilac seedlings.) The Bedouins who lived nearby, and sometimes on the land, were brought into the project, given work and helped with their living needs. Buildings were built using traditional adobe; some of these were designed by Hassan Fathy. The initial farm animals were Egyptian buffalo. The organization sold milk products produced from the buffalo milk and produce from the farm. The first large economic venture of the community initiative was production of a medicinal compound, ammoidin, an extract of Ammi majus (laceflower). The manufacture of herbal teas and a company to market fresh biodynamic produce in Europe followed. The needs of these companies led to many farms throughout Egypt switching to biodynamic methods; the SEKEM organization began an active advisory service to aid these farms in the transition to and the maintenance of biodynamic standards. Sekem leased many of these lands. Community projects began early in the initiative's history: a medical clinic using anthroposophic medicine, and a Society for Cultural Development sponsoring lectures, concerts and other cultural activities. In 1987, the center for adult education (Mahad) began its work; children with handicaps are also educated in this center. In 1988, SEKEM opened a kindergarten also open to the local Bedouin community; this grew into the SEKEM school, educating children from kindergarten through twelfth grade (about 18 years of age) on the basis of Waldorf education. \\"The school serves Muslim and Christian children alike encouraging them to live in harmony and have respect for the other's religious practices.\\" The school also operates a literacy center for illiterate children between ten and fourteen years of age. In response to the use of child labor in Egypt, SEKEM founded the project Chamomile Children, which offers children between ten and fourteen an education, vocational training, meals, and medical care in conjunction with their work; the children's teachers look after the children the whole day. There is also a cooperative for employees to organize the social processes (the Cooperative of SEKEM Employees), an independent organization with members from all the businesses and cultural institutions associated with SEKEM. In 1990, SEKEM founded the Centre of Organic Agriculture in Egypt (COAE), an independent organization that inspects organic farms in Egypt, Iran and Sudan. Faced with pesticide residues in their products that came from aerial spraying on nearby farms, SEKEM took up an initiative to eliminate such spraying in Egypt. As cotton production depended upon the sprays, SEKEM explored organic cotton production on initially small fields. The experiments were successful and yields actually were better than non-organic production achieved. The Egyptian Ministry of Agriculture sponsored further and more extensive tests. Within three years, the ministry agreed that organic pest suppression was superior for cotton farming and began converting the entire area of Egyptian cotton, 4,000 square kilometres, to organic methods for controlling pests; the conversion took two years. The conversion resulted in a reduction in the use of synthetic pesticides in Egypt by over 90% and an increase in the average yield of raw cotton of almost 30%. SEKEM then created a company to process organic cotton using mechanical rather than chemical methods, NatureTex. In response to increasing publicity about the novel methods employed by the community in many realms, the association of Muslim sheiks in Egypt gave the community a plaque verifying that SEKEM is an Islamic initiative. This was the result of intensive meetings between SEKEM and Muslim religious leaders. SEKEM's next initiative was the first private pharmaceutical company in Egypt, specializing in medicinal teas. The medical center had now grown to the point where it needed its own building; concurrently it considerably expanded its outreach into the Bedouin community, helping establish sanitary facilities and clean water supplies. In 1997, SEKEM established a vocational training center offering trainings in metalwork, carpentry, mechanical work, electrical work, tailoring, biodynamic farming and trading. The vocational center also includes an art school. The German Society for Technical Cooperation helped establish this project. In 1999 the SEKEM Academy (now Sekem University) opened. Originally a center for agricultural, pharmaceutical and medical research, the University now also conducts studies and offers training in other areas. In 2001, a holding company was established to administer the finances of all the SEKEM companies and to oversee developmental projects. The holding company includes a department to help each individual company with its developmental process, and is also responsible for the education and training programs for employees.Abouleish, Ibrahim, SEKEM: A Sustainable Community in the Egyptian Desert, Social connections All SEKEM companies have a policy of ensuring transparency in the production, distribution and consumption of their goods. They work to ensure fair and secure prices for the farmers supplying them, basing their operations on the principle that the health of the economy depends upon producers, distributors and consumers cooperating to generate stable businesses. SEKEM hosts a monthly gathering of all farmers working together with it; about 200 farmers attended these sessions as of 2004. It has created the following NGOs: * A Cooperative of SEKEM Employees that works to ensure equality, equity and dignity for all employees. In particular, the cooperative supports employee training, career development and health care provisions. Ten percent of SEKEM employees' working time is available for professional and personal development through social and cultural enrichment activities. * The SEKEM Developmental Foundation, with the goal of raising the quality of people's lives and supporting cultural and economic development in Egypt. The foundation provides education and literacy support for surrounding communities as well as programs for children with special needs. This includes a kindergarten, a \\"co-educational school with pupils from a diversity of cultural and social backgrounds, Muslim and Christian children learning together in a community where respect for all differences of gender, religion, class and ethnicity is cultivated\\", special education facilities and vocational trainings.UN Global Compact report * An adult education center, MAHAD, that offers professional trainings as well as continuing education programs in a variety of areas. * The Egyptian Biodynamic Association, established in 1990 as a research and training center in biodynamic methods. Approximately 800 farmers are now farming biodynamically in Egypt. SEKEM and Dr. Ibrahim Abouleish received the Right Livelihood Award in 2003 for integrating the commercial success with promotion of the social and cultural development of society.Right Livelihood organization The organization has been cited as a successful example of social entrepreneurship that has had a significant impact on Egyptian society both through its influence on the country's agricultural practices and through its educational and cultural institutions.Mair and Marti, \\"Social entrepreneurship research: A source of explanation, prediction, and delight\\", Journal of World Business 41 (2006) p. 38World Future Council Furthermore, Dr. Ibrahim Abouleish and his Son Helmy were named Social Entrepreneurs of the year 2003 by the Schwab Foundation for Social Entrepreneurship, and Well known business schools like IESE and CIDA City Campus use various case studies (e.g. Harvard Business Press Case Study published by Harvard Business School PublishingThe Power of Unreasonable People (Harvard Business School Press, 2008) to illustrate this novel approach to sustainable social entrepreneurship. Recent visitors included the first lady of Egypt, Suzanne Mubarak, a group from the Fulbright Commission in Egypt,Fulbright Commission in Egypt the former Federal Minister of the Interior of Germany, Otto Schily and the founder of the Witten/Herdecke University Dr. Konrad Schily (a former member of the German Bundestag). Motto Yearly seminars to reflect on the aims and goals of SEKEM have evolved the following motto: :We aim towards living together according to social forms which reflect human dignity and further development, striving towards higher ideals. Our main goal is a developmental impulse for people, society and the earth. SEKEM wants to contribute to the comprehensive development of people, society and the earth, inspired by higher ideals. The cooperation of economic, social and cultural activities is stimulated by science, art and religion. :SEKEM has set itself the following goals for the economic sphere: :*Healing the earth through biodynamic farming :*Development and production of herbal remedies and any kind of product or service which relates to real consumer requirements and has standards of the highest quality. :*Marketing in associative cooperation between farmers, producers, traders and consumers. :We aim to advance the individual development of the person through the cultural institutions. Education towards freedom is the goal of Sekem's educational institutions for children, adolescents and adults. Health care and therapies using natural healing remedies are provided by SEKEM. The SEKEM Academy for Applied Arts and Sciences researches and teaches solutions to pertinent questions from all areas of life. :Socially, SEKEM furthers a community of people from all over the world who recognize the dignity of the individual, enabling both learning to work and working to learn, and providing equal rights to all.

The Dynamic Energy Budget theory delineates two classes * Somatic maintenance mainly comprises the turnover of structural mass (mainly proteins) and the maintenance of concentration gradients of metabolites across membranes (e.g., counteracting leakage). This is related to maintenance respiration. * Maturity maintenance concerns the maintenance of defence systems (such as the immune system), and the preparation of the body for reproduction. The theory assumes that maturity maintenance costs can be reduced more easily during starvation than somatic maintenance costs. Under extreme starvation conditions, somatic maintenance costs are paid from structural mass, which causes shrinking.

The aim of a player in a last man standing match is to dispatch their opponents and remain the sole survivor; the basic rules followed are generally the same of the deathmatch gametype, with an important difference: respawn is limited or not allowed at all. Each player is assigned a specific number of lives per match (or just one when there is no respawn); once these lives have been expended, the player will no longer be able to return to the current match and remain as an invisible spectator until there is a winner and the LMS round is over. Within several games players are called to buy or pick up items, while other titles will have the players spawned with full weapons and ammo and there are no powerups available on the map. Several different variations of the last man standing mode exist, with the most common being team LMS. The rules are the same of the standard LMS and the winning team is the one able to eliminate all the members of the opposing teams and keep at least one of its components alive. The first last-man-standing video game with a shrinking play zone was the 1983 action game Bomberman.https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-10-17-remembering-dyna- blaster-the-first-battle-royale-game-i-played Camping In Last Man Standing mode, camping, which is often considered an unsocial and dishonest tactic, is highly beneficial.

The hiding player now not only has the advantage of additional lives (the player wasn't killed as many number of times as other players who were constantly moving), but also now has to fight a lesser number of players, each of whom has a disadvantage of lesser number of lives. This means that their chances of winning are higher than others, without any skill involved. Hence, it is often considered cheating. Camping tends to stall a game. Due to camping being highly beneficial, if everybody hides so as to wait until some players are eliminated, the game will not be allowed to proceed. Modern games, like Unreal Tournament 2004 can detect from a players movement if they are camping. If detected, the player is first given a warning and if the player continues camping, action is taken according to the server rules (generally, a camper is removed from the game). In vehicular combat games, camping can be prevented with a timeout clock that resets each time a player hits a rival vehicle. Battle royale games, such as PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds and Fortnite Battle Royale, discourage camping by gradually reducing the size of the area where LMS competitors can play on, typically with a deadly energy field. Any players who do not move to safer ground as the field closes in will suffer continuous damage and eventually die if they fail to escape it.

Subsequently, in January 2007, he moved to Bundesliga outfit VfL Bochum where he played for three and a half years. After a brief stay at Azerbaijani club FK Baku, in January 2011 he returned to Greece to have a second spell at Iraklis. Epalle was Iraklis' top-scorer for the 2005‚Äì06 season. Started at the end of March 2012, he has made his first appearance and play for Sarawak FA alongside his fellow Cameroon friend, Guy Bwele. Epalle has won 31 caps for Cameroon.

He also played his first match in a European competition as he came in at halftime of a 5‚Äì0 away defeat against Manchester United. In the next season Epalle did not get any chances in the league, and he only appeared in two Champions League matches. On 7 January 2005, Epalle was released by Panathinaikos, to empty a foreign player's spot, so the club would be able to sign Brazilian defensive midfielder Anderson de Lima Freitas. =Iraklis= Briefly after his release Iraklis decided to sign him. =VfL Bochum= In January 2007, Epalle signed a three and a half years contract with VfL Bochum. The transfer fee was 600,000 ‚Ç¨. Epalle debuted for VfL Bochum in a home match against Mainz. He played in the whole match but Mainz managed to win the match by 0‚Äì1 in a close encounter. In the next match Epalle was once again a starter and he helped VfL Bochum to get an away 0‚Äì0 draw from German giants FC Bayern. Epalle's first major contribution to the team came in a match against Arminia Bielefeld. He dribbled in the centre of the field before passing the ball towards Gekas to help him score the second goal of their team in what was meant to be a 1‚Äì3 away win for VfL Bochum. In the match Epalle scored his first goal for VfL Bochum. A corner was taken by his teammate Misimoviƒá an Alemannia Aachen defender poorly cleared the ball and Epalle took advantage of the loose ball to score his team's second goal, in a match that finished 2‚Äì2. Epalle continued showing his scoring abilities, as he send the ball to settle in the net of Hannover 96, during a count-attack of his team, to make the score 2‚Äì0, that was also the final score of the match. He also proved himself to be highly effective in front of the goal in an away match against Eintracht Frankfurt by scoring twice. His first goal was a powerful effort from just outside the area in the 58th minute of the match and second was scored in the 69th minute after an assist by Gekas. In his first season for VfL Bochum Epalle played in all of 17 VfL's Bundesliga matches for the second round of the 2006‚Äì07 club's campaign (all as a starter), scored four goals and handed three assists to his teammates. In the opening stages of the 2008‚Äì09 season Epalle was forced to miss several matches due to a toe injury. He was able to make his come back, in a 0‚Äì0 home draw against Werder Bremen, after replacing the injured Christian Fuchs in the 42nd minute. On 11 June 2010, Bochum announced that the contract of Epalle would not be extended beyond its original expiry date on 30 June 2010. During his spell at Bochum he became a firm favorite amongst his teammates and the club's fans due to his hard- working style of play and the trademark back-flip celebration of his goals. =FK Baku= In the summer of 2010, Epalle signed a contract with Azerbaijan Premier League outfit FK Baku, to meet again with Winfried Sch√§fer, his former manager for the Indomitable Lions. His first game for FK Baku was on 15 July, for the Second Qualifying Round of UEFA Europa League, against Buduƒánost of Montenegro. Epalle was suspended for that match, as he was sent off in an Iraklis' match four years ago against Wis≈Ça Krak√≥w, and due to this Buduƒánost gained a 3‚Äì0 default win, in a match they had originally lost 2‚Äì1. Epalle was handed a further two-match suspension. He made his league debut for his new club on 22 August in a 2‚Äì1 home win against Gabala. He was substituted in the 83rd minute of the match for Ibrahim Kargbo. The next match he featured, was a 1‚Äì1 home draw against Ganja on 12 September. In November his agent stated that Epalle was not happy with the lifestyle of Azerbaijan and with the situation in Azerbaijani football. The main reasons for that reaction was the low attendance of Azerbaijani Premier League and the fact that he could do nothing besides training and staying in his hotel room. His agent also declared Epalle's desire to return in the Greek Superleague for Iraklis. He played again on 13 November coming in as a substitute for Aleksandar ≈†oliƒá in the 78th minute, in a match that FK Baku won 2‚Äì0.

On 24 March 2012, he made his first appearance with Sarawak FA against Malaysia national football team in a friendly match at State Stadium, Kuching. The match ended with draw 1‚Äì1. Epalle scored the equalizer. His official league debut, in the game against Kelantan FA on 7 April 2012, saw Epalle fouled and he received a free-kick in the 18th minute which led to a goal by Guy Bwele in the 1‚Äì1 draw. His first goal for Sarawak was scored against Kuala Lumpur FA, an equaliser in a 1‚Äì1 draw on 4 May 2012. International career Epalle is capped with Cameroon and was a participant at the 2000 Olympic Games and at the 2002 FIFA World Cup. So far, he has gained 31 caps with Cameroon and has scored two goals. His first ever cap for Cameroon was on 26 November 1995, in a match against Gabon in Libreville for Bellier Africa Tournament. His debut was made while aged 17 years and 283, making him the tenth youngest player to gain a full cap for Cameroon at that time (16th nowadays). =2000 Summer Olympics football tournament= Epalle played in the opening match of Cameroon, coming in as a substitute in the 78th minute for Serge Branco, in a match that his team won by a 3‚Äì2 scoreline. He started the next match against United States, a 1‚Äì1 draw, but he was substituted by Daniel Kome in the 65th minute, just after the United States team scored its goal. He was benched in the two next matches, a 1‚Äì1 draw against the Czech Republic. The situation did not change in the quarter final match against Brazil, a match that Cameroon won 2‚Äì1 after extra time. He featured again in the semi-final, a 1‚Äì2 win over Chile, as he came in to replace Modeste Mbami in the 65th minute. In the final, against Spain he came in as a substitute in the 91st minute to replace Serge Branco for the extra-time. The score was 2‚Äì2 after extra-time and Cameroon finally won 5‚Äì3 in the penalty shoot-out to be named Olympic Gold Medallists. =2008 Africa Cup of Nations= Epalle was a starter in the opening match of the tournament for The Indomitable Lions,a 4‚Äì2 loss against defending champions Egypt. He was an unused substitute in Cameroon's 5‚Äì1 win against Zambia, but he reappeared in the final match of the group stage, a 3‚Äì0 win against Sudan. In the quarter final against Tunisia he came in as a substitute in the 62nd minute for Emana to help his team win the match, as he assisted Mbia, with a flick-on, to score the match decider in extra time. In the semi final, Epalle came in for Idrissou in the start of second half to help his team advance to the final. In the final Epalle was at the starting eleven, but he was substituted, in the 65th minute by M'bami, in a match that saw Egypt getting crowned Africa Cup of Nations champions for a sixth time. Coaching career Ahead of the 2014‚Äì15 season, Epalle was appointed manager of French Regional club Val d'Europe FC.Le Lion indomptable a de l'app√©tit, leparisien.fr, 27 January 2015 In September 2018 it was confirmed, that Epalle beside his manager position at Val d'Europe FC, also had been appointed the assistant manager of Cameroon national football team under newly appointed manager Clarence Seedorf alongside Patrick Kluivert and Jean-Alain Boumsong.Jo√´l Epalle : ¬´J‚Äôaiderai Seedorf et Kluivert du mieux possible¬ª, leparisien.fr, 23 September 2019 Personal life Epalle is married to Mari, with whom he has two daughters Marilyn and Zonti, both born in Greece and a son born in Paris.

Having served for seven years at the Pentagon, becoming chief of high-value targeting, Garlasco left in 2003 and joined Human Rights Watch (HRW) as a senior military expert, specializing in battle damage assessment, military operations, and interrogations for the Emergencies Division, where he investigated human rights issues in a number of different conflicts zones. The author of a World War II German anti-aircraft medals reference book, Garlasco was suspended by HRW with pay, \\"pending an investigation\\", on September 14, 2009, after it was alleged that he had collected Nazi memorabilia. Garlasco downplayed the controversy, indicating he collected German and US World War II memorabilia because of family history and his interest in military history.AFP, \\"Rights group suspends analyst over Nazi collection\\" He resigned from HRW in February 2010. He served as senior civilian protection officer for UNAMA in 2011, heading the UN's Protection of Civilians office. In early 2012, as the U.N. senior military advisor for the HRC's Independent Commission of Inquiry on Libya, he investigated civilian casualties while leading a survey of NATO's activities in Libya. Career Garlasco has a B.A. in government from St. John's University 1988‚Äì1992 and an M.A. in international relations from the Elliott School of International Affairs at the George Washington University(1992‚Äì1995) He lives in Pleasantville, New York. Garlasco was the senior military analyst in Human Rights Watch's (HRW) Emergencies Division. He specialized in battle damage assessment, military operations, and interrogations. =The Pentagon= He worked with a defense contractorWhite, Josh (2008-02-13). The Man on Both Sides of Air War Debate. The Washington Post. Retrieved 2009-09-09. before being hired as an intelligence professional at the Defense Intelligence Agency working in the Pentagon; he survived the 9/11 attack on the building. He claims he was Chief of High-value targeting in The Pentagon during the Second Gulf War where he claimed to lead the effort to track and target Saddam Hussein. The initial targets and attack, known as the \\"DECAP strike\\", was identified by the CIA and the actual attacks were planned by TLAM and F-117 (see:Dora Farms). Garlasco was a member of the Operation Desert Fox (Iraq) Battle Damage Assessment team in 1998, led a Pentagon Battle Damage Assessment team to Kosovo in 1999 and recommended several thousand aimpoints on targets during military operations in Iraq and Serbia. Later that year Garlasco debriefed Iraqi nationals to gather intelligence about Saddam Hussein. He described it as \\"contingency planning for a war that was probably never going to be fought.\\" He also participated in over 50 interrogations as a subject matter expert. In total, Garlasco served for seven years in the Pentagon. In 2003, Garlasco was responsible for dropping two, laser-guided, 500-kilogram bombs on a house in the Tuwaisi, neighborhood of Basra, Iraq, that he believed to contain Saddam Hussein's cousin Ali Hassan al-Majid, also known as Chemical Ali, the man responsible for launching poison gas attacks on Kurds in Iraq beginning in 1988. Watching the attack via satellite form a room in the Pentagon, Garlasco threw his arms in the air and shouted: \\"I just blew up Chemical Ali!\\" However, Chemical Ali was not in the house; 17 other people were killed instead. Garlasco left his Pentagon job in 2003 two weeks after the failed attack to take a position as senior military analyst at Human Rights Watch. Garlasco explained the calculus of civilian deaths in high-value targeting to the television news program 60 Minutes this way, \\"Our number was 30. So, for example, Saddam Hussein. If you're gonna kill up to 29 people in a strike against Saddam Hussein, that's not a problem. But once you hit that number 30, we actually had to go to either President Bush, or Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld.\\" Garlasco told the interviewer that prior to the invasion of Iraq, he personally recommended 50 high-value targets for air strikes, but, according to Garlasco, none of the targets on his list was actually killed. Rather, \\"a couple of hundred civilians at least\\" were killed in strikes he recommended. Garlasco defended the efforts made by the American military to minimize civilian casualties, \\"I don't think people really appreciate the gymnastics that the U.S. military goes through in order to make sure that they're not killing civilians\\".Bombing Afghanistan, Afghan President Tells 60 Minutes That Too Many Civilians Are Being Killed, Aug. 31, 2008, CBS News, 60 Minutes He responded to the question \\"If so much care is being taken why are so many civilians getting killed?\\" by stating \\"Because the Taliban are violating international law, and because the U.S. just doesn't have enough troops on the ground. You have the Taliban shielding in people's homes. And you have this small number of troops on the ground. And sometimes the only thing they can do is drop bombs.\\" =Human Rights Watch= After leaving the Pentagon, Garlasco joined Human Rights Watch as a senior military analyst; his task was to document laws-of-war violations and other atrocities committed during significant conflicts around the world. In an interview he gave for the Washington Post Garlasco described the transition from targeter to human rights advocate; \\"I had been a part of it, so it was a lot harder than I thought it would be. It really dawned on me that these aren't just nameless, faceless targets. This is a place where people are going to feel ramifications for a long time.\\" In December 2003, Garlasco co-authored the report 'Off Target ‚Äì The Conduct of the War and Civilian Casualties in Iraq' after carrying out field work with two other HRW staff to investigate the effect of the air war, ground war, and the immediate post-combat environment on civilians after the fall of Baghdad to U.S. led Coalition forces in the Iraq War. Garlasco and colleagues focused on the main fighting areas in the Tigris and Euphrates river valleys where civilian deaths had been reported, visiting ten cities in total. The report focused on the identification and investigation of potential violations of international humanitarian law by both Coalition and Iraqi forces together with the identification of patterns of conflict which may have resulted in avoidable civilian casualties. Garlasco and his co-author stated that Iraqi forces had committed various violations of international humanitarian law which may have resulted in significant civilian casualties and claimed that the widespread use of cluster munitions in populated areas by Coalition forces killed or wounded more than 1,000 civilians. In October 2004, Garlasco co-authored the report 'Razing Rafah: Mass Home Demolitions in the Gaza Strip' after carrying out research with two other HRW staff in the Gaza Strip, Israel, and Egypt. The report documented what it described as a \\"pattern of illegal demolitions\\" by the IDF in Rafah, a refugee camp and city at the southern end of the Gaza Strip on the border with Egypt where sixteen thousand people lost their homes after the Israeli government approved a plan to expand the de facto \\"buffer zone\\" in May 2004. Garlasco and colleagues examined the background to and effects of the demolitions, the security situation in Rafah, the IDF's main stated rationales for the demolitions, responding to and preventing attacks on its forces and the suppression of weapons smuggling through tunnels from Egypt, and concluded that in most cases the demolitions were \\"carried out in the absence of military necessity\\" in violation of international law. Garlasco has made it a personal objective to prevent the use of cluster munitions. He co-authored the 2006 Human Rights Watch report condemning Israel's use of such weapons in Lebanon and a report in 2008 documenting how civilians living in South Ossetia suffered the use of cluster munitions by both the Russian and Georgian armies.Flooding South Lebanon: Israel's Use of Cluster Munitions in Lebanon in July and August 2006. Human Rights Watch, 2/16/08A Dying Practice: Use of Cluster Munitions by Russian and Georgia in August 2008. Human Rights Watch, 4/14/09 Colin Kahl, a professor of security studies at Georgetown University, said that Garlasco \\"knows more about airstrikes than anyone in the world who isn't in the military currently\\", adding that \\"when Marc says stuff is messed up, the military has to take it seriously. It's not some wing nut in a human rights group out to get the military\\". According to Haaretz, Garlasco worked in the Pentagon for seven years and \\"was known over the last years of his career for his harsh condemnation of Israel\\".Former HRW analyst said to be avid collector of Nazi souvenirs, Haaretz, Sept. 10, 2009 John H. Richardson, a writer at Esquire, writes that Garlasco's work on torture scandals in Iraq resulted in testimony from American soldiers that led directly to John McCain's anti-torture amendment. Richardson also writes that Garlasco was one of the first foreigners to cross the border into Georgia during its war with Russia, and that during the Gaza War Garlasco lived in an apartment in the middle of the war zone and spent weeks visiting hospitals and bomb sites.Richardson, John.\\"Why Is This Good Man Getting Hung Out to Dry? \\" Esquire (Oct 2009). Accessed October 14, 2009. Garlasco has attracted some criticism for his reporting, with the Ottawa Citizen, for example, suggesting in an editorial that he \\"has made a career of painting Israel as a criminal state\\".Not-so-secret motives, Ottawa Citizen, September 16, 2009 (retrieved September 22, 2009) Garlasco appeared as an expert in the documentary film No End in Sight, which examined in detail some of the key decisions made by the US military and the Pentagon in the early days after the invasion of Iraq. He was also featured in a 60 Minutes story on US military targeting practices that aired October 28, 2007. Emma Daly confirmed in March 2010 that Garlasco resigned from Human Rights Watch in February 2010, and offered no elaboration.After ‚ÄòPost' query, HRW says top military analyst quit, Jerusalem Post, (retrieved March 5, 2010) =United Nations= Beginning in 2011, Garlasco served as senior civilian protection officer for United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA). Heading the UN's Protection of Civilians office, Garlasco monitored civilian casualty rates, and admonished Taliban leader Mullah Mohammad Omar to refrain from using mines. In early 2012, as the U.N. senior military advisor for the Human Rights Council's (HRC) Independent Commission of Inquiry on Libya, he investigated civilian casualties while leading a survey of NATO's activities in Libya. Suspension from HRW over Nazi memorabilia On September 14, 2009, Garlasco was suspended with pay after a controversy arose regarding when it was publicized that he collects Nazi memorabilia. Criticism that had started to appear, posted by what the Guardian called Pro-Israeli bloggers, had questioned the appropriateness of Garlasco's hobby. Garlasco has stated his hobby of collecting German and American World War memorabilia from the Second World War is because of his family history and his interest in military history. =Initial controversy= On September 9, 2009 The Jerusalem Post quoted blogger Omri Ceren saying that Garlasco is \\"obsessed with the color and pageantry of Nazism, has published a detailed 430-page book on Nazi war paraphernalia, and participates in forums for Nazi souvenir collectors\\".'HRW expert collects Nazi memorabilia', JPost, September 09 2009 Other newspapers such as The Guardian and Haaretz covered the controversy in the following days. The Guardian reported on what it described as \\"mounting internet attacks on Garlasco\\". Pro-Israeli bloggers had questioned the appropriateness of Garlasco's hobby and discovered one blogpost in which Garlasco wrote, \\"The leather SS jacket makes my blood go cold it is so COOL!\\" Israeli Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu's policy director commented that Human Rights Watch's employment of \\"a man who trades and collects Nazi memorabilia\\" as its senior military expert is a \\"new low\\". = HRW response = Though Garlasco initially responded to the allegations under the pen name Flak88, writing \\"I would reply, but I don't want to encourage them... Anyway, I doubt if they read my book. More than anything else, it is related to my work.\\" Maariv, Sept. 9, 2009, English translation available here He subsequently apologized, writing on Huffington Post, \\"I deeply regret causing pain and offense with a handful of juvenile and tasteless postings I made on two websites that study Second World War artifacts\\". Garlasco added, \\"I've never hidden my hobby, because there's nothing shameful in it, however weird it might seem to those who aren't fascinated by military history\\". He also wrote that the allegations of Nazi sympathies were \\"defamatory nonsense, spread maliciously by people with an interest in trying to undermine Human Rights Watch's reporting,\\" and that \\"I work to expose war crimes and the Nazis were the worst war criminals of all time\\". He added, \\"[p]recisely because it's so obvious that the Nazis were evil, I never realized that other people, including friends and colleagues, might wonder why I care about these things\\". He went on to say that \\"I told my daughters, as I wrote in my book, that \\"the war was horrible and cruel, that Germany lost and for that we should be thankful\\". HRW Communications Director Emma Daly at first responded to the charge by saying, \\"Marc Garlasco is not pro-Nazi. These allegations are monstrous. He does not delve into Nazi memorabilia. Garlasco is a student of military history and he has an interest in military history\\". HRW later issued an official statement that the accusation against Garlasco \\"is demonstrably false and fits into a campaign to deflect attention from Human Rights Watch's rigorous and detailed reporting on violations of international human rights and humanitarian law by the Israeli government,\\" adding that Garlasco \\"has never held or expressed Nazi or anti-Semitic views\\". HRW associate director Carroll Bogert accused The Guardian of \\"repeat[ing] defamatory nonsense unworthy of [the] newspaper,\\" adding that \\"[t]he allegations of pro-Nazi sympathies are part of a larger campaign to smear non-governmental organisations which criticise the Israel Defense Forces' conduct of the Gaza offensive\\". Iain Levine, the watchdog's programme director responded by saying that \\"The Israeli government is trying to eliminate the space for legitimate criticism of the conduct of the IDF, and this is the latest salvo in that campaign\\". In what has been described by Ed Pilkington of The Guardian as an \\"abrupt change of tact\\" (sic) for Human Rights Watch, Garlasco was \\"suspended with pay\\" from HRW pending an investigation. According to Bogert, \\"[W]e have questions as to whether we've learned everything we need to know\\". Regarding the suspension, HRW has indicated \\"This is not a disciplinary measure. Human Rights Watch stands behind Garlasco's research and analysis\\". =Other responses = Critics of Human Rights Watch have suggested that Garlasco's enthusiasm for Nazi-era badges and uniforms goes beyond historical interest and raises questions Nazi sympathy or anti-Semitism. NGO Monitor, an Israeli NGO that monitors human rights organisations for perceived political bias, described Garlasco's hobby as \\"problematic\\" and \\"insensitive\\". John Richardson of Esquire magazine wrote that because Garlasco has criticized Israel for alleged human-rights violations, \\"NGO Monitor has decided to try to destroy Marc Garlasco ‚Äî not to argue with him or dispute his statistics, but to destroy him personally.\\" Antony Lerman, former director of the Institute for Jewish Policy Research, wrote that Human Rights Watch failed to see Garlasco's hobby \\"could be used to discredit his role as author of highly critical reports of Israel's military conduct in Gaza\\". Lerman further wrote that Garlasco working \\"on reports critical of Hamas and Hezbollah was ignored\\", concluding that \\"as another excuse to attack HRW, and deflect attention from its reports' findings, the Garlasco affair was a gift\\". Yaron Ezrahi, a Professor of Political Science at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, said he did not believe that Mr. Garlasco's interest in memorabilia could support allegations of \\"premeditated bias,\\" though he indicated it may hurt Human Rights Watch's credibility, and that the revelations had \\"armed the right-wing fanatics\\" who try to \\"demonize\\" anybody who questions the effects of Israeli military operations. A group of ten Israeli rights groups also protested that the Israeli government has been attempting to \\"instill fear and silence or alarm vital organizations\\" that were engaging in free public discourse. In the Christian Science Monitor, Robert Marquand claimed Garlasco's critics were using him \\"to distract from or obfuscate findings that war crimes and crimes against humanity may have taken place in Gaza\\" and that a U.N. report by Richard Goldstone showed illegal white phosphorus use consistent with Garlasco's first hand testimony. In Nazi scandal hits human rights group, Katie Engelhart in Macleans magazine reported that \\"For HRW, the timing of the expos√© could not be worse. The group has thrown its weight behind the UN-sponsored Goldstone report, which accuses both Israel and the Palestinians of committing war crimes in the Gaza strip earlier this year. Garlasco's actions will surely lead many to question the group's credibility\\".Engelhart, K. Nazi scandal hits human rights group, Macleans, October 1, 2009 (retrieved October 15, 2009) According to The New York Times, HRW Middle East advisory committee member Helena Cobban questioned on her blog whether Garlasco's military collecting activities were \\"something an employer like Human Rights Watch ought to be worried about? After consideration, I say Yes\\".Rights Group Assailed for Analyst‚Äôs Nazi Collection, New York Times, John Schwartz, September 14, 2009 NGO Monitor head Gerald M. Steinberg, a Professor of Political Science at Bar Ilan University, argued that Human Rights Watch's response to the matter was \\"too little, too late\\". Cobban says in suspending Garlasco Human Rights Watch is now \\"in a better position to take part in the public discussion in this country on what our government should be doing with regard to the Goldstone report\\". =Aftermath = Emma Daly confirmed in March 2010 that Garlasco resigned from Human Rights Watch in February 2010, and offered no elaboration. A reporter from the Times Online attempted to contact Garlasco, who wouldn't comment. A friend of Garlasco's indicated he had \\"in effect\\" been fired, but had entered into a confidentiality agreement with HRW in which he would be paid for the remainder of his contract if he kept silent.

Wald (; born June 29, 1947 in New York City) is an American theoretical physicist who studies gravitation. His research interests include general relativity, black holes, and quantum gravity. He is also a science communicator and textbook author.  Life and education  He is the son of the mathematician and statistician Abraham Wald. Wald's parents died in a plane crash when he was three years old. He earned his Bachelor's degree from Columbia University in 1968 and his PhD in physics from Princeton University in 1972, under the supervision of John Archibald Wheeler. His doctoral dissertation was titled Nonspherical Gravitational Collapse and Black Hole Uniqueness.  Career and contributions  Between 1972 and 1974, Robert Wald worked as a research associate in physics at the University of Maryland. He then moved to the University of Chicago, spending two years as a postdoctoral fellow before joining the faculty in 1976. He wanted to move to Chicago in order to work with Robert Geroch and other specialists in gravitation. In 1977, Wald published a popular-science book titled Space, Time, and Gravity: The Theory of the Big Bang and Black Holes explaining Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, and its implications in cosmology and astrophysics. The book also gives a survey of what was then ongoing research on gravitational collapse and black holes. This book grew out of a series of lectures Wald gave as part of the Compton Lectures at the University of Chicago in the spring of 1976. The Compton Lectures, given every Spring and Fall quarter, are intended to explain notable advances in the physical sciences to members of the general public. He published the textbook General Relativity in 1984. Aimed at beginning graduate students, it covers spinors, the variational-principle formulation, the initial-value formulation, (exact) gravitational waves, singularities, Penrose diagrams, Hawking radiation, and black-hole thermodynamics.A Guide to Relativity Books. John C. Baez et al. University of California, Riverside. September 1998. Accessed January 18, 2019. Wald has taught first-year graduate courses covering a broad range of topics, including classical mechanics, quantum mechanics, statistical mechanics, and electromagnetism. He has also taught courses on general relativity, his specialty, at both introductory and advanced levels. A particularly effective teacher, he received the Graduate Teaching Award from the University of Chicago in 1997. Wald investigates black holes and their thermodynamics, and gravitational radiation-reaction (or self-force). Due to quantum-mechanical processes, black holes emit particles and therefore have a definite temperature and entropy. Wald has published over 100 research papers on general relativity and quantum field theory in curved spacetime, many of which have been cited by hundreds of subsequent papers. In 1993, he described the Wald entropy of a black hole, which is dependent simply on the area of the event horizon of the black hole. He organized The Symposium on Black Holes and Relativistic Stars in 1996, in honor of the late Nobel Prize-winning theoretical astrophysicist Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar. Distinguished speakers of this event included Stephen Hawking, Roger Penrose and Martin Rees. Although the event charged an entrance fee of $100, Wald made sure all University of Chicago students were admitted free of charge. Chandrasekhar founded a research group on general relativity at the University of Chicago, which includes Wald, James Hartle and Robert Geroch. Although Wald and Chandrasekhar never collaborated on any particular research projects, the two developed warm relations. He became a fellow of the American Physical Society (APS) in 1996 and a member of the National Academy of Sciences in 2001. He received the Einstein Prize from the APS Division of Gravitational Physics in 2017 for \\"the discovery of the general formula for black hole entropy, and for developing a rigorous formulation of quantum field theory in curved spacetime.\\" Wald delivered a public lecture at the University of Alabama in October 27, 2015, titled \\"The Formulation of General Relativity,\\" celebrating the centennial of Einstein's theory. Wald is a member of the LIGO group at the University of Chicago, headed by astrophysicist Daniel Holz. The Laser Interferometry Gravitational-wave Observatory detected gravitational waves for the first time in 2015, one century after Einstein predicted their existence.

Interpreted as a torus the Tonnetz has 12 nodes (pitches) and 24 triangles (triads). In musical tuning and harmony, the Tonnetz () is a conceptual lattice diagram representing tonal space first described by Leonhard Euler in 1739. Various visual representations of the Tonnetz can be used to show traditional harmonic relationships in European classical music. History through 1900 Euler's Tonnetz. The Tonnetz originally appeared in Euler's 1739 Tentamen novae theoriae musicae ex certissismis harmoniae principiis dilucide expositae. Euler's Tonnetz, pictured at left, shows the triadic relationships of the perfect fifth and the major third: at the top of the image is the note F, and to the left underneath is C (a perfect fifth above F), and to the right is A (a major third above F). The Tonnetz was rediscovered in 1858 by Ernst Naumann, and was disseminated in an 1866 treatise of Arthur von Oettingen. Oettingen and the influential musicologist Hugo Riemann (not to be confused with the mathematician Bernhard Riemann) explored the capacity of the space to chart harmonic motion between chords and modulation between keys. Similar understandings of the Tonnetz appeared in the work of many late-19th century German music theorists. Oettingen and Riemann both conceived of the relationships in the chart being defined through just intonation, which uses pure intervals. One can extend out one of the horizontal rows of the Tonnetz indefinitely, to form a never-ending sequence of perfect fifths: F-C-G-D-A-E- B-F#-C#-G#-D#-A#-E#-B#-Fx-Cx-Gx- (etc.) Starting with F, after 12 perfect fifths, one reaches E#. Perfect fifths in just intonation are slightly larger than the compromised fifths used in equal temperament tuning systems more common in the present. This means that when one stacks 12 fifths starting from F, the E# we arrive at will not be seven octaves above the F we started with. Oettingen and Riemann's Tonnetz thus extended on infinitely in every direction without actually repeating any pitches. The appeal of the Tonnetz to 19th- century German theorists was that it allows spatial representations of tonal distance and tonal relationships. For example, looking at the dark blue A minor triad in the graphic at the beginning of the article, its parallel major triad (A-C#-E) is the triangle right below, sharing the vertices A and E. The relative major of A minor, C major (C-E-G) is the upper-right adjacent triangle, sharing the C and the E vertices. The dominant triad of A minor, E major (E-G#-B) is diagonally across the E vertex, and shares no other vertices. One important point is that every shared vertex between a pair of triangles is a shared pitch between chords - the more shared vertices, the more shared pitches the chord will have. This provides a visualization of the principle of parsimonious voice-leading, in which motions between chords are considered smoother when fewer pitches change. This principle is especially important in analyzing the music of late-19th century composers like Wagner, who frequently avoided traditional tonal relationships. Twentieth-century reinterpretation Neo-Riemannian music theory's PLR operations applied to a minor chord Q. Recent research by Neo-Riemannian music theorists David Lewin, Brian Hyer, and others, have revived the Tonnetz to further explore properties of pitch structures. Modern music theorists generally construct the Tonnetz using equal temperament, and using pitch-classes, which make no distinction between octave transpositions of a pitch. Under equal temperament, the never- ending series of ascending fifths mentioned earlier becomes a cycle. Neo- Riemannian theorists typically assume enharmonic equivalence (in other words, Ab = G#), and so the two-dimensional plane of the 19th-century Tonnetz cycles in on itself in two different directions, and is mathematically isomorphic to a torus. Theorists have studied the structure of this new cyclical version using mathematical group theory. Neo-Riemannian theorists have also used the Tonnetz to visualize non-tonal triadic relationships. For example, the diagonal going up and to the left from C in the diagram at the beginning of the article forms a division of the octave in three major thirds: C-Ab-E-C (the E is actually an Fb, and the final C a Dbb). Richard Cohn argues that while a sequence of triads built on these three pitches (C major, Ab major, and E major) cannot be adequately described using traditional concepts of functional harmony, this cycle has smooth voice leading and other important group properties which can be easily observed on the Tonnetz. Similarities to other graphical systems The harmonic table note layout is a recently developed musical interface that uses a note layout topologically equivalent to the Tonnetz. A Tonnetz of the syntonic temperament can be derived from a given isomorphic keyboard by connecting lines of successive perfect fifths, lines of successive major thirds, and lines of successive minor thirds. Like a Tonnetz itself, the isomorphic keyboard is tuning invariant. The topology of the syntonic temperament's Tonnetz is generally cylindrical. Tonnetz aligned with the notes of an isomorphic keyboard. Tonnetz showing enclosed chords. Capitalized chords ('Xx') are major; others ('xx') are minor. The Tonnetz is the dual graph of Schoenberg's chart of the regions, and of course vice versa. Research into music cognition has demonstrated that the human brain uses a \\"chart of the regions\\" to process tonal relationships.

After starting professionally at Canon Sportif de Yaound√©, he went on to play in four countries: first Panachaiki F.C. in Greece then Spain's CF Extremadura, where he competed in both major divisions. In 2002, after Extremadura dropped another category to the third level, Kalla signed with VfL Bochum in Germany‚Äì he scored five times in his last season, second-best in the squad ‚Äì but the club was relegated from the Bundesliga. He also received a three-match ban for anti-doping rules breaching, in late 2003. Subsequently, Kalla joined Turkish side Sivasspor for the 2005‚Äì06 campaign, returning home for two final years at Union Douala and retiring at age 33. International career Kalla won 63 caps for Cameroon, and was a participant at three consecutive FIFA World Cups: 1994, 1998 and 2002. In the first he (aged 19) played all the matches and minutes, often being partnered by another youngster, Rigobert Song (17), in an eventual group stage exit. He was part of the victorious 2000 and 2002 African Cup of Nations squads. After the 2002 World Cup, Kalla announced to retire from the national team due to conflicts with the Federation structure, which he accused of poor organization, but eventually changed his mind. Initially summoned for the 2006 Africa Cup of Nations, Kalla was forced to withdraw due to injury, and retired for the second and definitive time.

His resume encompasses over 100 international mixed martial arts events since 1997. A long time martial arts practitioner and devotee, Quadros was the original host and play-by-play commentator for the PRIDE Fighting Championships alongside Bas Rutten (iN Demand PPV, Fox Sports Net, DVD, Japan) and has done play-by-play and color commentary for events such as the International Fight League (Fox Sports Net, USA), Cage Rage (SKY Sports, DVD, England), Hardcore Championship Fighting (BELL ExpressVU, DVD, Canada), World Extreme Cagefighting (HDNet, DVD, USA), K-1 World Grand Prix 2000 (ESPN, DVD, Japan), Rumble on the Rock (iN Demand PPV, USA), Too Hot To Handle (DVD, Netherlands), Kuwait Shidokan Jitsu Warriors War 1 (DVD, Kuwait), APEX Championship Fighting (TSN, DVD, Canada) and King of the Cage (DVD, USA). From 2007 to 2011, Stephen worked for Showtime Sports (premium cable, USA) where he called the action for (Strikeforce, Strikeforce Challengers, as well as ShoXC and EliteXC. Quadros was reunited with his PRIDE broadcasting partner Bas Rutten as part of the UFC Undisputed 3 video game (PlayStation, Xbox). When the game is played in \\"PRIDE Mode\\", Quadros and Rutten provide the commentary duties. Additionally Quadros was the host, along with San Diego sports radio personality Jeff Dotseth, of Clinch Gear Radio, a mixed martial arts (MMA) related program, that was broadcast weekly on Sirius XM (2010‚Äì2012). Clinch Gear Radio was also the voice of mixed martial arts for AFN, American Forces Network. He was also the host for the 2005 and 2006 Black Belt Hall of Fame Awards at Universal Studios. Working alongside his longtime Showtime cohort Mauro Ranallo, Quadros served as an analyst-color commentator and interviewer for GLORY World Series on CBS Sports Network, Spike TV, ESPN 2 (2012-2015).

Quadros also called the action on ShinZo: Fight Sport in Guatemala City, Guatemala with UFC Hall of Famer Stephan Bonnar. On August 1, 2014, Quadros was inducted into the Masters Hall of Fame for \\"Outstanding Contributions To The Martial Arts\\". The award ceremony was held in conjunction with the 50th anniversary of the Long Beach International Karate Championships, Ed Parker's tournament that previously showcased Bruce Lee, Chuck Norris, Joe Lewis, Mike Stone, Benny Urquidez, Bill Wallace and many more. Then on November 16, 2014, Quadros was inducted into the Legends of MMA Hall of Fame along with Art Davie, Big John McCarthy, Pat Miletich, Fedor Emelianenko and Rickson Gracie. After working practically non- stop for 15 years as a broadcaster-fight commentator, Quadros is very enthusiastic about resuming his acting career in Southern California. He has studied acting with William Alderson, Stella Adler, Milton Justice, Mark Haining (of Peggy Feury's \\"Loft\\" studio), Arthur Mendoza, Scott Bernstein's Comedy Plus and Michelle Danner (Larry Moss Studio). Music Quadros was the drummer for SNOW (1978‚Äì1981), a heavy metal band that included Quiet Riot guitarist Carlos Cavazo. SNOW opened for Iron Butterfly, Quiet Riot and Johnny Winter and headlined musical venues such as The Troubadour, The Starwood, Whisky A Go-Go, Pasadena Civic Auditorium and Santa Monica Civic Auditorium. The group independently released its only record in 1980, which included popular SNOW songs \\"Crack The Whip\\" and \\"No Way To Treat A Lady\\", and received airplay on Southern California radio stations KROQ and KLOS. Upon the departure of drummer Peter Criss, Gene Simmons spotted Quadros, while he was still a member of SNOW, in \\"Carmine Appice's 1st Annual Drum-off\\" video and invited him to audition for KISS, though Quadros did not land the position. Quadros also drummed for the Los Angeles-based rock bands Orange (1976‚Äì1977) and Dangerface (1982‚Äì1983). In 2004, Quadros appeared as a founding member of Sacred Cowboys, performing with the group at Los Angeles-area clubs such as the Knitting Factory, House of Blues (Hollywood) and the Cat Club. Fronted by W. Earl Brown of the HBO series ‚ÄúDeadwood,‚Äù Sacred Cowboys‚Äô single, Gear Grinding Daddy, is featured on the soundtrack of \\"Dunsmore,\\" an independent film in which Brown starred. Quadros is also a member of 7th Sun, along with JT Curtis (lead guitar, vocals), Adam Kury (bass, vocals) and Mike Russeck (keyboards, vocals), who released their debut album \\"From The Beginning\\" in 2008 (iTunes, Amazon, Rhapsody). Quadros, Curtis and Kury also compose the trio that is Whipped Cream, a Los Angeles-based Cream tribute band. Quadros and the Cavazo brothers, Carlos and Tony, have reformed SNOW, along with vocalist Andrew Freeman. The group played its first live gig in over three decades at The Key Club on the Sunset Strip on December 10, 2011. Film and television When tendonitis interrupted Quadros‚Äô musical career in the early 1980s, he transitioned into acting, broadcasting and journalism. Quadros has either starred, guest-starred or co-starred in more than 75 films and TV shows since 1988. His on-screen credits include Dr Caligari (1989), \\"Never Back Down: No Surrender\\" (2016) which was directed by action star Michael Jai White; \\"Demon Wind\\" (1990) as Chuck, The Kung Fu Magician; Cradle 2 the Grave (Jet Li, DMX) (2003); The Last Run (2004); Sworn to Justice (Cynthia Rothrock) (1996); CSI: Miami; Numb3rs; Without A Trace; Pacific Blue; Murder, She Wrote; and Walker, Texas Ranger (versus Chuck Norris). Quadros also played \\"Angel Martin\\" alongside Traci Lords in the (1991) movie Shock 'Em Dead. He was in CIA Code Name: Alexa (1993) as Max, where he went toe-to-toe in a fight scene with O.J. Simpson. Combining his theatrical training with an extensive martial arts background in Tae Kwon Do, Shotokan, WingTsun, boxing, kickboxing and submission grappling, Quadros also became a Hollywood fight choreographer. He served as fight coordinator for The Perfect Sleep (2006) and Skeleton Man (2004); fight technical advisor for Cradle 2 the Grave and Exit Wounds (Steven Seagal) (2001); and fight choreographer and 2nd unit director for Pit Fighter (2005).  Journalism  Quadros contributed to ‚ÄúBas Rutten's Big Books of Combat‚Äù and to ‚ÄúUFC's Ultimate Warriors: The Top Ten‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Ultimate Martial Arts Q&A; Book‚Äù. He also served as a judge for the Ultimate Fighting Championship 8. Stephen was the founding editor of Black Belt Presents: FIGHTSPORT with Stephen Quadros (2001‚Äì2002), a full-color glossy magazine with newsstand distribution published by Black Belt Magazine. Prior to that, Quadros was a contributing editor/columnist for Black Belt (1998‚Äì2001) and Fighters Only (2005‚Äì2006), editor-in-chief of Kickboxing Ring Report (1993‚Äì1998) and was published in popular combat sport publications such as Inside Kung Fu, Karate/Kung Fu Illustrated, Grappling Magazine and Full Contact Fighter. Quadros was the host of the eponymously titled Stephen Quadros Show on the Sherdog Radio Network, which debuted on June 12, 2007. It was a weekly, one-hour program that aired live on Tuesdays at 12:00 PM PST, featuring commentary by Quadros and co-host Aaron Crecy, listener calls and interviews. The show featured live segments with mixed martial arts stars such as Dan Henderson, Randy Couture, Quinton Jackson, Renzo Gracie, Frank Shamrock, Ken Shamrock, Bas Rutten, BJ Penn, Rashad Evans, Matt Lindland, Matt Serra, Ian Freeman and Don Frye. Quadros left Sherdog Radio Network in 2008, citing his schedule could no longer accommodate it. During Quadros' career as a broadcaster, he has been known for his creative descriptions of fighters and fights, occasionally giving nicknames, or coining terms or phrases. Case is point is \\"lay and pray,\\" a frequently used mixed martial arts (MMA) term coined by Quadros during the televised broadcast of the PRIDE Fighting Championships event titled ‚ÄúCold Fury‚Äù, which was held at the Saitama Super Arena in Japan on December 9, 2000. The phrase (‚Äòlay and pray‚Äô) refers to a situation where a wrestler or grappler keeps another fighter, who is perceived to have the better striking skills, pinned or controlled on the mat to avoid a stand up, boxing, kickboxing or Muay Thai style fight, yet exhibiting little or no urgency to finish the grounded opponent with a knockout or a submission. The inference is that the wrestler/grappler takes the striker down, lies on him to neutralize the opponent's striking weapons, and prays that they don't return to the standing position. At the PRIDE ‚ÄúCold Fury‚Äù show in 2000, in the 7th fight of the evening, former Japan national Greco-Roman wrestling champion Kazuyuki Fujita faced Dutch Muay Thai stylist Gilbert Yvel, in a classic wrestler versus striker mixed martial arts (MMA) matchup. The result a relatively slow-paced fight that ended in a decision, where Fujita took Yvel to the floor repeatedly and mostly just held him in the downed position, which lead PRIDE play-by-play announcer Stephen Quadros to utter the following passage in the final round during the broadcast: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs ground and pound, that‚Äôs when a wrestler, primarily, is on top and throws punches downward. But there‚Äôs also Bas (Rutten, Quadros's PRIDE broadcasting partner), can I coin a phrase tonight? Can you call it ‚Äòlay and pray‚Äô that they don‚Äôt stand up?‚Äù References External links * Stephen Quadros Home Page * Category:1952 births Category:American color commentators Category:American television personalities Category:Kickboxing commentators Category:Living people Category:Mixed martial arts broadcasters Category:People from Santa Cruz, California Category:Pride Fighting Championships Category:Strikeforce (mixed martial arts) ","title":"Stephen Quadros"},{"id":"5635937","text":"Lucas Scott \\"Luke\\" Woolmer (born 25 January 1965) is an Australian politician.

The sport was introduced to Fiji in the 1880s. Fiji is defined as a tier two rugby nation by World Rugby. The national team has competed at the Rugby World Cup and made it as far as the quarter finals. Their sevens team is also noted for their success, and have won the Rugby World Cup Sevens twice and the World Rugby Sevens Series three times. Governing body Fiji Rugby Union (FRU) is the governing body for the sport. It was founded in 1913, and joined the IRB in 1987.Bath pp 66, 67 It is divided into over 30 provincial unions. The Fiji Rugby Union is a member of the Pacific Islands Rugby Alliance (PIRA) along with Samoa and Tonga. The FRU was originally established as the Fiji Rugby Football Union, with the change in title coming about in 1963. The FRFU was formed in 1913 as the sport begun to grow. Fiji were awarded 'second tier' status by the International Rugby Board. By 1976, the union contained 750 clubs.Jones, p37 For a number of years, Fiji rugby suffered from a degree of racial segregation - the Native Rugby Union was formed in 1915, but did not merge with the national union until 1945. History =Early history= Rugby football was introduced into Fiji in the 1884 if not earlier, by Britons and New Zealanders, and Fijian soldiers of the Native Constabulary at Ba, on Viti Levu. By the early 1890s, the sport had started to draw attention from media outlets, such as newspaper and other print, and the game started to establish itself as a sport in the country. In its early years, it faced off strong competition from association football, but by 1904, rugby had won out as the stronger code in Fiji, and remains so today. At the turn of the twentieth century, a lot of the regular players were expatriates, however, by 1904, a domestic club competition had been organised; in the early years, there were racially segregated leagues with whites and native Fijians playing separately. The first formally organised club, Pacific, was formed in 1913 by New Zealander PJ Sheehan, a tradesman. The idea to form a rugby club came about from Sheehan and his co- workers, most who were New Zealand or Australian expatriates, and had no organised sporting club or competition. The club was founded with around 40 members. These matches became popular with the locals, as well as the European population in Fiji. Sheehan was approached by a European to consider the formation of a governing body. Thus, the Fiji Rugby Football Union was soon formed. The Cadets club and the United Services club were also established in this period. Sir Ernest Bickham Sweet-Escott, the governor of the colony at the time, donated the Escott Shield, with the purpose for competitive club competition. The first championship was won by the Pacific club. During this period, Sheehan arranged for the All Blacks to stop in Fiji on their way home from a tour of California in the United States. A match was organised between the All Blacks and a Fijian representative side. The All Blacks won 67 to 3, with Sheehan, the captain-coach getting the only points for the Fijian representative side. The Fijian team was made up of Europeans, as were most of the clubs at this point, though by now the locals had taken an enthusiastic interest in the game. Several Fijian locals approached Sheehan and asked him to teach the sport to the locals. Sheehan subsequently organised a match between two sides, all made up of local players. The game was played on a rainy afternoon, that, along with different interpretations of the rules, made the game difficult. By the following year, locals had formulated their own competition, and the clubs Taipou, Tarirere, Hill and Ofisa (police) had been established. Local businessman J Davies presented the Davies Cup for competition in 1915, which was first won by Tarirere. A governing body for the competition was established through the main Rugby union. On 18 August 1924, the national team played their first ever test, playing Western Samoa. The match was played in Samoa at 7 in the morning, so the Fijians could later continue onto Tonga that same day, as well, so the Samoans could work after the game. Fiji won the match 6 to nil, and continued on to a nine match tour of Tonga. The team actually wore black jerseys, as opposed to their now- traditional white ones. Spectators at their first game praised the visiting Fijians for their speed and agility. In 1926, two overseas sides visited Fiji, being the Auckland University College and the national team of Tonga. This became the first time that the national side of Fiji would wear their now traditional white jerseys and black shorts. Two years later, a domestic schools competition was started. The toured Fiji in 1938. It was in 1939 that Fiji Schools Union was established to govern school rugby. Also that year, Fiji embarked on a tour of New Zealand. The team became famous for becoming the first side to leave New Zealand without losing a match - winning seven and drawing one of their eight fixtures. The Fijians impressed the New Zealand crowds with their unpredictable and free-flowing style of rugby. After their final match against the New Zealand Maori, a newspaper wrote that \\"Fiji is destined to play a big part in world rugby\\". =1950s and 60s= Fiji toured New Zealand again in 1951, and were successful with most of their fixtures, winning eight of their games, losing five and drawing twice. As early as the 1950s, the Fijians toured Australia twice. The 1952 tour was notable for its record crowds in Australia: in the 1952 game at the Sydney Cricket Ground, a crowd of 42,000 turned up to watch. Fiji held the Wallabies to a one-a-piece drawn two-test series. The Farebrother-Sullivan Trophy, started in 1961 was for competition between Fijian sub-unions. Fiji returned two years later, achieving the same test series result, and breaking further crowd records. In 1963 the Fiji Rugby Football Union became the Fiji Rugby Union (FRU). 's first tour to Europe came in 1964. and they played and and a variety of local teams. Their first match in Europe was against France in Paris, where they lost 21 to 3. They went on to play another five matches against various French teams. They then played a test against Wales XV at Cardiff Arms Park, where they lost only 28 to 22. Fiji then continued on to play another three Welsh sides. =1970s, 80s and 90s= The Hong Kong Sevens tournament for rugby sevens was introduced in 1976 and the Fiji sevens team won the title in its second year of competition, in 1977. Fiji went on to win in 1978 and again in 1980 as well as the 1984 tournament. Fiji won the tournament another five times during the 1990s making themselves one of the most dominant sevens sides in the world. However, some commentators have blamed Fijians' love of rugby sevens as being to the detriment of the XV-a-side game. Despite its isolation and small population, Fiji has regularly punched above its weight, and threatened to challenge the \\"Big Eight\\" - one of the most recent examples of this was in the 2007 Rugby World Cup. From 1982 through to 1984, Fiji completed a 15 match winning streak. The national side were invited by the International Rugby Football Board to participate in the inaugural Rugby World Cup in 1987 that was to be hosted by Australia and New Zealand. In their first World Cup match, Fiji defeated Argentina 28 to 9 in Hamilton. They were subsequently defeated by the All Blacks, 74 to 13, and Italy, 18 to 15, but they still finished second in their group, which allowed them to go through to the quarter finals where they lost to France, 16 to 31. However, they have often been challenged by their South Pacific neighbours, Tonga and Samoa, who are the other two parts of the Pacific Championship. In the 1987 Rugby World Cup, which was invitation only, Tonga and Fiji were invited, with Fiji making it to the quarter finals where they lost to France, which ended their World Cup campaign. In the 1991 Rugby World Cup, they lost all three of their games, and they did not even qualify for the 1995 tournament. However, the Fiji sevens team won the Rugby World Cup Sevens three years later. Fiji found itself increasingly excluded from the Tri-Nation group - Australia, New Zealand and South Africa - which denied them entry to the Super 12, and hindered development of the game internationally. Professionalisation was a mixed blessing for the Fijian game. On the one hand, it meant that the Fiji team could call on professional talent, and on the other, it meant a \\"brawn drain\\", as players such as Serevi, Rosari, Bale and Vidiri were drawn out of Fiji, and into the leagues of Japan and New Zealand, which diminished the domestic competition. Fiji qualified for the 1999 Rugby World Cup in Wales and were grouped in pool C. After strong pool victories over Namibia and Canada, they lost their last game against France. Their pool wins saw them finish second in their pool behind France, and move through to the finals. They lost to England at Twickenham, 45 to 24. Political unrest in Fiji during 2000 forced the FRU to accept the cost of hosting international meets in Samoa, instead of Fiji. =Present day= Fiji qualified for the 2003 Rugby World Cup in Australia and were grouped in pool B. They lost their opening match to France 61 to 18, won a subsequent close game over the United States 19 to 18, defeated Japan but lost their last pool game to Scotland by two points. They finished third in their pool, which did not take them to the finals. In the 2007 Rugby World Cup Fiji were grouped in pool B with Australia, Wales, Japan and Canada. In their final group game they beat Wales 38-34 and went through to the next round, sending Wales home. They were beaten by eventual champions South Africa in the knockout stage. There are over 600 clubs in Fiji. =Notable players= Some notable Fijian players include - * Waisale Serevi, a mercurial fly-half. * Mesake Rasari, a giant second rower. * Paula Bale * Joeli Vidiri Two Fijian players were chosen for the President's Overseas XV squad, selected to play England at the anniversary of the English Rugby Football Union: *Jona QoroStarmer-Smith, Nigel (ed) Rugby - A Way of Life, An Illustrated History of Rugby (Lennard Books, 1986 ) pp 106, 107 (including portrait of each player) *George Barley Competition =Colonial Cup= The Colonial Cup was introduced by the Fiji Rugby Union to identify and prepare local players for the international stage. The national side and 'A' team were selected from Colonial Cup players, as well as including overseas players. In 2007 a new team entered the competition leading to six teams in the competition. =Pacific Rugby Cup= The IRB Pacific Rugby Cup started in 2006 and involves representative teams from the three Pacific rugby unions, Fiji along with Samoa and Tonga. Fiji has two sides in the tournament, the Fiji Warriors and the Fiji Barbarians. The aim of the tournament is to improve the quality of rugby in the Pacific Islands. Representative teams Fiji sevens team at the 2006 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne. =National= Fiji have competed at seven World Cups since the tournament was first held in 1987. They made the quarter-finals in 1987 and in 1999. Fiji also compete in the Pacific Tri- Nations alongside Samoa and Tonga. Fiji also participate in the IRB Pacific 5 Nations, again with Samoa and Tonga, as well as Japan and the Junior All Blacks. Fiji perform the cibi as part of their pre-match traditional. The Fiji kit is made up of white jerseys with black shorts. Fiji also participate in the Pacific Tri-Nations series between Tonga, Fiji and Samoa which has been played since 1982. The Pacific Nations Cup is a competition which involves Fiji, Samoa, Tonga as ell as the Junior All Blacks and the Japan and Australia A. =National (sevens)= Fiji are one of the most successful sevens nations. They won the Hong Kong Sevens tournament in 1977, and have since won it another eight times. They are also the only side to have won the Rugby World Cup Sevens on two occasions; in 1997 (defeating South Africa in the final) and in 2005 (defeating New Zealand in the final). The World Sevens Series was introduced in 2000, and New Zealand won the first six series in a row. However, at the 2006 event, Fiji put an end to their winning streak, becoming the 2006 World Sevens Series champions. They also won a gold medal at the Rio Olympics in 2016, the first Olympic medal in the country's history, when they defeated Great Britain in the final.

Early life Egon Ferdinand Ranshofen-Wertheimer was born as the son of the Catholic land owner and member of the Upper Austrian parliament Julius Wertheimer in Ranshofen near Braunau. His family had Jewish roots, so they fled Austria in 1938 because of the growing threat of the Nazi government. His town of birth, Braunau am Inn, was also the birthplace of Adolf Hitler. During World War I, he was introduced to Marxist ideology and studied in Vienna, Munich, and Heidelberg after the war. He later developed a more and more pragmatic attitude and became a social democrat. He started to work as an editor in Hamburg and until 1930 as a foreign correspondent for the social-democratic newspaper Forward in London. In this period, he wrote his first book, Portrait of the British Labour Party, which became a bestseller and he made first contact with Leopold Kohr, a young journalist and economist from Salzburg, later author of The Breakdown of Nations. His book raised the awareness of the British government, which had an important influence on the League of Nations. Therefore, he was able to work as a diplomat and supervisor of the League of Nations for 10 years in Geneva, beginning in 1930. United States of America Because of the deteriorating situation in Europe, he emigrated to America, where he worked at American University in Washington, D.C., as a professor. In addition, he was employed as a consultant of the United States State Department and supported the US government in the struggle against Hitler. There, he and his younger colleague Leopold Kohr began to criticize Nazi Germany through media such as The New York Times. Post-war period Tizzy von Trapp honored with the Egon Ranshofen-Wertheimer Award in Braunau am Inn. Shortly after the Second World War, Egon Ranshofen began to work as an executive, supervisor, and diplomat for the UN. His book A Great Experiment in International Administration had a substantial influence on the development of the UN. Ranshofen-Wertheimer and Kohr also lobbied for an independent Austria. That the young second republic of Austria became a member of the UN rather quickly can be attributed to the engagement of Ranshofen- Wertheimer. Egon Ranshofen-Wertheimer is buried in his family grave in the cemetery of the castle of Ranshofen. Reception Braunau Contemporary History Days 16 September 2007, with the title ‚ÄúPeacemakers manual‚Äù, focused on the life of Egon Ranshofen-Wertheimer.

His great- grandfather was Jon Flatab√∏ from Kvam in Hardanger, one of the pioneer authors of popular literature in Norway. Egeland's novels are published in 24 languages. His most famous novel is Sirkelens ende, published in English under the title Relic, which deals with several of the same topics as The Da Vinci Code. Egeland's book was published in 2001, two years before The Da Vinci Code. European readers and critics quickly noted some striking similarities between the Da Vinci Code and Relic. Like The Da Vinci Code, Relic involves an ancient mystery and a worldwide conspiracy, the discovery that Jesus was married to Mary Magdalene, and an albino as one of the central characters. In both novels, the main female character turns out to be the last living descendant of Christ and Mary Magdalene, and the daughter/granddaughter of the last grand master of a secret order. Many European readers have speculated that Dan Brown had plagiarized Tom Egeland's book. Since the Norwegian novel had not yet been translated into English when The Da Vinci Code came out, it is generally assumed today that the similarities between the two books, although striking, are coincidental. The author himself, Tom Egeland, has in numerous interviews in European media, and on his own website,http://www.tomegeland.com/no/books/sirkelens+ende/sirkelensende dismissed the claim of Brown's novel plagiarizing his own novel, stating that the similarities just show that he and Brown more or less have done the same research and found the same sources. Egeland's novel Guardians of the Covenant has been translated into 17 languages. Both Guardians of the Covenant and the 2001 bestseller Relic have been acquired by the British publishing house John Murray. The thriller Night of the Wolf (2005) - about Chechen terrorists taking control over a live television debate show - as also been made into a feature-length movie and a TV mini-series. Egeland wrote the script himself. In 2007 Tom Egeland published two books: The Girl in the Mirror (for young adults) and Guardians of the Covenant, a thriller with the same main character as Relic: The albino archaeologist Bj√∏rn Belt√∏. Egeland's thriller The Gospel of Lucifer was published in Norwegian in May 2009 and has been translated into 12 languages. The novel was awarded the Norwegian Riverton Prize for best crime novel 2009.http://www.vg.no/rampelys/artikkel.php?artid=594202 According to IMDB, he was an extra in The Empire Strikes Back, portraying one of the rebel soldiers fighting in the Battle of Hoth. In the autumn of 2016, Egeland became the center of controversy after he was banned by Facebook for publishing the iconic war photograph of \\"the Napalm girl\\" Phan Th·ªã Kim Ph√∫c on his personal Facebook page. Facebook eventually reconsidered its opinion on this picture and republished it, recognizing \\"the history and global importance of this image in documenting a particular moment in time\\". Egeland has been president of the Norwegian Crime Writers' Association (Rivertonklubben) since 2015 and has been a board member of the Norwegian Authors' Union (Den norske Forfatterforening) since 2010. He is a book critic for the Norwegian newspaper VG (Verdens Gang).

Education and career Holbourn was educated at the Slade School of Art and Merton College at Oxford. As a young man he became fond of the remote Scottish island of Foula, which he succeeded in purchasing around 1900, thus becoming its laird. He was a co-founder of Ruskin College, and served on the college's correspondence and examining staff for many years. He was also appointed professor of the University of California art and architecture extension program, and was instrumental to the expansion of the art department of Carleton College in Minnesota, where he served part-time as a professor of art and archaeology. RMS Lusitania Holbourn was a second-class passenger on the RMS Lusitania on her last voyage in May 1915. During the voyage, Holbourn befriended 12-year-old Avis Dolphin, who was being escorted to school and family in England by two nurses, Hilda Ellis and Sarah Smith. With his insights into the largely hushed-up events surrounding the wreck of the RMS Oceanic off Foula, Professor Holbourn was aware of the imminent dangers presented to ocean liners during the First World War, and as a passenger on Lusitania was prepared to face the worst. Holbourn attempted to insist that Captain William Thomas Turner should take the precautions of ordering lifeboat drills and instructing passengers on how to wear lifejackets. His efforts to stimulate safety awareness during a time of war were unwelcome, and he was asked to keep quiet. When the ship was torpedoed, Holbourn guided Avis Dolphin and her nurses to his cabin where he fitted them with life belts, even offering up his own; he then steered them through the tilting passageways to the decks above and into a lifeboat. This lifeboat capsized while being lowered into the water. Nevertheless, Avis was saved, though her nurses were not. Holbourn himself dived into the ocean to find himself surrounded by a mass of bodies and wreckage. His hope of reaching the nearest boat was interrupted when he stopped to help a man who was floating helplessly nearby. By the time Holbourn found his way to a boat, the man he had pulled along with him was dead. Holbourn was picked up by the fishing boat Wanderer of Peel and later transferred to the Stormcock. He was one of over 750 rescued from the Lusitania to arrive at Queenstown in Ireland that night. Writings Holbourn continued to write and remained lifelong friends with Avis Dolphin. One of his books, The Child of the Moat (1916), was written for Avis because she had complained that books for girls were uninteresting. On most of his written works, Holbourn is identified as Ian Bernard Stoughton Holbourn. His published works include: *Jacopo Robusti, Called Tintoretto. (1903,). London: G. Bell. *Children of Fancy (Poems). (1915). New York: G. Arnold Shaw. *The Need for Art in Life. (1915). Haldeman- Julius Company. *The Child of the Moat, A Story for Girls, 1557 A.D.

It was commissioned in 1998 from the sculptor Neil Simmons by the Speaker's Advisory Committee on Works of Art; paid for by an anonymous donor, it was intended for a plinth among statues of former Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom in the Members' Lobby of the House of Commons. However as the House did not permit a statue to be erected there during its subject's lifetime, the work had been temporarily housed in Guildhall. It was unveiled there by Thatcher in February 2002. Decapitation On 3 July 2002, theatre producer Paul Kelleher decapitated the statue while it was on display at Guildhall Art Gallery. Having unsuccessfully taken a swing at the statue with a Slazenger V600 cricket bat concealed in his trousers, Kelleher picked up a metal pole from a nearby rope cordon and used it to decapitate the ¬£150,000 statue. After the vandalism he waited to be arrested by the police who arrived minutes later. He joked on capture: \\"I think it looks better like that.\\" Following the loss of its head, the statue was removed from display. Although it was estimated that the work could be repaired for about ¬£10,000, statue experts worried that it would never be the same. At his first trial, Kelleher said in his defence that the attack involved his \\"artistic expression and my right to interact with this broken world\\". The jury, despite nearly four hours of deliberation and a direction from the judge that it could decide by majority, failed to agree on whether or not he had \\"lawful excuse\\". He was retried in January 2003, found guilty of criminal damage and sentenced to three months in jail. On 21 February 2007, a new statue of Thatcher was commissioned in 2003 from sculptor Antony Dufort and this time in tougher silicon bronze. It was erected on the reserved plinth in the Members' Lobby. The rule against living subjects had been relaxed by this stage and Thatcher unveiled the statue. By then, the marble statue had been repaired, but it remains in Guildhall. After several years in the Guildhall Art Gallery, the statue was moved to a corridor location elsewhere in the Guildhall building.

Francesco Barberini (23 September 1597 ‚Äì 10 December 1679) was an Italian Catholic Cardinal. The nephew of Pope Urban VIII (reigned 1623‚Äì1644), he benefited immensely from the nepotism practiced by his uncle. He was given various roles within the Vatican administration but his personal cultural interests, particularly in literature and the arts, meant that he became a highly significant patron. His secretary was the antiquarian Cassiano dal Pozzo who was also a discerning patron of the arts. Francesco was the elder brother of Cardinal Antonio Barberini and Taddeo Barberini who became Prince of Palestrina. Career He was born in Florence to Carlo Barberini and Costanza Magalotti, and studied at the University of Pisa where he was assisted by family friend Galileo Galilei,Catholic.net ‚Äì Galileo's contribution to the Church graduating in canon and civil law in 1623. On 2 October the same year, his uncle, Maffeo Barberini, newly elected as Pope Urban VIII, made him a cardinal, state secretary and papal legate to Avignon when he was twenty six years old. He held the latter position until 1633. According to contemporary, John Bargrave, the Pope regularly referred to his nephew as cardinal padrone (\\"cardinal master\\"),Pope Alexander the Seventh and the College of Cardinals by John Bargrave, edited by James Craigie Robertson (reprint; 2009) much to the displeasure of visiting Catholic diplomats who argued that they had only one padrone; the Pope himself. In 1625, he went to Paris as special legate and from March to September, undertook various negotiations with Cardinal Richelieu such as the dispute about Valtellina with Spain including discussions in advance of the Treaty of Mon√ßon. Overall, the negotiations were not a political success for the papacy but as a ‚Äòsweetener‚Äô he received a gift of six tapestries from King Louis XIII, designed by Peter Paul Rubens.Haskell, Francis. Patrons and Painters, Yale University Press, 1980, p. 44 In 1625 he travelled to Spain as papal legate and this mission was also unsuccessful. He returned to Rome the following year. From 1628 he effectively led the foreign diplomacy of the Papal States, showing a clear stance favoring France in the war of succession for the Marquisate of Montferrat and during the Thirty Years' War. In 1632 he was appointed papal Vice-Chancellor. Cardinal Francesco Barberini by Andrea Sacchi As the Grand Inquisitor of the Roman Inquisition, a post he held from 1633 until his death, he was part of the Inquisition tribunal investigating Galileo; he was one of three members of the tribunal who refused to condemn Galileo.The other two were Cardinals Laudivio Zacchia and Gaspare Borgia S. Miranda: Cardinal L. Zacchia Hostilities between the papacy and the Farnese Duchy of Parma and Piacenza resulted in the War of Castro in 1641, from which the papacy did not emerge well, and peace was only concluded months before the death of Urban in 1644. Once it had become clear that the Barberini candidate for his successor, Cardinal Giulio Sacchetti, was not going to be elected by the papal conclave of 1644, Francesco and Antonio Barberini switched their vote to support Giovanni Battista Pamphili in the hope that he might look more favorably upon them. They were wrong. Pamphili, who took the name of Innocent X (1644‚Äì1655) instigated investigation into their handling of the finances in the War of Castro forcing first Antonio to flee to Paris in 1645, to be followed by Francesco and his brother Taddeo Barberini in 1646.Haskell, 1980, p. 59 Here they remained under the protection of Cardinal Mazarin. Two years later, Francesco was pardoned by the pope who restored confiscated properties to him.In 1645 he became bishop of Sabina On his return to Rome, Francesco resumed his role as a patron of arts although on a reduced scale. Again from Bargrave comes an interesting insight into Barberini's character ‚Äì the cardinal refused to meet with Bargrave (despite a number of requests over some 11 months) on the basis that he held letters of introduction addressed to cardinals Capponi and Panciroli but not to him, suggesting Bargrave had met with others first. In 1666 he became Dean of the College of Cardinals, taking part in the conclaves of 1667, 1669‚Äì1670 and 1676. He died in Rome in 1679 at the age of eighty two. Patronage  Francesco Barberini was active as a patron of the arts both as a private patron and within broader spheres. He was a member of several learned and literary associations, including the Accademia dei Lincei.http://www.bl.uk/catalogues/ItalianAcademies/PersonFullDisplay.aspx?RecordId=022-000000096&searchAssoc;=Assoc accessed 9/7/2017 In 1623 he became a member of the Conregazione della Reverenda Fabbrica di San Pietro and was able to secure altarpiece commissions for St Peter‚Äôs by artists such as Giovanni Lanfranco, Andrea Sacchi, Pietro da Cortona, Nicolas Poussin, Simon Vouet and Valentin. Privately, he bought several paintings by Poussin during the artist's early years in Rome. In 1625, he acquired the Sforza palace on the Quirinal Hill in Rome and a year later gave it to his brother Taddeo. After buying further land around the palace, the architect Carlo Maderno was engaged to transform the site into a much larger and grander palace which became the Palazzo Barberini and effectively the family palace with Taddeo and his family living in one wing and Francesco in the other. Francesco and Urban were on hand to advise on its decoration. An iconographic programme celebrating the Barberini family, devised by the Tuscan poet Francesco Bracciolini for the vast coved vault of the main salone, was carried out by Pietro da Cortona in an exuberant display of illusionism, colour, movement and ornamentation that marked a new departure for secular Baroque interior decoration. Also at the Palazzo Barberini, Francesco established the Arazzia Barberini or Barberini Tapestry works in 1627 which remained open until 1679, Its production included six tapestries designed by Cortona on the theme of the ‚ÄòStory of Constantine‚Äô to complement those the Cardinal had received from the French king in 1625, designed by Rubens.‚ÄòBarberini Tapestry Workshop‚Äô, Oxford Art Online With Cortona busy with the Barberini vault, Francesco began to engage Cortona‚Äôs pupil Giovan Francesco Romanelli to carry out other paintings and altarpieces, and also made him Supervisor of the Tapestry works Haskell, 1980, p. 53 He founded a rich library at the Palazzo Barberini which included ancient Greek and Roman manuscripts, and he supported numerous European intellectuals, scholars, scientists and artists, including Athanasius Kircher, Jean Morin, Gabriel Naud√©, Gerhard Johann Vossius, Heinsius and John Milton.In 1902, the large Biblioteca Barberina was purchased by Pope Leo XIII and became part of the Vatican holdings. Magnuson, Torgil. Rome in the Age of Bernini, volume 1, Stockholm, 1982, p.239 Also at the Palazzo Barberini, he initiated a small natural science museum and botanical garden and his collections attested to his interests in ancient sculpture, numismatics and inscriptions.Magnuson, 1982, p.238-9 The Libellus de Medicinalibus Indorum Herbis, sometimes referred to as the Codex Barberini, was named in his honour. Cardinal Francesco Barberini contributed financially to churches in Rome. As protector of the Academy of Saint Luke, the artists guild in Rome, he dedicated funds for the construction of the Academy's church of Santi Luca e Martina, designed by Cortona. He built the church of San Bonaventura al Palatino, rebuilt San Giacomo alla Lungara and San Salvatore in Campo, restored the church of Santa Maria in Palmis (also called Domine Quo Vadis) and San Sebastiano al Palatino, had the choir of San Lorenzo in Damaso remodelled, and paid for the wooden ceiling of Sant'Agata dei Goti.Blunt, Anthony. Guide to Baroque Rome, Granada, 1982 Although initially he made funds available for the construction of San Carlo alle Quattro Fontane designed by Francesco Borromini, these were not sustained. He also commissioned various monuments for church interiors, including ones to G. Aleandro and B. Guglielmi who had been his teachers, in San Lorenzo fuori le Mura and designed by Cortona.

History Desludging trucks of Manila Water in 2012 Manila Water Company, a publicly listed company and a subsidiary of Ayala Corporation, holds the exclusive right to provide water and used water services to over six million people in the Manila Water Concession, particularly the East Zone of Metro Manila and Rizal Province consisting of 23 cities and municipalities. The National Water Crisis Act enacted by the Philippine government paved the way for government- run Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System (MWSS) to turn over the operation of water utilities in the East Zone concession to Ayala-led Manila Water, and the West Zone of Metro Manila to Maynilad Water Services, Inc. in August 1997. This was brought about by the various water supply problems when only 26 percent of the area's population had access to round-the-clock water supply due to high system losses caused by illegal connections, meter tampering, and leaking pipelines. This Concession Agreement was originally for a period of 25 years, due to expire in 2022. In 2009, it was extended by another 15 years by MWSS and the Philippine government, extending the concession until 2037. As the agent and concessionaire of MWSS, the Concession Agreement gives Manila Water the right to the use the land and operational fixed assets, and the exclusive right to extract and treat raw water, distribute and sell water, and collect, transport, treat and dispose used water discharged by the sewerage system in the East Zone. Services Since 1997, the Company has been significantly improving its water and used water services by expanding its distribution lines and eliminating system losses in its coverage areas, resulting in increased water availability from 26% in 1997 to 99% of the central distribution system to date. Manila Water provides water treatment, water distribution, sewerage and sanitation services to over six million people in the East Zone to a broad range of residential, semi- business, commercial, and industrial customers in 23 cities and municipalities that includes Makati, Mandaluyong, Pasig, Pateros, San Juan, Taguig, Marikina, most parts of Quezon City, portions of Manila, as well as the following towns of Rizal: Angono, Antipolo, Baras, Binangonan, Cainta, Cardona, Jalajala, Morong, Pililla, Rodriguez, San Mateo Tanay Taytay and Teresa. =Manila Concession Water Sources= Manila Water gets its water from Angat Dam at the Angat River in Norzagaray, Bulacan, which is 38 kilometers north of Metro Manila. It is a rockfill dam with a spillway equipped with three gates at a spilling level of 217 meters. Angat Dam supplies 96% of Metro Manila's water needs with a storage capacity of about 850 million cubic meters. Five auxiliary turbines release water from Angat Dam, where it is diverted to the two tunnels going to Ipo Dam. Ipo Dam is a gravity-concrete dam located about 7.5 kilometers downstream of the Angat Dam in Bulacan. Primarily a diversion dam, its elevation is maintained at 101 meters as it delivers water into tunnels that lead to La Mesa reservoir and Balara Filtration plants through three tunnels leading to three settling basins in Bicti, Norzagaray, Bulacan. Five aqueducts connected to these settling basins will then deliver a maximum of 4,000 million liters of water daily at the Novaliches Portal, which will then be conveyed through three open channels going to the Balara Treatment Plant. La Mesa Dam is an earth dam located in Novaliches, Quezon City and it serves as a primary sedimentation basin prior to water treatment in the Balara and East La Mesa Treatment Plants. Its maximum level is at 80.15 meters. During dry months, La Mesa Dam may be used as a buffer or reliability dam to provide supply. It can store water that is good for 19 days of Manila Water's supply requirements. Its critical dam level is at 69 meters above sea level. Manila Water has also begun drawing water from the Laguna Lake, which is treated in and distributed from the Cardona Water Treatment Plant located in Brgy. Del Remedio, Cardona, Rizal. Commencing operations on March 14, 2019, the water treatment plant is now providing up to 100 million liters of potable water per day to several towns in Rizal, augmenting water supply to Manila Water's concession area while alternative major water sources are being developed. =Water Treatment Facilities= Manila Water operates four water treatment plants: Balara Filter 1, Balara Filter 2, and East La Mesa, all located in Quezon City, as well as the Cardona Water Treatment Plant in Rizal. The Balara Treatment Plants filter the equivalent of 6.5 billion glasses of water every day. The Balara Filter 1, operational since 1935, has a treatment capacity of 470 million liters per day. On the other hand, Balara Filter 2 has been operational since 1958 and treats 1,130 million liters of water daily. Both treatment plants deliver water to Metro Manila's eastern area. The East La Mesa Treatment Plant, located in Payatas, Quezon City, has a capacity of treating 150 million liters of water per day. Since 2012, it supplies water to far-flung expansion areas in the Rizal Province, improving the supply balance of the entire network. The Cardona plant, with a capacity of treating 100 million liters of water per day, employs a more rigorous and complex treatment process and types of equipment compared to other existing water treatment plants because of the diverse quality of water from Laguna Lake. The process includes treatment for suspended solids, organic matter, algae and dissolved solids. The treatment plant is complemented by 45 kilometers of transmission lines plus 61 kilometers of distribution lines. =Water Distribution= Manila Water's distribution system consists of transmission and distribution lines, pumping stations, and reservoirs to ensure that potable water is delivered to all customers. Pipelines laid and maintained across the East Zone since 1997 have spanned over 5,000 kilometers, serving 99 percent of the Company's concession area with a water supply pressure of 7 PSI and above. =Water Sampling and Laboratory Analysis= On a regular basis, Manila Water's Laboratory Services processes an average of around 900 water samples from the distribution network monthly. This is to ensure that water to be delivered to the customers passes not only the regulatory standards on quality, but also to 100% comply with the Philippine National Standards for Drinking Water (PNSDW). =Used Water Services= Manila Water also provides sewerage and sanitation services. Sewerage services of Manila Water include the operation and maintenance of sewer pipeline networks that collect and convey sewage to a Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) which cleans the used water before safely returning the treated water to rivers. To address the sewage and sanitation needs of its service areas, Manila Water constructed compact or ‚Äúpackage‚Äù sewage treatment plants to serve specific areas or communities. Manila Water also utilizes a Combined Sewer-Drainage System in the collection of used water from households, utilizing the existing municipal drainage system for used water conveyance. This minimizes the laying of separate sewer lines. Manila Water has laid over 300 kilometers of sewer pipelines that goes to 38 sewage treatment plants with a combined treatment capacity of 310 million liters daily. =Sanitation= Around 85 percent of Metro Manila's East Zone are not yet covered by a sewer system. These households still utilize their own septic tanks that contains used water called septage. Since septic tanks only get partial treatment, these will eventually leak into the environment if not maintained properly. To address the possible leakage of septic tanks into the rivers and other water systems, Manila Water offers a sanitation service that collects the sludge from septic tanks. Siphoned sludge is then brought to Septage Treatment Plants where it is treated and returned to the environment safely. Manila Water manages two septage treatment plants that treats collected sludge to safely return the used water back to the environment. This sanitation program is carried out through barangay officials. Subsidiaries A subsidiary of Manila Water Company, Inc., Manila Water Philippine Ventures (MWPV) covers the country's key metropolitan areas including Cebu, Laguna, Tanauan City in Batangas, Clark in Pampanga, Zamboanga City, Tagum City in Davao and key locations in Bulacan, Pangasinan, Isabela, Nueva Ecija, Iloilo and Samar. Manila Water Asia Pacific Pte. Ltd. (MWAP) currently provides half of the bulk water requirements of Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam and leakage reduction programs in Bandung, Indonesia and Yangon, Myanmar. Recently, the company has acquired a stake in East Water, a publicly listed water supply and distribution company in Thailand and in PT Sarana Tirta Ungaran in Indonesia. Under MWAP are two affiliated companies in Vietnam, namely Thu Duc Water B.O.O Corporation and Kenh Dong Water Supply Joint Stock Company, both supplying treated water to Saigon Water Corporation (SAWACO) under a take-or-pay arrangement. Also under MWAP are Saigon Water Infrastructure Corporation (Saigon Water), a holding company listed in the Ho Chi Minh City Stock Exchange, Cu Chi Water Supply Sewerage Company, Ltd. (Cu Chi Water) and another company tasked to pursue non-revenue water reduction projects in Vietnam called Asia Water Network Solutions (Asia Water). Lastly, Manila Water Total Solutions Corporation (MWTS), a wholly owned subsidiary, handles after-the-meter products and services. Its current offerings include environmental services like waste-to-energy.

These chemical compounds can have active metabolic functions, however. They are not just \\"set apart for later use.\\" Reserve differs from structure in the first place by its dynamics. Reserve has an implied turnover, because it is synthesized from food (or other substrates in the environment) and used by metabolic processes occurring in cells. The turnover of structure depends on the maintenance of an organism. Maintenance is not required for reserve. A freshly laid egg consists almost exclusively of reserve, and hardly respires. The chemical compounds in the reserve have the same turnover, while that in the structure can have a different turnover, and so it depends on the compound. Functionality Reserves are synthesized from environmental substrates (food) for use by the metabolism for the purpose of somatic maintenance (including protein turnover, maintenance of concentration gradients across membranes, activity and other types of work), growth (increase of structural mass), maturity maintenance (installation of regulation systems, preparation for reproduction, maintenance of defense systems, such as the immune system), maturation (increase of the state of maturity) and reproduction. This organizational position of reserve creates a rather constant internal chemical environment, with only an indirect coupling with the extra-organismal environment. Reserves as well as structure are taken to be generalised compounds, i.e. mixtures of a large number of compounds, which do not change in composition. The latter requirement is called the strong homeostasis assumption. Polymers (carbohydrates, proteins, ribosomal RNA) and lipids form the main bulk of reserves and of structure . Some reasons for including reserve are to give an explanation for (from ): # the metabolic memory; changes in food (substrate) availability affect production (growth or reproduction) with some delay. Growth continues for some time during starvation; embryo development is fueled by reserves # the composition of biomass depends on growth rate. With two components (reserves and structure) particular changes in composition can be captured. More complex changes require several reserves, as is required for autotrophs. # the body size scaling of life history parameters. The specific respiration rate decreases with (maximum) body size between species because large bodied species have relatively more reserve. Many other life history parameters directly or indirectly relate to respiration. # the observed respiration patterns, which reflect the use of energy. Freshly laid eggs hardly respire, but their respiratory rates increase during development while egg weight decreases. After hatching, however, the respiration rate further increases, while the weight now also increases # all mass fluxes are linear combinations of assimilation, dissipation and growth. If reserves are omitted, there is not enough flexibility to capture product formation and explain indirect calorimetry.

Aldershot & District Traction Company Limited was a major bus company operating services in East Hampshire, West Surrey and parts of adjoining counties for sixty years during the 20th century, from 1912 until 1972 when it became part of Alder Valley.  History  Aldershot & District was inaugurated on 24 July 1912 when the British Automobile Traction Company Limited (a subsidiary of British Electric Traction Company - BET) bought the pioneering Aldershot & Farnborough Motor Omnibus Company Ltd, whose 5 buses had operated services between those two towns since 1906.Aldershot's Buses by Peter Holmes, published 1992 by Waterfront Publications The initial livery was dark green and white, with the upper deck of double-deckers being a lighter green. Variations on a theme of two-tone green continued, later with cream relief replacing the white. The familiar looped fleetname was introduced in 1923 and lasted until 1968. In its early years, the company was also a general haulage contractor, operating a fleet of Foden steam lorries. In common with many other rural bus companies, it also carried parcels on its buses until the 1970s.Aldershot & District timetable booklets 1950 to 1971; \\"Carriage of Parcels\\" regulations There was increasingly close co-operation between British Automobile Traction and rivals Thomas Tilling in the 1920s and, in 1928 BAT was reconstructed with the new title, Tilling & British Automobile Traction Ltd but, in 1942 the company was wound up and A&D;'s ownership reverted to the parent company BET. Aldershot & District expanded during the pre-World War II period, taking over a number of smaller concerns and establishing depots at Guildford, Woking, Hindhead, Haslemere, and Alton,Aldershot & District Buses with smaller \\"outstations\\" elsewhere. World War II provided a challenge to the company ‚Äì conscription meant that fewer men were available to serve as bus crews, service engineers and administrators, which meant recruitment and training of a great number of women, and maintenance of the vehicles was difficult; requisition of vehicles to replace destroyed vehicles in London or for conversion to military ambulances caused shortages locally and being based in Aldershot (the \\"Home of the British Army\\") meant that the company's vehicles were in continuous demand for transport of troops. Following the war the company invested in new vehicles, mainly AEC single-deckers and Dennis double-deckers and services returned to pre-war levels for a while, until the increase in car-ownership brought about significant loss of custom from the mid-1950s onwards. A&D; sought to minimise the impact by taking over routes from other operators, for instance Yellow Bus Services, Guildford. Large peaks in traffic levels occurred on a regular basis to meet the special demands of the Aldershot Military Tattoo and the Farnborough Airshow. Passenger numbers had peaked in 1950 at almost 52,000,000 journeys. At its peak services based in Aldershot and Guildford reached as far as Reading, Egham, London, Horsham, Bognor Regis, Petersfield and Winchester. Seasonal services operated to coastal towns such as Hastings, Eastbourne, Brighton, Worthing, Portsmouth and Southsea. Summer excursions ran to many destinations including Cheddar Caves, Longleat Safari Park, Hampton Court and race meetings such as Goodwood and Ascot. Demand for services to local beauty spot Frensham Ponds on summer Sundays sometimes necessitated running an extra double-decker for that part of route 19 in addition to the usual single- decker. Buses and coaches were also available for private hire, often being used by works' social clubs and public houses for outings. Some services were operated jointly with other companies, such as the service to Reading (jointly with the Thames Valley Traction Company. Through tickets were available on many routes, allowing the traveller to transfer from the A&D; bus to another company's vehicle to complete the journey (e.g. Aldershot to Southampton, changing at Winchester to a Hants and Dorset vehicle). On some routes return tickets were valid for use by bus or train, both in Southern Railway and British Rail periods. The company absorbed the private hire and excursion coach company of Gudge's of Lower Bourne (trading as \\"Comfy Coaches\\") during the 1960s, which also gave them a booking and enquiry office in Farnham. Although BET had campaigned vigorously against the proposed compulsory nationalisation of the UK bus industry, the company's policy changed and it sold its bus interests to the government's Transport Holding Company on 14 March 1968. The Transport Act 1968 formed the National Bus Company, which came into existence on 1 January 1969,Peter Gould - Local Transport History Accessed 8 September 2008. amalgamating the interests of The Tilling Group (BET's main competitor) with the recently acquired BET Group. From that point the company's independence was lost, as exemplified by the immediate change in purchasing policy, with centrally-specified Bristol buses coming in instead of the locally sourced Dennis and AEC vehicles. The company continued to trade as Aldershot and District under nationalised ownership until it was merged with the former Tilling Group company, Thames Valley Traction Company Limited on 1 January 1972 to form the Thames Valley and Aldershot Omnibus Company, which traded under the contrived fleet name of Alder Valley.

Kerbside collection or curbside collection is a service provided to households, typically in urban and suburban areas, of collecting and disposing of household waste and recyclables. It is usually accomplished by personnel using specially built vehicles to pick up household waste in containers that are acceptable to, or prescribed by, the municipality and are placed on the kerb. History Before the 20th century, the amount of waste produced by a household was relatively small. Household waste was often simply thrown out of an open window, buried in the garden or deposited in outhouses (see more at urban archaeology). When human concentrations became more dense, waste collectors, called nightmen or gong farmers were hired to collect the night soil from pail closets, performing their duties only at night (hence the name). Meanwhile, disposing of refuse became a problem wherever cities grew. Often refuse was placed in unusable areas just outside the city, such as wetlands and tidal zones. One example is London, which from Roman times disposed of its refuse outside the London Wall beside the River Thames. Another example is 1830s Manhattan, where thousands of hogs were permitted to roam the streets and eat garbage. A small industry developed as \\"swill children\\" collected kitchen refuse to sell for pig feed and the rag and bone man traded goods for bones (used for glue) and rags (essential for paper manufacture prior to the invention of wood pulping).Susan Strasser, Waste and Want: A Social History of Trash, 1999, New York: Metropolitan Books Later, in the late nineteenth century, trash was fed to swine in industrial. As sanitation engineering came to be practised beginning in the mid-19th century and human waste was conveyed from the home in pipes, the gong farmer was replaced by the municipal rubbish collector as there remained growing amounts of household refuse, including fly ash from coal, which was burnt for home heating. In Paris, the rag and bone man worked side by side with the municipal bin man, though reluctantly: in 1884, Eug√®ne Poubelle introduced the first integrated kerbside collection and recycling system, requiring residents to separate their waste into perishable items, paper and cloth, and crockery and shells. He also established rules for how private collectors and city workers should cooperate and he developed standard dimensions for refuse containers: his name in France is now synonymous with the garbage can. Under Poubelle, food waste and other organics collected in Paris were transported to nearby Saint Ouen where they were composted. This continued well into the 20th century when plastics began to contaminate the waste stream.Frederique Krupa, Parisian Garbage from 1789-1900, Paris: Urban Sanitation Before the 20th Century: A History of Invisible Infrastructure From the late-19th century to the mid-20th century, more or less consistent with the rise of consumables and disposable products municipalities began to pass anti-dumping ordinances and introduce kerbside collection.Still, by 1902, only 40 percent of US cities offered curbside collection. See: C.-E.A. Winslow and P. Hansen, \\"Some Statistics of Garbage Disposal for the Larger American Cities in 1902\\" Residents were required to use a variety of refuse containers to facilitate kerbside collection but the main type was a variation of Poubelle's metal garbage container. It was not until the late 1960s that the green bin bag was introduced by Glad. Later, as waste management practices were introduced with the aim of reducing landfill impacts, a range of container types, mostly made of durable plastic, came to be introduced to facilitate the proper diversion of the waste stream. Such containers include blue boxes, green bins and wheelie bins or dumpsters. Over time, waste collection vehicles gradually increased in size from the hand pushed tip cart or English dust cart, a name by which these vehicles are still referred, to large compactor trucks. Waste management and resource recovery Glass bottles and jars in a recycling collection box in Edinburgh, Scotland. Kerbside collection is today often referred to as a strategy of local authorities to collect recyclable items from the consumer. Kerbside collection is considered a low-risk strategy to reduce waste volumes and increase the recycling rates. Recyclable materials are typically collected in large wheelie bins, plastic bags, or small open, coloured plastic boxes, specifically designated for content. Discarded Christmas trees awaiting collection in the San Fernando Valley Recyclable materials that may be separately collected from municipal waste include: Biodegradable waste component *Green waste *Kitchen and food waste Recyclable materials, depending on location *Office paper *Newsprint *Paperboard *Cardboard *Corrugated fiberboard *Plastics (#1 PET, #2 HDPE natural and coloured, #3 PVC narrow-necked containers, #4 LDPE, #5 PP, #6 Polystyrene (but not expanded polystyrene), #7 other mixed resin plastics) *Glass *Copper *Aluminium *Steel and Tinplate *Co-mingled recyclables- can be sorted by a clean materials recovery facility In Somerville, Massachusetts, all accepted paper, glass, plastic, and metal recyclables are collected from one recycling cart. Kerbside collection of recyclable resources is aimed to recover purer waste streams with higher market value than by other collection methods. If the household residents incorrectly separate the recyclable materials, or put the wrong items in the recycling bin, the whole vehicle load of recycling will have to be rejected and sent to landfill or incineration if it is deemed to be contaminated. Kerbside collection and household recycling schemes are also being used as tools by many local authorities to increase the public's awareness of their waste production. New and emerging waste treatment technologies such as mechanical biological treatment may offer an alternative to kerbside collection through automated separation of waste in recycling factories. Usage by country =Australia= Residential kerbside collection is carried out by local governments, with some exceptions, e.g. some large apartment complexes may have their own separate arrangements with commercial providers. Available services and details vary from council to council. Councils generally provide residents with wheelie bins for kerbside collection of normal waste which is collected weekly or fortnightly. Many councils also have less frequent kerbside collection of bulkier waste (\\"hard rubbish\\") collected once or twice a year. Councils provide their residents with two or three wheelie bins, depending on the council, with some councils having different options for different properties. The two-bin system consists of a recycling bin (usually 240 litre) for co-mingled recyclables, and a general waste bin which is often smaller (e.g. 140 litre, 120 litre or 80 litre). The three-bin system consists of the above two bins plus a green waste bin (usually 240 litre). Not all councils have a green waste bin collection service. Many councils provide the option of larger bins, smaller bins, or additional bins. A wide variety of hard plastics, glass bottles and jars, steel cans, aluminium cans, paper and cardboard can be put in the recycling bin. The green waste bin can be used for garden organics (e.g. small branches, leaves, grass clippings), and councils are increasingly allowing food scraps, used paper towels and tissues and other biodegradable organics to be placed in the green waste bin. The council may turn the green waste into mulch (garden waste collection only) or compost and extract energy (food organics and garden organics). Details of what can and cannot be placed into each bin vary by council. Most councils follow a standard colour scheme for their wheelie bins, specified in Australian standard AS4123. According to the standard, general waste bins have a red lid, recycling bins have a yellow lid, green waste bins have a lime green lid, and all these bins have a dark green or black body. Not all councils follow this colour scheme. For example, recycling bins in some councils have a blue body and yellow lid. Bins are emptied according to one of several patterns. Generally speaking, general waste bins are emptied weekly while recycling bins and green waste bins are emptied fortnightly on alternate weeks. Many councils with food waste recycling have switched to emptying green waste bins weekly and general waste bins and recycling bins fortnightly on alternate weeks. Some councils empty recycling bins weekly, while others do so only during a certain period like the Christmas and summer holiday period, switching to fortnightly at other times. Recycling bins are provided at no additional cost, while the general waste bin is either at no additional cost or at an annual cost. The green waste bin, where available, is either provided to all residents, or available as an option to residents, either at an additional annual cost, a one-off cost or no additional cost, depending on the council. Some councils limit the availability of green waste bins (e.g. the City of Cockburn limits them to properties over a certain land size). Many councils provide the option of larger bins than the standard ones provided (even larger than 240 litres in some cases) or additional bins at additional annual cost. Some provide the option of a smaller general waste bin at a reduced cost. Many councils also have kerbside collection of bulky waste. There may be different kinds of collection, e.g.: * Large branches * E-waste (e.g. TVs, computers) which the council may recycle * Hard rubbish (anything else too big or too heavy for the wheelie bin) For bulky waste, residents are asked to place items directly on the kerbside. There may be other rules, e.g. what can and cannot be collected, limits on the amount of rubbish that will be collected, etc. that vary from council to council. Collections may occur once or a few times a year on specific dates or date ranges, or on demand with a limit to the number of times per year, depending on the council. =Austria= Kerbside collection is universal in Austria. The service is provided by the municipality. A fee applies for non-recyclable general waste, while recyclables are collected for free, being mainly financed by companies selling packaged goods via a mandatory fee. Different waste containers are used for general waste (black), paper (red), plastics (yellow), organic waste (green or brown), metal (blue) and glass (white for clear glass, green for coloured glass). In some rural areas, appropriately coloured plastic bags are used instead of bins. In many areas, a collection service for Christmas trees is provided in early January. =Canada= Halifax Regional Municipality (HRM) in Nova Scotia, Canada, with a population of about 375,000, has one of the most complex kerbside collection programmes in North America. Based on the green cart, it requires residents to self-sort refuse and place different types at the kerb on alternating weeks. As shown in the photo at left, week 1 would see the green cart and optional orange bags used for kitchen waste and other organics such as yard waste. Week 2 would permit non-recoverable waste in garbage bags or cans. Blue bags are used for paper, plastic and metal containers. Together with used grocery bags containing newspapers, they may be placed on the kerb either week. In summer, the green cart is emptied weekly due to the prevalence of flies. HRM has achieved a diversion rate of approximately 60 percent by this method. Calgary, Alberta has adopted \\"Curbside\\" Recycling and uses blue bins. The blue cart programme accepts all types of recycables, including plastics 1‚Äì7. It is picked up weekly for the cost of $8.00 per month. This programme is mandatory. In 1981 Resource Integration Systems (RIS) in collaboration with Laidlaw International tested the first blue box recycling system on 1500 homes in Kitchener, Ontario. Due to the success of the project the City of Kitchener put out a contract for public bid in 1984 for a recycling system citywide. Laidlaw won the bid and continued with the popular blue box recycling system. Today hundreds of cities around the world use the blue box system or a similar variation. Many Canadian municipalities use \\"green bins\\" for kerbside recycling. Others, such as Moncton, use wet/dry waste separation and recovery programmes. =New Zealand= Kerbside collection bins in Dunedin, New Zealand. The yellow- liddied wheelie bin is for non-glass recyclables, and the blue bin is for glass. The two bins are collected on alternating weeks. Official council bags are used for general household waste, and are collected weekly. In New Zealand, kerbside collection of general refuse and recycling, and in some areas organic waste, is the responsibility of the local city or district council, or private contractors. Practices and collection methods vary widely from council to council and company to company. Some examples of collection are: * Auckland City Council: Two 240-litre wheelie bins are supplied: a red- lidded bin for general refuse, collected weekly, and a blue-lidded bin for recyclables, collected fortnightly. * Christchurch City Council: Three wheelie bins are supplied: a 140-litre red-lidded bin for general refuse, a 240-litre yellow-lidded bin for recyclables, and an 80-litre green-lidded bin for organic waste. The organic waste bins are collected weekly, while the recyclables and general refuse bins are collected on alternating weeks. * Hamilton City Council and Hutt City Council: A 45-litre bin is supplies for recyclables, collected weekly. General refuse is collected weekly using user- pays official council bags. * Dunedin City Council, Palmerston North City Council and Wellington City Council: Two bins are supplied: a 45-litre or 70-litre bin for glass, and an 80-litre or 240-litre wheelie bin for non-glass recyclables. These two bins are collected on alternating weeks. General refuse is collected weekly using user-pays official council bags. * Rodney District Council: A 45-litre bin is supplies for recyclables, collected weekly. There is no council collection of general waste, and all general waste collection is carried out by independent companies. * Taupo District Council: A 45-litre bin is supplies for recyclables, collected weekly. General refuse is collected weekly using user-pays system of orange tags - one orange tag is to be placed on a standard rubbish bag up to 60 litres capacity, or half an orange sticker can be placed on two supermarket bags tied together. * Upper Hutt City Council: Recycling is to be placed in plastic bags, with paper and cardboard collected in the first week, and plastic, metal and glass in the second week. General refuse is collected weekly using user-pays official council bags. * Waitakere City Council: A 140-litre wheelie bin is provided for recyclables, collected fortnightly. General refuse is collected weekly using user-pays official council bags. By 1996 the New Zealand cities of Auckland, Waitakere, North Shore and Lower Hutt had kerbside recycling bins available. In New Plymouth, Wanganui and Upper Hutt recyclable material was collected if placed in suitable bags. By 2007 73% of New Zealanders had access to kerbside recycling. Kerbside collection of organic waste is carried out by the Mackenzie District Council and the Timaru District Council. Christchurch City Council is introducing the system to their kerbside collection. Other councils are carrying out trials. =United Kingdom= In the United Kingdom, the Household Waste Recycling Act 2003 requires local authorities to provide every household with a separate collection of at least two types of recyclable materials by 2010. There has been criticism in the difference of schemes used in the country such as the colour of bins, whether the recycling is collected from wheelie bins, coloured plastic boxes or plastic bags, and also the fact that the bins, boxes and bags obstruct the roads and pavements, and how the additional collection vehicles and waste collection services needed also contribute to traffic congestion and produce carbon dioxide emissions. Some find the colour differences confusing, and some people want a national scheme. A typical example is to compare two neighbouring councils in Greater Manchester; Bury Council and Salford City Council. Bury uses blue for cans, plastic and glass, green for paper and cardboard and brown for garden waste. Salford uses blue for paper and card, brown for cans, plastic and glass, and pink for garden waste. Most councils use grey or black bins for general waste, with a few exceptions such as Liverpool, which uses a purple bin for general waste, a colour that is used by no other council. Another controversial issue in the UK is the frequency of the waste collections. To save money, many councils are reducing the frequency of both general waste and recycling collections. This has caused problems from larger households, and has led to an increase of overflowing bins and fly tipping. For example, previously, Bury Council collected general waste once a week and recyclables fortnightly. This has now changed to fortnightly for general waste and monthly (every 4 weeks) collection of recyclables. A few councils are using \\"forced\\" recycling, by replacing the large, 240 litre general waste bin with a smaller 180 litre or 140 litre bin, and using the old 240 litre one for recyclables. This may be made worse by fortnightly collections of the \\"small\\" bin, and strict rules such as \\"No extra waste will be collected\\" and \\"Bin lids must be fully closed\\". Stockport Council is a notable user of this scheme. Their recycling rates have substantially increased as a result, but there are usually complaints from household residents. Trafford Council also use a similar scheme, but the small grey bin is emptied every week. In addition, the two named councils, and more, collect food waste together with garden waste, by sending out kitchen caddies and compostable bin liners. These prevent food waste (including meat and fish) from going to landfill or incineration, and to increase the council's recycling rate. The food and garden waste is usually collected weekly or fortnightly, and is taken to an in-vessel composting facility or an anaerobic digestion plant, where the biodegradable waste is organically recycled into soil fertiliser to be used on local farms. In North West England, all the glass collected for recycling is used within the UK, around half of the plastics and cans are used in the UK; the rest is sent further afield to continental Europe or China to be made into new products, and paper and cardboard collected is sent to local paper mills to be reprocessed into newspapers, tissues and paper towels, cardboard and office paper. Once again, some of the paper will be sent further afield. Some councils only use three bins, i.e. general waste, food and garden waste and mixed recyclables. This means that a single-stream recycling system is used, so plastics, cans and glass go into the same bin as paper and cardboard. Although this is much easier for the residents, there is more sorting required, and the paper quality is sometimes of a low grade due to food waste or liquid contamination or shards of glass in the paper, and so this scheme has been criticised. Also, most councils require residents to remove all plastic caps and lids from plastic bottles, and thoroughly rinse them out to avoid unpleasant smells or liquid contamination. This is because the caps and lids are made from a different type of plastic (PP) from the bottle (PET/HDPE); if the bottles are squashed down and folded over like toothpaste tubes and caps are screwed back on, the size and volume of bottles is greatly reduced, so that more bottles can be contained inside the recycling bins. In fact many bottlers, especially bottled water companies, have now designed their bottles to be collapsible; though this message has not been effectively disseminated to the consumer. A collapsible bottle takes between 25% and 33% of the space a non-collapsed bottle. Labels and neck rings can, however, be left on the bottles and they do not need to be removed. This also means that only plastic bottles can be recycled. Many councils are still trying to remind residents that plastic pots, tubs and trays (yoghurts, desserts and spreads), plastic carrier bags, crisp packets and cling film cannot be recycled via the kerbside economically. If too many incorrect, unsuitable or unsafe materials are put into the recycling bin, this means that the whole vehicle load of recycling will have to be rejected and sent directly to landfill or incineration at a high cost. Contamination is normally a problem if recyclables are collected from wheelie bins, as the bin collection workers can only look at the top; there may be a small amount of contamination 'hidden' at the bottom. Councils that use many bags and boxes (Edinburgh) suffer from less contamination but are complicated and the loose paper and cardboard, and plastic recycling bags are blown around by the wind, and paper can become wet due to rain or snow, or contaminated with food residue, dirt, oil or grease. =Spain= Basque Country In the province of Gipuzkoa, this system is implanted in many towns as Usurbil, Hernani, Oiartzun, Antzuola, Legorreta, Itsasondo, Zaldibia, Anoeta, Alegia, Irura, Zizurkil, Astigarraga, Ordizia, O√±ati and Lezo, where the common used name in Basque is \\"atez-atekoa\\", which means door-by-door. Due to the big success in these towns, with more than 80% of the waste recycled, 34 towns in Gipuzkoa are considering setting this system up in 2013, like Arrasate, Bergara, Aretxabaleta, Eskoriatza, Legazpi, Tolosa or Pasaia. The \\"atez-ate\\" system consists in hanging each kind of rubbish in a hanger outside the house a certain day or days in a week. For example, in Hernani, they have three days to hang their organic rubbish, two days for plastics and metallics, one for paper and one for rejects residuals. This system started in the town of Usurbil in the year 2009, due to the incinerator of the region of Gipuzkoa which was going to be built in this town, exactly in the neighborhood of Zubieta. Three years after, the construction of the incinerator was stopped by the government of the region, suggesting that the incinerator was a source of contamination and the high cost of the building. Criticism This type of collection service is subject to criticism: * The large (wheelie bin) container encourages the \\"out of sight\\" rubbish mentality and invites more rubbish to be disposed of. * The bins and collection trucks are not suited to narrow roads or houses with steep driveways or steps. * They lock local authorities into capital intensive equipment programmes and multi-national providers. * Co-mingled recyclables are sometimes not being successfully managed by automated sorting stations and the rates of diversion are low. In some cases, this results in mountains of unsorted recyclables. * In the UK especially, some councils are sending out at least 4 large bins - residents of smaller houses with no gardens have little space to put them; not everybody lives in a house, some live in blocks of apartments * Many use small plastic boxes, bags and lockable outdoor food waste 'caddies' which get blown around and lost, bad for recycling participation.

It doubles as one of two high schools in the city of Quincy and as the vocational center. Quincy's mascot is known as the 'Presidents' and their school colors are Blue & White. History Quincy High School was founded in 1854 about a half-mile down Hancock Street (marked by the current High School Avenue) and moved to the former Central Middle School in 1894. It moved to Coddington Street in 1924. North Quincy High School was established at a separate location in 1926. Construction of the new high school building was completed in 2010. The old school was vacant until 2013 when the city received approval from the Massachusetts Department of Historical Sites to demolish the old school.

They were purchased by Diamond Multimedia in 1995. Early history The company was founded by John Wiley and Alan Ackerman as Microbits Peripheral Products (MPP), a provider of interface products for the Atari 8-bit family. The two of them were friends in high school when they developed various computer hardware for the school computers, and were best known for a 300 baud modem and a printer interface. The company was successful for some time, but a number of factors led to its bankruptcy around 1986, and its reformation as Supra, initially selling hard drives for the Atari ST. Originally from Albany, Oregon, they later moved to Vancouver, Washington. SupraFAXModem 14400 In 1991 the company arranged a deal with Rockwell International to use their new V.32bix 14,400 bit/s modem chips with an exclusivity arrangement. Their SupraFAXModem 14400 was sold at prices points about half that of the slower 9600 V.32 models of the same era, and its introduction led to a rapid downward spiral in modem pricing.

Henry Brown also designed the Scootacar microcar (built between 1957 and 1964). The body was of steel construction, rather than the more usual glass fibre, and was mounted on a steel chassis. The engine was a rear-mounted, direct driven impeller air-cooled 750 cc twin-cylinder unit made by JAP driving the rear wheels through a three-speed gearbox and chain to the axle which had a friction differential. The suspension was by independent coil springs at the front and underslung semi elliptic at the rear. Steering was by a chain system. Although the car was advertised as a four-seater and fitted with four seats, the rear ones, as might be expected in a microcar, were rather small and cramped. The fabric roof panel could be rolled forwards to give an opening roof. Although the production target was 50 cars a week, only 65 were ever built, and only one is believed to survive. It was at the time the cheapest four-wheel car available on the British market but rapidly acquired a very poor reputation, especially for overheating to the extent of catching fire.

In 1937, they formed the Schweizer Metal Aircraft Company. Their first commercial glider sale was an SGU 1-7 glider to Harvard University's Altosaurus Glider Club. At that time, Eliot Noyes was a sailplane pilot in the Harvard soaring club. That glider was later restored and currently resides at the National Soaring Museum in Elmira, New York. In 1939, the Schweizer brothers relocated to Elmira, New York, and incorporated as Schweizer Aircraft. Best known internationally for their gliders, they also remembered the importance of the folks who worked with them and for them. Over their nearly 70 years, they enabled creation of various flying machines; from gliders to crop dusters to helicopters, while contributing to the aircraft industry as a whole, and the Southern Tier of New York in particular. According to a recent editorial in the Elmira Star-Gazette, when it came time to sell the company, the brothers wanted to find a buyer who respected their values and their folks, and chose the Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation (a UTC subsidiary) in Connecticut. The sale was completed successfully in 2004, providing growth opportunities for Schweizer.Sikorsky announces acquisition is complete.

It combines a heading indicator with a VHF omnidirectional range-instrument landing system (VOR-ILS) display. This reduces pilot workload by lessening the number of elements in the pilot's instrument scan to the six basic flight instruments. Among other advantages, the HSI offers freedom from the confusion of reverse sensing on an instrument landing system localizer back course approach. As long as the needle is set to the localizer front course, the instrument will indicate whether to fly left or right, in either direction of travel. On the HSI, the aircraft is represented by a schematic figure in the centre of the instrument ‚Äì the VOR-ILS display is shown in relation to this figure. The heading indicator is usually slaved to a remote compass and the HSI is frequently interconnected with an autopilot capable of following the heading select bug and of executing an ILS approach by following the localizer and glide slope. On a conventional VOR indicator, left‚Äìright and to‚Äìfrom must be interpreted in the context of the selected course. When an HSI is tuned to a VOR station, left and right always mean left and right and TO/FROM is indicated by a simple triangular arrowhead pointing to the VOR. If the arrowhead points to the same side as the course selector arrow, it means TO, and if it points behind to the side opposite the course selector, it means FROM. The HSI illustrated here is a type designed for smaller airplanes and is the size of a standard 3 ¬º-inch instrument. Airline and jet aircraft HSIs are larger and may include more display elements. The most modern HSI displays are electronic and often integrated with electronic flight instrument systems into so-called \\"glass cockpit\\" systems.

SBR reactors treat wastewater such as sewage or output from anaerobic digesters or mechanical biological treatment facilities in batches. Oxygen is bubbled through the mixture of wastewater and activated sludge to reduce the organic matter (measured as biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and chemical oxygen demand (COD)). The treated effluent may be suitable for discharge to surface waters or possibly for use on land. Overview While there are several configurations of SBRs, the basic process is similar. The installation consists of one or more tanks that can be operated as plug flow or completely mixed reactors. The tanks have a ‚Äúflow through‚Äù system, with raw wastewater (influent) coming in at one end and treated water (effluent) flowing out the other. In systems with multiple tanks, while one tank is in settle/decant mode the other is aerating and filling. In some systems, tanks contain a section known as the bio-selector, which consists of a series of walls or baffles which direct the flow either from side to side of the tank or under and over consecutive baffles. This helps to mix the incoming Influent and the returned activated sludge (RAS), beginning the biological digestion process before the liquor enters the main part of the tank. Treatment stages There are five stages in the treatment process: #Fill #React #Settle #Decant #Idle The inlet valve opens and the tank is being filled in, while mixing is provided by mechanical means (no air). This stage is also called the anoxic stage. Aeration of the mixed liquor is performed during the second stage by the use of fixed or floating mechanical pumps or by transferring air into fine bubble diffusers fixed to the floor of the tank. No aeration or mixing is provided in the third stage and the settling of suspended solids starts. During the fourth stage the outlet valve opens and the \\"clean\\" supernatant liquor exits the tank. Removal of constituents Aeration times vary according to the plant size and the composition/quantity of the incoming liquor, but are typically 60 to 90 minutes. The addition of oxygen to the liquor encourages the multiplication of aerobic bacteria and they consume the nutrients. This process encourages the conversion of nitrogen from its reduced ammonia form to oxidized nitrite and nitrate forms, a process known as nitrification. To remove phosphorus compounds from the liquor, aluminium sulfate (alum) is often added during this period. It reacts to form non-soluble compounds, which settle into the sludge in the next stage.New England Interstate Water Pollution Control Commission, Lowell, MA (2005). \\"Sequencing Batch Reactor Design and Operational Considerations.\\" The settling stage is usually the same length in time as the aeration. During this stage the sludge formed by the bacteria is allowed to settle to the bottom of the tank. The aerobic bacteria continue to multiply until the dissolved oxygen is all but used up. Conditions in the tank, especially near the bottom are now more suitable for the anaerobic bacteria to flourish. Many of these, and some of the bacteria which would prefer an oxygen environment, now start to use oxidized nitrogen instead of oxygen gas (as an alternate terminal electron acceptor) and convert the nitrogen to a gaseous state, as nitrogen oxides or, ideally, molecular nitrogen (dinitrogen, N2) gas. This is known as denitrification. Anoxic SBR can be used for anaerobic processes, such as the removal of ammonia via Anammox, or the study of slow-growing microorganisms. In this case, the reactors are purged of oxygen by flushing with inert gas and there is no aeration. As the bacteria multiply and die, the sludge within the tank increases over time and a waste activated sludge (WAS) pump removes some of the sludge during the settle stage to a digester for further treatment. The quantity or ‚Äúage‚Äù of sludge within the tank is closely monitored, as this can have a marked effect on the treatment process. The sludge is allowed to settle until clear water is on the top 20 to 30 percent of the tank contents. The decanting stage most commonly involves the slow lowering of a scoop or ‚Äútrough‚Äù into the basin. This has a piped connection to a lagoon where the final effluent is stored for disposal to a wetland, tree growing lot, ocean outfall, or to be further treated for use on parks, golf courses etc. Conversion In some situations in which a traditional treatment plant cannot fulfill required treatment (due to higher loading rates, stringent treatment requirements, etc.) the owner might opt to convert their traditional system into a multi-SBR plant. Conversion to SBR will create a longer sludge age, minimizing sludge handling requirements downstream of the SBR. The reverse can also be done where in SBR Systems would be converted into extended aeration (EA) systems. SBR treatment systems that could not cope up with a sudden constant increase of influent would easily be converted into EA plants. Extended aeration plants are more flexible in flow rate, eliminating restrictions presented by pumps located throughout the SBR systems. Clarifiers can be retrofitted in the equalization tanks of the SBR.

It ran for 2,397 weekly issues before being merged with Look and Learn in 1965. Background Following the successful publication of The Children's Encyclop√¶dia as a part-work between 1908 and 1910, the title was immediately relaunched as The New Children's Encyclop√¶dia. This new edition, published in monthly parts from March 1910, added a supplement in September 1910 entitled The Little Paper which carried news stories of interest to children. This idea was expanded by Mee into the 12-page, tabloid-sized Children's Newspaper which debuted on 22 March 1919, priced 1¬Ωd. Subtitled The Story of the World Today for the Men and Women of Tomorrow, the paper epitomised Mee's values and reflected the editor's twin faiths of Christian ethics and the British Empire. Mee believed that children could be guided to better, more creative lives through education. His aim for the Encyclopaedia was to give the nation's children a firm grasp of subjects such as history and geography and practical. The Children's Newspaper was designed to keep young people up to date with the latest in world news and science. At its peak, The Children's Newspaper sold 500,000 copies a week. Following Mee's death in 1943, Hugo Tyerman took over the editorial reins. Sales began to fall after the Second World War as rival publications, notably the Eagle, Junior Mirror and Junior Express, began to appear. It was not until the mid-1950s that The Children's Newspaper began to modernise, adding features on television and sports and including interviews with popular sporting personalities. In January 1962, Fleetway Publications launched the educational weekly entitled Look and Learn. The black and white Children's Newspaper suffered by comparison and despite attempts to attract a teenage audience by adding a column for girls and a 'Pop Spot' featuring photos of popular singers and groups, sales continued to slip. The Children's Newspaper came to an end on 1 May 1965 after 2,397 issues.

He was the 15th head football coach at Colorado State University from 1993 to 2007. Lubick won or shared six Western Athletic Conference or Mountain West Conference titles, guided the program to nine bowl games and was named National Coach of the Year by Sports Illustrated in 1994. Lubick's success has made him the most recognizable figure in the CSU and Fort Collins community, so much so that when Pat Stryker, head of the Bohemian Foundation, decided to donate $15.2 million toward extensive renovations of Hughes Stadium, she did so with the stipulation that the playing surface be named after Lubick. The stadium was then known as Sonny Lubick Field at Hughes Stadium until its closure after the 2016 season. As a result of the donation, CSU added 4,400 new seats and a video scoreboard in 2004, a new press box and suites in 2005, and a new FieldTurf surface in 2006. In 2016, the university announced that the playing surface at its new football stadium, which opened in 2017 as Colorado State Stadium and is now known as Canvas Stadium, would also be known as \\"Sonny Lubick Field\\", following an anonymous $20 million donation for that specific purpose. Montana State A native of Butte, Montana, and a graduate from Western Montana in 1960, Lubick coached football at Butte High School for eight years, the last two as head coach. His collegiate coaching career began in Bozeman as an assistant at Montana State in 1970 under head coach Tom Parac. Sonny Holland became the head coach in 1971 and led the program for seven seasons, which included a Big Sky Conference title and the Division II national title in 1976. Following Holland's retirement announcement a year later, Lubick was named head coach at MSU in Lubick's first season in 1978 was wildly successful, as the Bobcats finished overall in the new Division I-AA and second place in the Big Sky at The following year, the Bobcats won the Big Sky with a league record, but were overall and not invited to the four-team playoffs. The following two years saw decline. In 1980, Montana State plummeted from first to sixth place in the Big Sky, finishing at and in league play. The Bobcats fell to in 1981, and despite his popularity in Bozeman, Lubick was fired. Assistant coach Lubick moved on to the Division I-A ranks as an assistant coach. His first stop was at Colorado State as offensive coordinator for Leon Fuller from 1982 to 1984. At the time, the CSU program generally regarded as one of the worst programs in college football. The Rams had been to just one bowl game in their history, and were coming off a winless season in 1981. CSU wasn't overly successful in Lubick's three years as offensive coordinator, winning only 12 games total and only once getting to .500 in WAC play. Nonetheless, Lubick was a popular and likable figure in the Fort Collins and university community, something that would ultimately benefit him later in life. In 1985, Lubick was hired by Jack Elway at Stanford University as an assistant coach. In 1989, Lubick joined Dennis Erickson's coaching staff at the University of Miami as the Hurricanes' defensive coordinator. While at Miami, Lubick molded a tough and physical Hurricane defense that featured the likes of Cortez Kennedy and Russell Maryland. Miami won two national championships in Lubick's four years there. Colorado State =1993‚Äì1994= Lubick returned to Colorado State in 1993 as head coach. Little had changed at CSU since Lubick had left the program a decade earlier. There had been a brief period of success under Lubick's predecessor, Earle Bruce, that featured the school's first-ever bowl win (32‚Äì31 over Oregon in the 1990 Freedom Bowl), but CSU was still considered a graveyard for college football. Since 1960, the program had recorded just seven winning seasons, and in that same span, the program had three winless seasons. Considering it a challenge, Lubick accepted the head coaching position at Colorado State prior to the 1993 season. Faced with a culture of losing, Lubick assembled a staff of assistants that included eventual Ohio State head coach Urban Meyer and began aggressively recruiting and attempting to change CSU's image. Considering the dreadful state of the program he'd inherited, Lubick made the Rams respectable fairly quickly. After starting 1‚Äì4 in his first season, the Rams won three consecutive games to finish the season 5‚Äì6, providing hope that the program was headed in the right direction. However, not even the most optimistic Rams fan anticipated what happened in 1994. Led by a defense that featured future NFL players Sean Moran and Brady Smith, Colorado State flew out of the gate 6‚Äì0 heading into a key game on October 8 against the #4 Arizona Wildcats in Tucson, Arizona. Known for their vaunted \\"Desert Swarm\\" defense, Arizona had been picked by several publications, including Sports Illustrated, to win the national championship, but it was CSU that took a stunning 14‚Äì6 lead. With Arizona driving to the CSU 21 in the second half, Garrett Sand forced a fumble that Moran recovered and ran back 79 yards for a touchdown. Regarded simply as \\"The Play\\" in CSU football history, the return ended up being the game-winning score, as Lubick and the Rams went on to win 21‚Äì16‚Äìat the time, the biggest upset in school history. Near-rioting broke out in Fort Collins as a result of celebrations from students and fans. A victory the following week over UTEP set up a nationally televised showdown with Utah, also undefeated, at Hughes Stadium. With extra bleachers brought into the 30,000 seat facility, a crowd of 39,107, the largest in Hughes Stadium history, witnessed a heartbreaking 45‚Äì31 shootout loss. Despite the setback, the Rams recovered to win their final three games, including a dramatic 44‚Äì42 comeback win at Fresno State that sealed CSU's first-ever WAC championship (Utah lost twice more during the regular season following their win at CSU), and their first conference title of any sort since winning the 1955 Skyline Conference title. The victory earned Colorado State their first-ever trip to the Holiday Bowl in San Diego, where the Rams lost a hard-fought 24‚Äì14 affair to Michigan. Though the season ended on a down note, the Rams' 10 wins were a program record for victories in a single season. The 10‚Äì2 campaign was the start of 10 straight winning seasons under Lubick, and also earned him National Coach of the Year honors from Sports Illustrated. =1995‚Äì1999= Lubick's Rams followed up their breakout campaign in 1994 with a strong 1995 season. With Smith earning WAC defensive player of the year honors, and safety Greg Myers earning All American honors for a second straight year, CSU finished the 1995 season with an 8‚Äì4 mark and a share of the WAC title. The Rams were once again invited to the Holiday Bowl, but this time they were downed by the Kansas State Wildcats by a score of 54‚Äì21. In 1996, the Rams posted another winning season, finishing 7‚Äì5 and tied for second place in the WAC. However, a lack of quality wins, and losses to Colorado, Oregon, Nebraska, and Wyoming kept the Rams out of a bowl game. The 1997 season also got off to a difficult start. Colorado State blew a halftime lead against arch-rival Colorado in their second game to lose 31‚Äì21. Two weeks later, the Rams suffered a 24‚Äì0 shutout loss at home against Air Force to fall to 2‚Äì2. It would be the last game Lubick's Rams lost for the rest of the season. Led by quarterback Moses Moreno, the WAC Offensive Player of the Year, running back Kevin McDougal, and future Pittsburgh Steelers linebackers Joey Porter and Clark Haggans, Colorado State stormed through the rest of league play, with a 14‚Äì7 victory at Wyoming October 18 the closest they came to defeat. After defeating New Mexico in the WAC Championship Game, the Rams once again went to the Holiday Bowl, this time facing the Missouri Tigers. Down three at halftime, CSU scored 21 second-half points to defeat the Tigers 35‚Äì24, netting Lubick his first-ever bowl victory, extending a school record nine-game winning streak (the streak would end at ten in 1998), and finishing what is still the greatest season in school history at 11‚Äì2. During this period of success, Lubick reportedly received interest and coaching offers from several other high-profile programs, including Miami and USC. But the commitment to his program, and intense efforts from fans to keep the lovable coach in Fort Collins, lead to Lubick staying at CSU each time. In 1998, Lubick's Rams finished 8‚Äì4 and third in the WAC but were not invited to a postseason bowl. Prior to the 1999 season, eight member schools of the WAC (Air Force, Colorado State, BYU, Utah, San Diego State, Wyoming, New Mexico, UNLV), upset over conference expansion that threatened to balloon travel costs and break up longstanding regional rivalries, broke away from the conference and formed a new league, the Mountain West Conference. But 1999 would be memorable for Ram fans for another reason. Since the day they began playing football, CSU had more often than not failed to beat their in-state rivals, the Colorado Buffaloes. With superior resources and (since moving to the Big Eight in 1947) playing in a superior league, Colorado often overshadowed Colorado State. Lubick had gone 0‚Äì3 in his first three games against Colorado. On September 4 the game, dubbed the Rocky Mountain Showdown, was played at a neutral site, Mile High Stadium in Denver for the second straight year, and the Rams were once again considered underdogs against the ranked Buffaloes. However, behind 189 rushing yards and two touchdowns from McDougal, the Rams blew out the Buffaloes 41‚Äì14, marking the first time in 13 years that CSU had beaten their in-state rivals. The victory was seen by many as the final step in CSU's ascension to legitimacy. Victories over Wyoming and Air Force also completed the \\"Front Range\\" sweep, and the Rams finished 8‚Äì4 again, this time tying for the Mountain West title. CSU was invited to the Liberty Bowl, but lost to Southern Miss 23‚Äì17. =2000‚Äì2005= In 2000 Lubick's Rams, led primarily by Mountain West Conference Offensive Player of the Year Matt Newton, defeated Colorado for the second straight season 28‚Äì24. The victory was the catalyst for a 10‚Äì2 season that included an outright Mountain West title and a 22‚Äì17 Liberty Bowl victory over Louisville. With the graduation of several key seniors and the preseason loss of starting running back Cecil Sapp to injury, Lubick faced a rebuilding year in 2001. The Rams still managed a 7‚Äì5 finish and a 45‚Äì20 New Orleans Bowl victory over North Texas. 2001 was also notable for the emergence of quarterback Bradlee Van Pelt. A transfer from Michigan State, Van Pelt's dual- threat capability as a running and passing quarterback would make him a two- time conference player of the year. But it was his game in 2002 against Colorado that made Van Pelt a cult hero in Fort Collins. After losing to CU in 2001, Van Pelt and the Rams, bolstered by the return of Sapp, went into their Rocky Mountain Showdown heavy underdogs against a Buffaloes team ranked sixth in the nation. Trailing 14‚Äì13 late in the fourth quarter, Van Pelt broke loose on a 26-yard touchdown run. As he neared the goal line, Van Pelt turned and spiked the football off of CU cornerback Roderick Sneed's helmet as he scored what would be the game-winning touchdown. Following the game, Van Pelt called CU \\"the sorriest sixth-ranked team in the nation he had ever faced\\". It was the second biggest upset in school history, and further added to Van Pelt's following in Fort Collins. Though the outspoken quarterback occasionally gave Lubick problems, the 2002 season would be another banner season. With Sapp setting the school single-season rushing record, the Rams finished 2002 with a 10‚Äì4 record and another Mountain West Conference title. The 2003 Ram football team was considered by many to be the best team in Lubick's tenure, if not all of CSU history, prior to the season. Though Sapp was gone, Van Pelt and many other seniors returned, and high-profile Colorado-transfer Marcus Houston was added to the mix. The Rams entered the season ranked 24th in the nation and with hopes of cracking the Bowl Championship Series. Those hopes were quickly dashed when the Rams were upset in their opener by CU 42‚Äì35. Though CSU did make a bowl game for the fifth straight season, the Rams' 7‚Äì6 finish was the start of a down period for Lubick and his program. With Van Pelt gone, CSU faced another rebuilding year in 2004. A particularly devastating loss at Folsom Field against Colorado on September 4, in which Lubick later admitted to mismanaging CSU's final series that ended in the Rams failing in three plays from CU's one-yard line to score what would have been a game-winning touchdown in a 27‚Äì24 loss, led to a 4‚Äì7 finish, the worst year in Lubick's tenure. The 2005 season started once again with another devastating loss at Colorado on September 3. Leading 21‚Äì10 after three quarters, three interceptions allowed CU to tie the game, and Mason Crosby kicked a game- winning 47-yard field goal with five seconds left to give the Buffs a 31‚Äì28 win. This time the Rams regrouped. Behind school record-setting wide receiver David Anderson, and buoyed by the surprising emergence of thousand yard sophomore running back Kyle Bell, CSU finished the regular season 6‚Äì5 and tied for second place in the Mountain West. One of the highlights of the 2005 season was the Rams maintaining the Bronze Boot with a 39-31 victory over Wyoming in Fort Collins. However, a blowout 51‚Äì30 loss to Navy in the Poinsettia Bowl seemed to be another setback. =2006‚Äì2008= Following the 2005 season, Lubick signed a three-year contract extension that would have made him CSU's coach through the 2009 season. Unfortunately, the Lubick family was dealt a difficult blow in the offseason. In February, Lubick's youngest son, Marc, was diagnosed with Rhabdomyosarcoma cancer. The younger Lubick had just finished his first season as Colorado State's wide receivers coach, a position he took over after his brother Matt left the program in 2005 after spending the previous four seasons coaching that position under his father. Marc Lubick underwent chemotherapy and coached during the 2006 season. The Rams entered the 2006 season with high hopes, but on and off-field problems quickly beset the program. Just three days prior to the season-opening game against Weber State on September 2, preseason all-conference back Kyle Bell was lost for the season with a torn ACL during a practice. A sophomore in 2005, Bell had run for over 1,000 yards and figured to be the centerpiece of CSU's offense. The Rams defeated Weber State 30‚Äì6 but lost another starter prior to their game against archrival Colorado on September 9, this time due to a scandal. Several players, including preseason All-MWC cornerback Robert Herbert, were suspended indefinitely from the program after being charged with fraud in a campus check-cashing scandal. Herbert had arguably been the team's best defender in 2005. Despite these losses, however, the Rams started the 2006 season strong. On September 9, after three years of frustratingly close losses, the Rams defeated their in-state rival CU 14‚Äì10 at Invesco Field at Mile High Stadium. After dropping a 28‚Äì10 decision at Nevada the following week, CSU rebounded with a road win at Fresno State and homecoming win against UNLV to go to 4‚Äì1. Playing at in-state rival Air Force on October 12, the Rams opened up a 21‚Äì3 halftime lead and appeared to be well on their way to a fifth victory. However, the Falcons rallied for 21 unanswered points and came back to defeat CSU 24‚Äì21. The loss was the beginning of one of the worst slides in Lubick's tenure. The following week Colorado State was shut out 24‚Äì0 at Wyoming in the annual Border War series. Home losses to New Mexico and BYU followed, and the Rams ultimately never recovered. Losses to Utah, TCU, and San Diego State concluded a season-ending, seven-game losing streak, leaving CSU 4‚Äì8 and tied for last place in the Mountain West, by far the worst year in Lubick's tenure and leading some fans and followers to question whether Lubick should be retained or released. Lubick's 14th season got an immediate boost with the return of Bell. With their all-conference halfback in the fold, as well as the most seniors returning in Lubick's tenure, the Rams had a team that figured to rebound from the dismal 2006 season. But a difficult early schedule challenged CSU. Opening against Colorado at Invesco Field at Mile High, the Rams had a familiar finish against their in-state rival. Despite big games from Bell and Kory Sperry, CSU squandered an 11-point 3rd quarter lead and went into overtime. On their possession, Caleb Hanie threw an interception in the end zone. CU would win in overtime, 31‚Äì28. Following the CU loss, Colorado State faced one of its most daunting home games ever against then-10th ranked California. The Bears were heavily favored but Colorado State, playing in its home opener, was game. CSU lost a thriller 34‚Äì28, their 9th straight loss dating back to 2006. Even worse, the bizarre chain of season-ending ACL injuries to key players continued when Sperry was lost with a torn ACL during the game. It was the 3rd straight season a key player for the Rams had been lost to the injury. Losses continued to mount. Dating back to 2006, CSU lost 11 straight games before defeating UNLV at midseason. Colorado State finished the season 3‚Äì9, a new low in the Lubick tenure. The lone bright spot of the year came at the end of the season when the Rams regained the Bronze Boot with a 36‚Äì28 win over Wyoming at Hughes Stadium. It would end up being the final game in Lubick's tenure at CSU. On November 26, 2007, just 3 days after the Wyoming win, it was announced that Lubick was being relieved of his duties as head coach. Colorado State University Athletic Director Paul Kowalczyk announced that Lubick has been offered a public relations position as senior associate athletic director, focused on fundraising and serving as a goodwill ambassador for Rams athletics.9 News web site Lubick was replaced by Steve Fairchild, a former Lubick assistant who returned after serving as offensive coordinator for the NFL's Buffalo Bills. Lubick's tenure at Colorado State was one of the most successful rebuilding projects in college football history. When he arrived in 1993, he inherited a program that had been to only two bowl games in its entire history and had only cracked the eight-win barrier six times. He left it as a regional powerhouse with six conference titles (four outright, two shared). He also led the Rams to nine bowl games (winning three) and four 10-win seasons. On February 2, 2008, the Rocky Mountain News reported that Lubick had declined the university's offer to remain in a fundraising role. The paper quoted a source as saying Lubick, 70, had talked with Florida coach Urban Meyer about joining the Gators' staff. Meyer was an assistant under Lubick in the early 1990s. The job was reported to involve breaking down film and helping with recruiting. However, Lubick did not take that job, and remained in Fort Collins, working with several local businesses, and opening a restaurant (Sonny Lubick Steakhouse) in downtown Fort Collins. Personal life Lubick was born to mother Francis and Doc Lubick in Butte, Montana. He grew up with older sister Elizabeth, and younger siblings Donna and Jimmy. Lubick is married to wife Carol Jo and has three children: daughter Michelle, and sons Matt and Marc, both of whom have been assistant coaches under their father. In fact, his son, Matt Lubick is currently the Offensive Coordinator for the Nebraska Cornhuskers football team.

It used to be located close to the present-day Red Square, but in the early 16th century it was moved northeast to what is now Bolshaya Lubyanka Street. The Sretensky Monastery gave its name to adjacent streets and byways, namely Sretenka Street, Sretensky Boulevard, Sretensky Lane, Sretensky Deadend, and Sretensky Gates Square. History View of the monastery from Lubyanka Street in 1882. Unlike most other Russian Orthodox churches of the same name the monastery is not, as might be expected, named after one of the twelve Great Feasts of Russian Orthodox Church Sretenie Gospodne (Presentation of Our Lord in the Temple), with Sretenie being a Church Slavonic word for \\"meeting\\". The origin of the monastery's name comes from the fact that it was built on the spot where the muscovites and the ruling Prince had met the icon of Our Lady of Vladimir on August 26, 1395. It was being moved from Vladimir to Moscow to protect the capital from the imminent invasion of Tamerlane. Soon thereafter, the armies of Tamerlane retreated and the grateful monarch founded the monastery to commemorate the miracle. In 1552, the Muscovites gathered at the walls of the monastery to meet the Russian army returning after the conquest of Kazan. In 1925, the monastery was closed down. In 1928-1930, most of its buildings were dismantled by the Soviets, including the Church of Mary of Egypt (14th-16th century) and Church of Saint Nicholas (16th century). Only the Cathedral of the Meeting of the Icon of Our Lady of Vladimir (—Å–æ–±–æ—Ä –°—Ä–µ—Ç–µ–Ω–∏—è –í–ª–∞–¥–∏–º–∏—Ä—Å–∫–æ–π –∏–∫–æ–Ω—ã –ë–æ–≥–æ–º–∞—Ç–µ—Ä–∏) with a side chapel to the Nativity of John the Forerunner (built in 1679 by the order of tsar Fyodor Alexeyevich) survived to this day. Services in the Vladimirsky Cathedral resumed in 1991. The cathedral was transferred to the authority of the Pskovo-Pechorsky Monastery in 1994, but nowadays it is a separate monastic establishment, with Patriarch Kirill as its archimandrite. Since 1998 the Monasteries is headed by Bishop Tikhon (Shevkunov) as the Patriarch's representative (namestnik).

Development The DH.60 was developed from the larger DH.51 biplane.Bransom 1991, p. 11. The first flight of the Cirrus powered prototype DH.60 Moth (registration G-EBKT) was carried out by Geoffrey de Havilland at the works airfield at Stag Lane on 22 February 1925. The Moth was a two-seat biplane of wooden construction, it had a plywood covered fuselage and fabric covered surfaces, a standard tailplane with a single tailplane and fin. A useful feature of the design was its folding wings which allowed owners to hangar the aircraft in much smaller spaces. The then Secretary of State for Air Sir Samuel Hoare became interested in the aircraft and the Air Ministry subsidised five flying clubs and equipped them with Moths. The prototype was modified with a horn-balanced rudder, as used on the production aircraft, and was entered into the 1925 King's Cup Race flown by Alan Cobham. Deliveries commenced to flying schools in England. One of the early aircraft was fitted with an all-metal twin-float landing gear to become the first Moth seaplane. The original production Moths were later known as Cirrus I Moths. Three aircraft were modified for the 1927 King's Cup Race with internal modifications and a Cirrus II engine on a lowered engine mounting. The original designation of DH.60X (for experimental) was soon changed to Cirrus II Moth; the DH.60X designation was re-used in 1928 for the Cirrus III powered version with a split axle. The production run for the DH.60X Moth was short as it was replaced by later variants, but it was still available to special order. =Gipsy engine= Although the Cirrus engine was reliable, its manufacture was not. It depended on components salvaged from World War I‚Äìera 8-cylinder Renault engines and therefore its numbers were limited by the stockpiles of surplus Renaults. De Havilland therefore decided to replace the Cirrus with a new engine built by his own factory. In 1928 when the new de Havilland Gipsy I engine was available a company DH.60 Moth G-EBQH was re- engined as the prototype of the DH.60G Gipsy Moth. Next to the increase in power, the main advantage of this update was that the Gipsy was a completely new engine available in as great a number as the manufacture of Moths necessitated. The new Gipsy engines could simply be built in-house on a production-line side by side with the Moth airframes. This also enabled de Havilland to control the complete process of building a Moth airframe, engine and all, streamline productivity and in the end lower manufacturing costs. While the original DH.60 was offered for a relatively modest ¬£650, by 1930 the price of a new Gipsy-powered Moth was still ¬£650, this in spite of its state- of-the-art engine. DH.60G-III Moth Major G-ADHE at Coventry in June 1954 A metal-fuselage version of the Gipsy Moth was designated the DH.60M Moth and was originally developed for overseas customers, particularly Canada. The DH.60M was also licence-built in Australia, Canada, the United States and Norway. Also in 1931 a variant of the DH.60M was marketed for military training as the DH.60T Moth Trainer. In 1931 with the upgrade of the Gipsy engine as the Gipsy II, de Havilland inverted the engine and re-designated it the Gipsy III. The engine was fitted into a Moth aircraft, which was re- designated the DH.60G-III Moth Major. This sub-type was intended for the military trainer market and some of the first aircraft were supplied to the Swedish Air Force. The DH.60T Moth was re-engined with the Gipsy III and was initially re-designated the DH.60T Tiger Moth. The DH.60T Tiger Moth was further modified with swept back mainplanes and the cabane struts were moved forward to improve egress from the front cockpit in case of emergency. The changes were great enough that the aircraft was again re-designated, becoming the DH.82 Tiger Moth. Design  Lower port wing internal structure Apart from the engine, the new Gipsy Moth was still a standard DH.60. Except for changes to accommodate the engine the fuselage remained the same as before, the exhaust still ran alongside the left side of the cockpits and the logo on the right side still read 'De Havilland Moth'. The fuel tank was still housed in the bulging airfoil that formed the centre section of the upper wing. The wings could still be folded alongside the fuselage and still had de Havilland's patented differential ailerons on the bottom mainplanes and no ailerons on the top ones. Colour options still remained as simple as before: wings and tail in \\"Moth silver\\", fuselage in the colour the buyer chose. Operational history As there was no real comparison between the original DH.60 and the new DH.60G, the Gipsy Moth quickly became the mainstay of British flying clubs as the only real recreational aircraft in the UK. By 1929 it was estimated that of every 100 aeroplanes in Britain, 85 were Moths of one type or another, most of them Gipsy Moths. This was in spite of the fact that with de Havilland having switched from the Cirrus engine to its own Gipsy engine, surplus Cirruses were now pouring into the market and a trove of Cirrus-powered aircraft like the Avro Avian, the Klemm Swallow, and the Miles Hawk started fighting for the flying club and private market. Although replaced in production by the DH.82 Tiger Moth, the Gipsy Moth remained the mainstay of the British flying scene up to the start of WWII. The war however marked the end of the Gipsy Moth and post-war it was quickly replaced by ex- RAF Tiger Moths pouring into the civilian market. =DH.60 Moth in flying clubs= The DH.60 arrived at the right spot at the right time. Next to the Moth's maiden flight, 1925 also marked the birth of the first five Royal Aero Club flying schools and clubs and with its simplicity and performance, the Moth was the aircraft of choice to equip the clubs. De Havilland then used this income to concentrate on developing the Moth further into a mass- produced, mass-market aircraft. The Moth made the aero clubs at least just as much as the aero clubs made the Moth. The Moth remained the mainstay of the clubs even long after more modern aircraft became available. With de Havilland's habit of painting the wings and tailplane of the Moth in silver also came the clubs' habit of distinguishing their aircraft by painting their fuselage in one distinctive club colour. Aircraft of the London Aero Club had a yellow fuselage (plus yellow struts and wheel caps); those of Newcastle a red one. Green stood for the Midlands and blue for Lancashire. Registration letters were black on the wings and, depending on the club colour, either black or white on the fuselage. DH.60 Moth built in 1931 in France under licence by Morane-Saulnier As the Royal Aero Club marketed the idea of flying clubs to other members of the Commonwealth, the de Havilland Aircraft Company followed suit and soon established subsidiaries in Australia and Canada to stock the local flying clubs there with Gipsy Moths. Canadian Moths were offered with a detachable canopy for winter flying. Other factories to licence-build the Gipsy Moth were the Larkin Aircraft Supply Company in Australia (which built 32 for the RAAF). Although built for flying clubs rather than for individual air cruising, the Australian Moths were the DH.60 L \\"Luxury\\" version and were delivered with their fuselages sporting the L's characteristic two-tone colour scheme rather than the fuselage entirely painted in the club colour as was customary in British flying clubs. Other manufacturers were Morane-Saulnier in France (40 built) and a company called Moth Aircraft Co. in the U.S. (18 built). =DH.60 Moth in private use= Amy Johnson and Jason, a DH.60G Gipsy Moth, in Jhansi, India in 1930 Most Gipsy Moths belonged to flying clubs, but after the Prince of Wales purchased a Gipsy Moth (G-AALG) for his own private flying, the aircraft became popular with high society. In addition the Moth was used for many record flights. The 'Lonely Flyer' Sir Francis Chichester flew his Gipsy Moth from England to Australia, on to New Zealand and then across the Pacific to Japan. Although he originally planned to fly around the world, a crash in Japan convinced him to switch to sailing. (Chichester subsequently named his yachts 'Gipsy Moth II', 'Gipsy Moth III', and most famously, 'Gipsy Moth IV'.) Of the aviatrixes, London secretary Amy Johnson flew her Gipsy Moth (G-AAAH \\"Jason\\") 11,000 mi (17,703 km) to Australia in 1930, and Jean Batten used a Gipsy Moth for her flights from England to India and England to Australia (the aircraft used to fly to India was G-AALG borrowed from Victor Dor√©e, who then owned the plane. In March 1928 Mary Bailey flew her Cirrus Moth solo from Croydon to Cape Town, a trip of three weeks, and returned the following year. Amy Johnson's Gipsy Moth (G-AAAH \\"Jason\\") =DH.60 Moth in military service= Although the DH.60T was aggressively marketed as a military trainer, response was rather lukewarm. In particular the RAF initially purchased only a handful of aircraft for testing and found that many aspects of the Moth did not suit their method of military flight training. However, by 1931 the RAF had acquired 124 DH.60M Moths and these were used by the Central Flying School and other training units until 1939. Moth trainers were however ordered by a number of foreign air forces including those of Argentina, Australia (as noted above), Austria, Norway, Portugal, Sweden and the flying arm of the Danish Navy. Finland licence-built 22 Moth trainers, but equipped them with the old Cirrus engine. Two Gipsy Moths were purchased by the Paraguayan government during the Chaco War. They were used as liaison aircraft. One was lost in a fatal accident at √ëu-Guaz√∫ Air Force Base and the other survived the war. It was transferred to the Paraguayan Aeroclub in 1936. The bulk of military Moths however were civilian sport aircraft impressed by their countries air forces and used as trainers and liaison aircraft. Like this, civilian Moths ended up flying for both the Nationalist and Republican air forces during the Spanish Civil War. This was repeated on a larger scale during the Second World War where Moths ended up flying, amongst others, for the air forces of Egypt, China (with several captured ex-Chinese aircraft flying for the Japanese), Ireland, Italy, Iraq, Belgian Congo, Dutch East Indies (later taken over by the Indonesian AF), South Africa, New Zealand and the U.S. Navy.

This very small car originated as a fairground Dodgem and was electrically powered. In 1934, the designer Jack Shillan changed the engine to a 98 cc Villiers Midget single-cylinder engine and sold it for road use. The transmission was single speed and operated by a single pedal which opened the throttle on being pressed down and applied the brake when released. The clutch was automatic. There were no springs. Drive was to one of the rear wheels and the single brake operated on the other. It was said to be capable of reaching 15 mph (25 km/h). The body was open and had a single seat. Later cars from about 1939 had a larger 250 cc engine, a three speed gearbox and normal pedal controls. Top speed was 40 mph (65 km/h). Two seats were now fitted along with electric lights. A commercial version, the Scootatruck was also made and for publicity some were styled to look like Vauxhall and Chrysler models. About 1000 were made.

Butakoff, Imperial Russian Navy, 1848 & 1849\\") Taras Shevchenko: Tent of the expedition on the island of Barsa-Kelmes, 1848 Barsa-Kelmes (, , Barsakelmes meaning \\"the place of no return\\") is a former island, the largest in the Aral Sea. Its area was 133 km2 in the 1980s, but as the sea became more shallow it steadily grew, until in the 1990s it ceased to be an island. Its highest altitude is 113 m. It encompasses the Barsa-Kelmes Nature Reserve. Because of the native salt deposits, visitors are recommended to close their eyes during dust storms and strong winds. History The first recorded survey of Barsa-Kelmes was made in August 1848, when Geographer A. Maksheyev and topographer A. Akishev made a topographical survey of the island and described its landscape. The first sketches of the local flora and fauna were made by Taras Shevchenko. A jumping spider, Sitticus barsakelmes, was named after the island in 1998. =Urban legend= During the second half of the 20th century, there was a persistent urban legend about paranormal phenomena occurring on the island. The legend reached its peak in the early 1990s, when popular science magazine Tekhnika Molodyozhi published a large article about these phenomena, listing local medical student Sergey Lukyanenko as their chief source.Tekhnika Molodyozhi (–¢–µ—Ö–Ω–∏–∫–∞ –º–æ–ª–æ–¥–µ–∂–∏), 1991, No. 3;Tekhnika Molodyozhi 1993, No. 4. It told an engaging story of variable flow of time on the island and possible UFO visitation, and featured letters and stories from local fishermen about strange temporal variations, disappearing expeditions, and other mysteries. It was later revealed, however, that the legends were a series of elaborate hoaxes perpetrated by successive generations of local writers and journalists, which central publications in the USSR had believed and picked up to boost public interest. The hoax had in fact been first perpetrated and then revealed by Lukyanenko and Grigory Neverov, then president of KLF MGU (KLF = kluba lyubiteley fantastiki, club of fantasy fans), whose involvement started it all. As the story went, when Neverov asked his colleagues throughout the Soviet Union whether they recalled any stories about paranormal phenomena in their regions, Lukyanenko, then an active member of the Almaty KLF, remembered some rumors about mysterious doings on Barsa- Kelmes and decided to play a practical joke on the Muscovite. He found the origin of the rumors, an old story in a local newspaper, together with his friends fabricated the evidences like the letters from fishermen, and even invented a local version of a Kazakh epic about the hero . Neverov bought into a story and reported it to the TM editorial staff, who published the article. Later, when Lukyanenko admitted the hoax to Neverov, they tried to trace the origin of the article that had inspired the joke, and found that it itself was a joke by a local journalist.

It is located about 45 km from Farrukhabad, and 55 km from Budaun. It is a very important place from an historical and mythological point of view. Ancient In ancient times this town reached its highest glory as the capital of the Panchala Kingdom, extended from Himalayas in the north to the river Charmanwati in the south during the period of the Mahabharata. It had Kuru, Surasena and Matsya kingdoms to the west and the forest Naimisha to the east. Later, Panchala was divided into Southern Panchala (Panchala proper ruled by King Drupada, the father in law of the Pandavas) and Northern Panchala (ruled by Ashwathama, the son of Drona. Drona was Drupada's former friend who became his enemy later). The Ganges River separated the two Panchalas.  Southern Panchala  Capital: Kampilya :- Kampil, Fatehgarh, Uttar Pradesh Southern Panchala or Panchala-proper had Kampilya city as its capital, now a small town named Kampil near Farrukhabad in Uttar Pradesh. This kingdom extended from the Ganges River to river Charmanwati. It is believed to be the birthplace of the 13th tirthankar Brahlan Vimal Nath. This is a Holy Land where the four Kalyanakas‚Äîchayavan, birth, diksa and omniscience‚Äîof Tirthankar 1008 Bhagawan Vimalnath ji, the thirteenth Tirthnakara took place. It was also graced by the visit of Lord Mahavir. Apart from these, there are many old temples, which signify the historical and religious importance of Kampil. During the epic period it was the capital of King Drupad, the father of Draupadi. The sacrificial altar (Yajna Kund) from which Draupadi is believed to have been born from the fire of knowledge, is situated in Kampil. Near the sacrificial altar, there is a structure, which is the hermitage of a sage Kampil, where he used to perform penance. By tradition the temple of Rameshwarnath Mahadev is attributed to Shatrughana, brother of Rama. It is said that he had brought the idol (Lingam) of Shiva, which was worshiped by Sita, the wife of Rama in Ashok Vatika while she was held in captivity in Lanka and installed it in this temple.

The following passage from Mahabharata, that describes the Puru lineage of kings, shows the kinship of the Kurus and the Panchalas, both branched out from the same line. When Janamejaya wished to hear the history of kings who were descended from Puru. Vaisampayana narrated the lineage of kings in Puru's line.  Lineage of Puru Kings up to the branching of Panchala tribe  Puru had by his wife Paushti three sons, Pravira, Iswara, and Raudraswa. Amongst them, Pravira was the perpetuator of the dynasty. Pravira had by his wife Suraseni a son named Manasyu. Manasyu had for his wife Sauviri. And he begat upon her three sons called Sakta, Sahana, and Vagmi. Raudraswa begat upon the Apsara Misrakesi ten sons. They all had sons. They are Richeyu, Kaksreyu Vrikeyu, Sthandileyu, Vaneyu, Jaleyu, Tejeyu, Satyeyu, Dharmeyu and Sannateyu the tenth. Amongst them all, Richeyu became the sole monarch and was known by the name of Anadhrishti. Anadhristi had a son of the name of Matinara who became a famous and virtuous king and performed the Rajasuya and the Ashwamedha. Matinara had four sons viz., Tansu, Mahan, Atiratha, and Druhyu. (Amongst them, Tansu of great prowess became the perpetrator of Puru's line). Tansu begat a son named Ilina. Ilina begat upon his wife Rathantara five sons with Dushmanta (Dushyanta) at their head. They were Dushmanta, Sura, Bhima, Pravasu, and Vasu. The eldest of them, Dushmanta, became king. Dushmanta had by his wife Sakuntala an intelligent son named Bharata who became king. Bharata gave his name to the race of which he was the founder. It is from him that the fame of that dynasty hath spread so wide. Bharata begat upon his three wives nine sons in all. But none of them were like their father and so Bharata was not at all pleased with them. Their mothers, therefore, became angry and slew them all. The procreation of children by Bharata, therefore, became vain. The monarch then performed a great sacrifice and through the grace of Bharadwaja obtained a son named Bhumanyu. Then Bharata, the great descendant of Puru, regarding himself as really possessing a son, installed that son as his heir-apparent. Bhumanyu begat upon his wife, Pushkarini six sons named Suhotra, Suhotri, Suhavih, Sujeya, Diviratha and Kichika. During the virtuous reign of Suhotra the surface of the whole earth was dotted all over with hundreds and thousands, of sacrificial stakes. Suhotra, begat, upon his wife Aikshaki three sons, viz., Ajamidha, Sumidha, and Purumidha. The eldest of them, Ajamidha, was the perpetuator of the royal line. And he begat six sons,--Riksha was born of the womb of his wife Dhumini; Dushmanta and Parameshthin, of his wife Nili; Jahnu, Jala and Rupina were born of his wife Kesini. Kushikas are the sons of Jahnu. All the tribes of the Panchalas are descended from Dushmanta and Parameshthin, two sons of the second wife of Puru king Ajamidha. = War between Panchalas and the forefathers of Kurus = Continuous war between the Kurus and Panchalas led the defeated Kurus to be exiled from their kingdom. They lived in the forests on the banks of Sindhu. Later the Kurus retook their capital. Riksha who was older than both Jala and Rupina became king. Riksha begat Samvarana, the perpetuator of the royal line. While Samvarana, the son of Riksha, was ruling, there happened a great loss of people from famine, pestilence, drought, and disease. The Bharata princes were beaten by the troops of enemies. And the Panchalas setting out to invade the whole land with their four kinds of troops soon brought the whole land under their sway. And with their ten Akshauhinis the king of the Panchalas defeated the Bharata prince. Samvarana then with his wife and ministers, sons and relatives, fled in fear, and took shelter in the forest on the banks of the Sindhu extending to the foot of the (western) mountains. There the Bharatas lived for a full thousand years (for a long period), within their fort. After they had lived there a long period, one day the sage Vasishtha approached the exiled Bharatas. It hath been heard that Vasishtha (becoming the priest) then installed the Bharata prince in the sovereignty of all the Kshatriyas. The king retook the capital that had been taken away from him and once more made all monarchs pay tribute to him. The powerful Samvarana, was thus installed once more in the actual sovereignty of the whole land. Samvarana begat upon his wife, Tapati (whose abode was on the banks of river Tapati (Tapti, Maharashtra)), the daughter of Surya (a king of the Solar Dynasty), a son named Kuru. This Kuru was exceedingly virtuous, and therefore, he was installed on the throne by his people. It is after his name that the field called Kurujangala (eastern Haryana) has become so famous in the world. Devoted to asceticism, he made that field Kurukshetra sacred by practising asceticism there. He was the founder of the Kuru dynasty and the Kuru Kingdom. It seems that the Samvarana who retook the capital was another king in the line of the exiled king Samvarana. Another interesting fact is that sages in the line of Vasistha, were the priests of Solar Dynasty of kings (especially the Ikshwakus) for many generations. This could be the reason why Samvarana, who took Vasistha as his priest, married from the Solar Dynasty. The history of Samvarana falling in love with Tapati, while he roamed in the vicinity of Tapati river (Tapti river Maharashtra) and Vasistha's help in getting the consent of king Surya, her father, to give her in marriage to Samvaran‚Äîall these are mentioned at (1-173,174,175,176). = Drupada becomes the king of Panchala = *Mahabharata, Book 1: Adi Parva, Chapter 131: The History of Drona There was a king named Prishata who was a great friend of Bharadwaja. About this time Prishata had a son born unto him, named Drupada. Drupada, the son of Prishata, used every day to come to the hermitage of Bharadwaja to play with Drona and study in his company. When Prishata was dead, this Drupada became the king of the Northern Panchalas. Once Drupada became the king, he forgot his friendship with Drona. Drupada insulted Drona by telling him that he deserved not to be his friend, because Drona was not a king, but a poor Brahmana. = The partition of the Panchala Kingdom = *Mahabharata, Book 1: Adi Parva, Chapter 140: Arjuna takes Drupada captive Drona defeated Drupada, by means of his disciple Arjuna, to settle his old scores. Drona spoke as follows to the captive Drupada:- Thou toldest me before that none who was not a king could be a king's friend. Therefore, is it, O Yajnasena (Drupada), that I retain half thy kingdom. Thou art the king of all the territory lying on the southern side of the Bhagirathi (Ganga), while I become king of all the territory on the north of that river. And, O Panchala, if it pleaseth thee, know me hence for thy friend. On hearing these words, Drupada answered:-, Thou art of noble soul and great prowess. Therefore, O Brahmana, I am not surprised at what thou doest. I am very much gratified with thee, and I desire thy eternal friendship. After this, Drona released the king of Panchala, and cheerfully performing the usual offices of regard, bestowed upon him half the kingdom. Thenceforth Drupada began to reside sorrowfully in the city of Kampilya within the province of Makandi on the banks of the Ganges filled with many towns and cities. And after his defeat by Drona, Drupada ruled the Southern Panchalas up to the bank of the Charmanwati river. Meanwhile, Drona continued to reside in Ahichatra. Thus was the territory of Ahicchatra full of towns and cities, obtained by Arjuna, and bestowed upon Drona. (Later, Drona gave the rulership of Northern Panchala kingdom to his son Ashwathama and stayed at Hastinapura the capital of Kuru Kingdom.) = The higher status of Panchalas and Kurus in ancient India = The Kuru-Panchala was considered foremost among the provinces in Bharata Varsha (ancient India), comprising the Kuru and Panchala Kingdoms (6,9). The Kurus and Panchalas were considered as foremost among the ruling tribes in ancient India, adhering close to the Vedic religion. They were the proponents of the Vedic religion in its dogmatic and purest form. Other tribes imitated the practices of these tribes and thus got accepted into the Vedic religions. Commencing with the Panchalas, the Kauravas, the Naimishas (a forest-country to the east of Panchala), the Matsyas, all these, know what religion is. The old men among the Northerners, the Angas, the Magadhas, without themselves knowing what virtue is follow the practices of the Kuru-Panchalas (8,45). The Kurus and the Panchalas comprehend from a half-uttered speech; the Salwas cannot comprehend till the whole speech is uttered. The Magadhas are comprehenders of signs; the Koshalas comprehend from what they see. The Mountaineers, like the Sivis, are very stupid. The Yavanas are omniscient; the Suras are particularly so. The mlecchas are wedded to the creations of their own fancy that other peoples cannot understand (8,45). The Panchalas observe the duties enjoined in the Vedas; the Kauravas observe truth; the Matsyas and the Surasenas perform sacrifices. Beginning with the Matsyas, the residents of the Kuru and the Panchala countries, the Naimishas as well and the other respectable peoples, the pious among all races are conversant with the eternal truths of religion. The Kauravas with the Panchalas, the Salwas, the Matsyas, the Naimishas, the Koshalas, the Kasapaundras, the Kalingas, the Magadhas, and the Chedis who are all highly blessed, know what the eternal religion is (8,45). = Territories and locations within the Panchala Kingdom =  Kichaka Kingdom  Capital: Vetrakiya See Also:- Matsya Kingdom = Kichaka the commander-in-chief of Matsya army = Kichaka Kingdom was a territory lying to the south of (southern) Panchala. It was ruled by Kichaka clan of kings. They belonged to the Suta caste (offspring of Kshatriyas upon Brahmana ladies) . One among the Kichakas was the commander-in-chief of the Matsya army under king Virata. He was slain by Pandava Bhima due to his bad conduct towards the wife of Pandavas, viz Draupadi. Kichaka kingdom also lay to the east of the Matsya Kingdom under the rule of king Virata. It seems that this territory was allied to both the Matsyas and Panchalas, with its own independent rulers. Its capital was mentioned to be Vetrakiya, on the banks of the river Vetravati (Betwa) also known as Suktimati. = The town named Ekachakra = It is believed that the Pandavas lived in a small town named Ekachakra, belonging to this territory, during their wanderings after Duryodhana attempted to murder them at Varanavata (a Kuru city). In the course of their wanderings the Pandavas saw the countries of the Matsyas, the Trigartas, the Panchalas and then of the Kichakas, and also many beautiful woods and lakes therein. They all had matted locks on their heads and were attired in barks of trees and the skins of animals. They attired in the garbs of ascetics. They used to study the Rik and the other Vedas and also all the Vedangas as well as the sciences of morals and politics. Finally they met Vyasa. He told them:- Not far off before you is a delightful town. Saying this he led them into the town of Ekachakra. on arriving at Ekachakra, the Pandavas lived for a short time in the abode of a Brahmana, leading an eleemosynary life. (1,159). During this period, Bhima slew a Rakhsasa named Baka (Vaka), at Vetrakiya. He controlled the affairs of that kingdom (Kichaka Kingdom) making the king of the kingdom, a name-sake king. By slaying the Rakshasa, Bhima freed that kingdom from Baka's the reign of terror. (1-165-166).  Pandavas journey from Ekachakra to Kampilya  Pandavas proceeded towards Panchala with their mother, to attend the self-choice event of princess Draupadi. In order to reach their destination, they proceeded in a due northerly direction, walking day and night till they reached a sacred shrine of Siva with the crescent mark on his brow. Then those tigers among men, the sons of Pandu, arrived at the banks of the Ganges. It was a forest called Angaraparna. Here, they encountered a Gandharva named Angaraparna (See Gandharva Kingdom) (1,172). After that encounter they went to a place called Utkochaka, where they met sage Dhaumya. They appointed Dhaumya, the younger brother of Devala, as their priest (1,185). Then they proceeded towards the country of the southern Panchalas ruled over by the king Drupada They proceeded by slow stages staying for some time within those beautiful woods and by fine lakes that they beheld along their way and entered the capital of the Panchalas. Beholding the capital (Kampilya), as also the fort, they took up their quarters in the house of a potter. Desirous of beholding the Swayamvara (self-choice ceremony of the princess), the citizens, roaring like the sea, all took their seats on the platforms that were erected around the amphitheatre. The kings from diverse countries entered the grand amphitheatre by the north-eastern gate. And the amphitheatre which itself had been erected on an auspicious and level plain to the north-east of Drupada's capital, was surrounded by beautiful mansions. And it was enclosed on all sides with high walls and a moat with arched doorways here and there. The Pandavas, too, entering that amphitheatre, sat with the Brahmanas and beheld the unequalled affluence of the king of the Panchalas (1,187). Arjuna won the competition set for winning Draupadi in the self- choice ceremony (1,192).  Kanyakubja Kingdom  This kingdom is identified to be the modern day Kannauj district of Uttar Pradesh. During the reign of King Drupada of southern Panchala, this territory formed a part of the southern Panchala Gadhi, born in the race of king Kusika and Gadhi's son Viswamitra, were mentioned as the earlier rulers of this kingdom at (1, 176). Gadhi's daughter was married to Richika (could be related to the Rishikas in the north), belonging to the Bhargava clan. Richika's son was Jamadagni and Jamadagni's son was the celebrated Bhargava Rama. Gadhi mentioned to Richika about a custom followed by their race, that during marriage, that the bridegroom should give to the bride side a dower of 3,000 fleet steeds with brown color. (This custom is similar to that of Madra Culture.) Richika get the horses from Varuna (Varuna is indicative of western cultures. Note that Arjuna also got his excellent chariot, horses and bow from Varuna). The horses reached Kanyakubja capital, crossing the river Ganges. The spot where they crossed the river was known by the name 'horse's landing place' (3,115). Not far from Kanyakubja, a spot in the sacred bank of the Ganges is still famous among men as Aswatirtha in consequence of the appearance of those horses at that place (13,4). Both the Kusikas and the Bhargava-Richikas seems to have links with the ancient western-cultures (See Also: Bahlika Culture, Madra Culture, Rishika Kingdom and Rishikas). Viswamitra (Kusika's race) was born as a Kshatriya and later became a Brahmana, much like what was common in Madra Cultures. Bhargava Rama ( Richika's race) was mentioned as an expert in the use of the battle-axe, which he got from Kailasa region (Kailas range Tibet). The Rishika tribe, who were experts in the use of battle-axes were located not far from this region. The custom of donating or accepting horses as dowry also indicates a north-western culture. It seems that neither the Bhargavas (and Richikas or Rishikas) nor the Kusikas, maintained any distinctions such as Brahmana and Kshatriya upon themselves. However during the later periods, when the Vedic religion became rigid in its four-order caste-system, the Bhargavas were accepted as Brahmanas and the Kusikas as Kshatriyas Gadhi was mentioned as a sovereign whose military force was exceedingly great (3,115). Viswamitra also was mentioned as possessing a large army and many animals and vehicles. Using those animals and vehicles he used to roam around in the forests in search of deer (1,176). During his wanderings he met the sage Vasistha. He engaged in a dispute with this sage, on the matter of the wealth of cattle possessed by the sage. (Cattle wealth always caused dispute among ancient Indian kingdoms. See the dispute between Matsyas and Trigartas for the sake of cattle wealth; in Matsya Kingdom). Viswamitra had to encounter many local- armies to seize the cattle wealth. (See Dravidas, Keralas, Paundras and Kiratas, Pulindas). He was vanquished by the local-armies (1,177). After the defeat from Vasistha, Viswamitra adopted the life of an ascetic. Bhargava Rama also is mentioned to defeat many tribes like Heheyas and later adopting the life of an ascetic. Thus both the Kusikas and Bhargava-Richikas were warrior- tribes, who also were a priest-like class of people. *In the country of Panchala, there is a forest called Utpala, where Viswamitra of Kusika's race had performed sacrifices with his son (3,87). = Pandavas's route from Dwiata lake to Matsya kingdom = Panchala was one among the countries considered by the Pandavas to spend their 13th year of anonymity along with the kingdoms viz Chedi, Matsya, Surasena, Pattachchara, Dasarna, Navarashtra, Malla, Salva, Yugandhara, Saurashtra, Avanti, and the spacious Kuntirashtra (4,1). Pandavas selected the Matsya Kingdom for their 13th year of anonymous life. Pandavas ordered their chief servant Indrasena and the others to take with then the empty chariots and to speedily proceeded to Dwaravati. All the maid-servants of Draupadi were ordered to go to the Panchala kingdom. After that the Pandavas left Dwaita lake in the Dwaita forest and proceeded to Matsya kingdom. Dhaumya, their priest, taking their sacred fires, set out for the Panchala Kingdom (4,4). Pandavas travelling eastwards, reached river Yamuna. Travelling along the southern banks of Yamuna, they passed through Yakrilloma, Surasena. Then they turned westwards (possibly to deceive the spies of Duryodhana, who might have following them), leaving behind, on their right (north side), the country of the Panchalas, and on their left (south side), that of the Dasarnas entered the Matsya Kingdom (4,5). = Impact of Magadha Kings on Panchala = Due to the power of Magadha king Jarasandha, many ancient tribes had to shift their domains. Prominent among them were the Yadavas, who fled from Surasena Kingdom to south-west to Anarta Kingdom. The king of the Salwayana tribe with their brethren and followers, and the southern Panchalas and the eastern Kosalas also had to flee to the country of the Kuntis (which was south of these kingdoms) (2,14). Even though only king Jarasandha is mentioned, this situation could have arisen due to many generations of powerful Magadha kings who were forefathers of Jarasandha. During the reign of Drupada, no shift in the location of southern Panchala is mentioned explicitly. If the situation was created by Jarasandha alone, and no other Magadha kings later or earlier to him, then this shift of southern- Panchala could be temporary. = Dispute of Panchalas with Dasarnas = There arose a dispute between the Dasarna Kingdom lying to the south, and the southern-Panchala king Drupada, upon the matter of the gender of prince Shikhandi, who was married to the princess of Dasarna. = Panchala's alliance with Pandava King Yudhishthira = Bhima during his military campaign to the east, to collect tribute for Yudhishthira's Rajasuya sacrifice, first visited the Panchala Kingdom after leaving his home city Indraprastha (2,28). only two tribes do not pay tribute unto Yudhishthira, viz., the Panchalas in consequence of their relationship by marriage, and the Andhakas and Vrishnis (Anarta Yadavas) in consequence of their friendship (2,51). When the Pandavas were banished by Duryodhana to the woods, by taking over their kingdom, both the Panchalas and Yadavas visited them along with other cousines like Chedis and Kekeyas (3,12). Pandavas five son's by Draupadi, spent some of their life in Panchala and some in Dwaraka during the 13-year-long exile of the Pandavas. During their pilgrimage all around India, Yudhishthira asked the weak men among his followers to go to king Dhritarashtra of Kuru Kingdom and if he didn't take care of them, then to king Drupada of southern Panchala (3,92). Yudhishthira and his followers, with Matsya king Virata, began to make preparations for war (Kurukshetra War). Virata and his relatives sent word to all the monarchs, and Panchala king Drupada also did the same. And at the request of Pandavas, as also of the two kings of the Matsyas and the Panchalas, many kings gathered for their cause (5,5). Druupada sent his priest to Hastinapura for the initial peace talks (5-19,20). Drupada, the king of the Panchalas, surrounded by his ten heroic sons, Satyajit and other headed by Dhrishtadyumna, and well-protected by Shikhandi, and having furnished his soldiers with necessary things, joined the Pandavas with a full Akshauhini (5,57). = Panchalas in Kurukshetra War = Panchalas were the closest among all the allies of the Pandavas in the Kurukshetra War. Panchala prince Dhristadyumna was the commander-in-chief for the whole of the Pandava army. Many heroes from Panchala fought in the war. Most of them were alive till the end of the war. However all of them were slain by Ashwathama in an ambush, when they were asleep in their tents, on the last day of the war. Ashwathama was the ruler of half of the Panchala Kingdom viz the northern Panchala, under Kuru king Duryodhana. Northern Panchala was then reduced to the status of a province of the Kuru Kingdom. This could be the political factor that caused the Panchalas (southern Panchalas) to become kinsmen of the Pandavas, who were a rebel force in the Kuru Kingdom. By supporting the Pandavas in Kurukshetra War they might have sought to regain their lost Panchala territories.  Panchala Heroes  At (1,140) Satyajit is mentioned as the commander-in- chief of the Panchala army under king Drupada who fought against Arjuna who was then a disciple of Drona, the preceptor in warfare, in the Kuru Kingdom. He came to the Kurukshetra War leading the one Akshouhini of Panchala army. The brave warriors among the Panchalas, viz., Jayanta, Amitaujas and the great car-warrior Satyajit were mentioned as great car-warriors (Maharathas) by Bhishma. (5,172) The Panchala princes (5,57) Yudhamanyu and Uttamaujas were protectors of Arjuna's car-wheels (7-88,89), during the battle. Similarly the Panchala prince Kumara is mentioned as one of the protectors of Yudhishthira's car-wheels, along with another hero Yugadhara (hailing from the city of Yugandhara, located somewhere to the west of Kurujangala (either in Haryana or Punjab)). Kumara and Yugandhara was slain by Drona (7,16). Vyaghradatta was another Panchala prince slain by Drona along with Sinhasena (7,16). Dhrishtadyumna, Sikhandin, Janamejaya ( the son of Durmuksha), Chandrasen, Madrasen, Kritavarman, Dhruva, Dhara, Vasuchandra and Sutejana were mentioned as Panchala heroes, some of them being the sons of Drupada (7,155). The 10 sons of Drupada were mentioned at (5,57) and his five sons were mentioned at (8,85) as participating in the Kurukshetra War. Suratha and Satrunjaya were mentioned as sons of Drupada slain by Ashwathama (7,153), (9,14). At (7,184) Drupada's three grandsons were also mentioned as battling in the war. Shikhandi's son Khsatradeva was mentioned as battling in the war at (7,23). Dhristadyumna's sons, tender in year, were mentioned as slain by Drona in the war at (11,22). Valanika, Jayanika, Jaya, Prishdhra, and Chandrasena‚Äîthese heroes were also is believed to be of Panchala, slain by Ashwathama (7,153).  The Somakas, Srinjayas and the Prabhadrakas  These three names were mentioned frequently in the narration Kurukshetra War either as related to the Panchalas or as synonymous to the Panchalas. Srinjayas and Somakas were tribes allied to the Panchalas by kinship, born off from the various branches of the same royal lineage that brought forth the Panchala-tribe. They dwelled in the various provinces of the Panchala kingdom. Prabhadrakas seems to be an elite group of Panchala army, employed in Kurukshetra War. = The Somakas = Somaka seems to be a name used to denote all the tribes of Panchalas. The word Somaka, means the one who belonged to the Lunar Dynasty. This name could have given by rulers of Solar Dynasty. The Kosala Kingdom ruled by Solar Dynasty of kings lay to the east of Panchala. So this name could have been coined by the Kosalas to denote the Panchalas. Thus the name could be collective to the whole of the Panchala tribes or specific to the tribes that lie close to Kosala, i.e. the tribes that dwell in the eastern parts of Panchala. *Pancalas and Srinjayas were mentioned collectively as Somakas at (10,8). *Somakas and Panchalas were mentioned as different tribes at (5-175), (6-72,89,99,120), (7- 83, 123, 124, 148, 156, 157, 162, *167, 171, 184), (8- 22, 89), (9- 6, 17, 18, 21). *Somakas and Srinjayas were mentioned as different tribes at (6-15, 119), (8,92), (9,20) *Somakas and Prabhadrakas were mentioned as different tribes at (9-11). *The Srinjayas and the Panchalas, the Matsyas and the Somakas were mentioned as separate tribes at (7,158). *Drona during the war mentioned to Duryodhana thus:- I will not put off my armour without slaying all the Panchalas. O king, go and tell my son Ashwathama not let the Somakas alone. (7,148). *A Kurukshetra War hero, viz Kshatradharman is mentioned as belonging to the Somaka tribe, where another hero Uttamaujas is mentioned as belonging to the Panchala tribe (7,83). *A King Somaka is mentioned at (1-2,127,128) along with his son Jantu. King Somaka was the son of Sahadeva, and a most excellent maker of gifts and he performed a sacrifice on the banks of Yamuna. King Somaka is listed among the great kings of ancient India (6,9) (13-76,115). Somakas were mentioned as synonymous to Panchalas at many places. In some of these references Drupada is mentioned as a Somaka king and Dhristadyumna as a Somaka prince. Refer (1- 123, 133), (5- 5, 22, 48, 50, 130, 141, 152, 161), (6- 1, 43, 52, 59, 75, 77, 90, 98, 104, 108, 109, 117, 119), (7- 7, 23, 92, 107, 115, 122, 143, 152, 161, 166, 170, 188, 191, 198), (8- 24, 74, 78, 82, 89, 90, 91), (9- 7, 8, 30, 56, 57, 59), (10- 8). = The Srinjayas = Srinjaya king Hotravahana is mentioned as the maternal grandfather of Kasi princess Amba (Amva) (5 -178, 179). Amva, coming from Salwa stayed in the asylum of sage Saikhavatya (who dwelled on the banks of Saikavati river). Hotravahana met her granddaughter there. He is mentioned as a friend of Bhargava Rama. At (1,140) the Panchalas and Srinjayas were mentioned as attacking Arjuna when he try to make Drupada captive for the sake of Drona. *Uttamujas was mentioned as the great Srinjaya car-warrior at (8,75). *Srinjayas and Panchalas were mentioned as separate tribes at many places. Refer (1- 140), (5- 57), (6- 14, 89, 96, 116), (7- 21, 22, 38, 105, 108, 111, 119, 127, 153, 154, 157, 163, 171, 175, 181, 188, 197), (8- 3, 5, 10, 25, 32, 37, 47, 60, 96), (9- 13, 32, 55, 61), (10,8). *Chedis the Andhakas, the Vrishnis, the Bhojas, the Kukuras and the Srinjayas were mentioned as separate tribes at (5,28). Here the Andhakas, Vrishinis, Bhojas and the Kukuras were tribes belonging to the Yadava clan. *The Kasayas (Kasis), the Chedis, the Matsyas, the Srinjayas, the Panchalas, and the Prabhadrakas were mentioned as separate tribes at (5,57). *The Chedis, the Srinjayas, the Kasis and the Kosalas were mentioned as battling together for Pandavas at (7,122). *A Srinjaya king is mentioned as great amongst conquerors at (1- 1) . He is also mentioned at (2,8). At (7,53) Srinjaya is mentioned as the son of a king named Switya. Sinjaya's son named Suvarnashthivin was slain by some robber-tribes during his childhood. The sages Narada and Parvata (Narada's sister's son (12,30)) were Srinjaya's friends. Chapters (7- 53 to 69) describes a narration of Narada to Srinjaya, to console him in the death of his son. This is also mentioned at (12-29,30,31). *Bhishma mentions at (5,164) that he could slay the whole armies of Srinjayas and the Salweyas (Salwa lay to the west of Kuru while Panchala was to its east). Srinjayas were mentioned as synonymous to Panchalas at many places. Refer (3- 33,35), (5- 22, 24, 25, 26, 28, 48, 71, 72, 82, 93, 127, 162, 163, 168), (6- 16, 45, 59, 60, 72, 73, 74, 75, 87, 91, 99, 108, 109, 110, 115, 116, 120), (7- 2, 7, 9, 12, 13, 14, 16, 33, 76, 92, 94, 107, 122, 148, 151, 152, 180, 184, 190), (8- 21, 24, 31, 35, 51, 54, 56, 57, 58, 59, 61, 66, 67, 73, 75, 79, 85, 93, 94), (9- 19, 29, 33, 34, 57, 59, 61), (10,8), (11,26). *A king named Srinjaya is mentioned as an ally of Jayadratha king of Sindhu Kingdom. (3,263). = The Prabhadrakas = Prabhadrakas seems to be an elite army obtained by Panchalas from the Kambojas. They could also be a Panchala army-unit or a Panchala tribe, that were trained in cavalry warfare by the Kambojas. At (7,23) the Prabhadrakas were mentioned as hailing from Kamboja Kingdom.In MBH verse 7.23.43, as it can be seen from original Sanskrit text, the term Prabhadraka has been used as a qualifier before the Kambojas: : (MBH Gorakhpore Rec., 7.23.42-44) Hence in this context, the term Prabhadraka definitely implies adjective and not noun, and may not, therefore, be confused with the Prabhadraka clan. As an adjective, the term Prabhadraka/Prabhadrakastu means exceedingly handsome (Check up Prabhadraka in Monier-William Dictionary ). Researchers like Dr J. L. Kamboj, S Kirpal Singh etc have, therefore correctly taken the term Prabhadraka in the sense of an adjective rather than noun in the present context. Ganguli's translation is in error here. In fact, according to Sanskrit scholars, Ganguli's translation of MBH has numerous translations errors. (See also note 4 & 5 in: Parama Kamboja Kingdom). They could be the army bought by Panchals from the Kambojas, since Kambojas were famous for lending their horses or cavalry to any party on payment basis:- The Prabhadrakas of the Kamvoja country, numbering 6000, with upraised weapons, with excellent steeds on their gold-decked cars, with stretched bows, supported Dhristadyumna (6, 19), (7,23). To distinguish them from the proper Panchala army or from other Prabhadrakas, they were mentioned as Prabhadraka-Panchalas (7,151). They were 6000 in numbers and mentioned as supporting Shikhandi at (7,151). They were an elite group in the Pandava army (5- 48, 199). This army is mentioned as battling on the side of Pandavas at (6,112), (7- 159, 182), (8- 12, 22, 30, 48, 49, 56, 67), (9- 7, 11, 15, 27). Karna slew 770 foremost of warriors among the Prabhadrakas initially (8,48). He then slew 1700 of them (8, 67). A group of Prabhadrakas is mentioned as battling against Dhristadyumna at (7,92):- The chief of Avanti, with the Sauviras and the cruel Prabhadrakas, resisted wrathful Dhrishtadyumna. The Kasayas (Kasis), the Chedis, the Matsyas, the Srinjayas, the Panchalas, and the Prabhadrakas were mentioned as separate armies at (5,57). Prabhadrakas and Panchalas were mentioned as separate armies at (5- 152, 172), (6- 19, 49, 56), (7- 23, 33, 181, 191), (8- 61) and (9,1). When Ashwathama slaughtered the Panchalas in an ambush at night, when they were asleep, the Prabhadrakas headed by Shikhandi woke up and tried to put up some resistance. But Ashwathama and his army slew them all including Shikhandi. = Other References = *Brahmadatta is mentioned as a highly devout king of Panchala at (13,137). Here he is mentioned as donating a conch-shell. At (12,233) he is mentioned as donating two precious jewels called Nidhi and Sankha. He is mentioned at (12,342) also. *A sage from Panchala is mentioned as Rishi- Panchala (also known as Galava, born in the Vabhravya race) at (12-342,347). He compiled the rules in respect of the division of syllables and words for reading the Vedas and those about emphasis and accent in utterance, and shone as the first scholar who became conversant with those two subjects. He is mentioned to have acquired the science of Krama. Literary significance of Kampilya In Kampil there have also been great poets. (1) Mathura Chaubey Mukatimani (Kaviraja).

It connects the towns of Smith and Wellington to the California state line north of Bridgeport, California. Much of the route has served as a road through this section of Nevada since at least 1919, and was known as State Route 22 from the 1920s until the late 1970s. Route description The majority of the route lies within the Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest. The road begins as a continuation of California State Route 182 north of Bridgeport. That route, which follows the East Walker River as it flows from the Bridgeport Reservoir, crosses the Nevada state line east of the Sweetwater Mountains. SR 338 follows the river northeast for about before diverting northwest, away from the water's course. The route eventually passes the former town of Sweetwater as it climbs up toward the Sweetwater Summit. View from the north end of SR 338 looking southbound As SR 338 heads down from the summit, it passes between the Wellington Hills to the west and the Pine Grove Hills to the east. The route crosses several small creeks as it heads north entering the Smith Valley. Farmlands come into view as the highway approaches its junction with Wellington Road (SR 829), which heads towards Wellington and points west. State Route 338 continues due north from here, heading through more farm tracts before ending at a \\"Y\\" junction with State Route 208 just south of Smith. History Most of SR 338 was previously known as State Route 22. An unimproved road connecting the Smith Valley to Sweetwater and Bridgeport existed as early as 1917. By 1929, the road had been made part of the state's highway system as State Route 22. The route, which largely followed present-day Sweetwater Road, connected directly to State Route 3 (now SR 208) on the north end at Wellington, via the Wellington Cutoff, instead of the present northern terminus near Smith. Earthwork improvements were made on SR 22 by 1936, but the northern end of the route would not be paved until 1948 with the remainder receiving pavement two years later. The north‚Äìsouth road segment connecting SR 22 to Smith appears to have been constructed by 1952. After receiving upgrades in the early 1950s, no additional changes were made to State Route 22 until Nevada began renumbering its state highways in the late 1970s. During the renumbering process, the majority of SR 22 was renumbered as State Route 338‚Äîthis also included the separate north‚Äìsouth link south of Smith. The portion of SR 22 that followed the Wellington Cutoff became State Route 829 in the same process. The Nevada Department of Transportation approved the new highway numbers on July 1, 1976, with the route change first shown on the 1978‚Äì79 state highway map. The highways have remained unchanged since.

It is available for use topically on small skin infections, or as an ingredient in throat lozenges. It is marketed as S.T.37 by Numark Laboratories, Inc. (in a 0.1% solution) for oral pain relief and as an antiseptic. Sytheon Ltd., USA markets hexylresorcinol (trade named Synovea HR). Johnson & Johnson uses hexylresorcinol in its Neutrogena, Aveno, and RoC skincare products as an anti-aging cream. Hexylresorcinol has been used commercially by many cosmetic and personal care companies, such as Mary Kay, Clarins, Unilever, Murad, Arbonne, and many small and large companies. A study published in Chemical Research in Toxicology shows that 4-hexylresorcinol used as a food additive (E-586) exhibits some estrogenic activity, i.e. resembles action of the female sex hormone estrogen. However, recent study published in Applied Sciences shows that 4-hexylresorcinol did not change the expression of estrogen receptor-Œ±, -Œ≤, or p-ERK1/2 in MCF-7 cells. In an ovariectomized animal model, the 4HR group showed similar levels of ERŒ±, ERŒ≤, and prolactin expression in the pituitary gland compared to the solvent only group, while the estradiol group showed higher levels. Serum prolactin levels were similar between the 4HR and solvent only groups. In one study, 4-hexylresorcinol increased the shelf life of shrimp by reducing melanosis (black spots). In mice with cancer, 4-hexylresorcinol inhibited NF-Œ∫B and extended their survival rate.

Krynki is famous for its history and its old buildings. It lies approximately south-east of Sok√≥≈Çka and east of the regional capital Bia≈Çystok. History Krynki received town privileges in 1569. Throughout history, it was an important textile, leather and pottery center. In 1914, the town's population was 10,000 people, about 80 percent of them Jewish. The remainder was made up of Christian Poles and ethnic Belarusians. Krynki used to be a multicultural town prior to World War II, and before the Holocaust in occupied Poland. Today, the majority of Krynki's citizens are Catholic, but there is a Belarusian minority still present. Krynki lost city rights in 1950 in Stalinist Poland due to significant loss of population, but regained them in 2009.Ordinance of the Council of Ministers of the Republic of Poland (in Polish) Jewish heritage Jews began living in Krynki in the 17th century when the Polish king W≈Çadys≈Çaw IV Vasa invited them to town to boost trade and manufacturing. From that moment, the Jewish population continued to grow and their culture flourished. A notable part of Krynki's history was the Jewish labour movement of 1905. In that year, Jakow Pat led Jewish workers and created the independent Republic of Krynki in defiance of the Russian imperial rule. After World War I Poland returned to independence and democracy. The Jews began emigrating to Palestine and the United States for greater economic benefit. =The Holocaust= During World War II, Krynki was occupied by the Soviets from 1939 until 1941 and by Nazi Germany after Operation Barbarossa. The German authorities began the reign of terror by executing 30 prominent Jews, and in December 1941 created a Jewish ghetto in Krynki. The Jews from neighbouring settlements were deported to Krynki including 1,200 inhabitants of Brzostowica Wielka. Around 6,000 people were imprisoned there with insufficient food and severe overcrowding. The liquidation of the ghetto began in November 1942. The ghetto inmates, men, women and children, were deported to the Nazi transit camp in Kie≈Çbasin and sent off aboard Holocaust trains to the Treblinka extermination camp. The Jewish population, however, did not remain passive. During the ghetto liquidation action, a number of Jewish insurgents responded by shooting at the Nazi police including their gun-wielding Belarusian auxiliaries, and many escaped into the forest. Today, no Jews live in Krynki, but the memory of them still lives on.

History  The airport is on the site of Ardmore Army Air Field (1942 to 1946), later Ardmore Air Force Base (1953 to 1959). Central Airlines served Ardmore from about 1951 until 1963. On April 22, 1966 American Flyers Flight 280, flying a Lockheed Electra L-188 on approach to Ardmore crashed into a hill. 83 of the 98 aboard were killed. This was a flight under charter to the Military Air Command, en route from Montery, California, to Columbus, Georgia, with a scheduled refueling stop at Ardmore. An autopsy showed that the pilot had suffered a massive heart attack during the attempted landing. He was not wearing his harness and slumped forward into the controls, which prevented the co-pilot from taking control. Subsequent investigation showed that the pilot was under treatment for arteriosclerosis and diabetes, but that he had falsified information on his application for a First Class Medical Certificate, which would have been denied except for the falsification.\\"Flyers Flight 280 crashes at Ardmore Municipal Airport.\\" AirCrashMayday.

Caballes, 543 U.S. 405 (2005), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that the Fourth Amendment is not violated when the use of a drug-sniffing dog during a routine traffic stop does not unreasonably prolong the length of the stop.. Facts An Illinois State Police trooper stopped Roy Caballes for speeding on an interstate highway. When the trooper reported the stop to his headquarters, a member of the state police's drug interdiction squad overheard the report and proceeded to the location of the stop. When the drug officer arrived, Caballes was in the trooper's car while the trooper was writing out a warning ticket. The drug officer walked his drug-sniffing dog around Caballes' car, and the dog alerted at the trunk. Inside the trunk, the officers found marijuana. The whole episode lasted less than 10 minutes. After unsuccessfully moving to suppress the marijuana before trial, Caballes was convicted of narcotics trafficking and sentenced to 12 years in prison and a $256,136 fine. The trial judge denied Caballes' motion to suppress, reasoning that the officers had not unnecessarily prolonged the traffic stop, and the indication by the dog, of narcotics in the vehicle, gave them probable cause to search the trunk of Caballes' car. The Appellate Court of Illinois affirmed, but the Illinois Supreme Court reversed, holding that because the dog sniff was performed without reference to specific and articulable facts, it unjustifiably enlarged the scope of the stop into a drug investigation.People v. Caballes, 207 Ill. 2d 504, 802 N.E.2d 202, 280 Ill. Dec. 277 (2003). The Supreme Court agreed to hear the case in order to answer the question of whether the Fourth Amendment requires reasonable suspicion to justify using a drug-sniffing dog during a routine and otherwise legitimate traffic stop. Majority opinion The Fourth Amendment guards against \\"unreasonable searches and seizures.\\" Under the Court's Fourth Amendment jurisprudence, a traffic stop is a \\"seizure,\\" and requires reasonable suspicion that the driver of the vehicle has violated a traffic law. In this case, it was undisputed that Caballes was speeding. Thus, the traffic stop by itself was lawful from the start. However, a seizure that is justified at its inception may become unreasonable if it is unreasonably prolonged in duration. Thus, if the sole reason for the stop is to issue a warning to the motorist, the stop becomes unreasonable if it is prolonged beyond the time reasonably necessary to issue the warning. And if a drug- sniffing dog is used during this unreasonable extension, the use of the dog violates the Fourth Amendment. The Illinois Supreme Court reasoned that using the dog changed the character of the encounter from a routine traffic stop to a drug investigation, and that transformation had to be supported by reasonable suspicion. The Supreme Court instead reasoned that the dog sniff does not change the character of an encounter unless the dog sniff invaded any of the citizen's other reasonable expectations of privacy. The Court concluded it did not. Official conduct that does not invade a reasonable expectation of privacy is not a \\"search\\" under the Fourth Amendment. The possession of contraband is not anything in which a person can have a legitimate expectation of privacy, since it is by definition illegal to possess contraband. In United States v. Place (1983), the Court had held that a dog sniff is sui generis because it discloses only the presence or absence of narcotics.. By contrast, the information disclosed by the heat sensing device in Kyllo v. United States (2001) disclosed the \\"intimate details in a home, such as at what hour each night the lady of the house takes her daily sauna and bath.\\". People have a reasonable expectation that such information will be kept private, whereas they have no such expectation in the fact they possessed contraband. Thus, the use of a drug-sniffing dog does not intrude upon any reasonable expectation of privacy, and it was not unreasonable for the Illinois police to use the dog during the time it took them to issue a warning to Caballes. Caballes argued that it was wrong to assume that the alerts of drug-sniffing dogs reveal only information regarding the presence or absence of narcotics. But the Court rejected this argument because there was no information before the state courts to support it, and because he did not point to anything else in which a person has a reasonable expectation of privacy that a drug detection dog's alert might reveal. Dissenting opinions =Justice Souter's dissent= Justice Souter believed that the time had come to revisit the essential premise underpinning both the Court's opinion in United States v. Place and the majority's opinion in Caballes‚Äîthat the sniff of a dog is infallible, and can reveal either the presence or absence of narcotics and nothing else. \\"The infallible dog, however, is a creature of legal fiction.... Their supposed infallibility is belied by judicial opinions describing well-trained animals sniffing and alerting with less than perfect accuracy, whether owing to errors by their handlers, the limitations of the dogs themselves, or even the pervasive contamination of currency by cocaine.\\" Souter pointed to a study relied on by the State of Illinois in its reply brief, indicating that \\"dogs in artificial testing situations return false positives anywhere from 12.5% to 60% of the time, depending on the length of the search.\\" If a dog is not infallible, then there is no logical basis for the sui generis rule underlying Place and Caballes, and every reason to investigate \\"the actual function that dog sniffs perform.\\" Because the dogs are in the hands of government agents determined to discover evidence of crime, the dog sniff is the \\"first step in a process that may disclose intimate details without revealing contraband,\\" and hence is a \\"search\\" within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment. In the context of a traffic stop, an additional search unrelated to the initial purpose of the stop requires reasonable suspicion. Since in this case the police did not have such suspicion, Justice Souter would have affirmed the decision of the Illinois Supreme Court. =Justice Ginsburg's dissent= Justice Ginsburg, joined by Justice Souter, focused on the long-standing connection in the Court's Fourth Amendment jurisprudence between a traffic stop and the stop-and-frisk authorized in Terry v. Ohio (1968). The scope of a Terry stop is not circumscribed merely by duration; the manner in which the stop is carried out must also be carefully controlled. Ginsburg would have applied this principle to the traffic stop in this case, and required reasonable suspicion for the police to transform the routine traffic stop into a more extensive search for drugs. The fact that a dog sniff is sui generis only matters if the sole determinant of what is \\"reasonable\\" is the length of time a traffic stop lasts. If the Court had recognized that traffic stops must be limited in what police are searching for as well as how long they take to conduct the search, the sui generis nature of dog sniffs would not have been dispositive of the case. \\"Under today's decision, every traffic stop could become an occasion to call in the dogs, to the distress and embarrassment of the law-abiding population.... Today's decision clears the way for suspicionless, dog-accompanied drug sweeps of parked cars along sidewalks and in parking lots.... Motorists [would not] have constitutional grounds for complaint should police with dogs, stationed at long traffic lights, circle cars waiting for the red signal to turn green.\\" Rodriguez v. United States In 2015, in Rodriguez v. United States, the Supreme Court hold that absent reasonable suspicion, officers may not extend the length of a traffic stop to conduct a dog sniff.

In materials science, fast ion conductors are solids with highly mobile ions. These materials are important in the area of solid-state ionics, and are also known as solid electrolytes and superionic conductors. These materials are useful in batteries and various sensors. Fast ion conductors are used primarily in solid oxide fuel cells. As solid electrolytes they allow the movement of ions without the need for a liquid or soft membrane separating the electrodes. The phenomenon relies on the hopping of ions through an otherwise rigid crystal structure. Mechanism Fast ion conductors are intermediate in nature between crystalline solids which possess a regular structure with immobile ions, and liquid electrolytes which have no regular structure and fully mobile ions. Solid electrolytes find use in all solid-state supercapacitors, batteries, and fuel cells, and in various kinds of chemical sensors. Classification In solid electrolytes (glasses or crystals), the ionic conductivity Œ©i can be any value, but it should be much larger than the electronic one. Usually, solids where Œ©i is on the order of 0.0001 to 0.1 Ohm‚àí1 cm‚àí1 (300 K) are called superionic conductors. =Proton conductors= Proton conductors are a special class of solid electrolytes, where hydrogen ions act as charge carriers. One notable example is superionic water. =Superionic conductors= Superionic conductors where Œ©i is more than 0.1 Ohm‚àí1 cm‚àí1 (300 K) and the activation energy for ion transport Ei is small (about 0.1 eV), are called advanced superionic conductors. The most famous example of advanced superionic conductor-solid electrolyte is RbAg4I5 where Œ©i > 0.25 Ohm‚àí1 cm‚àí1 and Œ©e ~10‚àí9 Ohm‚àí1 cm‚àí1 at 300 K. The Hall (drift) ionic mobility in RbAg4I5 is about 2 cm2/(V‚Ä¢s) at room temperatures. The Œ©e ‚Äì Œ©i systematic diagram distinguishing the different types of solid-state ionic conductors is given in the figure. Classification of solid-state ionic conductors by the lg (electronic conductivity, Œ©e) ‚Äì lg (ionic conductivity, Œ©i) diagram. Regions 2, 4, 6 and 8 are solid electrolytes (SEs), materials with Œ©i >> Œ©e; regions 1, 3, 5 and 7 are mixed ion-electron conductors (MIECs). 3 and 4 are superionic conductors (SICs), i.e. materials with Œ©i > 0.001 Ohm‚àí1cm‚àí1. 5 and 6 are advanced superionic conductors (AdSICs), where Œ©i > 10‚àí1 Ohm‚àí1cm‚àí1 (300 K), energy activation Ei about 0.1 eV. 7 and 8 are hypothetical AdSIC with Ei ‚âà kBT ‚âà0.03 eV (300 –ö). No clear examples have been described as yet, of fast ion conductors in the hypothetical advanced superionic conductors class (areas 7 and 8 in the classification plot). However, in crystal structure of several superionic conductors, e.g. in the minerals of the pearceite-polybasite group, the large structural fragments with activation energy of ion transport Ei < kBT (300 –ö) had been discovered in 2006. Examples =Zirconia-based materials= A common solid electrolyte is yttria-stabilized zirconia, YSZ. This material is prepared by doping Y2O3 into ZrO2. Oxide ions typically migrate only slowly in solid Y2O3 and in ZrO2, but in YSZ, the conductivity of oxide increases dramatically. These materials are used to allow oxygen to move through the solid in certain kinds of fuel cells. Zirconium dioxide can also be doped with calcium oxide to give an oxide conductor that is used in oxygen sensors in automobile controls. Upon doping only a few percent, the diffusion constant of oxide increases by a factor of ~1000.Shriver, D. F.; Atkins, P. W.; Overton, T. L.; Rourke, J. P.; Weller, M. T.; Armstrong, F. A. ‚ÄúInorganic Chemistry‚Äù W. H. Freeman, New York, 2006. . Other conductive ceramics function as ion conductors. One example is NASICON, (Na3Zr2Si2PO12), a sodium super- ionic conductor =beta-Alumina= Another example of a popular fast ion conductor is beta-alumina solid electrolyte. Unlike the usual forms of alumina, this modification has a layered structure with open galleries separated by pillars. Sodium ions (Na+) migrate through this material readily since the oxide framework provides an ionophilic, non-reducible medium. This material is considered as the sodium ion conductor for the sodium‚Äìsulfur battery. =Fluoride ion conductors= Lanthanum trifluoride (LaF3) is conductive for F‚àí ions, used in some ion selective electrodes. Beta-lead fluoride exhibits a continuous growth of conductivity on heating. This property was first discovered by Michael Faraday. =Iodides= A textbook example of a fast ion conductor is silver iodide (AgI). Upon heating the solid to 146 ¬∞C, this material adopts the alpha-polymorph. In this form, the iodide ions form a rigid cubic framework, and the Ag+ centers are molten. The electrical conductivity of the solid increases by 4000x. Similar behavior is observed for copper(I) iodide (CuI), rubidium silver iodide (RbAgI2), and Ag2HgI4. =Other Inorganic materials= *Silver sulfide, conductive for Ag+ ions, used in some ion selective electrodes *Lead(II) chloride, conductive at higher temperatures *Some perovskite ceramics ‚Äì strontium titanate, strontium stannate ‚Äì conductive for O2‚àí ions *Zr(HPO4)2.\\\\mathit{n}H2O ‚Äì conductive for H+ ions *UO2HPO4.4H2O (hydrogen uranyl phosphate tetrahydrate) ‚Äì conductive for H+ ions * Cerium(IV) oxide ‚Äì conductive for O2‚àí ions =Organic materials= *Many gels, such polyacrylamides, agar, etc. are fast ion conductors *A salt dissolved in a polymer ‚Äì e.g. lithium perchlorate in polyethylene oxide *Polyelectrolytes and Ionomers ‚Äì e.g. Nafion, a H+ conductor History The important case of fast ionic conduction is one in a surface space-charge layer of ionic crystals. Such conduction was first predicted by Kurt Lehovec. As a space-charge layer has nanometer thickness, the effect is directly related to nanoionics (nanoionics-I). Lehovec's effect is used as a basis for developing nanomaterials for portable lithium batteries and fuel cells.

The company was renamed Leyland Motors in 1907. In 1919 Spurrier's father, another Henry, took charge of the company. Spurrier (Henry III) was educated at Repton School, and started working life as an apprentice in his grandfather's firm. During World War I he was a pilot lieutenant with the Royal Flying Corps, and served in Mesopotamia and India. Immediately after the war Spurrier involved himself in car development, working with the chief engineer at Leyland Motors, J.G. Parry-Thomas and with his assistant Reid Railton. They produced a luxury touring car the Leyland Eight, with which they intended to compete with Rolls-Royce. It was exhibited at the 1920 London motor show, only eight however, were ever built. After his father's death, Spurrier progressed to become Managing Director of Leyland Motors in 1949. Spurrier was knighted in 1955.

Biography Faustus was born between 405 and 410, and according to his contemporaries, Avitus of Vienne and Sidonius Apollinaris, in the island of Britain; although Sabine Baring-Gould says Brittany is more probable. In his youth he was devoted to the study of elocution and Christian philosophy.Baring-Gould, Sabine. The lives of the saints, London, John Hodges, 1875, p. 413 He is thought by some to have been a lawyer but owing to the influence of his mother, famed for her sanctity, he abandoned secular pursuits as a young man and entered the monastery of L√©rins. Here he was soon ordained to the priesthood and after about eight years, because of his extraordinary piety was chosen in 432 to be head of the monastery, in succession to Maximus who had become Bishop of Riez. His career as abbot lasted about twenty or twenty-five years during which he attained a high reputation for his wonderful gifts as an extempore preacher and for his stern asceticism.Healy, Patrick. \\"Faustus of Riez.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 6. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1909. 27 February 2018 After the death of Maximus he became Bishop of Riez. This elevation did not make any change in his manner of life; he continued his ascetic practices, and frequently returned to the monastery of L√©rins to renew his fervour. He was a zealous advocate of monasticism and established many monasteries in his diocese. In spite of his activity in the discharge of his duties as bishop, he participated in all the theological discussions of his time and became known as a stern opponent of Arianism in all its forms. For this, and as is said for his view, stated below, of the corporeity of the human soul, he incurred the enmity of the Arian Euric, King of the Visigoths, who had gained possession of a large portion of Southern Gaul, and was banished from his see. His exile lasted eight years, during which time he was aided by loyal friends. On the death of Euric he resumed his labours at the head of his diocese and continued there until his death between 490 and 495. His own diocesan flock considered him a saint and erected a basilica in his honour. Works and theological position Throughout his life Faustus was an uncompromising adversary of Pelagius, whom he styled Pestifer 'plague bringer', and equally decided in his opposition to the doctrine of predestination which he styled \\"erroneous, blasphemous, heathen, fatalistic, and conducive to immorality\\". This doctrine in its strongest form had been expounded by a presbyter named Lucidus and was condemned by two synods, at Arles and Lyons (475). At the request of the bishops who composed these synods, and especially Leontius of Arles, Faustus wrote the Libri duo de Gratia Dei et humanae mentis libero arbitrio, in which he argued against the doctrines of the Predestinarians as well as those of Pelagius (P.L., LVIII, 783). The work was marked by Semipelagianism, and for several years was bitterly attacked. It was condemned by the Second Synod of Orange in 529 (Denzinger, Enchiridion, Freiburg, 1908, no. 174 sqq. - old no. 144; PL.L., XLV, 1785; Mansi, VIII, 712). Faustus maintained that the human soul is in a certain sense corporeal, God alone being a pure spirit. The opposition to Faustus was not fully developed in his lifetime and he died with a well- merited reputation for sanctity. Faustus wrote also: \\"Libri duo de Spiritu Sancto\\" (P.L., LXII, 9), wrongly ascribed to the Roman deacon Paschasius. His \\"Libellus parvus adversus Arianos et Macedonianos\\", mentioned by Genadius, seems to have perished. His feast day is 28 September.http://www.catholic.org/saints/saint.php?saint_id=3664 Catholic Online  Notes  Sources  His correspondence (epistulae) and sermons are found in: External links *Opera Omnia by Migne Patrologia Latina with analytical indexes Category:5th-century births Category:5th- century deaths Category:5th-century bishops Category:Bishops in Gaul Category:Bishops of Riez Category:5th-century Christian saints Category:5th- century Gallo-Roman people ","title":"Faustus of Riez"},{"id":"5636789","text":"1861 Bezdna unrest or Bezdna peasant revolt (, ) was an unrest of former serfs after the Emancipation reform of 1861 in Russia in April 1861. The events took place in the Spassky Uyezd of Kazan Governorate and the center of unrest was a village of Bizn√§ (Tatar Cyrillic: –ë–∏–∑–Ω”ô, Russian: –ë–µ–∑–¥–Ω–∞). Russia After Serfdom With the Emancipation Reform of 1861 in Russia, Tsar Alexander II and the Russian autocracy put several new alterations into place to help advance Russia past its old traditions of bonded labor and into a more enlightened age similar to the other European nations. But for many noblemen and landlords, the end of serfdom would lead to the destruction of the Russian economy; if landowners and state officials had to start paying for their labor, their profit would significantly diminish. Nonetheless, Alexander knew that it was time to lift the burden of serfdom off of Russia; he was quoted as saying in 1856: In fear of an all out revolt, plans began moving forward to ensure the survival of the autocracy. By early 1861 the Emancipation Manifesto was completed, it contained several statutes that freed serfs from their lords, entitled former serfs to rights that other civilians possessed, and allowed them to purchase lands as well. Unfortunately even these reforms could not grant the peasants the life they desired; many peasants were left homeless and starving because they did not possess money to purchase land, nor could they get paying jobs because of the mass influx of people who now needed paying jobs. It seemed as if nothing would grant these laborers the respect and liberty they had desperately tried to attain. The lower class majority at the time was unable to ascend to the level of the royals and landowners; this caused many peasants to blame the noblemen who made up the tsar‚Äôs court, for they are the ones who profited from their indentured labor and lost a cheap labor source when the emancipation went into effect. The former serfs, who had endured the hardship since the birth of the Russian Empire, had been granted bittersweet liberty. The disappointment of the reforms would soon spark an upheaval in the small town of Bezdna only after a month of the manifesto being introduced. Anton Petrov and the Unrest The leader of the unrest was a literate peasant Anton Petrov. Petrov inspired the local peasants within the Kazan Governorate in what some historian consider the ‚Äúmost significant incident of peasant unrest in the wake of the emancipation.‚Äù Although much is not known about Petrov, he was literate which was a rarity to find amongst the peasant population. Petrov being able to read the manifesto began to create his own interpretation of the emancipation; he spoke out against the reforms, convinced that peasants were still not equal and that the reforms were lies in disguise. High illiteracy rates continued throughout the 19th century, making Petrov‚Äôs message even more credible among the peasants; being somewhat distrustful of the government-hired messengers who read the manifesto to the masses, the peasants found a kindred spirit in Petrov. Soon thousands flocked to Bezdna to hear Petrov‚Äôs interpretation on why the royals would continue to place restrictions onto the lower class, for these citizens were not upset with Alexander but with royals and upperclassmen, who the peasants believed influenced the tsar to control the serfs. This surprising support for the tsar stemmed from Orthodox Christianity and its belief that the tsar was chosen by God to protect all Christians; therefore Alexander could not commit such an atrocity towards the former serfs. After thousands of peaceful protestors gathered in Bezdna, a unit of the Russian Army, under the orders of the tsar, descended onto the town ordering the civilians to stand down on April 12, 1861; soon it became clear that the mass would not cease, the soldiers began firing upon the protestors. According to historical accounts, the peasants shouted back while remaining stationary: ‚ÄúWe will not yield, it is the tsar‚Äôs blood that is flowing, you are shooting at the tsar.‚Äù The peasants began to retreat as the soldiers continued to gun down their fellow demonstrators. The army then arrested Petrov, he being the only individual of the Bezdna Unrest to be detained. About 5000 peasants from 130 villages in the area joined the unrest. Military forces were sent to subdue the riot under general-mayor Anton Apraksin. Soldiers opened gunfire, and 57 peasants were killed (by other sources 91), more than 350 were injured. Aftermath Following the bloodshed that occurred at Bezdna, Alexander II quickly began to cover all traces of what had happened, even publicly denying the Unrest for over a month. Even after admission, the facts of what had occurred were inconsistent and made to put the blame upon the peasants. Anton Petrov, under direct orders from Alexander, met his end after he was arrested; he was then bound to a pole and shot in the street by Russian soldiers. Although the death toll of the unrest is not certain, it is estimated between 57 and 91 peasants were killed by the military on April 12, 1861. Although this event did not cause similar disturbances in Russia, two Russian figures viewed this event as a national tragedy, each expressing their sentiments differently; Afanasy Shchapov, a historian and teacher, traveled to the commemorative service in the Kazan Governorate, along with 400 students. For nearly four days, he joined the mourners; he also delivered an inspirational speech dedicated to those who had fallen victim to the military slaughter. Unfortunately, Shchapov was arrested soon after his speech and brought to St. Petersburg; throughout his life he would face much persecution from the autocratic government, including exile to Siberia. Alexander Herzen, a writer and social reformist, documented the Bezdna Unrest while serving his exile from Russia in London. According to his writings in the London magazine, The Bell, Herzen criticizes the Russian government for their complete disregard for human life and the fact that the government did not publicly acknowledge the unrest until a month after it had occurred. Although Herzen‚Äôs opinion is biased against the Russian autocracy, due to his previous conflicts with the government, he did provide information about Bezdna to a larger audience in Europe.

The Akiyama line of Y≈çshin-ry≈´ is perhaps the most influential school of j≈´jutsu to exist in Japan. By the late Edo Period, Akiyama Y≈çshin-ry≈´ and its descendants had spread all over Japan. By the Meiji era, Y≈çshin-ry≈´ had even spread overseas to Europe and North America. Together with the Takenouchi-ry≈´ (Á´πÂÜÖÊµÅ), and the Ry≈çi Shint≈ç- ry≈´, the Y≈çshin-ry≈´ (Ê•äÂøÉÊµÅ), was one of the three largest, most important and influential J≈´jutsu schools of the Edo period (Ê±üÊà∏ÊôÇ‰ª£ Edo jidai 1603 - 1868) before the rise of Judo.Classical Fighting Arts of Japan: A Complete Guide to Koryu Jujutsu. by Serge Mol (2001) Curriculum This line of Y≈çshin-ry≈´ is noted for a curriculum including ky≈´sho-jutsu atemi (vital points striking) and the development of internal energy, teachings most likely influenced by Chinese sources. It is believed that these teachings were eventually absorbed by many other jujutsu traditions. Only the Y≈çshin-ry≈´ buki/naginata school in Hiroshima currently headed by Koyama Takako and attributed to Akiyama has been successfully transmitted and survives.

It is also spelled phenethylline and fenetylline (INN); other names for it are amphetaminoethyltheophylline and amfetyline. The drug was marketed for use as a psychostimulant under the brand names Captagon, Biocapton, and Fitton. History Fenethylline was first synthesized by the German Degussa AG in 1961 and used for around 25 years as a milder alternative to amphetamine and related compounds. Although there are no FDA-approved indications for fenethylline, it was used in the treatment of \\"hyperkinetic children\\" (what would now be referred to as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) and, less commonly, for narcolepsy and depression. One of the main advantages of fenethylline was that it does not increase blood pressure to the same extent as an equivalent dose of amphetamine and so could be used in patients with cardiovascular conditions. Fenethylline was considered to have fewer side effects and less potential for abuse than amphetamine. Nevertheless, fenethylline was listed in 1981 as a schedule I controlled substance in the US, and it became illegal in most countries in 1986 after being listed by the World Health Organization for international scheduling under the Convention on Psychotropic Substances, even though the actual incidence of fenethylline abuse was quite low. Pharmacology The fenethylline molecule results when theophylline is covalently linked with amphetamine via an alkyl chain. Fenethylline is metabolized by the body to form two drugs, amphetamine (24.5% of oral dose) and theophylline (13.7% of oral dose), both of which are active stimulants. The physiological effects of fenethylline therefore seem to result from a combination of these two compounds, although this is not entirely clear. Abuse and illegal trade 127 bags of Captagon seized from the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant terror group before being destroyed on 31 May 2018 Abuse of fenethylline of the brand name Captagon is most common in Arab countries and counterfeit versions of the drug continue to be available despite its illegality. In 2017 captagon was the most popular recreational drug in the Arabian peninsula. Many of these counterfeit \\"Captagon\\" tablets actually contain other amphetamine derivatives that are easier to produce, but are pressed and stamped to look like Captagon pills. Some counterfeit Captagon pills analysed do contain fenethylline however, indicating that illicit production of this drug continues to take place. Fenethylline is a popular drug in Western Asia, and is allegedly used by militant groups in Syria. It is manufactured locally by a cheap and simple process and is sold for $1.5 to $2.0 a pill as of July 2019 in Lebanon. According to some leaks, militant groups also export the drug in exchange for weapons and cash. According to Abdelelah Mohammed Al-Sharif, secretary general of the National Committee for Narcotics Control and assistant director of Anti-Drug and Preventative Affairs, 40% of the drug users who fall in the 12‚Äì22 age group in Saudi Arabia are addicted to fenethylline. On 26 October 2015, a member of the Saudi royal family, Prince Abdel Mohsen Bin Walid Bin Abdulaziz, and four others were detained in Beirut on charges of drug trafficking after airport security discovered two tons of Captagon (fenethylline) pills and some cocaine on a private jet scheduled to depart for the Saudi capital of Riyadh. The following month, Agence France Press reported that the Turkish authorities had seized 2 tonnes of Captagon during raids in the Hatay region on the Syrian border. The pills, almost 11 million of them, had been produced in Syria and were being shipped to countries in the Arab states of the Persian Gulf. On 31 December 2015, the Lebanese Army announced that it had discovered two large scale drug production workshops in the north of the country. Large quantities of Captagon pills were seized. Two days earlier three tons of Captagon and hashish were seized at Beirut airport. The drugs were concealed in school desks being exported to Egypt.The Daily Star (Lebanon): Tuesday raids in east Lebanon netted 800 kg of hash:police and Lebanese Army busts two drug factories The drug is playing a role in the Syrian Civil War. The production and sale of fenethylline generates large revenues which are likely used to fund weapons, as well as combatants on different sides using the stimulant to keep them fighting. References to the drug were found on a mobile phone used by Mohamed Lahouaiej Bouhlel, a French-Tunisian who killed 84 civilians in Nice on Bastille Day, 2016. In May 2017, French customs at Charles de Gaulle airport seized 750,000 Captagon pills transported from Lebanon and destined for Saudi Arabia. In addition, two other separate discoveries of the pills were also made at Charles de Gaulle airport in January heading for the Czech Republic, and in February hidden in steel moulds, from the same year. Further investigation showed that the seized products mainly contained a mixture of amphetamine and theophylline. In January 2018, Saudi Arabia seized 1.3 million Captagon pills at Al-Haditha crossing near the border with Jordan. In December 2018, Greece intercepted a Syrian ship sailing for Libya, carrying six tonnes of processed cannabis and 3 million Captagon pills. In July 2019, a shipment of 33 million Captagon pills, which weighs 5.25 tonnes, was seized in Greece coming from Syria. Later that month, 800,000 Captagon pills were found on a boat in the United Arab Emirates. In February 2020, the UAE found 35 Captagon million pills in a shipment of electricity cables from Syria to Jebel Ali. In April 2020, Saudi Arabia seized 44.7 million Captagon pills smuggled from Syria. On 1 July 2020, an anti-drug operation coordinated in Italy by the Italian Guardia di Finanza and Customs and Monopolies Agency seized 14 tonnes of amphetamines, labeled as Captagon, smuggled from Syria and initially hypothesized by the Italian authorities to have been produced by ISIS,; which were found in three shipping containers filled with around 84 million pills, in the southern port of Salerno.

In 1968, he received the M.Sc. degree in physics and mathematics from the Niels Bohr Institute, in Copenhagen, Denmark. He was a university researcher studying high-energy particle physics from 1968 to 1978. In 1979, he joined the research laboratory of the Danish Teleadministrations in Copenhagen. He was Head of Optical Communications Department at Tele Danmark Research, Horsholm, Denmark from 1987 to 1995. He was an adjunct professor at the Niels Bohr Institute from 1991 to 2001. In 1997, he took a leave of absence at the Technion - Israel Institute of Technology. Until his retirement at the end June 2006, he was a research professor at Dept. of Communications, Optics and Materials (currently named DTU Fotonik, Department of Photonics Engineering), Technical University of Denmark.\\"Biografi Bjarne Tromborg\\", Ingenioren, November 27, 2005, Research Tromborg co-authored a research monograph and approximately one hundred journal and conference publications, mostly on physics and optoelectronics. At the Niels Bohr Institute, he carried out research in elementary particle physics, particularly analytic S-matrix theory and electromagnetic corrections to hadron scattering. He coauthored a research monograph on dispersion theory. In the early 1980s, he switched to photonics. Tromborg was one of the first to develop advanced theoretical models for complex semiconductor laser structures such as external laser cavities and distributed feedback lasers in the beginning of the 1980s. Computer simulations and measurements confirmed the validity of the theoretical models and their predictions. Several co-workers including Henning Olesen, Gunnar Jacobsen, Jens Henrik Osmundsen, Finn Mogensen, Kristian Stubkj√¶r, Jesper M√∏rk, Xing Pan, Hans Erik Lassen and Bj√∂rn J√≥nsson contributed to this work over a period of almost 15 years until 1995. At TeleDanmark Research in the late 1980s and early 1990s Tromborg and colleagues worked to study the dynamics of active semiconductor materials in order to understand the physical relaxation processes at play, their strength and characteristic time scales. A pump-probe set-up employing femtosecond lasers was established and modeling efforts were initialized. Tromborg led the effort to identify this as a topic that would remain important for many years and argued that Denmark should work to lead in the field. He also proposed theoretical methods that could be used to estimate the size of these ultrafast dynamical effects and their role in understanding the origin of nonlinear gain suppression in semiconductor lasers. From 1999 to his retirement at the end of June 2006, Tromborg was with the Department of Communications, Optics and Materials (COM*DTU) at the Technical University of Denmark. In this period, he worked in both research and education, as well as in securing several European Union research projects for COM*DTU. Tromborg took up the field of photonic crystals and initiated and contributed himself to activities within the theory of photonic crystals. He also applied general techniques within stochastic theory and signal analysis to develop improved descriptions of noise spectra in nonlinear semiconductor optical amplifiers. Awards and recognition Tromborg received the Electro- prize from the Danish Society of Engineers in 1981. He was Chairman of the Danish Optical Society from 1999 to 2002.\\"News from ICO Members Worldwide\\", ICO Newsletter, April 2000, No. 43, He has been Associate Editor of the IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics since 2003.

The market at Wiener Platz forms the centre of the district of Haidhausen. Here you can stock up on all the foods for your everyday needs. But gourmets can also get their money‚Äôs worth: shops where you can buy delicacies and specialities have something to offer for everyone. History In 1891 \\"Wiener Platz\\" was named after the Austrian city of Vienna (Wien). This name was chosen because the \\"Innere-Wiener-Stra√üe\\" which runs alongside the market used to be the link road to Vienna. Lion of the Wiener Markt The history of the \\"market at Wiener Platz\\", the smallest of Munich‚Äôs permanent grocery markets is long and eventful. On 1. November 1889, the market that had hitherto been held in the Preysingstra√üe was moved to its current location. An \\"announcement of the municipal authorities of Munich, Capital of Bavaria and Royal Residence on 25. October 1889\\", which was signed by the mayor, Dr. von Widenmeyer, is the \\"birth certificate\\" of the market. During World War II the market was severely damaged but was reconstructed in the post-war years. With the end of the renovation at Wiener Platz in October 2002, both Wiener Platz and Wiener Markt once again became jewels in the crown of the Haidhausen district. The grand May Day festival on 1. May 2003 and the putting up of the maypole, donated by the Friends of Haidhausen, clearly showed the central significance of the square and the market for Haidhausen. Administration The Wiener Markt is organized by the Wholesale Market Munich. The Wholesale Market Munich, together with Wiener Markt, Viktualienmarkt, Pasing Viktualienmarkt, Elisabethmarkt and the Weekly Markets in Munich, are operated by Munich Markets, a municipal company run by the City of Munich.

Laruelle has been publishing since the early 1970s and now has around twenty book-length titles to his name. Alumnus of the √âcole normale sup√©rieure, Laruelle is notable for developing a science of philosophy that he calls non-philosophy. He currently directs an international organisation dedicated to furthering the cause of non-philosophy, the Organisation Non- Philosophique Internationale. Work Laruelle divides his work into five periods: Philosophy I (1971‚Äì1981), Philosophy II (1981‚Äì1995), Philosophy III (1995‚Äì2002), Philosophy IV (2002‚Äì2008), and Philosophy V (2008‚Äìpresent). The work comprising Philosophy I finds Laruelle attempting to subvert concepts found in Nietzsche, Heidegger, Deleuze and Derrida. Even at this early stage one can identify Laruelle's interest in adopting a transcendental stance towards philosophy. With Philosophy II, Laruelle makes a determined effort to develop a transcendental approach to philosophy itself. However, it is not until Philosophy III that Laruelle claims to have started the work of non- philosophy. =Non-philosophy= Laruelle claims that all forms of philosophy (from ancient philosophy to analytic philosophy to deconstruction and so on) are structured around a prior decision, but that all forms of philosophy remain constitutively blind to this decision. The 'decision' that Laruelle is concerned with here is the dialectical splitting of the world in order to grasp the world philosophically. Laruelle claims that the decisional structure of philosophy can only be grasped non-philosophically. In this sense, non- philosophy is a science of philosophy. Laruellean (non)ethics is \\"radically de-anthropocentrized, fundamentally directed towards a universalized, auto- effective set of generic conditions.\\" Reception and influence A decade ago, he was described by Scottish philosopher Ray Brassier as \\"the most important unknown philosopher working in Europe today\\"Brassier 2003, p. 24. and was described by Gilles Deleuze and F√©lix Guattari as \\"engaged in one of the most interesting undertakings of contemporary philosophy.\\"Gilles Deleuze and F√©lix Guattari, What is Philosophy?, Trans. Hugh Tomlinson and Graham Burchell (New York: Columbia University Press, 1994), p. 220n5. The first English-language reception of his work (Brassier's account of Laruelle in Radical Philosophy in 2003) has been followed with a slew of introductions from John √ì Maoilearca (Mullarkey), Anthony Paul Smith, Rocco Gangle, Katerina Kolozova, and Alexander R. Galloway, as well as Brassier's own subsequent book, Nihil Unbound.Ray Brassier, Nihil Unbound. Palgrave Macmillan, 2010 Today, Laruelle's international reception is growing with dozens of titles a year translated and published in English by such publishing houses as Polity Books, Edinburgh University Press, Continuum, Palgrave Macmillan, Columbia University Press, Urbanomic/Sequence and others.

A macroblock typically consists of 16√ó16 samples, and is further subdivided into transform blocks, and may be further subdivided into prediction blocks. Formats which are based on macroblocks include JPEG, where they are called MCU blocks, H.261, MPEG-1 Part 2, H.262/MPEG-2 Part 2, H.263, MPEG-4 Part 2, and H.264/MPEG-4 AVC. In H.265/HEVC, the macroblock as a basic processing unit has been replaced by the coding tree unit. Technical details =Transform blocks= A macroblock is divided into transform blocks, which serve as input to the linear block transform, e.g. the DCT. In H.261, the first video codec to use macroblocks, transform blocks have a fixed size of 8√ó8 samples. In the YCbCr color space with 4:2:0 chroma subsampling, a 16√ó16 macroblock consists of 16√ó16 luma (Y) samples and 8√ó8 chroma (Cb and Cr) samples. These samples are split into four Y blocks, one Cb block and one Cr block. This design is also used in JPEG and most other macroblock-based video codecs with a fixed transform block size, such as MPEG-1 Part 2 and H.262/MPEG-2 Part 2. In other chroma subsampling formats, e.g. 4:0:0, 4:2:2, or 4:4:4, the number of chroma samples in a macroblock will be smaller or larger, and the grouping of chroma samples into blocks will differ accordingly. In more modern macroblock-based video coding standards such as H.263 and H.264/AVC, transform blocks can be of sizes other than 8√ó8 samples. For instance, in H.264/AVC main profile, the transform block size is 4√ó4. In H.264/AVC High profile, the transform block size can be either 4√ó4 or 8√ó8, adapted on a per-macroblock basis. =Prediction blocks= Distinct from the division into transform blocks, a macroblock can be split into prediction blocks. In early standards such as H.261, MPEG-1 Part 2, and H.262/MPEG-2 Part 2, motion compensation is performed with one motion vector per macroblock. In more modern standards such as H.264/AVC, a macroblock can be split into multiple variable-sized prediction blocks, called partitions. In an inter-predicted macroblock in H.264/AVC, a separate motion vector is specified for each partition. Correspondingly, in an intra-predicted macroblock, where samples are predicted by extrapolating from the edges of neighboring blocks, the prediction direction that is specified on a per-partition basis. In H.264/AVC, prediction partition size ranges from 4√ó4 to 16√ó16 samples for both inter-prediction (motion compensation) and intra-prediction. Bitstream representation A possible bitstream representation of a macroblock in a video codec which uses motion compensation and transform coding is given below.

He spent more than twenty years in the Philippines where he became a recognized authority on the flora of the Asia-Pacific region. Through the course of his career he authored nearly 500 publications, described approximately 3,000 new plant species, and amassed over one million herbarium specimens. In addition to his scientific work he was an accomplished administrator, college dean, university professor and editor of scientific journals.Archives of the Arnold Arboretum Early life Merrill and his twin brother, Dana T. Merrill, were born and raised in the small village of East Auburn, Maine. They were the youngest of six children by Daniel C. Merrill and Mary (Noyes) Merrill. Merrill showed an early interest in natural history, collecting and identifying plants, birds' eggs, rocks, and minerals. In 1894 he entered the University of Maine with the intention of studying engineering but soon switched to a general science curriculum where he focused on the biology and classification of flowering plants. He was the valedictorian of his graduation class in 1898 and then stayed on for an additional year working as an assistant in the Department of Natural Science. During his time in college Merrill built a sizable herbarium of almost 2,000 specimens which he eventually donated to the New England Botanical Club.Robbins, 1958 In 1899 Merrill accepted a position with the United States Department of Agriculture in Washington D.C. as an assistant to Frank Lamson-Scribner, an authority on the classification of grasses and a pioneer plant pathologist. At the USDA he learned the principles of plant taxonomy and became proficient in the development and management of a herbarium. His training was supplemented by fieldwork in Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming. Philippines At the end of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, the United States Taft Commission established the Insular Bureau of Agriculture in Manila. Merrill was appointed to the post of botanist in the new organization and arrived in 1902 in Manila where he was to work for the next twenty-two years. Merrill was dismayed to discover that the herbarium he was expecting to find had been destroyed during the war, along with the botanical library and scientific equipment. Nevertheless, starting with just an empty building, he set out to rebuild the herbarium and library.Hay, 1998 Within a few months his role was expanded to include a joint appointment with the Bureau of Forestry. Over the years Merrill's responsibilities continued to grow until he became both the Director of the Bureau of Sciences and a Professor of Botany at the University of the Philippines. He collected and studied plants not only from the Philippines but also from the greater Asia-Pacific region including Indonesia, Malaysia, Indochina, China, and Guam. Eventually the herbarium grew to over 250,000 specimens and the botanical library was recognized as one of the best in Asia. Merrill published more than 100 taxonomic papers on Philippine flora and several additional papers on the flora of the region. Many of his papers were published in The Philippine Journal of Science, a journal he helped establish and edited from 1907 to 1918. In 1912 he published a 500-page Flora of Manila covering some 1,000 species. In 1921 he completed a Bibliographic Enumeration of Bornean Plants, a volume of 637 pages. His most ambitious work was the Enumeration of Philippine Flowering Plants published in sections between 1923 and 1926. As documented by his Enumeration the list of known Philippine species had been extended from 2,500 plants of all types in 1900 to 8,120 species of flowering plants, 1,000 species of ferns, and 3,000 species of cryptogams. University of California, Berkeley In 1924 Merrill returned to the United States to join the University of California, Berkeley. There he was appointed Dean of the College of Agriculture and Director of the Agricultural Experiment Station. At Berkeley he led a reorganization of the faculty, revised the curriculum, emphasized academic training of staff, added buildings and equipment, and stressed fundamental research. In 1925, Merrill established the journal Hilgardia, named for Eugene W. Hilgard who organized the Agriculture Department and was the founding director of the Agricultural Experiment Station. During his spare time, Merrill continued to work on systematic botany of the Asia-Pacific flora and added more than 100,000 specimens from that region to the University herbarium. In 1926 a proposal was developed to establish the California Botanic Garden in Los Angeles. Merrill took part-time leave from the College to become director of the Garden Foundation. The plan involved the purchase of at Mandeville Canyon in the Santa Monica Mountains. About 800 acres in the center of the tract were to be developed as a botanical garden financed by the sale of surrounding property for residential homes. During his short tenure as director Merrill built administrative offices and greenhouses, started a library, established an herbarium of 180,000 specimens and planted 1,200 species in the gardens. Unfortunately, not long after Merrill left, the plans collapsed when property prices plummeted as a result of the Great Depression. The herbarium was transferred to the University of California, Los Angeles and the gardens were subdivided and sold for housing. New York Botanic Garden In 1929 Merrill accepted dual appointments as Director of the New York Botanic Garden and Professor of Botany at Columbia University. He started his new job at the onset of the Great Depression and the Garden was facing severe financial constraints. Despite these difficulties, he was able to continue many of the programs by taking advantage of personnel provided by the Works Progress Administration. Up to 300 personnel were employed building walks, roads, fences and other infrastructure in the gardens; or they worked in the herbarium as mounters, artists, secretaries, librarians, clerks and technicians.Archives of the New York Botanical Garden The herbarium collection was completely rearranged, operations were improved, and specimens inventoried for the first time. Once the substantial backlog of unmounted material was complete, specimens were mounted for other institutions including the Arnold Arboretum and the Gray Herbarium. In 1931 Merrill established a new journal focused on systematic botany and plant geography, named Brittonia after Nathaniel Lord Britton, a co-founder of the Garden. Harvard In 1935 Merrill left the Botanic Garden and took a job as Administrator of Botanical Collections at Harvard University, a new position created to consolidate the supervision of eight separate Harvard botanical units. A year after his arrival Merrill also became the Arnold Professor of Botany, and in 1937 the Director of the Arnold Arboretum. In his new roles Merrill devoted significant time to expanding the herbarium of the Arnold Arboretum and to research on Asiatic plants. Over the next ten years 220,000 plant specimens were acquired from all parts of Asia and the Asia-Pacific. Meanwhile, Merrill continued to publish numerous papers on Asia flora as well as articles dealing with the cultivation and dispersion of domesticated plants. During the Second World War he consulted with the United States War Department and wrote a handbook, Emergency Food Plants and Poisonous Plants of the Islands of the Pacific. In 1946, at the age of seventy Merrill retired from his administrative duties and became Professor Emeritus in 1948. He continued with his research at Harvard and traveled as much as his age and health would allow. One of his last major contributions was The Botany of Cook's Voyages and its Unexpected Significance in Relation to Anthropology, Biogeography and History, published in 1952. Merrill died on February 25, 1956, in Forest Hills, Massachusetts. His library of 2,600 titles was donated to the New York Botanical Garden and a fund was established to award an annual medal to ‚Äúthat individual within the entire field of botany irrespective of race, creed or nationality who was considered worthy of such an award‚Äù. Recognition and honors Merrill was widely recognized for his many accomplishments. He received honorary doctorate degrees from the University of Maine in 1926, Harvard University in 1936, the University of California in 1936, and Yale University in 1951. He was a Guggenheim Fellow for the academic year 1951‚Äì1952. At various times he served as President of the Botanical Society of America, Acting President of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and President of the New England Botanical Club, the American Society of Plant Taxonomists, and the International Union of Biological Sciences. Seven plant genera (Merrillia, Merrilliobryum, Merrilliodendron, Merrilliopeltis, Merrillosphaera, Sinomerrillia, and Elmerrillia) and over 200 species were named in his honor.

The firm advises on Bermuda, British Virgin Islands and Cayman Islands laws, from offices in those jurisdictions and in the key financial centres of Hong Kong, London and Singapore. Conyers also provide a wide range of corporate, trust, compliance, governance and accounting and management services.  History  Founded in Bermuda in 1928 (although it can trace its roots back to 1903), the firm has subsequently opened legal practices in a number of other offshore financial centres, including the British Virgin Islands (1996) and the Cayman Islands (2004). It also has offices in key financial centres, including London (1998), Hong Kong (1985) and Singapore (2001). It is a member of the Offshore Magic Circle. Perhaps uniquely amongst multi-jurisdictional offshore firms, Conyers' expansion has been entirely by way of organic growth, rather than by acquisition of smaller firms in jurisdictions it wishes to operate in. The firm can legitimately claim to be the first offshore firm to operate in multiple jurisdictions; the original Bermudian firm opening a British Virgin Islands office in 1996. The firm's founder, Reginald Conyers, played an important role in the development of the nascent financial services industry in Bermuda in the 1920s and 1930s. Following on from the Bermuda Railway Company Act 1924, Conyers was faced with the legal problem of conveying huge numbers of land parcels by the company. This led to two things. Firstly, he took on two partners in his practice, Bayard Dill and James Pearman (and thus the firm was officially born). Secondly, in 1935 the firm was instrumental in the enactment of the first \\"exempt company\\" legislation in Bermuda, which leads some to claim that Bermuda was the world's first offshore financial centre.In practice the Bermudian claim does not stand up to scrutiny; Liechtenstein enacted trust laws to attract tax exempt foreign capital in 1926. Later, in 1957 another partner of the firm, David Graham, laid the basis for the development of Bermuda as a domicile for ship registrations in a letter to The Times.The firm's role in the development of offshore finance is noted in Tolley's International Initiatives Affecting Financial Havens (2001), In 2019, the firm became the subject of the Mauritius Leaks and related investigations carried forth by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists and its partners.  Practice areas  Conyers offers Legal and Client services in areas including Corporate, Banking & Finance, Insurance & Reinsurance, Investment Funds, Private Client & Trust, Litigation & Restructuring and Real Estate & Property Development.

Punjab Institute of Technology (PIT) =Punjab Institute of Technology (PIT), Hoshiarpur= The Punjab Institute of Technology, Hoshiarpur is one of the newly planned PITs by the Punjab Technical University, Kapurthala. The Punjab Technical University has decided to establish an institute in the name and style of Punjab Institute of Technology, Hoshiarpur for the benefit of Doaba belt of Punjab. In the year 2011, the Hon‚Äôble Chief Minister Sr. Parkash Singh Ji Badal came up with a view that in Punjab there are as many as 400 plus colleges in private sector imparting Engineering, Technical and Management courses, but there are very few colleges in Govt sector imparting Technical Education. The Hon‚Äôble Chief Minister choose Punjab Technical University as the Nodal agency to implement the idea of Technical and Management colleges in Govt. Sector in each of the Districts of Punjab, specially in rural areas for the upliftment of backward area and economically weaker students who have the talent but otherwise deprived of quality education due to financial limitations. For this purpose 22.6 acres of land was transferred to establish PIT, Hoshiarpur. Hon‚Äôble Vice-Chancellor Dr. Rajnish Arora under the leadership of S Parkash Singh Ji Badal initiated a process for developing a model for a new Technical college named PIT‚Äôs in Govt. Sector in every districts of Punjab. Driving this effort was the projected growth in student enrolment at its main campus i.e. PIT, Kapurthala and the belief that a community college structured differently might better address the persistent challenges of improving technical graduation rates and preparing students for further study and job readiness. =Punjab Institute of Technology (PIT), Mansa= PIT, Mansa is one of the institutions developed under the aegis of PTU to promote technical education and employment in rural areas of Punjab, at par with IITs.

The other two villages were Gobindapur and Sutanuti. Job Charnock, an administrator with the British East India Company is traditionally credited with the honour of founding the city. He settled in the village of Sutanuti. Kalikata was much less important than Sutanuti and Gobindapur, and this, along with the consequent abundance of space, afforded the British room to settle there.Cotton, H.E.A., Calcutta Old and New, 1909/1980, p. 1, General Printers and Publishers Pvt. Ltd. While both Sutanati and Gobindapur appear on old maps like Thomas Bowrey's of 1687 and George Herron's of 1690, Kalikata situated between the two is not depicted.Cotton, H.E.A., p. 11 However, one variant of the name, \\"Kalkat√¢\\", is shown in Abu'l Fazal's Ain-i-Akbari (around 1590). History English trader Job Charnock landed at Sutanuti on 24 August 1690 with the objective of establishing the East India Company's Bengal headquarters. As Kalikata did not have any settled native population, it was easy for the British to occupy the site. In 1696, construction of old Fort William began (near the site of the present-day General Post Office) without legal title to the land. Legal title was eventually secured on 10 November 1698 when Charles Eyre, Job Charnock's son-in-law and ultimate successor, acquired the zemindari (land-holding) rights from the Sabarna Roy Choudhury family, the zemindars (landlords) of the area. It is from this date that Kolkata came legally under English control. (At this time, the Mughal empire was still strong, under Aurangzeb). It is not clear when the Sabarna Roy Choudhury family acquired the village of Kalikata, but they acquired a vast acreage by grant allegedly in 1608 from Raja Man Singh, a maternal cousin of the reigning Mughal emperor Jahangir. However, other sources state that a progenitor only impressed Man Singh in 1612.Samaren Roy. Calcutta: Society and Change 1690-1990 iUniverse, , p. 7 The Sabarna Roy Choudhury's own tenure of the three villages ‚Äì Kalikata, Sutanuti, and Gobindapur ‚Äì is thus of uncertain duration, although in 1698, they were certainly the zemindars, or landlords, with their lands acquired through some sort of grant or lease from the Mughal emperors. They were apparently reluctant to transfer their rights as landlords but were forced to do so under pressure from the Mughal court.Debashish Bandopadhyay alleges that the British paid a bribe to the Mughal Darbar or court to obtain the legal rights to the land.

Cotton, \\"The pivot of the settlement must be sought in what is now Dalhousie Square, but was then known as the Lall Bagh or Park. In the centre was the Lall Dighi, or great Tank, which has been in existence before the coming of Charnock within what was the cutcherry (court- house) of the former zemindars (landlords)‚Ä¶ There was no Strand Road, and the waves of the Hooghly lapped the ramparts of the Fort. To the south there extended from Koila Ghat to Chandpal Ghat the mouth of a creek, navigable for large boats, which passed along Hastings Street and made way through Creek Row and Wellington Square to Beliaghata near the Salt Lakes‚Ä¶ Beyond Chitpore Road, which formed the eastern boundary of the settlement, lay more pools, swamps and rice-fields, dotted here and there with the struggling huts of fishermen, falconers, wood-cutters, weavers and cultivators.\\"Cotton, H.E.A., pp. 18-19 That in short was Kalikata in the early 18th century. As Calcutta became settled Sutanuti was gradually abandoned by the English as a place of abode.Cotton, H.E.A., p. 34 As the English withdrew to \\"White Town\\" restricted mostly to the north of the old fort, the sharp division was sealed with \\"Black Town\\" spread over Sutanuti, Chitpur and Gobindapur.Lahiri Choudhury, Dhriti Kanta,Trends in Calcutta Architecture, in Calcutta, the Living City, Vol I, pp. 156-160, edited by Sukanta Chaudhuri, Oxford University Press, . =Battles fought around Kalikata= Siraj ud-Daulah, the Nawab of Bengal, was alarmed by the growing prosperity and enhanced fortifications of Kolkata. In 1756, he decided to attack Kolkata. After capturing Kolkata, Siraj ud-Daula named it Alinagar, after his grandfather Alivardi Khan. The name of Kolkata was restored in 1758, after the British regained control of Bengal. \\"To the English indeed, the sack of Kolkata must have appeared little short of devastation. But in fact, of the four contiguous villages of Gobindapur, Kalikata, Sutanuti and Chitpur, only Kalikata or \\"White\\" Calcutta suffered extensively‚Ä¶ The Black Town escaped major damage, except the burning down of Barabazar‚Ä¶ Gobindapur had been fired by the English themselves.\\" The English evacuees set up temporary quarters at Falta, some 40 miles downstream. What followed was a series of skirmishes finally leading to the Battle of Plassey on 23 June 1757 and the establishment of British power in Bengal.Sinha, Pradip, Siraj's Calcutta, in Calcutta, the Living City, Vol I, pp. 8-9, edited by Sukanta Chaudhuri, Oxford University Press, The re-establishment of British power was followed by the construction of the new Fort William, in 1758 and the demolition of Gobindapur. The Indians moved out mostly to the north. European inhabitants gradually forsook the narrow limits of the old palisades and moved to around the Maidan.Cotton, H.E.A., p. 72. The most important public buildings and imposing private houses lined the northern side of the Esplanade, facing the Maidan on the south. \\"Esplanade Row,\\" wrote Mrs. Fay, \\"seems to be composed of palaces.\\" The movement of the white population was then directed towards Chaurangi, then a small village, and away from such areas as Baitakkhana (Bowbazar), Dharmatala and Janbazar. The latter areas were taken over by \\"the rest\\", which included half-castes, Portuguese and Armenians, to become a grey area between Black and White towns. As the metropolis grew with the passage of time, it absorbed the original village which was subsumed under the emerging city.

He is widely known for his research in the philosophy of communication and culture. Though his scholarship focused significantly throughout the 1980s and early 1990s on the politics of postmodernism, his more recent work explores the possibilities and limitations of alternative and emergent formations of modernity. Biography Born and raised in Brooklyn, New York, Grossberg went to Stuyvesant High School. In 1968 he graduated summa cum laude in history and philosophy from the University of Rochester, where he studied with Hayden White. Afterwards, he trained under Richard Hoggart and Stuart Hall at the Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies at the University of Birmingham, England. After two years of traveling through Europe with Les Treteaux Libres, a French-speaking theater company, Grossberg returned to the United States for doctoral studies in communication research (with James W. Carey) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. There, he received a Ph.D. in speech communication in 1976. His doctoral dissertation, which he now largely repudiates, was entitled, Dialectical Hermeneutics and the Human Sciences. Grossberg taught briefly at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana (1975-1976), before returning to the University of Illinois as assistant professor of speech communication in 1976. At the University of Illinois he supported founding the Unit for Criticism and Interpretive Theory. He was promoted to the rank of associate professor in 1982, and in 1990 achieved the rank of Professor of Speech Communication. Currently, he is Morris Davis Professor of Communication Studies and chair of the executive committee of the University Program in Cultural Studies at UNC. His published books include It's a Sin: Essays on Postmodernism, Politics and Culture (1988), We Gotta Get Out Of This Place: Popular Conservatism and Postmodern Culture (1992), Bringing it All Back Home: Essays on Cultural Studies (1997), Dancing in Spite of Myself: Essays in Popular Culture (1997), Caught in the Crossfire: Kids, Politics and America's Future (2005), and Cultural Studies in the Future Tense (2010). Grossberg is co-author of MediaMaking: Mass Media in a Popular Culture (2005) and About Raymond Williams (2010), and co-edited (with Cary Nelson and Paula Treichler) Cultural Studies. He has also published more than one hundred articles and essays. Grossberg is editor of the journal Cultural Studies, and has served in that capacity since 1990. He also serves on the editorial collective of Public Culture, among many other academic journals. His work, including a number of collections, has been translated into ten languages.

The other two villages were Kalikata and Sutanuti. Job Charnock, an administrator with the British East India Company is traditionally credited with the honour of founding the city. While Kalikata and Sutanuti lost their identity as the city grew, Gobindapur was demolished to make room for the construction of new Fort William. The foundations When the Portuguese first started to frequent Bengal, around the year 1530, the two great centres of trade were Chittagong, which the Portuguese called Porto Grande or Great Haven, in the east and Satgaon, which the Portuguese called Porto Piqueno or Little Haven in the west. Tolly‚Äôs Nallah or Adi Ganga was then the outlet to the sea and ocean-going ships came up to around where Garden Reach is now, then the anchoring place for ships. Only country boats operated further up the river. Possibly the Saraswati river was another watery life line. It started drying up from the middle of the 16th century. The Portuguese built a new port at Hugli in 1580. Towards the beginning of the 16th century, there was a person name Gobindasharan Dutta Chaudhury, who belonged to a kayastha zamindar of Andul Dutta Chaudhury Family was returning by boat from a pilgrimage. He dreamt of goddess Kali asking him to dig the barren land on the bank. He did so and discovered enormous qualities of wealth hidden underground. He stayed back and founded the place. It is said that the name of the place Gobindapur was named after him. There is another story regarding the foundation and naming of the village. Towards the end of the 16th century, the Indian merchant-princes of Port Piqueno were forced to seek another market for their trade. Most of them settled down in Hugli but four families of Basaks and one of Sheths, determined to profit by the growing prosperity of Betor, founded the village of Gobindapur, on the east bank of the river. Gobindaji was the family deity of the Sheths and Basaks, and so they named the village Gobindapur. In 1596, the place is mentioned as a district of the Sirkar (or government) of Satgaon, in the book Ain-e-Akbari by Abul Fazal, the prime minister of Akbar. As traders, the Portuguese were succeeded by the Dutch and finally the British. English arrival Job Charnock favoured Sutanuti as a settlement because of the security of the location. It was protected by the river on the west and by impassable marshes on the south and the east. Only the north-east had to be guarded. The three villages were part of the khas mahal or imperial jagir (an estate belonging to the Mughal emperor himself), whose zemindari rights were held by the Sabarna Roy Choudhury family of Barisha. On 10 November 1698, Job Charnock‚Äôs successor and son-in-law, Charles Eyere, acquired the land holding rights for the three villages from the Sabarna Roychoudhuris. The company paid regular rent to the Mughals for these villages till 1757. Within a short period Kolkata grew considerably. New Fort William Siraj ud-Daulah, the Nawab of Bengal, was alarmed by the growing prosperity and enhanced fortifications of Kolkata. In 1756, he decided to attack Kolkata and captured it. Gobindapur was fired by the English themselves. The English evacuees set up temporary quarters at Falta, downstream. What followed was a series of skirmishes finally leading to the Battle of Plassey on 23 June 1757 and the establishment of British power in Bengal. One of the first things that the English embarked upon on their return to Kolkata was the construction of new Fort William. It commenced in 1758 and completed in 1773. The site chosen was in the heart of ‚Äòpopulous flourishing‚Äô village of Gobindapur. A portion of the ‚Äòrestitution money‚Äô was spent in compensating the inhabitants who were given lands in other parts of the town notably in Taltala, Kumortuli and Shobhabazar.

He serves at present as the Chairman of the board of directors and trustees of LifeBank, a rural bank and microfinancial institution in the Philippines. Early life and education Perlas is the son of Jesus C. Perlas, Sr. and Anunciacion M. Pineda. Raised into a Spanish Filipino family of Azucarera (sugar mill) owners, he finished his elementary education at the Ateneo de Manila University in 1964 and finished his secondary education in the same school in 1968. While spending his high school years at the Ateneo, he was the Athlete of the Year and the recipient of the Silver Medal of the school's Math and Science Club in 1968. Perlas pursued his undergraduate studies at the College of Agriculture in Xavier University - Ateneo de Cagayan. With the highest honors, he graduated Bachelor of Science in Agriculture, major in Agronomy and minor in Agricultural Economics in the said educational institution in 1972. He would then seek to pursue his master's studies at the University of the Philippines Los Ba√±os, but would soon be forced to abandon his studies after being involved in the opposition of the Bataan nuclear power plant under the presidency of Ferdinand Marcos. Personal life He was married to American citizen Kathryn Carpenter. Now divorced. Together they have had one son, Christopher Michael Perlas. LifeBank Nicanor Perlas sits as the Chairman of the Board of Trustees/Corporation of LifeBank, a microfinancial institution and rural bank in the Philippines. LifeBank which is founded in 1970 is divided into two corporate arms each with its own different banking/financing functions - the LifeBank - A Rural Bank (LifeBank RB) and LifeBank Microfinance Foundation, Inc. (LifeBank MFI). LifeBank RB is one of the fastest growing rural banks supervised under the jurisdiction of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP). As of 2020, it operates 4 bank branches and 31 branch-lite units (BLUs) in Western Visayas. The LifeBank MFI or LifeBank Microfinance, is an offshoot of LifeBank founded in 2003. Presently, it operates as a non-governmental organization (NGO) microfinance institution (MFI) with 477 branches and 20+ zonal and district offices across the Philippines covering 300,000+ loan clients and 400,000+ saving deposits clients. It is the 3rd largest microfinance institution in the country. LifeBank MFI is also involved in social responsible programs by the Perlas Group/LifeBank Group. Its social and sustainable development programs created a nearly 2000 academic scholars across, built public buildings for government use, promoted healthcare through medical missions in far flung areas, among others, across the Philippines. Activism In his university days, Perlas was one of the key organizers of a university-wide education reform movement that resulted in changes in university policies. During this time, he founded the first ecological society in the Philippines. After graduation, he co- organized a successful large scale global campaign, the first of its kind during his time, to halt 12 nuclear plants in the Philippines. Perlas subsequently become a technical adviser to the Presidential Commission on the Philippine Nuclear Power Plant, Office of the President of the Philippines, where he was instrumental in stopping the operation of the fully constructed and operational Bataan Nuclear Power Plant, a $2.2 billion project plagued with design, construction, location, and corruption problems. Shortly thereafter, Perlas was appointed member of the national technical panel overseeing the regulation of pesticide use in Philippine agriculture. While in this capacity, he simultaneously mobilized and headed a national effort that resulted in the banning of 32 hazardous pesticide formulations in the Philippines. The ban triggered the creation of a P750 million government program to reduce the use of pesticides in Philippine agriculture. In parallel with these efforts, Perlas pioneered the introduction of large scale commercial organic and biodynamic agriculture in many provinces in the Philippines. All these efforts were the fruition of early advocacies in sustainable agriculture when he was still an agricultural journalist and columnist at the Modern Agriculture and Industry-Asia, where he pioneered the first monthly articles on ecological agriculture in the Asian context. Together with colleagues at the International Alliance for Sustainable Agriculture or IASA, he coined the term sustainable agriculture in 1983, a term which has received wide use and currency until today. Perlas was the chief negotiator for a network of national networks, which involved 5000 organizations, that successfully stopped the agenda of radical and one sided liberalization in the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation or APEC. He successfully introduced strong sustainable development language in the Leaders and Ministerial Declarations in APEC, and constrained the Individual Action Plan of the Philippines to abide by sustainable development principles. The successful negotiations prevented the premature exposure and economic decline of 3 million Philippine rice farmers to subsidized and artificially cheap rice coming from other countries. =Projects and offices= Perlas is the co- founder, president and executive director of the Center for Alternative Development Initiatives or CADI, in Metro Manila and Iloilo City, where he guides research and policy work and develops initiatives on globalization, threefolding and their impacts on civil society, cultural power and sustainable development.

He was one of the official civil society delegates from the Philippines at the Earth Summit in Rio. It was out of this experience, among others, that he helped shape the process and substance of PA21. Having emerged from more than 26 regional and national consultations, PA21 was characterized by the former Philippine president as the most consultative policy document in post-martial law Philippines. PA21 is still officially the blueprint for sustainable development in the Philippines, although presently marginalized by the current controversial government of the Philippines. He was also the technical writer of SIAD: Framework for the Localization of Philippine Agenda 21, which is now used by a number of local governments and civil society organizations to advance sustainable integrated area development in towns. =Speaking and Consultancy= Perlas has been the resource person and keynote speaker in over 70 global conferences and events in over 20 countries, and over 120 national conferences on a range of topics including culture and societal transformation, integral sustainable development, globalization, technology, corporate social responsibility, science and spirituality, social threefolding, strategic microfinance, direct democracy and others. He has provided consultancy work for several UN agencies, the Philippine Senate, donor agencies and foundations, as well as many other global and national civil society organizations and networks and businesses striving for ecological and social responsibility.

The other two villages were Gobindapur and Kalikata. Job Charnock, an administrator with the British East India Company is traditionally credited with the honour of founding the city. He settled in the village of Sutanuti. In addition to the three recognised hamlets around which the city has grown up, must be added at least four others as the elementary constituents of the city (including Howrah on the opposite bank.) These are Chitpur, Salkia, Kalighat and Betor. Out of these four Betor, which was the focus of trade once upon a time, vanished in the seventeenth century. It was located around where Shibpur presently is. Location \\"The three villages may be said, roughly speaking, to have extended along the river from Coolie Bazar, where the buildings of the Commissariat now stand in the vicinity of Prinsep‚Äôs Ghat, to Chitpore: but the English settlement proper was a very small affair indeed. It was confined to the locality between Baboo Ghat, hard by modern Eden Gardens, and a point about a hundred yards to the north of Clive Street. Surrounding it was the native portion of ‚ÄòDhee‚Äô Kolkata, and to the north was Suttanuttee. On the south stood Govindpore, high on the river-bank and covered with thick jungle. The total amount of inhabited land was only 840 bighas, or one-sixth of the territory conveyed by the sanad of Azim-us-shan and of this 204 bighas was absorbed by the Settlement itself, and 400 by the great Bazar to its immediate north. In Colonel Mark Wood's Map of 1784, published in 1792 by William Baillie, Suttanuttee is described as extending from Chitpore in the north to what is designated in the map as Jora Bagan Ghat, a little below Nimtollah Ghat. Thence commenced the northern boundary of ‚ÄòDhee‚Äô Kolkata, and that village proceeded south as far as Baboo Ghat. Here Govindpore began and ended at the Govindpore Creek, afterwards called Surman's Nullah and later Tolly's Nullah.\\" Mughal period At the end of the fifteenth century a poem in praise of the serpent-goddess written by Bipradas Pipilai gives us the first authentic glimpse of the area. Satgaon or Saptagram on the west bank of the Hooghly, between Bandel and Tribeni was a great port. Lower down the river, on the same bank, Betor was a large market town, where travellers paused to buy provisions and worship the goddess Chandi. Chitpur and Kalikata were neighbouring villages passed just before reaching Betor. Gobindapur and Sutanuti did not exist. Kalighat was a small sanctuary claiming just a bare mention. When the Portuguese first started to frequent Bengal, around the year 1530, the two great centres of trade were Chittagong, then known as Porto Grande or Great Haven, in the east and Satgaon, then known as Porto Pequeno or Little Haven in the west. Tolly's Nallah or Adi Ganga was then the outlet to the sea and ocean-going ships came up to around where Garden Reach presently is, then the anchoring place for ships. Only country boats operated further up the river. Possibly the Saraswati river was another watery life line. It started drying up from the middle of the sixteenth century. The Portuguese built a new port at Hugli in 1580. Simpson, William, India Ancient and Modern, published in 1867, view of Chitpore Road that cuts across Sutanuti from south to north. Towards the end of the sixteenth century, the merchant-princes of Port Pequeno were forced to seek another market for their trade. Most of them settled down in Hugli but four families of Bysacks (an English corruption of the Indian term Vaishakh) and one of Setts (an English corruption of the Indian surname Seth), determined to profit by the growing prosperity of Betor, founded the village of Gobindapur, on the east bank of the river. On the northern side of Dhee (meaning village or group of villages) Kalikata (as Calcutta was known in Bengali), came up a place for sale of cloth, which was soon to become celebrated as Sutanuti Haat, the cotton bale market. In 1596, the place is noticed as a district of the Sirkar (or government) of Satgaon, in the book Ain-e-Akbari of Abul Fazal, the prime minister of Akbar. As traders, the Portuguese were succeeded by the Dutch and finally the British came. The British arrive Job Charnock is heard of in various positions and places associated with the East India Company from around 1658. After Cossimbazar and Patna he stayed for shorter periods at Hughli, Hijli and Sutanuti. He was convinced about the advantages of Sutanuti as a place of settlement but his colleagues and superiors were not. However, the officials in Madras, after certain debacles at Chittagong, allowed him, with the objective of establishing a settlement, to sail for Sutanuti and he landed there on 24 August 1690, a date that has become historically famous. He lived for two and half years after that.Biswas, Prabodh, Job Charnock, in Calcutta, the Living City, Vol I, edited by Sukanta Chaudhuri, pp. 6-7, Oxford University Press, Job Charnock favoured Sutanuti as a settlement because of the security of the location. It was protected by the river on the west and by impassable marshes on the south and the east. Only the north had to be guarded. The three villages were part of the khas mahal or imperial jagir (an estate belonging to the Mughal emperor himself), whose zamindary rights were held by the Sabarna Roy Choudhury family of Barisha. On 10 November 1698, Job Charnock's successor and son-in-law, Charles Eyre, acquired the zamindary rights for the three villages from the Sabarna Roychoudhuris. The company paid regular rent to the Mughals for these villages till 1757. Kolkata emerges as a city Rebellions and skirmishes in the hinterland gave the English the pretext to fortify Kolkata. The fort was named Fort William after William of Orange who was at that time both king of both England and stadtholder of part of the Dutch Republic. Kolkata soon grew into a prosperous town. It attracted merchants, skilled artisans, adventurers and law-abiding citizens anxious to flee from the lawless conditions in the neighbouring territories. In 1700, Kolkata was separated from Madras and became a new presidency. The three presidencies at Kolkata, Mumbai and Chennai started functioning independently. In 1717, it secured from the Mughal emperor Farrukhsiyar, certain concessions regarding trade and revenue. It helped the company to grow commercially. Siraj ud- Daulah, the Nawab of Bengal was alarmed by the growing prosperity and enhanced fortifications of Kolkata. In 1756, he decided to attack Kolkata. After capturing Kolkata, Siraj ud-Daula named it Alinagar, after his grandfather Alivardi Khan. The name of Kolkata was restored in 1758, after the British regained control of Bengal. \\"To the English indeed, the sack of Kolkata must have appeared little short of devastation. But in fact, of the four contiguous villages of Gobindapur, Kalikata, Sutanuti and Chitpur, only Kalikata or ‚ÄòWhite‚Äô Calcutta suffered extensively... The Black Town escaped major damage, except the burning down of Barabazar... Gobindapur had been fired by the English themselves.\\" The English evacuees set up temporary quarters at Falta, some downstream. What followed was a series of skirmishes finally leading to the Battle of Plassey on 23 June 1757 and the establishment of British power in Bengal. Black town There were practically no roads in the area except the road connecting Halisahar in the north to Kalighat in the south (it was up to Barisha according to some). Some writers called it pilgrim path. It was kept in repair by the Sheth family; Jagannath Sheth planted trees on both sides of it. The Sheths also maintained a road connecting their garden house at Jorabagan with old Fort William. Some road construction started in 1721 but most of roads came up after 1757.Bagchi, Amiya Kumar, Wealth and Work in Calcutta 1860‚Äì1921, in Calcutta, the Living City, Vol I, p. 229. As the city grew, different neighbourhoods sprang up. Mechhuabazar (later Jorasanko) was the fish market. Kalutola was home of the Kalus (Kaluas) or oil pressers of the company, who may have supplied mustard and other oils to the merchants. Kumortuli was named after the Kumors (Kumbhars) or potters who settled there. Jorabagan, also called Sheth Bagan in earlier days had a 110 bigha garden owned by the Sheths. Further north there were the settlements Bagbazar and Shyambazar. The area was citadel of Bengali aristocracy. Bosepara was set up by Basus and Pals migrating from Hooghly district. Nidhuram Bose is believed to have arrived before the British came to Sutanuti. Sometimes localities were named after trees. Bartala was named after twin banyan trees (bar or bat). Taltala was named after its tal (palmyra) trees. In those days areas such as Entally were part of the salt lakes, Ballygunj and Rasapagla (later Tollygunj) were sleepy villages. The three-mile (5 km) Maratha Ditch was excavated by 1742 as a protections against the marauding Marathas (known in Bengal as Bargis), but they never came and Siraj ud-Daulah easily crossed it with his forces, near what is now Sealdah. At around the same time, the palisades around the English settlement were strengthened, creating in effect a ‚Äòwhite ghetto‚Äô.Lahiri Choudhury, Dhriti Kanta,Trends in Calcutta Architecture, in Calcutta, the Living City, Vol I, pp. 156-157. Long before Siraj-ud-dowla sacked Kolkata, the psychological barrier sprung up with a clear distinction between the ‚ÄòWhite Town‚Äô restricted mostly to the north of the old fort and ‚ÄòBlack Town‚Äô spread over Sutanuti, Chitpur and Gobindapur. The sharp division was sealed by the gradual withdrawal of the British from Sutanuti. Even a deep trench, 16 to wide, was dug in 1710, ostensibly to drain the White Town but also to separate it from the Black Town in Sutanuti.Nair, P. Thankappan, Civic and Public Services in Old Calcutta, in Calcutta, the Living City, Vol I, p. 227 Even as the English gradually abandoned Sutanuti as a place of abode, there stood at its northernmost corner a pleasure resort called Perrin's Garden, where \\"once it was the height of gentility for the Company‚Äôs covenanted servants to take their ladies for an evening stroll or moonlight fete.\\" It also gradually fell out of use and repair and was sold out in 1752. With the commencement of construction of the new Fort William, in 1758 and the demolition of Gobindapur, the inhabitants were compensated and given land in Taltala, Kumortuli and Shobhabazar. European inhabitants gradually forsook the narrow limits of the old palisades and moved to around the Maidan. Sett and Basaks Before the British came the most powerful families in the region were Sheths and Basacks, the merchants of yarn and cloth market at Sutanuti. With the arrival of the British these families flourished with renewed vigour. Janardan Sheth was a trading agent of the British. Shobharam Basack (1690‚Äì1773) became a millionaire by supplying textiles to East India Company.http://thegangeswalk.com/sobharam-bysack-the-lost-icon-of-bengal/Deb, Chitra, The ‚ÄòGreat Houses‚Äô of Old Calcutta, in Calcutta, the Living City, Vol I, pp. 56-60. The earliest names floating around are those of Mukundaram Sheth, who lived in the earlier part of sixteenth century and moved from Saptagram to Gobindapur. When Gobindapur was demolished the Sheths moved to Sutanati Haat or Barabazar. Thereafter, the most important name is that of Janardan Sheth. He was the son of Kenaram Sheth (Kiranchandra Sheth according to some) and had two brothers, Baranasi and Nandaram. Janardan Sheth's son Biashnabcharan Sheth had a roaring business of selling bottled Ganges water. The Marwaris ousted the Sheths and Basacks as cloth merchants and changed the name of old Sutanuti haat or market to Barabazar. Even after that some of them continued to have business ties. Radhakrishna Basak (d. 1811), descendant of Shobharam Basak was Dewan of the Bank of Bengal, but the leading business families of the eighteenth century switched to investments in urban property. While Shobharam Basak left thirty-seven houses to his heirs. Ramkrishna Sheth left sixteen in Barabazar alone.Bhattacharya, Sabyasachi, Traders and Trades in Old Calcutta, in Calcutta, the Living City, Vol I, P. 206. The Sheths and the Basacks began to decline from the mid-eighteenth century ‚Äì just as Kolkata began to grow into a large city. Along with the Sheths and Basaks, Sutanuti gradually lost its visibility, replaced by numerous neighbourhoods, and retreated into the books of history and scrolls of honour. We hear of Nabakrishna Deb being offered the Talukdari of Sutanuti.Raychoudhuri, Subir, The Lost World of the Babus, in Calcutta, the Living City, Vol I, P. 72. Binay Ghosh, the renowned cultural-historian has distinguished four types of culture prevailing in old Kolkata ‚Äì Sutanuti culture, Kalikata culture, Gobindapur culture and Bhawanipur culture. Sutanuti culture was the urban-feudal culture propagated by Nabakrishna Deb, Kalikata culture was the mercantile culture propagated by Sheths-Basaks. Gobindapur culture was the European nouveaux riche culture. Bhawanipur culture was the Hindu Bengali middle-class culture. Sutanuti is the place where Job Charnock landed in 1690. Around it grew not only the city of Kolkata but also the mighty British Empire in India. As the heart of Kolkata's Black Town, as well as cradle of its culture, Sutanuti continues to hold nostalgic curiosity for anybody with an interest in old Kolkata.

Route description  Illinois Route 142 Illinois 142 runs northwest from Equality. Before reaching Eldorado, it intersects Illinois Route 13 and U.S. Route 45. Illinois 142 largely parallels the North Fork of the Saline River before reaching McLeansboro and intersecting Illinois Route 14 and Illinois Route 242, a spur of Illinois 142. Route 142 then proceeds northwesterly following the alignment of the former US Route 460, passing through Dahlgren and crossing Interstate 64 without an interchange, before entering the Mount Vernon area. In Mt. Vernon, Illinois 142 passes the sole remaining Continental Tire North America manufacturing plant, becoming Fisher Lane for a short distance before intersecting IL 37. Illinois 142 crosses IL 37, where its name changes to Veterans Memorial Drive. It proceeds along Veterans Memorial Drive ending at the northern terminus of Illinois Route 148 (Waltonville Road). Illinois 142 passes through these communities with a population greater than 500: Mount Vernon, Illinois, Dahlgren, McLeansboro, Eldorado, and Equality.  History  SBI Route 142 ran from Effingham to McLeansboro along what is Illinois 37 today. It was changed in the mid-1930s to its current routing. In 1947, U.S. Route 460 was applied onto Illinois 142 from Mount Vernon to McLeansboro; Illinois 142 was then moved onto what was then Illinois Route 147, which had been Illinois Route 142A, or the highway north from McLeansboro to Wayne City. This configuration lasted until 1974, when U.S. 460 was decommissioned and the current routing for Illinois 142 re-established from Mount Vernon to McLeansboro. The road from McLeansboro north to Wayne City was again renamed, to Illinois 242. Illinois Route 142 runs roughly parallels to and near the path of the historic Goshen Road in the counties it traverses.

A critical review of the book calls it \\"a highly ambitious and intriguing work, if an ultimately flawed one.\\"Gardiner, Michael Rockin' at the White House Memorial University of Newfoundland Introduction, ‚ÄúRock under siege‚Äù Lawrence Grossberg explains that the rising number of attacks on rock music only show the Right‚Äôs ambiguous relationship to popular culture. Attacks on rock music are usually produced by Christian fundamentalist movements and an ‚Äúelitist fraction of a new conservative alliance‚Äù, who see rock as the main cause for ‚Äúa certain fall from grace‚Äù.Grossberg (1992) 5 =The Increasing Commodification of Rock Music= Grossberg distinguishes between more organic forms of rock music, which sometimes characterize the 1960s, for example, and those of the 1980s, whose texts were highly choreographed by the culture industry (record labels, MTV, music magazines, etc.). =Conservative Appropriation of Rock Music= For Grossberg, the Reagan and Thatcher revival of conservatism can be understood in terms outlined by Antonio Gramsci. A popular hegemony sought to defang the critiques of the counterculture and reinscribe youth culture in the service of corporate capitalism. On the surface, this form does not resemble an attack but it uses rock music and reconstructs its meanings and significance. Thus, conservative Christian groups can use rock in order to spread their ‚Äúfundamentalist and conservative messages‚Äù.Grossberg (1992) 8 Grossberg further states that these attacks on rock are actually quite paradoxical, as rock has become ‚Äúpart of a dominant mainstream culture‚ÄùGrossberg (1992) 9 and thus, ‚Äúrock is losing power to encapsulate and articulate resistance and opposition‚Äù‚Äù. According to Grossberg, however, the new conservatives try to regulate the ‚Äúpossibilities of pleasure and identity as the basis opposition and to dismantle the cultural and political field constructed in the 1960s\\".Grossberg (1992) 10 Professor Michael Gardiner writes, \\"According to Grossberg, the major consequence of this is that politics in present-day America has become curiously depoliticized. Strictly economic or ideological arguments in favour of the conservative agenda have been replaced by appeals to mood, passion, sentimentality, and so on.\\" Gardiner's review continues: \\"Yet, at the same time, daily life is repoliticized: the new conservatism seeks to take over the spaces and places within everyday life formerly occupied by youth culture (the body, pleasure/fun, youth) and invest them with new values and meanings. The overarching goal is to submit the practices of daily life to an apparatus of power that is more congenial to the requirements of the emerging post-Fordist economic order. One result is that politics has become largely personalized, just another \\"lifestyle choice,\\" rather than a site of collective struggle in which popular culture used to play a crucial role:\\" Gardiner then quotes Grossberg, \\"The collapse of all political space, civil society and everyday life and the transformation of everyday life in disciplined mobilization not only depoliticizes large segments of the population, it also eviscerates the recognition of popular culture as a terrain and weapon of struggle.\\" 'Grossberg (1992) 308 Notes Bibliography * Category:1992 non-fiction books Category:Music books Category:Books about politics of the United States ","title":"We Gotta Get Out of This Place (book)"},{"id":"5637287","text":"Union Sportive M√©dinat d'Annaba (), known as USM Annaba or simply USMAN for short, is an Algerian football club based in Annaba.

It is cited in Egils Saga (chapter 61), which claims that he created it in the span of one night. The events in the saga that lead up to the composition and recitation of the poem can be summarized in the following way. Egil falls into king Eirik's hands after being shipwrecked in Northumbria. Faced with the decision to either dishonorably flee and risk being exposed as a coward or to directly face his adversary and ask for reconciliation, Egil chooses the latter. The two men are enemies during the saga, which makes Egil‚Äôs decision especially bold. Earlier in the saga Egil goes as far as to construct a Nithing pole, a sign of disrespect in medieval Scandinavian society. For this and other reasons King Eirik tells Egil not to expect any outcome other than death for his arrival in his court. This would be the end for Egil, however, one of his allies, who has allegiance to Eirik, intercedes on Egil‚Äôs behalf. Arinbj«´rn hersir tells the king that it would be dishonorable to kill his enemy under such circumstances. Furthermore he states that Egil, also a renowned poet, ‚Äúcan make recompense with words of praise that will live for ever.‚Äù This argument along with it being considered scornful to kill during the night, convinces Eirik to delay his judgement until the next day. During the night Egil composes and memorizes the entire poetic dr√°pa known as the Head Ransom. He recites it in the presence of the king Eir√≠kr and receives his freedom, but not any sort of reconciliation. The two remain enemies and Egil continues on his original journey to visit king √Üthelstan of England. If the poem is authentic it constitutes the second use of end-rhyme in the northern artistic tradition. The first time was a stanza by Egil's father, which is widely believed to have been written by Egill himself.

PPF is thus a form of short-term synaptic plasticity. The mechanisms underlying neural facilitation are exclusively pre-synaptic; broadly speaking, PPF arises due to increased presynaptic concentration leading to a greater release of neurotransmitter-containing synaptic vesicles.

The amount of neurotransmitter released is correlated with the amount of influx. Therefore, short-term facilitation (STF) results from a build up of within the presynaptic terminal when action potentials propagate close together in time. Facilitation of excitatory post-synaptic current (EPSC) can be quantified as a ratio of subsequent EPSC strengths. Each EPSC is triggered by pre-synaptic calcium concentrations and can be approximated by: EPSC = k([]presynaptic)4 = k([]rest \\\\+ []influx \\\\+ []residual)4 Where k is a constant. Facilitation = EPSC2 / EPSC1 = (1 + []residual / []influx)4 \\\\- 1 =Experimental evidence= Early experiments by Del Castillo & Katz in 1954 and Dudel & Kuffler in 1968 showed that facilitation was possible at the neuromuscular junction even if transmitter release does not occur, indicating that facilitation is an exclusively presynaptic phenomenon. Katz and Miledi proposed the residual hypothesis. They attributed the increase in neurotransmitter release to residual or accumulated (\\"active calcium\\") within the axon membrane that remains attached to the membrane's inner surface. Katz and Miledi manipulated the concentration within the presynaptic membrane to determine whether or not residual remaining within the terminal after the first impulse caused an increase in neurotransmitter release following the second stimulus. During the first nerve impulse, concentration was either significantly below or nearing that of the second impulse. When concentration was approaching that of the second impulse, facilitation was increased. In this first experiment, stimuli were presented in intervals of 100 ms between the first and second stimuli. An absolute refractory period was reached when intervals were about 10 ms apart. To examine facilitation during shorter intervals, Katz and Miledi directly applied brief depolarizing stimuli to nerve endings. When increasing the depolarizing stimulus from 1-2 ms, neurotransmitter release greatly increased due to accumulation of active . Therefore, the degree of facilitation depends on the amount of active , which is determined by the reduction in conductance over time as well as the amount of removed from axon terminals after the first stimulus. Facilitation is greatest when the impulses are closest together because conductance would not return to baseline prior to the second stimulus. Therefore, both conductance and accumulated would be greater for the second impulse when presented shortly after the first. In the Calyx of Held synapse, short term facilitation (STF) has been shown to result from the binding of residual to neuronal sensor 1 (NCS1). Conversely, STF has been shown to decrease when chelators are added to the synapse (causing chelation) which reduce residual . Therefore, \\"active \\" plays a significant role in neural facilitation. In the synapse between Purkinje cells, short-term facilitation has been shown to be entirely mediated by the facilitation of currents through the voltage-dependent calcium channels. Relation to other forms of short- term synaptic plasticity = Augmentation and potentiation = Short-term synaptic enhancement is often differentiated into categories of facilitation, augmentation, and potentiation (also referred to as post-tetanic potentiation or PTP). These three processes are often differentiated by their time scales: facilitation usually lasts for tens of milliseconds, while augmentation acts on a time scale on the order of seconds and potentiation has a time course of tens of seconds to minutes. All three effects increase the probability of neurotransmitter release from the presynaptic membrane, but the underlying mechanism is different for each. Paired-pulse facilitation is caused by the presence of residual , augmentation likely arises due to increased action of the presynaptic protein munc-13, and post-tetanic potentiation is mediated by presynaptic activation of protein kinases. The type of synaptic enhancement seen in a given cell is also related to variant dynamics of removal, which is in turn dependent upon the type of stimuli; a single action potential leads to facilitation, while a short tetanus generally causes augmentation and a longer tetanus leads to potentiation. = Short-term depression (STD) = Short-term depression (STD) operates in the opposite direction of facilitation, decreasing the amplitude of PSPs. STD occurs due to a decrease in the readily releasable pool of vesicles (RRP) as a result of frequent stimulation. The inactivation of presynaptic channels after repeated action potentials also contributes to STD. Depression and facilitation interact to create short-term plastic changes within neurons, and this interaction is called the dual- process theory of plasticity. Basic models present these effects as additive, with the sum creating the net plastic change (facilitation - depression = net change). However, it has been shown that depression occurs earlier on in the stimulus-response pathway than facilitation, and therefore plays into the expression of facilitation. Many synapses exhibit properties of both facilitation and depression. In general, however, synapses with low initial probability of vesicle release are more likely to exhibit facilitation, and synapses with high probability of initial vesicle release are more likely to exhibit depression. Relation to information transmission =Synaptic filtering= Because the probability of vesicle release is activity-dependent, synapses can act as dynamic filters for information transmission. Synapses with a low initial probability of vesicle release act as high-pass filters: because the release probability is low, a higher-frequency signal is needed to trigger release, and the synapse thus selectively responds to high-frequency signals. Likewise, synapses with high initial release probabilities serve as low-pass filters, responding to lower-frequency signals. Synapses with an intermediate probability of release act as band-pass filters that selectively respond to a specific range of frequencies. These filtering characteristics may be affected by a variety of factors, including both PPD and PPF, as well as chemical neuromodulators. In particular, because synapses with low release probabilities are more likely to experience facilitation than depression, high-pass filters are often converted to band-pass filters. Likewise, because synapses with high initial release probabilities are more likely to undergo depression than facilitation, it is common for low-pass filters to become band-pass filters, as well. Neuromodulators, meanwhile, may affect these short-term plasticities. In synapses with intermediate release probabilities, properties of the individual synapse will determine how the synapse changes in response to stimuli. These changes in filtration affect information transmission and encoding in response to repeated stimuli. =Sound-source localization= In humans, sound localization is primarily accomplished using information about how the intensity and timing of a sound vary between each ear. Neuronal computations involving these interaurual intensity differences (IIDs) and interaural time differences (ITDs) are typically carried out in different pathways in the brain. Short-term plasticity likely assists in differentiating between these two pathways: short-term facilitation dominates in intensity pathways, while short-term depression dominates in temporal pathways. These different types of short-term plasticity allow for different kinds of information filtration, thus contributing to the division of the two kinds of information into distinct processing streams. The filtering capabilities of short-term plasticity may also assist with encoding information related to amplitude modulation (AM). Short-term depression can dynamically adjust the gain on high-frequency inputs, and may thus allow for an expanded high-frequency range for AM. A mixture of facilitation and depression may also assist in AM coding by leading to rate filtering.

The Hall was used as a health clinic in the second half of the 20th century and briefly reopened as a hotel, restaurant and spa in 2015 but shut in early 2017. The parkland and formal gardens of the hall are Grade I listed on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens, and the hall itself is listed Grade II* on the National Heritage List for England. History The first recorded owner of the estate was Robert de Shrubeland, although there is evidence of occupation on the site since the Roman period. Shrubland Old Hall was built by the Booth family in the early 16th century and demolished in the early 19th century. The present Grade II* listed hall was designed by James Paine for the Revd. John Bacon in the early 1770s. It was bought in the late 1700s by Sir William Fowle Middleton, 1st Baronet, whose son and heir, Sir William Fowle Middleton, 2nd Baronet, commissioned architect John Gandy-Deering to remodel it in the early 1830s. There was further remodelling of the building for Sir William between 1849 and 1855 by Sir Charles Barry, who also created the terraced gardens. Paine's central block was built in 3 storeys with a 5 bay frontage, to which Gandy-Deering added 3 further bays to either side. The whole is constructed of Gault brick with dressings of limestone and stucco. The parkland was styled by Humphry Repton and still retains the deer park and walled garden. Crowfield, Suffolk After Sir William's death in 1860, the property passed to his cousin Sir George Nathaniel Broke Middleton, and from him in 1882 to his niece Jane Anne Broke, eldest daughter of Captain Charles Acton Vere-Broke, and her husband James Saumarez, 4th Baron de Saumarez. The Hall was used as a convalescent home during the First World War and the Old Hall as a brigade HQ during the Second World War. In the 1960s, the 6th Baron de Saumarez established a health clinic in the property which continued in the time of the 7th Baron. Shrubland Hall Health Clinic operated in the hall adjoining Shrubland Park Gardens until 2 April 2006, when the Shrubland estate, totalling some , was put up for sale with an asking price of ¬£23 million. Until then the Italian style gardens which include Grade II listed features were open to the public as a visitor attraction. It also featured in the James Bond film Never Say Never Again. In 2010, the estate was sold in 42 separate lots. As of 2012, the Hall itself was used as residential quarters for the private higher education establishment, the British Institute of Technology & E-commerce (BITE) but in 2014 was re-opened as the luxury 7th Star Boutique Health and Hotel. In 2015, the Hall was advertised for sale at an asking price of ¬£6,500,000.24 bedroom house for sale Shrubland Park, Coddenham, Ipswich, Suffolk ¬£6,500,000 at rightmove.co.uk, accessed 9 November 2015.

Part of the Bratislava IV district, Lamaƒç is home to approximately 7,000 inhabitants. Until 1946, Lamaƒç was a small independent village, but it was incorporated into the city Bratislava. In the past, Lamaƒç was known for its vineyards and as an agricultural and fruit supplier for Bratislava's markets. The dominant features of Lamaƒç include the Church of Saint Margita, the Chapel of Saint Rozalia and the Memorial to soldiers killed in The First World War. Lamaƒç is accessible by the public transport system of Bratislava. The borough also features the Bratislava Lamaƒç railway station.  Location  Lamaƒç borders D√∫bravka to the south-east, Dev√≠nska Nov√° Ves to the west, Z√°horsk√° Bystrica to the north and Raƒça to the east, separated by the Pezinok Carpathians. = Division = Lamaƒç is unofficially divided into two local parts: R√°zsochy and Podh√°j.  History  Present-day Lamaƒç lies on the territory of four medieval villages. The first one (unknown name) ceased to exist in 1241. Blumenau and Sellendorf were founded between 1279 and 1288 and de facto ceased to exist until 1436, probably because of frequent border disputes and their division between the heirs of the original founder. Croats fleeing from the Ottomans in the south settled this area in the 16th century. Lamaƒç was founded by a Croatian Jan (probably Skerliƒç). It was first mentioned as Krabatendorff (Croatian Village) in 1547 and two years later under its Slavic name Lamas (1549). The village suffered from several epidemics and military conflicts, it was burned, looted by anti-Ottoman armies (1604) and four times during the R√°k√≥czi's War of Independence (1703‚Äì11). The final battle of the Austro-Prussian War took place on 22 July 1866 during which the Prussians again burned down the village. At the end of the 19th century, the village was mostly Slovak (93,3% in 1900). After the World War I, the village became a part of Czechoslovakia and on 1 April 1946 it became a borough of Bratislava.

Dec.8, 2005 The term chimera already referred to an individual organism whose body contained cell populations from different zygotes or an organism that developed from portions of different embryos. In mythology, a chimera is a creature such as a hippogriff or a gryphon formed from parts of different animals, thus the name for these viruses. Chimeric flaviviruses have been created in an attempt to make novel live attenuated vaccines.  As a bioweapon  Combining two pathogenic viruses increases the lethality of the new virus which is why there have been cases where chimeric viruses have been considered for use as a bioweapon. For example, the Soviet Union's Chimera Project attempted to combine DNA from Venezuelan equine encephalitis, smallpox and Ebola virus in the late 1980s. A combination smallpox and monkeypox virus has also been studied.  As a medical treatment  Studies have shown that chimeric viruses can also be developed to have medical benefits. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has recently approved the use of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) to treat relapsed non-Hodgkin Lymphoma. By introducing a chimeric antigen receptor into T cells, the T cells become more efficient at identifying and attacking the tumor cells. Studies are also in progress to create a chimeric vaccine against four types of Dengue virus, however this has not been successful yet.

The loose wire is then catapulted horizontally away from the magnetic field. This occurs due to the Lorentz force acting on the electric current in the wire due to the magnetic field. Implications of the catapult effect on science The idea of the catapult effect is central in our day-to-day lives as it greatly contributes to our understanding of the electric motor (which we use in numerous appliances from washing machines to vacuum cleaners and cars). The catapult effect helps to explain the movement of the motor itself and is thus used widely in science. The left hand rule The left-hand rule helps to explain why the loose wire moves as it does in the catapult effect. The left hand rule naturally takes its name from the left hand anemyl the thumb and the next two fingers. If you arrange the fingers in a three-dimensional shape so the first finger and thumb are perpendicular to one another and the second finger is perpendicular to the first aiming downwards then this is the way magnetic fields with addition of flowing current will act. The thumb represents the direction of motion. The first finger represents the direction of the magnetic field while the second finger represents the direction of the current. Therefore, as long as you know the direction of one of these three variables you will be able to predict the other two using the left hand rule. This is used in electric motors.

He batted and threw right- handed. A native of Columbus, Ohio, Gerber was a fine infielder with quick hands and a fine throwing arm. From 1914 through 1918 he served as a utility player for the Pittsburgh Pirates and St. Louis Browns, becoming the everyday shortstop for the Browns during the next nine seasons. In 1923 Gerber set a major league record for shortstops with 48 fielding chances in four consecutive games. He led the American League in errors in 1919 (45) and 1920 (52), but he settled down to lead the league in double plays four times. Basically a line-drive hitter, his most productive season came in 1923, when he posted career-highs in batting average (.281), runs (85), hits (170), doubles (26), runs batted in (62) and games played (154). That season he was named to the Babe Ruth All-Star team, the year he won notoriety for his \\"$18,000 base hit\\" against the Detroit Tigers, which gave the Browns third place in the American League and a split in the World Series money. He played his final game with the Boston Red Sox in 1929. In a 15-season career, Gerber batted .257 with seven home runs and 476 RBI in 1522 games. A disciplined hitter, he posted a fine 1.302 walk-to-strikeout ratio (465-to-357) in 5,099 at bats. As a shortstop, he recorded 2960 putouts, 4319 assists, 741 double plays, and 439 errors in 7718 chances for a .943 fielding percentage.

It is included in the National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2011‚Äì2015, which categorized it as a general aviation facility and reliever airport for Tulsa International Airport. Jones Airport is one of the busiest in the United States. In 2005, it had 347,000 operations, enough to rank it fourth among general aviation (GA) airports and thirtieth among all airports, according to a 2007 FAA report. It also was the busiest in Oklahoma, outranking both Will Rogers World Airport and Tulsa International.Brockway, p. 40.  History  MD-80 landed at Jones Riverside airport (April 2011) In the 1950s, the city of Tulsa decided to build a second airport to alleviate congestion around Tulsa International Airport. A consulting group hired by the city performed a site selection study. In February, 1955, the group recommended a site on the west side of the Arkansas River, just north of Jenks, Oklahoma. Construction began in 1957. The facility was originally called Riverside Airport, but was renamed in 1978 for Richard Lloyd Jones Jr., late publisher of the Tulsa Tribune.Brockway, p. 39. It opened on July 3, 1958. At that time, the airport had one long runway, an aircraft ramp, and one concrete building. By 1965, there were enough operations to justify building an air traffic control tower. The number of take-offs and landings exceeded 300,000 in 1978. In 1989, the airport installed an instrument landing system (ILS).Brockway, p. 39 Throughout the past fifty years, the airport has grown to become a hub of business and economic activity for the Tulsa region. It now includes three runways, over two hundred commercial and private hangars, and over 500 based aircraft. In 2008, RVS was the fifth busiest general aviation airport in the country. Much of the airport's activity comes directly from its seven flight schools. Including Tulsa Community College Professional Pilot School and Spartan College of Aeronautics and Technology. On 1 April 2011 an MD-80 donated by American Airlines was flown to the airport to replace the aging Boeing 727 then used for training Tulsa Technology Center students.  Facilities and aircraft  Richard Lloyd Jones Jr. Airport covers an area of 664 acres (269 ha) at an elevation of 638 feet (194 m) above mean sea level. It has three runways with asphalt surfaces: 1L/19R is 5,102 by 100 feet (1,555 x 30 m); 1R/19L is 4,208 by 100 feet (1,283 x 30 m); 13/31 is 2,641 by 50 feet (805 x 15 m). are leased to the Tulsa County Board of Commissioners for the operation of South Lakes Golf Course. For the 12-month period ending November 30, 2010, the airport had 209,328 aircraft operations, an average of 573 per day: 99.5% general aviation and 0.5% air taxi. At that time there were 270 aircraft based at this airport: 80% single-engine, 10% multi-engine, 7% jet, and 3% helicopter.  Airport observation area  The airport observation area from across the street In 2009 and again in 2010 the Tulsa Airport Authority held a fundraising golf tournament to create what they called \\"a first-class observation area\\" in an effort to discourage drivers from pulling over on 91st street directly adjacent to the airport to watch the aircraft landing. They initially built six parking spaces outside the fence on the southwest side of the airport. Since the two golf tournaments the Airport Authority has begun to sell brick pavers around the gazebo that will be built on the site and they have begun selling taxiway lights that have been removed and replaced by LED lights, and rewired as LED desk lamps. When complete the observation area will have a gazebo, security guard shack, and restroom. Currently an elevated viewing platform, enlarged airport diagram, and six picnic tables on concrete slabs have been completed and installed. Thus far all the work on the observation area has been completed by Tulsa Airport Authority employees except for the enlarged airport diagram which was completed as part of a Boy Scout Eagle project.

The Byzantine army won the battle, resulting in the disappearance of the Pechenegs as a distinct, independent people. Background In 1091, the Pechenegs invaded the Byzantine Empire and were crushingly defeated by John II's father Alexios I Komnenos (r. 1081‚Äì1118) at the Battle of Levounion. This defeat had meant the elimination of the Pechenegs who had taken part in the expedition as an independent force, as the male survivors were enrolled in the Byzantine army; however, some Pecheneg groups had not been involved in the invasion. Attacked in 1094 by the Cumans, many of the remaining Pechenegs were slain or absorbed. Nevertheless, some bands continued to exercise autonomy. In 1122, Pechenegs from the Pontic steppes invaded the Byzantine Empire by crossing the Danube frontier into Byzantine territory.. According to Michael Angold, it is possible that their invasion took place with the connivance of Vladimir Monomakh (r. 1113‚Äì1125), the ruler of Kiev, given that the Pechenegs had once been his auxiliaries. It is recorded that the remnants of the Oghuz and the Pechenegs had been expelled from Russia in 1121.. The invasion posed a serious threat to Byzantine control over the northern Balkans. Emperor John II Komnenos of Byzantium, determined to meet the invaders in the field and drive them back, transferred his field army from Asia Minor (where it had been engaged against the Seljuk Turks) to Europe, and prepared to march north. Battle Horse-archer in action. North Italian illustration, 10th century. The Byzantine emperor gathered his forces near Constantinople and set out to meet the Pecheneg army as soon as possible. Meanwhile, the Pechenegs had crossed the Haemus Mountains (Balkan Mountains) and encamped near the city of Beroia in Thrace. The emperor at first offered the Pecheneg chiefs presents, offering to grant them a treaty that was favourable to their interests. The Pechenegs were successfully duped by this deception and were therefore taken by surprise when the Byzantines suddenly launched a major attack on their defensive wagon fort, or laager. The Pechenegs fought as waves of horse archers, firing arrows continuously. They relied on their laager as a rallying point, depot for arrow resupply, and a point of last defence. The battle was hard fought, and John was wounded in the leg by an arrow. However, the Byzantines forced the Pechenegs back and penned them in their laager.. This defence proved effective, and it was not until John led the Varangian Guard, the elite heavy infantry force of the Byzantine emperors, against the wagons that their protection was breached. The Varangians, armed with their distinctive Danish axes, hacked their way through the Pecheneg circle of wagons, collapsing the Pecheneg position and causing a general rout in their camp. The Byzantine victory was complete, and the Pecheneg survivors were taken captive and enlisted into the Byzantine army.; . Aftermath Roman amphitheatre in the city of Beroia The Byzantine victory effectively destroyed the Pechenegs as an independent force. For some time, significant communities of Pechenegs remained in Hungary, but eventually the Pechenegs ceased to be a distinct people and were assimilated by neighbouring peoples such as the Bulgarians and Magyars. For the Byzantines, the victory did not immediately lead to peace since the Hungarians attacked Branitshevo, the Byzantine outpost on the Danube, in 1128.. Yet, the victory over the Pechenegs, and later the Hungarians, ensured that much of the Balkan peninsula would remain Byzantine, allowing John to concentrate on extending Byzantine power and influence in Asia Minor and the Holy Land.

K. Foster's XI in 1912. In all he scored 1,021 runs at 12.92 and took ten wickets at 36.90. Collier's first-class debut came against Warwickshire at Worcester in mid-May 1910. He did little with the bat, scoring 10 and 2, and did not bowl. Indeed, he did not send down a single ball in first-class cricket that season. His first wicket, in late May 1911, was that of Oxford University's opener Richard Twining, and he finished with five in the match. He played fairly frequently for Worcestershire over the following three years, turning out in 45 matches between 1911 and 1914. He also played one match for H. K. Foster's XI against Oxford University in 1912, in which he claimed a career-best 3/28 in the first innings.

Rebecca \\"Legs\\" Lawrence Weaver, the main character of the comic, first appeared as supporting character and sparring partner of Nathan Never (#1, Agente Speciale Alfa) in 1991. The main inspiration for the character were films of the Alien series and their main character Ellen Ripley, played by Sigourney Weaver. Initially the setting of the series was to mimic the one of the original Nathan Never series, as such it shares its characters. Its differentiating point was to be a more ironic and funny atmosphere to contrast the deep and involved scenery of Nathan Never. Initially Antonio Serra took care of the comic. He introduced a number of storyline which could be read as a parody of chauvinism versus feminism. After an intermediate period during which Stefano Piani edited the stories, in 2004 a major rework of the series went through. This was in response to a noticeable decline in sales. The attempt was eventually unsuccessful and the series closed with a last episode published on October 2005. Legs is the daughter of a solid middle-class family. During her childhood she suffered from dyslexia and dysmetria. Those conditions contributed to develop a closed and weak personality.

At the Rogers academy Rebecca shows a remarkable talent for weapons and military apparatus, however she is weak in the other subjects. She is helped in those by her roommate, Sybyl Danning. Eventually she will marry Oliver Lawrence, the founder of the academy. Her life turns upside down when she is wrongly convicted of her husband's murder. In jail, Rebecca changes. Sexual abuse and a tough environment shape her into a harder person. It is in jail that Rebecca takes the nickname Legs. She leaves jail thanks to Edwards Reiser, an entrepreneur founder of the Alfa Agency. Reiser was on the lookout for special agent material and manages to get Legs out of jail on condition of joining his agency. At Alfa, Legs will always be temperamental and difficult to deal with, but fair. However, as the story runs we learn that Legs has more depth. She quickly becomes Nathan Never's best friend within the agency. Her life changes when she meets May Frayn. Initially a thief with her two sisters she then joins the Alfa agency. Legs is lesbian. She shares a flat with May for a while, during most of that time they are lovers. However, May cannot reconcile her love of men with her love for Legs. A new woman takes her place in Legs' life: Janet Blaise. Janet closely resembles the character of Lara Croft from Tomb Raider. Despite her deep friendship with Nathan Never, Legs was never involved romantically with him; the only intimacy they share is a French kiss in Nathan Never episode 100. Cancellation Despite the attempts at revamping the series in 2004, Legs did not see a significant increase in sales. The series was cancelled with issue 119, published in October 2005. However, the Legs character did not disappear from the Nathan Never universe and was reintegrated in the series on Nathan Never special issue 16 (December 2006).

Opened in 1895, designed by James Hicks of Redruth and financed by John Passmore Edwards the gallery was conceived as a home and exhibition venue for the Newlyn School of Art the works of which are now largely located at Penlee House Gallery and Museum in nearby Penzance. Following an architectural design competition managed by RIBA Competitions, the gallery was redeveloped and a second venue The Exchange in Penzance, was opened in 2007. With two venues it offers a wide and varied programme across two sites. The focus at Newlyn Art Gallery is on painting and drawing. Artists working in other media continue to be a part of the programme on occasions, but two-dimensional work is the clear focus. Recent shows have included major retrospectives by Roger Hilton and Breon O'Casey. As a dog-friendly venue, dogs on leads are allowed to visit the gallery. At Newlyn Art Gallery, the pavilion on the seaward side of the gallery is a glass structure on the ground-floor level, which supports a first floor clad in wet-laid Cornish slate, a building method specific to the region, but rarely seen in modern buildings. The glass curtain wall allows panoramic views of Newlyn Green and the sea while sliding doors lead to a secluded garden and outdoor seating area. The versatile Lower Gallery presents small exhibitions, projects and events. The Education Room and Studio Cafe on the first floor of the pavilion has a large window offering panoramic views across Mount's Bay, as well as a skylight the length of the gabled ceiling. The Exchange The Exchange was converted from a telephone exchange. It has a large T-shaped gallery, double the size of Newlyn's gallery, which is regularly used as a project space in which artists and curators test new ideas. The Exchange enables audiences to see large-scale work not previously accessible in the region. It is also used as a venue for live performances, film screenings and community events. The Exchange has an undulating glass fa√ßade which runs the entire length of the building, which is a former telephone exchange. A dramatic, changing light display, designed by Penwith- based artist Peter Freeman illuminates the glass panels according to the exhibitions and time of day and year.

He was a morphine and opium addict for most of his life. In his first novel Gourrama, written between 1928 and 1930, he treated his own experiences at the French Foreign Legion. The evening before his wedding day, he suffered a stroke caused by cerebral infarction, and died two days later. Friedrich Glauser's literary estate is archived in the Swiss Literary Archives in Bern. Since 1987, the annual Glauser Prize has been one of the best-known German-language crime writing awards. Stories Portrait photo of Glauser by Gotthard Schuh, Z√ºrcher Illustrierte, vol. 13, no. 49 (December 3, 1937), cover page. The Sergeant Studer detective novels are set in the Switzerland and Europe of the 1930s, and make frequent reference to current European history, such as the Weimar Republic hyperinflation and the banking scams and scandals that marked that period. Today's readers may be surprised that no attention is given to a prominent politician of that era, Adolf Hitler. The novels were written in standard German with a sprinkling of Swiss dialect terms. The translations by Bitter Lemon Press make note of shifts in language register. Jakob Studer is a sergeant in the constabulary of the Canton of Bern. He is old for his rank, having had to start over again in a new police force after being fired from his original force. The firing is mentioned in each novel as being politically motivated, because Studer refused to back off from a full investigation of a banking scandal in which he eventually caught the real criminals, well- connected top people in the banking industry, rather than making do with a few minor players. Other minor characters, notably his cheerful wife and a local attorney with whom Studer plays billiards, play small roles within the books, sometimes helping to solve the mysteries. The Spoke opens at the wedding between Sgt. Jakob Studer's daughter and a young police constable, held at a small hotel run by an old schoolmate of Studer. Before the evening is over, another hotel guest (not a member of the wedding party) has been murdered. The unusual weapon chosen, a sharpened bicycle spoke, leads Studer and the local police to suspect the town's bicycle repairman, a gentle but mentally slow man who was severely abused during childhood. Fever is set roughly a year after The Spoke. Sgt. Studer's daughter has just given birth to a baby boy, and Studer, on assignment in Paris, receives the news from his wife, who has gone to help the young couple with their first child. Studer goes out for celebratory drinks with several of the French gendarmerie with whom he has been working. At the pub, a rather strange White Father joins the group and tells a story of a \\"clairvoyant corporal\\" in a French Foreign Legion battalion to which the priest has been assigned who has \\"predicted\\" the murder of two Swiss women. Upon his return to Switzerland, Studer learns of the two women's deaths and begins an investigation that will take him back through France to Algeria to find the killer. The Chinaman does not contain any clues as to where it fits within the timeline of the other stories. On 18 July (year unspecified), Studer meets an elderly retiree who has returned to the small village where he was born, near Bern, after decades spent working in various parts of Asia. The retiree tells Studer that he is sure he will be murdered very soon. Four months later, on 18 November, the retiree's prediction comes true, shortly after a seemingly unrelated, apparently natural death. After a cooperating witness is murdered, Studer must race to find the murderer before more people are killed.

On that day, 30 aircraft from the Argentine Navy and Air Force strafed and bombed Plaza de Mayo square in Buenos Aires, in what remains to this day the largest aerial bombing ever on the Argentine mainland. The attack targeted the adjacent Casa Rosada, the official seat of government, as a large crowd was expressing support for president Juan Per√≥n. The strike took place during a day of official public demonstrations to condemn the burning of a national flag allegedly carried out by detractors of Per√≥n during the recent procession of Corpus Christi. The action was to be the first step in an eventually aborted coup d'√©tat. The number of identified bodies was put at 308, including six children; an unknown number of victims could not be identified. The absolute disregard for civilian lives and the violence with which the act was carried out has prompted comparisons with the wave of state terrorism during the dictatorship of 1976-1983.  The attack  = Bombing, strafing and ground fighting = At 12:40, a force of thirty Argentine Naval Aviation airplanes, consisting of 22 North American AT-6, five Beechcraft AT-11 and three Consolidated PBY Catalina flying boats, took off from Mor√≥n Air Base. Per√≥n had been warned of the movements beforehand by his Minister of War, Franklin Lucero, who advised him to retreat to a bunker under the Libertador Building. The attack was carried out in the crowded city centre on a weekday with no warning during working hours, hence the many civilian casualties. Occupants of public transport vehicles were among the first recorded victims.¬´Los ataques de los aviones produjeron numerosos da√±os en los edificios, resultando gran cantidad de muertos y heridos entre los transe√∫ntes y ocupantes de autom√≥viles particulares y de transporte colectivo de pasajeros, especialmente en la esquina de Paseo Col√≥n e Hip√≥lito Yrigoyen y frente al Ministerio de Hacienda.¬ª Police report dated 22 June 1955 and relayed by commissioner Rafael C. Pugliese to President Juan Domingo Per√≥n. The first bomb to be dropped fell upon a trolleybus packed with children, killing everyone on board. Meanwhile, two companies of the rebel 4th Marine Infantry Battalion marched towards the Casa Rosada with the intention of capturing it. One of them was deployed 40 m from its northern fa√ßade while the other took position in the Autom√≥vil Club Argentino parking lot, between Col√≥n Park and the Central Post Office, and 100 m from the rear. However, they were repelled from the inside by members of the Regiment of Mounted Grenadiers and from the outside by Army troops marching from the sector of the Ministry of Finance, under the command of General Lucero. The defense of the Casa Rosada consisted of a mere two 12.7 mm Browning M2 machine guns placed on the roof, while defenders in the lower floors used various small arms, including bolt- action Mauser 1909 rifles. Loyalist troops were accompanied by Peronist civilians who took up arms.56 years Bombardment in the Plaza de Mayo At 13:12, union leader H√©ctor Hugo Di Pietro, acting head of the CGT due to the absence of its Secretary-General, spoke on national broadcasting calling all workers in the Federal District and Greater Buenos Aires to concentrate immediately around the CGT building to defend the constitutional government. Moreover, union officials were already mobilizing workers from factories around Buenos Aires towards the city center. Per√≥n ordered his adjutant, major Jose Ignacio Cialceta, to inform Di Pietro that a clash strictly between soldiers was taking place and therefore no civilian was to gather in Plaza de Mayo. Historian Joseph Page claimed, citing a report originating from the US Embassy as his source, that this order was not given until 16:00. Consequently, the bulk of the civilian casualties occurred when the mobilized workers arrived in Plaza de Mayo in huge numbers to defend the presidency of Juan Per√≥n when Gloster Meteor fighters suddenly arrived to bomb and strafe the large crowds of peronist supporters reported to be exiting the central subway entrances, and gathering in nearby streets and immediate vicinity of the presidential palace, killing and wounded hundreds in the process.Di Pietro, Secretario General de la CGT, convoc√≥ a los trabajadores a defender el gobierno. Los cit√≥ en la Plaza de Mayo. Lo hizo por radio, por cadena nacional. Unos minutos antes, los rebeldes hab√≠an tomado Radio Mitre. Desde all√≠ emitieron una proclama en la que, entre otras cosas, dec√≠an que ¬´el Tirano ha muerto¬ª. R√°pidamente, la proclama fue desmentida. Una segunda oleada de bombardeos. Esta vez eran los Gloster Meteor. Los objetivos hab√≠an cambiado. Las bombas ya no cayeron sobre la Casa Rosada. La Plaza de Mayo, las bocas de subte y las avenidas aleda√±as fueron los objetivos. Ya hab√≠an empezado a llegar trabajadores citados imprudentamente por Di Pietro a la Plaza. Los trabajadores furiosos se dirigieron al Ministerio de Marina y lo atacaron a pedradas. Desde dentro, los rebeldes atrincherados les respondieron a los tiros. Segu√≠a increment√°ndose la lista de bajas. La multitud vociferaba. En el Ministerio, los l√≠deres rebeldes estaban sentados en el suelo: no quedaban ventanas con vidrios. Olivieri le pregunt√≥ a uno de sus asistentes qu√© gritaba la gente. ¬´La vida por Per√≥n¬ª, le contestaron. Olivieri, el que hab√≠a iniciado el d√≠a mostr√°ndose prescindente, el hombre de confianza del Presidente en la marina, contest√≥: ¬´Vamos a darles el gusto¬ª. Las r√°fagas de ametralladora arreciaron. La gente corr√≠a despavorida. Muchos cayeron. Una √©pica de los √∫ltimos instantes: Tratado de adioses. Epitafios. Estertores. Suspiros. Gestos postreros y palabras, Mat√≠as Bauso, p. 122, Grupo Editorial Argentina, 2012 According to Police Commissioner Rafael C. Pugliese, a police observation post reported at 14:00 large numbers of civilians arriving in trucks to defend the Presidential Palace and gathering in and around the Paseo Col√≥n and Belgrano pedestrian walkways, before being caught out in the open when the main air attacks took place at 15:00, with the Gloster Meteors strafing the survivors as they pulled up from their final dive bombing attacks and headed back to base.A la hora 14.10 se recibe comunicaci√≥n telef√≥nica del personal de observaci√≥n, de que en Paseo Col√≥n y Belgrano se iba reuniendo numerosos civiles, que llegaban en camiones principalmente, advirti√©ndose densa humareda en las inmediaciones de la Casa del Gobierno... Cuando las informaciones generales indicaban que las fuerzas leales se hallaban cercando el reducto de los insurgentes en el Ministerio de Marina y que hasta las √∫ltimas habr√≠an enarbolado bandera blanca de rendici√≥n, a la hora 15.00 sorpresivamente aparecen nuevos aviones que bombardean la Casa del Gobierno e inmediaciones, para luego ametrallar la misma zona en distintas evoluciones, causando gran cantidad de v√≠ctimas personales y graves da√±os materiales. Diseminados quedaron numerosos cad√°veres de civiles, quienes encontraron la muerte mientras intentaban buscar refugio en los edificios contra las bombas y metralla. Los aviones se alejan, siempre ametrallando en picada, suponi√©ndose que volver√≠an luego de reabastecerse de proyectiles. Informe Policial, fechado el 22 de junio de 1955 y remitido por el comisario Rafael C. Pugliese al Presidente Juan Domingo Per√≥n The rebel ground offensive started to lose steam by 15:00. The marines surrounding the Casa Rosada's northern fa√ßade came under fire from army artillery units positioned in a building located at the intersection of Leandro N. Alem and Viamonte streets. Olivieri contacted the Higher School of Mechanics of the Navy in the hope of gaining reinforcements. However, it was already surrounded by elements of the 1st Infantry Regiment. The marines retreated in disarray towards the Ministry of the Navy, where they would remain besieged by loyal Army units until the end of hostilities. Lucero ordered the use of heavy machine guns against the rebels, and 81 mm mortars were brought in to reinforce the assault. At 15:17, after two telephone conversations between Olivieri and Lucero, the rebels waved a white flag from the Ministry of the Navy, but when generals Carlos Wirth and Juan Jos√© Valle arrived to communicate with the rebels, a second wave of bombings began. The attack destroyed two floors of the south wing of the building, killing a soldier and a general. At the same time, a Sherman tank fired on the second floor, causing a fire in the admirals' room. Simultaneously, civilian commandos under Zavala Ortiz's orders began clashing with the police and sniping from the roofs of various buildings. During the afternoon, rebel reinforcements coming from the Central Post building repeatedly tried to break the siege on the Ministry of the Navy, without success. = Aerial combat = As ground combat raged in the center of Buenos Aires, the loyal forces ordered the Mor√≥n Air Base to intercept rebel fighters. The pilots were in heated discussions over whether to join the coup or not. A squad of loyal Gloster Meteors took off and one of them shot down a rebel AT-6 over the R√≠o de la Plata, scoring the first air-to-air kill of the Argentine Air Force. Another rebel warplane was downed by fire from hastily mounted anti-aircraft batteries. However, Mor√≥n Air Base fell into rebel hands and the loyal pilots were captured upon landing. Their Meteors were seized and pressed into service by anti-peronist forces, participating in strafing sorties until the final surrender. At the last moment, with the coup on the verge of failure, the warplanes launched a second attack on the seat of government. Having run out of ordnance, one pilot dropped his auxiliary fuel tank as an ersatz incendiary bomb, which fell on the cars in a parking lot near the Casa Rosada. = Retreat and surrender = After heavy urban fighting, which included a false surrender incident, the besieged rebels finally opted for handing over the Ministry of the Navy to the Army units posted outside. Fire ceased at 17:20 local time. Between 9.5 and 13.8 tonnes of ordnance were dropped, killing between 150 and 364 people,Bombas sobre Buenos Aires: Gestaci√≥n y desarollo del bombardeo a√©reo sobre la Plaza de Mayo del 16 de junio de 1955, Daniel E.

Nine members of the Mounted Grenadiers presidential guard and five police officers were killed in action.Alfredo Aulicino, Rodolfo Nieto, Jos√© Mar√≠a Bacalja, Ram√≥n Alderete and C√©sar Augusto Puchulu, according to page 4 of the Clar√≠n newspaper from 18 June 1955. Faced with the failure of the intended coup (as neither the Army nor the bulk of the Air Force had joined in), the rebel pilots received orders to fly towards Uruguay and request asylum. Around thirty warplanes headed towards Carrasco Airport, using up their ammunition by strafing anything that moved along the way. Some pilots did not reach Uruguay, having used up all their fuel during the attack sorties, and crash-landed in the R√≠o de la Plata or the fields of Carmelo, Uruguay. At 03:00 on 17 June, the leaders of the ill-fated coup, Olivieri, Toranzo Calder√≥n and Gargiulo were informed they were to be tried under martial law and were each offered a pistol to end their lives, which Olivieri and Toranzo Calder√≥n declined. At 05:45, just before dawn, Gargiulo committed suicide in his office.  Aftermath  Bullet-ridden outer wall of the Ministry of Economy, pictured in 2009. In the night, angry Peronist crowds burned eight churches, two basilicas and the Curia office in revenge due to the Catholic Church's support for the coup. The police and fire service did not intervene. In September of that year, the bulk of the armed forces joined in a coup de etat known as the Revoluci√≥n Libertadora, which overthrew president Per√≥n and started a period of military dictatorship that ended with the 1958 presidential elections, won by Arturo Frondizi of the UCRI. The Peronist party was not allowed to stand for election, but Frondizi's victory was influenced by a pact between Per√≥n and Frondizi. One of the rebel leaders, radical Miguel √Ångel Zavala Ortiz, went on to serve as an official during the Revoluci√≥n Libertadora dictatorship and was later appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs and Worship by radical President Arturo Illia in 1963. One of the naval pilots who took part in the bombings, M√°ximo Rivero Kelly was promoted and was second-in-command of the Argentine Navy during the presidency of Ra√∫l Alfons√≠n. He would later claim that the naval aviation's target was the presidential palace but that one aircraft missed, causing about 20 civilian deaths. Bullet and shrapnel marks remained visible on some buildings on the south side of the square as of 2020.  Casualties  Peronist sources claimed those killed to be around 400. In 1965, a journalist from ‚ÄúExtra‚Äù magazine, claimed that once the fighting had ended in the immediate vicinity of Plaza de Mayo there lay two thousand killed.A 61 A√ëOS DEL BOMBARDEO DE LA MAS√ìNICA REVOLUCI√ìN \\"LIBERTADORA\\" On 22 June 1955, Commissioner Rafael C.

It was released by Five Star Production. A sequel in name only to a 2004 film Art of the Devil, this film is about a teacher, named Aajaan Panor (portrayed by Napakpapha Nakprasitte), who is humiliated by some students. She turns to black magic to exact revenge. Plot Two years ago, six school friends ‚Äì Ta, Kim, Por, Tair, Noot, and Ko ‚Äì were faced with a grudge. Ta's mother died when he was young, and his father remarried Ta's teacher, Miss Panor. Kim was his girlfriend (but is now dating Por). The boyish Tair and stylish Noot might be lovers (though this is never made clear), and Ko is their fun-loving friend. During their last year at school, Miss Panor seduces Por (though this is not known to his friends). Por subsequently discovers he's not the only one in her bed. In addition to being married to Ta's father, Miss Panor is also having an affair with the sports coach. Fuelled by jealousy, Por suggests filming Panor and the coach to 'prove her infidelity' to Ta's father. The friends, save for Kim, do so, and broadcast it to the entire school. The coach soon discovers it was them and holds the group at gunpoint while he sexually abuses them. Seeking revenge, the students approach a Shaman who agrees to curse the coach. A few days later, Por goes back to the shaman and asks him to curse Miss Panor, too. The coach dies in which numerous fish hooks appear from his body. Miss Panor, who is embarrassed at her sexual exploits being revealed, is found stabbing herself repeatedly in the legs. She subsequently becomes a recluse, returning home to her cottage on the river, away from the city. In the present, the six friends gather together after Ta's father commits suicide in order to head to the remote village and pay their respects to Miss Panor. Upon arrival at Panor's cottage on the river, Noot's cell phone rings; her uncle wants her to return because her father is in the hospital, so she makes her goodbyes and heads back to the city. Miss Panor is a polite hostess (if a little distant), and Ta's great-grandmother seems harmless enough, though he warns everyone that she is a bit senile. As the group stays at the cottage, Kim experiences some strange occurrences around it such as, the door moving on its own, a white figure appearing underwater, and seeing Ta's great-grandmother devouring a cat. Miss Panor retires to a secret hut in the jungle, where she has several corpses gathered round, all of them sitting at desks, like students. Each corpse has a photo attached to it, indicating which former student it represents. At dinner that night, as the friends eat the soup Panor has made for them, each student spits out something: Ko spits up a fingernail, Por spits up a piece of tongue with a piercing on it, Kim spits up an eye contact lens and Tair an eyeball. The group realizes that the meat, which is actually the dismembered body parts in the soup is, in fact, Noot. They search the cottage for Miss Panor. Kim finds a video camera with a tape that shows Miss Panor killing and cannibalizing the shaman who cursed her, and then rushing towards the camera with a tree branch raised and bringing it down on whomever is holding the camera. Tair begins to have hallucinations of corpses shambling around everywhere. The group flees the house and sees a light outside. They call to the boat for help, but it drives past them. The driver takes a fatal fall from the boat after seeing Miss Panor coming towards him from the other side, which sinks. Kim tumbles into the water and has a vision of Panor and Ta's father. In the vision, Panor is shown torturing Ta's father by ripping off his toenails, on the premise that if she hobbles him, he can't leave her. When Panor leaves the room, Ta's father shoots himself in the head. Kim relates this to the others, and they find the gun. In the same room, there are also some jars filled with pickled mangoes. In one of these jars, the group finds Ta's dead father. The group runs to the house's dusty old shrine to hide and pray. Tair has a laughing fit and is temporarily possessed by Miss Panor. Ko threatens Tair with the gun, but suddenly starts to writhe and flail as dozens of salamanders claw their way out of his body, killing him. The youths now decide to split up: Por and Ta go off into the jungle to find Panor, leaving Kim and Tair sitting outside the shrine, with Tair (now free of possession) still seeing visions of corpses. She panics and runs off, and Kim follows into the dense jungle. The boys hear Kim fall down. They run to find her, but are separated. Ta finds Kim and wrenches a piece of metal from her leg. Alone, Por has creepy visions of Panor. Ta leaves Kim to look for Por. Tair bursts from the jungle, cowering away from her visions. After seeing Kim as a walking corpse and in hysterics, Tair rips out her own eyes. Por finds Kim, who appears to him as Miss Panor, taunting him about their love affair. Firing the gun at Kim, but Ta rescues her just in time. Por runs off into the jungle and discovers Panor chanting in her secret hut. Por flees, but a vision of Panor appears, hamstrings him, and starts pulling out his teeth; Por crawls away and confesses that he had a love spell placed on Panor causing her to seduce him, became jealous when he found out she was also sleeping with the coach and took part in filming them and then placing a pain-inducing curse on Panor as punishment. Suddenly, his vision clears and he sees Kim and Ta. Kim is repulsed by Por's confession; she and Ta leave Por in the jungle. Miss Panor arrives, ties up Por, and takes him to her secret hut. She stabs him in the neck with a syringe full of a paralytic agent, then pours boiling water down his throat and slowly burns every inch of his skin with a blowtorch. In the jungle, Ta is carrying Kim on his back. She begs him to continue without her, but he refuses. The two of them come across a small shrine, on which is hanging Noot's bag. Her cell phone rings: it's her uncle, wondering where she is. In the secret jungle hut, Miss Panor is performing CPR on fatally burned Por in order to inflict more torture on him. Meanwhile, police officers converge outside the hut. As Miss Panor starts to use a power drill on Por's head, the officers break in and shoot her. Kim is rushed to a hospital. She recovers, and Ta comes to visit her. As they chat, the TV in Kim's room broadcasts a news show, which reports that the five students who visited Miss Panor are dead. Also discovered in the secret hut was Ta's charred corpse. In horror, Kim turns to see that Ta is actually a badly burned, walking corpse. He never went with them to visit Miss Panor; he was already dead by then. As he pets Kim's hand, Ta explains: the video of Panor eating the shaman was taken by Ta's father, who had threatened divorce after witnessing the tape of her and the coach. For this, Panor tortured him and he killed himself. Panor locked Ta's great-grandmother in a closet and left her to starve. It was Ta's great-grandmother who had told Panor that in order to break the spells placed on her she had to kill the shaman that was paid to perform them and eat his flesh. She also warned Panor that it could drive her insane (it does). It also becomes clear that the coach had also placed a love spell on Panor to instigate their affair just like Por did. Miss Panor was the victim of all these spells. Her attempt to free herself and seek revenge led her into insanity. She tortured Ta in all the ways that will be experienced by his friends. Ta's vengeful spirit had lured the group there so they could feel the pain that he went through. He only saved Kim from being killed because he still loves her. A flashback of their days in school returned. Kim and a classmate had a crush on Ta. Kim makes a bet with her classmate that if Ta doesn't court Kim within a week, she will \\"offer\\" Ta to her. Kim was then seen with the shaman who appeared earlier, who warns her, \\"Once you start, it will follow you till you die.\\" She receives a clay doll and thanks the shaman. The film ends with Kim jumps out of the hospital window to her death, holding the clay doll. Ta's burnt form lies beside her declaring his love for her. Nominations Napakpapha (better known in Thailand as Mamee) was a nominee for best actress for the Bangkok Critics Assembly's 2005 awards. She was also nominated as best supporting actress for the Thailand National Film Awards. This nomination was protested by Mamee and Five Star Production, who asserted that Mamee should have been nominated in the best actress category.

In finite dimensions, these are dual objects: the dual vector space to a Lie algebra naturally has the structure of a Lie coalgebra, and conversely. Definition Let E be a vector space over a field k equipped with a linear mapping d\\\\colon E \\\\to E \\\\wedge E from E to the exterior product of E with itself. It is possible to extend d uniquely to a graded derivation (this means that, for any a, b ‚àà E which are homogeneous elements, d(a \\\\wedge b) = (da)\\\\wedge b + (-1)^{\\\\operatorname{deg} a} a \\\\wedge(db)) of degree 1 on the exterior algebra of E: :d\\\\colon \\\\bigwedge^\\\\bullet E\\\\rightarrow \\\\bigwedge^{\\\\bullet+1} E. Then the pair (E, d) is said to be a Lie coalgebra if d2 = 0, i.e., if the graded components of the exterior algebra with derivation (\\\\bigwedge^* E, d) form a cochain complex: :E\\\\ \\\\rightarrow^{\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!d}\\\\ E\\\\wedge E\\\\ \\\\rightarrow^{\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!d}\\\\ \\\\bigwedge^3 E\\\\rightarrow^{\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!d}\\\\ \\\\dots =Relation to de Rham complex= Just as the exterior algebra (and tensor algebra) of vector fields on a manifold form a Lie algebra (over the base field K), the de Rham complex of differential forms on a manifold form a Lie coalgebra (over the base field K). Further, there is a pairing between vector fields and differential forms. However, the situation is subtler: the Lie bracket is not linear over the algebra of smooth functions C^\\\\infty(M) (the error is the Lie derivative), nor is the exterior derivative: d(fg) = (df)g + f(dg) eq f(dg) (it is a derivation, not linear over functions): they are not tensors. They are not linear over functions, but they behave in a consistent way, which is not captured simply by the notion of Lie algebra and Lie coalgebra. Further, in the de Rham complex, the derivation is not only defined for \\\\Omega^1 \\\\to \\\\Omega^2, but is also defined for C^\\\\infty(M) \\\\to \\\\Omega^1(M). The Lie algebra on the dual A Lie algebra structure on a vector space is a map [\\\\cdot,\\\\cdot]\\\\colon \\\\mathfrak{g}\\\\times\\\\mathfrak{g}\\\\to\\\\mathfrak{g} which is skew-symmetric, and satisfies the Jacobi identity. Equivalently, a map [\\\\cdot,\\\\cdot]\\\\colon \\\\mathfrak{g} \\\\wedge \\\\mathfrak{g} \\\\to \\\\mathfrak{g} that satisfies the Jacobi identity. Dually, a Lie coalgebra structure on a vector space E is a linear map d\\\\colon E \\\\to E \\\\otimes E which is antisymmetric (this means that it satisfies \\\\tau \\\\circ d = -d , where \\\\tau is the canonical flip E \\\\otimes E \\\\to E \\\\otimes E ) and satisfies the so-called cocycle condition (also known as the co-Leibniz rule) : \\\\left(d\\\\otimes \\\\mathrm{id}\\\\right)\\\\circ d = \\\\left(\\\\mathrm{id}\\\\otimes d\\\\right)\\\\circ d+\\\\left(\\\\mathrm{id} \\\\otimes \\\\tau\\\\right)\\\\circ\\\\left(d\\\\otimes \\\\mathrm{id}\\\\right)\\\\circ d . Due to the antisymmetry condition, the map d\\\\colon E \\\\to E \\\\otimes E can be also written as a map d\\\\colon E \\\\to E \\\\wedge E. The dual of the Lie bracket of a Lie algebra \\\\mathfrak g yields a map (the cocommutator) :[\\\\cdot,\\\\cdot]^*\\\\colon \\\\mathfrak{g}^* \\\\to (\\\\mathfrak{g} \\\\wedge \\\\mathfrak{g})^* \\\\cong \\\\mathfrak{g}^* \\\\wedge \\\\mathfrak{g}^* where the isomorphism \\\\cong holds in finite dimension; dually for the dual of Lie comultiplication. In this context, the Jacobi identity corresponds to the cocycle condition. More explicitly, let E be a Lie coalgebra over a field of characteristic neither 2 nor 3. The dual space E* carries the structure of a bracket defined by :Œ±([x, y]) = dŒ±(x‚àßy), for all Œ± ‚àà E and x,y ‚àà E*. We show that this endows E* with a Lie bracket. It suffices to check the Jacobi identity. For any x, y, z ‚àà E* and Œ± ‚àà E, :\\\\begin{align} d^2\\\\alpha (x\\\\wedge y\\\\wedge z) &= \\\\frac{1}{3} d^2\\\\alpha(x\\\\wedge y\\\\wedge z + y\\\\wedge z\\\\wedge x + z\\\\wedge x\\\\wedge y) \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\frac{1}{3} \\\\left(d\\\\alpha([x, y]\\\\wedge z) + d\\\\alpha([y, z]\\\\wedge x) +d\\\\alpha([z, x]\\\\wedge y)\\\\right), \\\\end{align} where the latter step follows from the standard identification of the dual of a wedge product with the wedge product of the duals. Finally, this gives :d^2\\\\alpha (x\\\\wedge y\\\\wedge z) = \\\\frac{1}{3} \\\\left(\\\\alpha( x, y], z]) + \\\\alpha( y, z], x])+\\\\alpha( z, x], y])\\\\right). Since d2 = 0, it follows that :\\\\alpha( x, y], z] + y, z], x] + z, x], y]) = 0, for any Œ±, x, y, and z. Thus, by the double-duality isomorphism (more precisely, by the double-duality monomorphism, since the vector space needs not be finite-dimensional), the Jacobi identity is satisfied. In particular, note that this proof demonstrates that the cocycle condition d2 = 0 is in a sense dual to the Jacobi identity.

Its members are 60 national associations of towns, municipalities and regions from 41 countries that are part of the Council of Europe. Together these associations represent about 130,000 local and regional authorities. At the head of its political structure is its president, currently the president of the region Emilia- Romagna, Stefano Bonaccini. It has a staff of about 30, headed by its secretary-general, Fr√©d√©ric Vallier. CEMR‚Äôs annual budget is about ‚Ç¨2.5 million. Membership fees from its national associations make up the bulk of its funding. About 15% are paid by the European Commission through an annual grant. The organisation has also assumed the function of the European section of the new worldwide organisation United Cities and Local Governments. History CEMR logo (1970's-2012) CEMR was founded in Geneva on 28 January 1951 by a group of European mayors as Council of European Municipalities (CEM). Regions were later allowed to join as well, hence the later name Council of European Municipalities and Regions. =CEMR Presidency= Stefano Bonaccini, president of the region Emilia-Romagna, has been elected President of CEMR in December 2016. He is notably succeeding: * √ç√±igo de la Serna, former Mayor of Santander, CEMR President from 2015 to 2016 * Annemarie Jorritsma, former Mayor of Almere, CEMR President from 2013 to 2015 * Wolfgang Schuster, former Mayor of Stuttgart, CEMR President from 2010 to 2013 * Michael H√§upl, Mayor of Vienna, CEMR President from 2004 to 2010. * Val√©ry Giscard d'Estaing, CEMR President from 1997 to 2004 Activities CEMR's task is to promote a united Europe, based on locally and regionally autonomous government and democracy. To this end, it endeavours to shape the future of Europe by enhancing local and regional contributions, to influence European law and policy, to exchange experience at the local and regional levels and to cooperate with partners in other parts of the world. European legislation affects more than 60% of the policies implemented by cities, municipalities and regions. CEMR works together with its members to ensure that their interests are taken into account when European policy is being drafted. CEMR is active in a number of political fields, including regional policy, transport, the environment, equal opportunities and governance. Its committees and working groups seek to influence draft EU legislation in order that the interests and concerns of local and regional authorities are taken into account from the earliest stages of the EU legislative process. =Fields of activity= CEMR‚Äôs work focuses on five thematic areas, which affect all aspects of the lives of European citizens as well as the local and regional authorities that represent them: * Governance, democracy and citizenship * Environment, climate and energy * International engagement and cooperation * Local and regional public services * Economic, social and territorial cohesion CEMR is also deeply involved in building an extensive European town twinning network. Today, there are over 30,000 twinning projects linking towns from all over Europe. This process is improved through CEMR's close cooperation with the DG Education and Culture of the European Commission. Last but not least, CEMR is behind several political documents of significance to local and regional governance, such as the Charter of Local Liberties (adopted in 1953), which inspired the Charter on Local Self-Government of the Council of Europe, adopted in 1985. It also launched the European Charter for Equality of Women and Men in Local Life, which was adopted in 2006 and has been signed by more than 1,800 local and regional governments in Europe. Gender equality In May 2006 CEMR launched the European charter for equality of women and men in local life. Local and regional governments are invited to sign the charter to make a formal public commitment to the principle of equality between men and women and to implement the charter within their territory. The Charter is now available in 27 languages and is signed by more than 1,800 municipalities and regions from 36 European countries. In order to monitor the implementation of the Charter by signatories, CEMR, in partnership with the Swedish government and the Swedish Association of Local Authorities and Regions, launched an Observatory of the European Charter for equality of women and men in Local Life in March 2012. Town twinning According to CEMR town twinning has always been a vital way to bring Europe closer to its citizens beyond national boundaries. In May 2007, CEMR organised a conference on Twinning for tomorrow's world in Rhodes. Over 600 representatives of local governments from across Europe met to discuss issues like new types of twinning; obtaining financial support; and how twinning can contribute to social inclusion. In September 2011, CEMR is organising in Rybnik (Poland) a European congress on citizenship and twinning. It will provide participants with the possibility to discover the next generation of partnerships between local and regional governments and their citizens; explore how to foster the development of a more \\"grassroots democracy\\" and to participate in a consultation on citizenship.

A poor batsman, Conway scored just 165 runs in 52 innings (batting average 4.34), with a highest score of only 20 not out. He acted as scorer at least once, for Worcestershire's game against Warwickshire at Dudley in 1913. On this occasion the other scorer was Chicko Austin, who scored in almost 500 first-class games.

He worked in Amsterdam and the Dutch East Indies. Biography Cuypers was trained in the architectural practice of his uncle Pierre Cuypers and in 1881 set up his own office in Amsterdam. His good contacts with businessmen earned him commissions for offices, shops and houses. In spite of his training by his uncle, the country's major architect of neo-Gothic, his work was closely related to Neo-renaissance and Jugendstil. Although he designed several churches, unlike his uncle and his cousin Joseph Cuypers, Eduard did not confine himself solely to ecclesiastical architecture. Instead, he designed a few dozen railway stations, which were mostly built in the north of the country, several hospitals and more than hundred housing projects in the Netherlands. Eduard Cuypers and his employees also designed pieces of furniture and other objects for interiors, such as lamps. In 1905 Cuypers published Het Huis, Oud & Nieuw (The House, Old and New), a magazine for interior design that was published until he died in 1927. He was buried at Zorgvlied cemetery. The office of Eduard Cuypers is considered as the origin of the Amsterdam School because the leaders of this style, Michel de Klerk, Johan van der Mey and Piet Kramer, were all trained there. Berend Tobia Boeyinga, one of the most important followers of the Amsterdam school, also worked for Ed.Cuypers for a while - as did the prominent Indonesian architect Liem Bwan Tjie. After Cuypers died in 1927, his office was continued by others. The current name in the Netherlands is A/D Amstel Architects in Amsterdam. =Dutch East Indies= Cuypers opened an agency in the Dutch East Indies to work on major projects such as the headquarters and branch office of De Javasche Bank in Indonesia. With Marius J. Hulswit and Arthur Fermont, Cuypers opened the largest architectural agency in the East Indies, then called Hulswit-Fermont, Batavia and Ed.Cuypers, Amsterdam. After Cuypers died in 1927, his office in Batavia/Jakarta was continued by others under the name Fermont-Cuypers till 1957.

It was written by Frank Deese and directed by Christopher Cain. It was filmed in Oakland, California and at Northgate High School in nearby Walnut Creek and distributed by TriStar Pictures on Panavision. Belushi reprised his role as Rick Latimer in the 1991 film Abraxas, Guardian of the Universe. Plot Rick Latimer (Jim Belushi) is a high-school teacher with a drinking problem. Spotting his ex-wife Kimberly (Sharon Thomas Cain) in a bar one night, Rick gets into a fight with the man she is with, culminating in his beating the hapless man's car with a baseball bat. The board of education finds that Rick's behavior is reflecting poorly on the school district's image. They unanimously decide to transfer him to another school, in another district: Brandel High, a crime-ridden and gang- dominated institution, where he is made the new principal. Initially, Rick is under the impression that this move is a promotion for him ‚Äî but he soon comes to realize that it is actually a punishment, because he is viewed as being as lost, incorrigible, & hopeless as the students of ‚ÄúBrand X‚Äù (the nickname that everyone derisively uses to refer to the school). Believing he can repair his image by cleaning up the school, Rick attempts to have an assembly to declare his intentions: \\"No more.\\" No more drugs, running in the hallways or being late to class. While he's giving his speech, Victor Duncan (Michael Wright), the leader of the main gang in the school, walks in, derides Rick in front of everyone, then walks out, which eventually results in a small riot, which earns Rick the enmity of not only the teachers but also school head of security Jake (Louis Gossett Jr.). Eventually, Rick manages to enforce his policy of getting rid of the drugs being dealt in the bathrooms and clearing out the hallways ‚Äî but not always with success. Because the students are now forced to go to class, some of the more unruly students become increasingly disruptive, including White Zac (J.J. Cohen), who eventually attempts to rape one of the teachers, Ms. Orozco (Rae Dawn Chong), with whom Rick is beginning to form a close friendship. She is able to throw a chair out the window, alerting Rick, who was talking with Arturo (Jacob Vargas), who has a crush on Ms. Orozco. Rick rides his motorcycle into the school and chases down White Zac, who he leaves in a trash can after beating him unconscious. Victor, meanwhile, continues to assert his influence on the school, going so far as to brutally beat a former member of his gang and hang him by his ankles when the member warms to Rick and actually starts learning. After a confrontation in the lunch room, Victor threatens Rick, telling him that if he shows up the next day, he's going home in a body bag. Rick scoffs and walks away as Victor continues to threaten him. The next day, after classes have been dismissed, Victor and his crew show up and sneak into the school. Jake goes to chain the doors, and while attempting to call the cops, Rick discovers that Victor's crew has cut the phone lines. A game of cat and mouse ensues. Rick hides in the girls' shower room with a baseball bat, waiting for Victor. However, Victor and Jojo (Reggie Johnson) get the drop on him. While holding Rick at gunpoint, Victor gives Jojo the order to cut him. Jojo refuses, telling Victor that killing Rick would bring down the crew. Victor shoots him in the head, killing him, and is about to shoot Rick as well when Arturo intervenes, striking Victor with Rick's baseball bat. The distraction leads to a showdown in the school halls between Victor and Rick, with Victor seemingly having the upper hand until Rick overpowers him. Rick beats Victor, much to the shock of the rest of the school who witness the beating. Several students cheer Rick on, much to the chagrin of Victor's gang members. After a small fight breaks out Rick again declares, \\"No more!\\" Victor is taken away in a police car, and as a student derisively asks, \\"Hey man, who the hell do you think you are?\\", Rick responds \\"I'm the principal, man!\\" and rides away on his motorcycle.

It was the central board of finance in the Papal administrative system and at one time was of great importance in the government of the States of the Church, and in the administration of justice, led by the Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church. History Since the middle of the 12th century the Papal chamberlain (') was a regular member of the Curia, entrusted with the financial management of the papal court. At that early period the income of the papal treasury came chiefly from many kinds of census, dues, and tributes paid in from the territory subject to the Pope, and from churches and monasteries immediately dependent on him. Cencius Camerarius (later Pope Honorius III, 1216-27) made in 1192 a new inventory of all these sources of papal revenue, known as the Liber Censuum. The previous list dated back to Gelasius I (492-496) and Gregory I (590-604), and was based on lists of the incomes accruing from the patrimonies, or landed property of the Roman Church. In the 13th century the Apostolic Camera entered on a new phase of development. The collection of the crusade taxes, regularly assessed after the time of Innocent III (1198-1216), imposed new duties on the papal treasury, to which were committed both the collection and distribution of these assessments. Moreover, during the course of this century the system of payment in kind was transformed into the monetary system, a process considerably influenced by the administration of the papal finances. The servitia communia of bishops and abbots (see Annates) were regulated at fixed sums. The income regularly yielded by them to the Curia is by no means small. To these were to be added the annates, taken in the narrower sense, especially the great universal reservations made since the time of Clement V and John XXII, the extraordinary subsidies, moreover, levied since the end of the thirteenth century, the census, and other assessments. The duties of the Apostolic Camera were thus constantly enlarged. For the collection of all these moneys it employed henceforth a great number of agents known as collectores. With time the importance of this central department of finance became more marked. The highest administrative officers were always the chamberlain (camerarius) and the treasurer (thesaurarius) ‚Äî the former regularly a bishop, the latter often of the same rank. Next in order came the clerics of the Camera (clerici camer√¶), originally three or four, afterwards as many as ten. Next to these was the judge (auditor) of the Camera. The two first-named formed with the clerics of the Camera its highest administrative council; they controlled and looked closely to both revenues and expenses. In their service were a number of inferior officials, notaries, scribes, and messengers. The more absolute system of ruling the Church which developed after the beginning of the 16th century, as well as the gradual transformation in the financial administration, modified in many ways the duties of the Apostolic Camera. The Camerarius (camerlengo, chamberlain) became one of the highest officers in the government of the Papal States, until the beginning of the 19th century, when new methods of administration called for other officials. In 1870 what remained of the Papal States was annexed to the Kingdom of Italy and ceased to exist, replaced by the diminutive Vatican City: the Apostolic Camera ceased almost entirely to exercise any practical influence on the papal administration, and the income of the papal treasury since chiefly derived from Peter's-pence and other donations contributed by the faithful, the Camera lost its practical importance as a board of finance, for the revenue known as Peter's-pence is managed by a special commission. The officials who since constituted the camera ‚Äî the cardinal-camerlengo, the vice-camerlengo, the auditor, the general treasurer (an office unoccupied since 1870) and seven cameral clerics ‚Äî hold in reality quasi-honorary offices. Officials The Officials of the Apostolic Camera are: *The Cardinal-Camerlengo enters upon his chief duties on the occasion of a vacancy in the Holy See, during which time he is invested with a portion of the papal authority. *The Vice- Camerlengo, one of the highest prelates of the Roman Curia, was until 1870 governor of Rome, and was charged with the maintenance of peace and order in the city; during a vacancy in the Papal See he is even yet first in authority after the cardinals, and entrusted with the surveillance of the conclave, to which no one is admitted without his permission. *The Auditor-General of the Camera, also one of the highest prelates, used to be the chief judge in all cases concerning the financial administration of the Curia. Before 1870 he presided over the supreme court, to which the Pope referred the most important questions for decision. On Wednesday, February 13, 2013, Pope Benedict XVI appointed Bishop Giuseppe Sciacca, Secretary General of the Governorate of Vatican City State, to serve as Auditor-General of the Camera in addition to his duties as Secretary General of the Governorate.http://www.microsofttranslator.com/bv.aspx?from=&to;=en&a;=http%3A%2F%2Fpress.catholica.va%2Fnews_services%2Fbulletin%2Fnews%2F30477.php%3Findex%3D30477%26lang%3Den Scicca completed his doctorate in canon law at the Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, Angelicum. *The Treasurer-General used to have supreme financial control of the whole income derived from the temporal possessions of the Church, as well as the rest of the tribute accruing to the papal treasury. *The College of Clerics of the Apostolic Camera has had seven members since 1870; before that, its membership varied in size. The members of the body, chosen from among the highest prelates, used to have the management of the property and income of the Holy See, and were consulted collectively on all important questions concerning their administration, but also officiated as a court in all disputes affecting the papal exchequer. When Pius IX, after the installation of the various ministries, divided among them the administrative duties, he assigned to each cleric of the Camera the presidency of a section of the department of finance. Four of them, moreover, were members of the commission appointed to examine the accounts of the Camera, entitled to special places whenever the Pope appears in public on solemn occasions, in the papal processions, and in public consistories. At the death of the Pontiff they take possession of the Apostolic palaces, attend to the taking of the inventories, and manage the internal or domestic administration during the vacancy. In the conclave they had charge of all that pertains to the table of the cardinals. Apart from this, the clerics of the Camera are usually professors and canons, with regular ecclesiastical appointments. Other offices The Apostolic Camera must be distinguished from the treasury or camera of the College of Cardinals, presided over by the cardinal-camerlengo (Camerarius Sacri Collegii Cardinalium). It had charge of the common revenues of the College of Cardinals, and appears among the curial institutions after the close of the 13th century. It has long ceased to exist.

Mariel Hemingway also has a supporting role as Margaux's onscreen sister. The film follows a fashion model who is raped by her sister's music teacher. Upon his acquittal in court, he rapes her sister, leading her to enact a brutal revenge. Plot Chris McCormick is a highly paid fashion model whose image serves as the driving force of the ad campaign for a popular brand of lipstick and can be seen in magazines and on billboards all around the world. Gordon Stuart, a part-time composer and full-time music teacher, eagerly accepts Chris's 13-year-old sister Kathy's invitation to come to a secluded beachside photo shoot, so Chris can listen to some of his music. He arrives at her apartment one day to visit her, but is interrupted by a phone call from her lover, Steve Edison. As Chris talks to Steve, Gordon begins to fume at the thought of Chris' obvious rejection. His hurt soon turns to anger, and he enters her room and smashes a picture of her brother Martin, a priest, before throwing himself on top of her. During Chris's struggle to fight him off, Gordon slams her head against one of her bedposts and screams at her to show him where she keeps the lipstick that her face sells to the public. When she tells him it is in her bathroom, he takes her in there and smears it across her face, then forces her to perform fellatio on him to leave the traces of the lipstick on his genitalia. Returning her to her bed, he ties her down with silk scarves, and sodomizes her to the accompaniment of his discordant compositions. Near the end of the ordeal, Kathy returns home from school and walks in on Chris and Gordon, and flees. He gets up and suggests Kathy join them and \\"have some fun,\\" but instead cuts Chris free and leaves. Gordon is arrested, but as Chris learns from Carla Bondi, the prosecutor assigned to handle the case, Gordon's conviction is hardly a sure thing, and she asks her to testify against him. Gordon's attorney argues that the sex was consensual, and that its roughness was the result of Chris's own twisted desires. He also suggests that even if Gordon acted without her consent, she provoked him by appearing naked in front of him at the photo shoot where they first met, and by the inherent sensuality of the photographs from which she makes her living. Gordon is ultimately acquitted. Chris leaves her job modeling for the lipstick company, and plans to relocate to Colorado with Kathy after her last shoot. By a terrible coincidence, Kathy's old school is using the same building where Chris's shoot is to rehearse a new ballet being orchestrated by Gordon. As Chris poses in a red sequined gown, Kathy runs into Gordon, who, despite her protestations to the contrary, a part of her still believes is innocent. Gordon chases her through the abandoned building and rapes her. Kathy returns to the photo shoot and tells Chris what happened. Chris, in a frenzy runs outside to her car and grabs a Remington Slide-Action Rifle she had intended to take to Colorado with her. Chris spots Gordon driving his car in the parking lot, and shoots at it. Gordon is hit by a bullet. He tries running Chris over, but the car swerves and overturns on its side. As he climbs out of the car, Chris shoots him three times. As he convulses, Chris approaches his body and shoots him in the groin, and continues to shoot at his corpse, even after the rifle is empty. Later, Carla Bondi speaks to a jury, telling them that their acquittal of Gordon earlier resulted in Chris losing faith in the law. The jury ultimately finds Chris not guilty.

The statement would seem a little bolder if the movie didn't linger in violent and graphic detail over the rape itself, and then handle the vengeance almost as an afterthought.\\" The New York Times remarked the film's glamorous photography, but said it was \\"anti-intellectual in the ways that B movies always have been.\\" Variety reviewed the film with a similar sentiment, declaring: \\"Lipstick has pretensions of being an intelligent treatment of the tragedy of female rape. But by the time it's over, the film has shown its true colors as just another cynical violence exploitation.\\" Harlan Ellison, writing in March 1977, said: \\"Lipstick panders to the basest, vilest, lowest possible common denominators of urban fear and lynch logic. It is the sort of film that, if you see it in a ghetto theater filled with blacks, will scare the bejeezus out of you. The animal fury this film unleashes in an audience is terrifying to behold. It gives exploitation a bad name; and it has less to do with rape, which is the commercial hook on which they‚Äôve hung the salability of this bit of putrescence, than it does with the cynicism of Joseph E. Levine, a man who probably has no trouble sleeping with a troubled conscience.\\"Harlan Ellison, Harlan Ellison Hornbook. Penzler, 1990. Soundtrack The soundtrack of the film was by French singer Michel Polnareff who released the album in 1976 on Atlantic Records. The soundtrack became a disco success on its own in the United States and internationally. Remakes The film inspired an Indian remake in Hindi, titled Insaaf Ka Tarazu (1980).

Whereas \\"ethical investment\\" funds avoid investments in firms that are accused of damaging the environment or of other negatively regarded behaviors, the Free Enterprise Action Fund sought out such investments, based on Milloy's claim that such criticisms are typically based on political bias or junk science. The fund ceased operations in 2009 and was merged into the Congressional Effect Fund.

Activism through the Fund In a conference in New York in March 2008, Milloy stated that the Fund aims to \\"be a problem for managements and shareholders\\", and that he and Borelli \\"primarily work through shareholder proposals\\" to \\"get the shareholders and CEOs to think about what they're doing\\". He also stated, \\"We have filed numerous shareholder proposals with companies in the US Climate Action Partnership\\".How to Stop Climate Change Legislation in the US. (MP3) Financial results The 2008 Annual Report for the fund shows an annualized loss of 6.58% during the timeframe of March 1, 2005 (its inception) to December 31, 2008. For comparison, the S&P; 500 Index showed an annualized loss of 5.47% during this period. At the end of 2008, the fund had total net assets under management of $6,705,261. The total paid-in- capital invested with the fund, from its start to the end of 2008, was $9,983,108 (p. 14). As had occurred in every year of operation thus far (p. 17), the adviser of the fund waived or reimbursed expenses to the fund. (Currently, the adviser is contractually obligated to do so to maintain the ratio of expenses to average net assets as, at most, 1.75%.) In 2008, the amount waived or reimbursed was $181,612; in previous years, it had been $154,750 (in 2007), $239,564 (in 2006), and $230,343 (in 2005 ). Of the $181,612 in 2008, $129,468 was from waiving the investment advisory fee, leaving $52,144 as the amount reimbursed out-of-pocket to the fund by the adviser for other operating expenses.

Originally established as an award for soldiers in the Papal Army, it is now a civil decoration but may still be awarded to members of the Pontifical Swiss Guards. History The Benemerenti Medal was first awarded by Pope Pius VI (1775‚Äì1799) as a military decoration. In 1831 under Pope Gregory XVI (1831‚Äì1846) a special Benemerenti medal was struck to reward those who fought courageously in the Papal army at Ferrara, Bologna, and Vienna.Hyginus Eugene Cardinale. \\"Orders of Knighthood, Awards, and the Holy See.\\" Edited and revised by Peter Bander van Duren. 3rd edition.

In 1925, the concept of awarding this medal as a mark of recognition to persons in service of the Catholic Church, both civil and military, lay and clergy alike, became acceptable. Members of the Swiss Guard may receive it for three years of faithful service. Appearance The current version of the Benemerenti medal was designed by Pope Paul VI. The medal is a gold Greek Cross depicting Christ with his hand raised in blessing. On the left arm of the cross is the tiara and crossed keys symbol of the papacy. On the right arm is the coat of arms of the current Pope. The medal is suspended from a yellow and white ribbon, the colors of the Papacy.

(2004) Speedway in the North- West, Tempus Publishing Ltd. History Belle Vue operated \\"second\\" teams in the pre-war era. Examples are the Belle Vue Merseyiders team and the second team of 1939 which operated in that prematurely closed season. In the mid 1950s Belle Vue ran a few \\"second\\" team events when the Aces were away from home. The Belle Vue Colts side was formed by former Aces rider Dent Oliver, who became General Manager of Belle Vue Aces in 1967. Oliver's arrival brought sweeping changes to the club's approach as he recognised that if the club was to remain at the very top of British Speedway it needed a way of developing its own young riders. Oliver quickly introduced the now legendary Monday night training schools which he hoped would provide for Belle Vue's future. His efforts brought huge and immediate rewards, with youngsters coming from the north of England to become a part of Belle Vue's roster. Belle Vue were invited to enter a team of their raw youngsters alongside former provincial league teams like Middlesbrough Bears, Plymouth Devils and Rayleigh Rockets, and the new division roared into life on Wednesday 8 May 1968 with Belle Vue defeating Canterbury 55-23 in the first ever second division match. The Colts went through that maiden season unbeaten at home and clinched the league title on Wednesday 28 August when they beat Weymouth 63-15 (the most convincing victory of the season). Twelve months later The Colts retained their Second Division title and even went one better by adding the Knock-Out Cup to the trophy cabinet. Many of the riders used in those two debut seasons went on to further their careers at first division level. In 1970, the Belle Vue management looked for a new home for their nursery team, and this was found at Rochdale where the Colts moved ‚Äî still under the control of Belle Vue ‚Äî to become the Rochdale Hornets.Bamford, R & Jarvis J.(2001). Homes of British Speedway. Rochdale finished third in the 1970 Second Division and reached the semi-finals of the knock-out cup. The Hornets closed after finishing ninth in the 1971 championship, but not before unearthing the biggest talent that the second division was ever to produce: the 16-year-old Peter Collins. Since then, the Colts have continued in various competitions, usually as second half events after the Aces' matches. Notable successes include the 1978 Scottish Junior League title, the 1989 British League 2 Championship and K.O. Cup double and the 2001 and 2002 Northern Youth Development titles.

Development and first draft  Woolf began work on The Voyage Out in 1910 and had finished an early draft by 1912. The novel had a long and difficult gestation; it was not published until 1915, as it was written during a period in which Woolf was especially psychologically vulnerable.Warner, Virginia Woolf, The Waves, p. 17 She suffered from periods of depression and at one point attempted suicide.Briggs, Virginia Woolf: an inner life, p. 42 The resultant work contained the seeds of all that would blossom in her later work: the innovative narrative style, the focus on feminine consciousness, sexuality and death.Waller, Writers, Readers and Reputations, p. 1043 In 1981, Louise DeSalvo published an alternate version of The Voyage Out featuring its original title, Melymbrosia. Professor DeSalvo worked for seven years on the project of reconstructing the text of the novel as it might have appeared in 1912, before Woolf had begun serious revisions. She reviewed more than 1,000 manuscript pages from Woolf's private papers, dating the earlier versions of the work by small organizational clues such as the color of ink used or noticing where a pen had last left off writing.Louise Desalvo, Melymbrosia, Cleis Press, 2002 DeSalvo's Melymbrosia attempts to restore the text of the novel as Woolf had originally conceived it, which contained more candid political commentary on such issues as homosexuality, women's suffrage, and colonialism. According to DeSalvo, Woolf was \\"warned by colleagues that publishing such an outspoken indictment of Britain could prove disastrous to her fledgling career\\". The work was heavily revised until it became the novel now known as The Voyage Out, which omits much of the political candour of the original.Louise Desalvo, Melymbrosia, Cleis Press, 2002 DeSalvo's edition was reissued by Cleis Press in 2002.  Plot  Rachel Vinrace embarks for South America on her father's ship and is launched on a course of self-discovery in a kind of modern mythical voyage. The mismatched jumble of passengers provide Woolf with an opportunity to satirise Edwardian life. The novel introduces Clarissa Dalloway, the central character of Woolf's later novel, Mrs Dalloway. Two of the other characters were modelled after important figures in Woolf's life. St John Hirst is a fictional portrayal of Lytton Strachey and Helen Ambrose is to some extent inspired by Woolf's sister, Vanessa Bell.Phyllis Rose, A Woman of Letters: A Life of Virginia Woolf, p.58 Rachel's journey from a cloistered life in a London suburb to freedom, challenging intellectual discourse and discovery very likely reflects Woolf's own journey from a repressive household to the intellectual stimulation of the Bloomsbury Group.Rose, op. cit., p. 57 Toward the novel's end, Rachel Vinrace dies of a fever.  Critical reception  Writing in 1926, E. M. Forster described it as \\"... a strange, tragic, inspired book whose scene is a South America not found on any map and reached by a boat which would not float on any sea, an America whose spiritual boundaries touch Xanadu and Atlantis\\".Majumdar Virginia Woolf, p. 172 Reviewing the book a decade earlier, he wrote this: \\"It is absolutely unafraid... Here at last is a book which attains unity as surely as Wuthering Heights, though by a different path.\\"Majumdar, op. cit., p. 52-53 Literary scholar Phyllis Rose writes in her introduction to the novel, \\"No later novel of Woolf's will capture so brilliantly the excitement of youth.\\"Phyllis Rose, Introduction to A Voyage Out, Bantam Books, 1991, p. xvi And also the excitement and challenge of life.cf. Forster, as quoted in Majumdar, op. cit., p. 54 \\"It's not cowardly to wish to live,\\" says one old man at the end of the book. \\"It's the very reverse of cowardly.

He is a billionaire heir to the Est√©e Lauder Companies, and the president of the World Jewish Congress. Early life and education Lauder was born in New York City to a Jewish family, the son of Est√©e Lauder and Joseph Lauder, founders of Est√©e Lauder Companies. He is the younger brother of Leonard Lauder, chairman of the board of the Est√©e Lauder Companies. He attended the Bronx High School of Science and holds a bachelor's degree in International Business from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. He studied at the University of Paris, and received a Certificate in International Business from the University of Brussels. Career Lauder started to work for the Est√©e Lauder Company in 1964. In 1984, he became a Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for European and NATO policy at the United States Department of Defense. In 1986, Ronald Reagan named him as the United States Ambassador to Austria, a position he held until 1987. As ambassador, he fired diplomatic officer Felix Bloch, who later became known in connection with the Robert Hanssen espionage case. As a Republican, he made a bid to become the mayor of New York City in 1989, losing to Rudy Giuliani in the Republican primary. Michael Massing, writing of this nomination race, notes that politically Lauder 'seemed out of step with most American Jews; ... he ran to the right of Rudolph Giuliani. And, on Israeli issues, he was a vocal supporter of the Likud party, with long-standing ties to Benjamin Netanyahu.\\"Massing, Michael (March 2001). \\"Deal Breakers\\". The American Prospect. In 1998, Lauder was asked by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to begin Track II negotiations with Syrian leader Hafez al- Assad; these negotiations continued after the election of Ehud Barak to the post. Lauder communicated a new-found willingness on Assad's part to make compromises with the Israelis in an overall land for peace deal, and his draft \\"Treaty of Peace Between Israel and Syria\\" formed an important part of the (ultimately fruitless) Israeli-Syrian negotiations that occurred in January 2000 in Shepherdstown, West Virginia. Lauder manages investments in real estate and media, including Central European Media Enterprises and Israeli TV. In 2010, Lauder founded RWL Water, LLC. Civic and philanthropic activities Lauder has been involved with organizations, such as the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, the Jewish National Fund, the World Jewish Congress, the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee, the Anti-Defamation League, the Jewish Theological Seminary, Brandeis University, and the Abraham Fund. With his brother he founded the Lauder Institute at Wharton School. Lauder has also served as a finance chairman of the New York Republican State Committee. In 2003, Lauder founded and became a president of Lauder Business School in Vienna, Austria. Lauder led a movement to introduce term limits in the New York City Council, which were subsequently imposed on most NYC elected officials, including the Mayor and City Council, after a citywide referendum in 1993. In 1996, voters turned down a council proposal to extend term limits. Lauder spent $4 million on the two referendums. He has been involved in environmental conservation efforts in eastern Long Island and has served on the board of directors of the conservation organization Group for the East End since 2002. =Art= On November 16, 2001, Lauder opened the Neue Galerie in New York, an art museum across the street from the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The Neue Galerie is dedicated to art from Germany and Austria from the early 20th century. It holds one of the best collections of works by Egon Schiele in the world. On June 18, 2006, he purchased from Maria Altmann and her family, the painting Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I by Gustav Klimt for $135 million, the highest price ever paid for a painting at that time. Lauder called the painting \\"Our Mona Lisa\\". He reportedly saw Klimt's portrait as a youth in Vienna and had admired it since. The painting, a Nazi-looted art piece which had just been restored to Altmann following years of negotiation and litigation with the Austrian government, now forms the centerpiece of the museum's collection. Lauder also has the world's largest private collection of medieval and Renaissance armor. Lauder has been criticized for failure to resolve a case involving the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA), which in 1997 exhibited some paintings owned by Rudolph Leopold, a Viennese doctor and art collector. An investigative article in The New York Times on December 24, 1997 ‚Äì \\"A Singular Passion for Amassing Art, One Way or Another\\" ‚Äì outlined a case involving Portrait of Wally by Egon Schiele, which was in the MoMA exhibition but was obtained by Leopold soon after the Nazi era. The New York County District Attorney (Manhattan) stepped in to help restore the piece to descendants of its original owner, but ownership of the painting is still in contention, nearly ten years later. Lauder has been accused of a failure to act on the case, despite being MoMA chairman at the time.Dobrzynski, Judith H. (January 25, 1998) \\"Man in the Middle of the Schiele Case\\". The New York Times. Lauder is an honorary trustee of the World Monuments Fund, a New York-based non- profit with the mission of protecting endangered cultural heritage sites around the world. In 1987, Lauder established the Ronald S. Lauder Foundation, a philanthropic organization that is dedicated to rebuilding Jewish life in Central and Eastern Europe. The foundation also supports student exchange programs between New York and various capitals in Central and Eastern Europe. In 1998, Lauder co-founded the Alzheimer's Drug Discovery Foundation with his brother, Leonard A. Lauder. Its mission it to \\"rapidly accelerate the discovery of drugs to prevent, treat and cure Alzheimer's disease.\\" Ronald continues as the Foundation's co-chairman. =President of the World Jewish Congress= Lauder with German leaders at a rally against anti-Semitism in Berlin, September 14, 2014.

Lauder was elected president of the World Jewish Congress on June 10, 2007, following the resignation of Edgar Bronfman, Sr.. He beat the South African businessman Mendel Kaplan and Einat Wilf of Israel by a clear margin. President George W. Bush appointed him to serve on the honorary delegation to accompany him to Jerusalem for the celebration of the 60th anniversary of the State of Israel in May 2008. Lauder condemned the persecution of Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar. =Jewish activism= In July 2009, Bernie Ecclestone faced calls from Lauder to resign as Formula One chief after he had praised Adolf Hitler in a newspaper interview and said that Hitler \\"got things done\\". Lauder said someone with Ecclestone's views should not be allowed to run such an important and popular racing series. He urged Formula One teams, drivers and host countries to suspend their cooperation with him. In reaction, Ecclestone told the news agency Associated Press that \\"I think the people who are saying that haven't got the power to say these things.\\" Asked if the World Jewish Congress was influential, Ecclestone said: \\"It's a pity they didn't sort the banks out\\" and \\"They have a lot of influence everywhere\\". After a public outcry, Ecclestone apologized for his remarks and said he had \\"been an idiot\\". In December 2009, Lauder protested against the Roman Curia's decree recognizing the heroic virtues of Pope Pius XII, asserting that an eventual beatification would be inopportune until the Holy See's historical archives from the 1939‚Äì1945 period were opened.\\"World Jewish Congress criticizes Pope's decision to beatify Pius XII\\".

European NATO member states ‚Äì including Turkey ‚Äì must admit the state of Israel into the Western alliance,\\" the WJC president wrote. He referred to the uprisings in Egypt and Tunisia and said they were reminders of how \\"unpredictable\\" developments in the Middle East were.

In May 2012, Lauder condemned as \\"despicable\\" remarks made by the Norwegian sociologist Johan Galtung who had \\"revived anti-Semitic canards such as Jewish control of the media\\" and suggested that Israel's Mossad could have been behind the 2011 \\"massacres in Norway committed by Anders Breivik\\" in which 77 people died. Lauder declared: \\"There is a growing tendency to blame the Jews for all evil that happens under the sun.

EJU News. May 3, 2012. In August 2012, Lauder criticized Austrian politicians for failing to publicly denounce the leader of the third-largest political party in the country, the FP√ñ, Heinz-Christian Strache, who had posted an anti-Semitic cartoon on his Facebook page. \\"Clearly, and not for the first time, the FP√ñ leader is trying to whip up anti-Semitic sentiment. His repeated denials are not credible because his words and actions speak for themselves,\\" Ronald Lauder said in a statement, adding: \\"This scandal shows that anti-Jewish resentment is still widespread, and unscrupulous politicians are allowed to exploit it for electioneering purposes.

The club was founded in 1947 and its colours are red and yellow. Their home stadium, Stade du 20 Ao√ªt 1955, has a capacity of 10,000 spectators. The club is currently playing in the Algerian Ligue Professionnelle 1. History The 15 June 1947 to Leveilley coffee Kaddour (now Maqaria), 180 members met to decide on the merger of three clubs of Hussein Dey: Nedjma Sports Hussein Dey, the Ideal Club Cooler and Esperance Sportive de Leveilley The athletic Nasr Hussein Dey was born. The Nasria is a club that was blessed at the time by the Sheikh Larbi Tbessi. A club that has been active during the war of liberation, and had its share of suffering, pain and of course, its share of martyrs, who responded to the call for 1956/1957 for stop sports clubs Algerians, the NAHD ceased all activity and did not resume until after the country's independence in 1962. Champion Algiers in 1963, he won his only championship of Algeria in 1967. In 35 years of presence at the highest level of national football, NAHD is mounted on the podium ten times in the league and won an Algerian Cup in 1979. The team also played a final of the African Cup Winners' Cup the same year. The Nasria is known for its training policy advocated by renowned coaches: Fez Ren√© Vernier Reynolds Ammar Boudissa and Jean Snella. This policy was responsible for the emergence of a generation of exceptional players who formed the backbone of the Algerian team in the Spanish World in 1982. Among the iconic players of the club we quote Defnoun Abdelkader Ouchen Bouyahi Youcef Khedis Merzekane Fergani El Hocine A√Øt Lazazi Alliche. Halliche with NAHD Special mention to Madjer who had the chance to play abroad and that made a world career with the FC Porto especially. Not to mention Mahmoud Guendouz which is the Algerian player who has the most significant playing time in final phase of World Cup (540 min). The season 2008, the NAHD became the first Algerian club to move a player to a club in Europe: center-back Rafik Halliche in this case, recruited by Benfica. Halliche will break the record Guendouz by playing seven matches (700 minutes) of the team of Algeria in the last two editions of the World Cup (2010 and 2014). Nahdiste The school has trained a galaxy of talented players such as Zarabi Guenoun Bouchefra and many others. But the club's training policy also has perverse effects. Every year, the club does not have a large budget, is bled of its best features. The last three years, we could consider that the workforce is redesigned each \\"transfer window\\" or each semester.

The village is part of the parish of \\"Bansha and Kilmoyler\\" (united in 1858) in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cashel and Emly. It is in the historical barony of Clanwilliam. Bansha is co-extensive with the pre-Reformation parish of Templeneiry of which the townland name of Templenahurney is thought to be a corruption. While the village is the focal point of the area, there is also an outlying hamlet in the parish, located at Rossadrehid where a rural creamery once serviced the dairy industry. Location Bansha is located on the National Primary Route (N24) linking the cities of Limerick and Waterford and is eight kilometres south-east of Tipperary Town and thirteen kilometres north-west of Cahir. The village is strategically located on the eastern approaches to the Glen of Aherlow, which forms a large part of the parish as do the Galtee Mountains (spelt Galty Mountains on Ordnance Survey maps), which has the highest inland mountain peak in Ireland, Galtymore (917 metres, or 3,009 ft). The Roman Catholic Parish Church of the Annunciation, built in 1807, is centrally located in the village as is the Church of Ireland, for the parish of Templeneiry, known to be in use from 1718 but now closed as unviable because of a reduced local congregation. However, the building which has an imposing spire, erected in 1814, is used for community purposes and the surrounding graveyard is still used for burials by the old families of the area. Bansha is located in the Golden Vale and the surrounding land is some of the finest in Ireland due to its natural limestone bedrock. The River Ara flows by the village, through the Deer Park of the old Lismacue demesne. The railway line from Limerick to Waterford also passes through, though the railway station which opened on 1 May 1852, was closed on 9 September 1963 as part of the rationalisation policy of the national railway company, C√≥ras Iompair √âireann. Tipperary railway station, around 8 km. away, is now the nearest railway station. Bansha is served by Bus √âireann route 55. History The names Bansha and Kilmoyler do not appear in ancient records but instead, this area was divided into different ecclesiastical administrations. The modern parish of Bansha & Kilmoyler comprises the whole of the two Civil Parishes of Templeneiry and Clonbullogue, and also parts of the four parishes of Killardry, Relickmurry & Athassel, Kilshane and Cordangan. The Papal Taxation records of 1291 record Templeneiry and Clonbullogue as Nachrich and Clonhalke, Archbishop O'Hedian (1437) names them as Naryt and Clonbolygg. Bansha village is thought to be an ancient settlement and its main geographical features and landed gentry of the surrounding area were vividly described by Samuel Lewis in his Topographical Dictionary of Ireland, published in 1837. Historically, it was a small compact village comprising two streets and two lanes - Main Street and Barrack Street with adjacent Banner's Lane (named after the Rev. Benjamin Holford Banner, the Church of Ireland rector of the Parish of Templeneiry) and Cooke's Lane which was a small enclave off Main Street, named after a member of the Cooke Family of Cordangan Manor, who lived here. The Station Road from Bansha Bridge (over the River Ara) to Bansha railway station had a strategic importance for about a century as it was the commercial artery connecting the village to both the station and the creamery which was the centre of activity each morning as trains arrived on one side of the road and busy creamery activity on the other side gave a vibrancy that has now been lost with the closure of both. The village expanded towards the end of the 20th century when the \\"Galtee View\\" residential area was developed in the Glebe close to the old Village Mill. Further expansion took place in the early 21st century when \\"Master Horgan's Field\\" adjacent to the northern boundary of the old graveyard was developed as a modern residential quarter. In earlier decades, the site was owned by Mr. Peter Horgan, a native of Kilmichael, County Cork, a place which won fame as the site of the famous ambush of the same name which took place there during the War of Independence, a fact of which the old master was very proud. Mr.Horgan was the long-time Principal of Bansha Boys National School in succession to Masters Pat Leahy and David Dee and also managed his own public house in Barrack Street. He also grew his own sallies on the river bank within the confines of his riverside garden, now sadly no more. These sallies made an occasional appearance in class and were an effective deterrent to wayward pupils. Nonthelass, he was a much-loved character, reminiscent of Oliver Goldsmith's \\"Village Schoolmaster\\". The only buildings on the site prior to development were the village telephone exchange erected in the 1960s and the \\"Farmers Hall\\", a wooden building of fragile construction, which was erected in the mid 20th century by the young farmers association in the parish which was a precursor of Macra na Feirme. It was used for dancing, variety shows, \\"pongo\\" which was a form of modern-day bingo and on Sunday afternoons up to about 1962, as a rendezvous by locals who wished to tune into the commentary of major hurling and football matches relayed from Croke Park on Radio √âireann. The building endured until the 1960s when because of dilapidation, it was eventually closed, after which the Parochial Hall became the sole entertainment centre for the village and surrounding area. Muintir na T√≠re Bansha came to national prominence when Rev. John Canon Hayes, founder of Muintir na T√≠re was appointed parish priest of Bansha & Kilmoyler in 1946. Due largely to his endeavours, a factory - Bansha Rural Industries - was started and enjoyed some success producing preservatives for the Irish home market. At that time also, Bansha was to the forefront in developing many Muintir na T√≠re initiatives and for a time in the 1950s enjoyed the sobriquet of The Model Parish. While Bansha still relies mainly on an agricultural economy where dairying is the main preoccupation, many of its residents are employed in industry and commerce in neighbouring towns such as Tipperary, Cahir, and Clonmel, to where they commute on a daily basis. Parliamentary tradition For its relative size, Bansha village has a proud and unique parliamentary tradition as two of its natives have represented County Tipperary in different parliaments. John Cullinan, a member of the National League and a Gaelic Athletic Association activist in its earliest years, was a Nationalist Member of Parliament at Westminster from 1900 until he was defeated at the famous election of 1918 when Sinn F√©in ousted the Irish Parliamentary Party in most constituencies. Michael Ferris was a Teachta D√°la in D√°il √âireann from 1989 until his death on parliamentary business in Lisbon on 20 March 2000 at the age of 69. Overall, he had over twenty years of service in the Oireachtas (parliament), having been elected to Seanad √âireann for the first time on 23 April 1975. He was a member of the Labour Party and a prominent spokesman on agricultural matters and social affairs. As a public representative, he was following in the footsteps of his grandfather, Patrick Ferris, who was a member of Tipperary (SR) County Council in the early years of the 20th century. S√©amus Ryan, a native of Deerpark, in nearby Kilfeacle, was a member of the Irish Senate--Seanad √âireann--before his death in 1933. Mr. Ryan and his wife, Agnes Harding of Solohead opened their first retail shop in Parnell Street, Dublin in 1918, known as the Monument Creamery. They specialised in the sale of dairy products and quickly developed their business to include a chain of over thirty restaurants and shops in Dublin over the next four decades. After Mr. Ryan's death, his widow carried on and indeed expanded the business. Their daughter was the Hollywood actress, Kathleen Ryan who starred in many movies in the 1940s and 1950s and their son John was an artist and man of letters who wrote a famous memoir of bohemian Dublin in the 1950s--Remembering How we Stood. Darby Ryan, poet and patriot Diarmuid O'R√≠ain (Darby Ryan) was born at Ashgrove, Bansha in 1777 and was a poet and patriot, his most famous composition was undoubtedly The Peeler and the Goat, a ballad or satire which was popularly sung across Ireland and was taken worldwide by emigrants. Copies of his Tipperary Minstrelsy are to be found in The British Museum and at The Royal Irish Academy. Ryan died in 1855 and is buried in the old graveyard in Bansha where his grave is marked, unusually, by a carved stone cross depicting a rope and anchor, suggestive of a maritime connection of which there was none. Sir William and Lady Butler Lieutenant-General Sir William Francis Butler PC, GCB (October 31, 1838 - June 7, 1910), a soldier, a writer, and an adventurer, lived in retirement at Bansha Castle from 1905 until his death in 1910. He was born a few miles distant at 'Suirville', Ballyslatteen. He took part in many colonial campaigns in Canada and India, but mainly in Africa, including the Ashanti wars and the Zulu War under General Wolseley. He was made commander- in-chief of the British Army in South Africa in 1898 where he was also High Commissioner for a short period. His views on colonialism were often controversial as he was sympathetic to the natives in many of the outposts of Empire in which he served. His wife, the famous battle artist, Elizabeth Thompson (1846‚Äì1933), known as Lady Butler, continued to live at the Castle until 1922 when she went to live at Gormanston Castle, County Meath with their youngest daughter, Eileen, who became Viscountess Gormanston (1883‚Äì1964) in 1911 on her marriage to Jenico Preston, 15th Viscount Gormanston (1878‚Äì1925), the Premier Viscount of Ireland. Lady Butler died in 1933 in her 87th year and is buried at Stamullen graveyard in County Meath, just up the road from Gormanston. Among her many famous paintings is The Roll Call depicting a scene in the Crimean War. This painting was bought by Queen Victoria and forms part of the royal collection and is now in Buckingham Palace. Her daughter Eileen suffered a great loss during the Second World War when two of her three sons, William (16th Lord Gormanston) and Stephen were killed in action at Dunkirk (1940) and Anzio (1944) respectively. Both boys, together with their brother Robert and sister Antoinette, spent many childhood days at Bansha Castle where they were once marooned during the civil war when Bansha and the surrounding area was the cockpit for fighting between the Free State forces and the local Republicans. Descendants of Sir William and Lady Elizabeth include their Great-grandson Jenico Nicholas Preston, 17th Viscount Gormanston of London. McCarthy family of Springhouse The MacCarthy Reagh family of Carbery in west Cork were aristocrats of the old Gaelic order, Princes of the medieval Barony of Carbery. Since early in the 15th century, they had their principal seat at Kilbrittain Castle, near Kinsale. Denis McCarthy Reagh, Chief of the McCarthy Reaghs settled at Springhouse, near Bansha in the late 17th century where he built a mansion and had an estate of , which in its day was considered to be the largest cultivated farm in Europe. Owing to the severity of the Penal Laws, his grandson, also named Denis went into exile in France where he died at Argenton, Berry in 1761. Justin McCarthy (1744‚Äì1811), son of the exiled Denis, realised his father's property and settled at Toulouse. He was an accomplished linguist and classical scholar. He cultivated the fine arts and possessed one of the finest libraries in France, rivalling the King's collection at Paris. Because of his illustrious Irish ancestry, he was ennobled by King Louis XVI as Count of Toulouse in 1776 and was admitted to the honours of the French Royal Court in Paris. He and his family resided in splendour at their palatial townhouse at 3, Rue Mage in the city of Toulouse. The best known of the Count's children was the Abbe Nicholas Tuite MacCarthy, also known as the Abbe de Levignac after one of the Count's properties. He was a famous Jesuit preacher, who is buried in the cathedral of St. Peter in Annecy. On Count Justin's death, his extensive estate was dispersed and as part of the family settlements, the townhouse was sold to his youngest son, Justin who resided there until his death at the age of 77 in 1862. The residence which was all that remained of the family property was sold in 1873 to a well-known family of bankers - Courtois de Vicoze - in Toulouse and is still a famous banking hall. Soon afterwards, the last Count of Toulouse, Nicholas McCarthy Reagh son of Joseph Patrick MacCarthy (1779-1862) and grandson of the original Count Justin bade farewell to the city and so ended the family connection with the place which had lasted for about a century. The Count lived into the 20th century and died in 1906, and this ended the male line in France of the McCarthys of Springhouse after 132 years. At home in Ireland, the McCarthy family were noted priest-protectors in penal times and Springhouse was considered a safe haven for priests on-the-run from persecution. A namesake, Donough McCarthy was consecrated Bishop of Cork & Cloyne on 16 Aug. 1713 in Villa Domus Fontis which was the Latinised equivalent of Springhouse. A family member, Edward McCarthy (1739-1823) was a member of the diocesan clergy of Cashel & Emly and served as Parish Priest of Ballinahinch and Killoscully. Richard Lalor Sheil (1791‚Äì1851), Irish politician - Member of Parliament for County Tipperary, writer and orator, was son of Edward Sheil of Bellevue, near Waterford and Catherine McCarthy of Springhouse. Another family member of a later generation was Catherine, daughter of Patrick McCarthy, farmer, of Ballygurteen, Kilmoyler, who survived the sinking of the in 1912. The Springhouse family still survives in Ireland, a family branch of recent memory lived at 'Coolavunga' (C√∫il an Mhong√°in), the medieval name for the townland of Barnlough, near Bansha, during the 20th century and members of that family still reside in nearby Tipperary Town and elsewhere in Ireland. In France, though the male line died out in 1906 with the death of the last Count, the bloodline has continued by virtue of Christine Marie, daughter of Count Justin of Toulouse. Christine married Augustine de Rey, the Marquis de St. Gery and their descendants still reside in the Chateau de St. Gery, a few kilometres from Toulouse. The family's great mansion at Springhouse was dismantled in the early 19th century with only a trace remaining near the lakeshore in the grounds of Kilshane House which was built by the Lowe family who replaced them in the 1820s and who also had an estate in Kenmare, Co. Kerry. The old mansion of Spring House was replaced by another of the same name to which the McCarthys moved and this house was subsequently known as 'Arraghslea' which is still extant. The stones for the building of 'Arraghslea' came from the ruins of an old castle located at nearby Dromline. The placename of Springhouse or Spring House originated from a spring or well near a whitethorn tree close to the scullery at the rear of the mansion house and the townland assumed this name thereafter. The McCarthys of Springhouse also have their 'Banshee' (Cl√≠odhna), the story of which is told by Thomas Crofton Croker in his Fairy Tales and Traditions of the South of Ireland published in 1825. In the old graveyard at Bansha village, the family vault is discreetly located inside the graveyard wall opposite Mr. O'Heney's public house at the junction of the glen road leading to the Glen of Aherlow. A member of the 'Coolavunga' branch of the family - James McCarthy Reagh, wrote a poem entitled \\"The Haunted Village\\", which is sometimes recited on social occasions by the older people of the village. Other notable people *Frank Baker (1889‚Äì1961), cricketer and Royal Navy officer Community and events The Bansha Agricultural Show is held annually, augmented by a festival week in late August. For recreation, game shooting and fishing in the rivers Suir, Ara and Aherlow River are common. There are also a number of sporting clubs such as Bansha Golf Society, Bansha Celtic F.C. which promotes Association football (soccer) and the Galtee Rovers GAA - Hurling & Gaelic Football Club (affiliated to the GAA, 1885). Bansha has also long been associated with horse racing and breeding.

History Morrison was born in 1971 and raised in Hornsby, a suburb of Sydney's North. He went to St. Leo's College at Wahroonga and is Catholic. He trained at 2GB in a journalism cadetship programme in 1990 and later qualified at the Australian Film Television and Radio School. Morrison has spoken of working for Dick Smith Electronicshttp://www.2gb.com broadcast interview with Dick Smith September 2010 as a salesman while working in radio to boost his income. He studied Electrical Engineering and Law at University but did not complete the degree.http://www.radioinfo.com.au/main.php Career =2GB= Morrison's media career started with 2GB in 1989 at the age of 17 as a newsroom cadet and he has subsequently covered news and current affairs in all parts of the country and around the world. In 1998, Morrison was appointed Director of News at 2GB and remains the youngest person to have ever held that position. Between 2008 and 2010, Morrison presented the Drivetime afternoon shift where he consistently held second-place in the market but never broke to number one. He was the regular alternate for Alan Jones for several years and during an extended stint in Jones' breakfast shift actually out-rated him. Morrison told the Sydney Morning Herald at the time \\"it was luck and anyone who thinks otherwise is kidding themselves\\". Jones later remarked \\"I'm not surprised, Jason is hugely talented and one day I won't be here so it's in good hands\\".http://www.smh.com/entertainment/radiotv/25024f.htm In December 2010, Morrison announced that he would be leaving his position at 2GB as host of Drive and move to rival 2UE. It was speculated that he had a falling out with fellow presenter Ray Hadley which Morrison denied, \\"Ray is just being competitive about me leaving. What do you expect him to say, tune in and listen to him. We actually got on fine\\". =2UE= After three years at 2UE, Jason's contract was terminated at the end of 2013, after allegedly being told his conservative views and style did not fit with the future ideological direction of the Fairfax Media owned radio station. The decision was considered a shock and prompted wide discussion in the media, including by direct rival Ben Fordham who said \\"2UE has rocks in their heads for getting rid of Morrison\\". Fordham immediately offered Morrison a segment on his show which he accepted. It was reported Morrison was sanctioned for criticising the board of Fairfax for refusing to allow Gina Rinehart to take up a board position, even though she was the largest single shareholder. The remarks reportedly resulted in legal action against Morrison which was later dropped. It was reported Morrison fell out with 2UE management after siding with controversial presenter Michael Smith who left the station after being prevented from broadcasting allegations about Julia Gillard's associations with the Australian Workers Union. =Television= Morrison was chief of staff at the Sydney newsroom of Network Ten for five years from 2000. He was promoted to Editor but left a year later to return to radio. He regularly appears in short opinion slots of various national morning television shows including Sunrise.

Controversy =Wins long running defamation case= In 2005 while broadcasting on 2GB, Morrison described Sydney Islamic activist Keysar Trad as a \\"gutless and a disgraceful and dangerous individual who incited racism and violence\\". Trad sued Morrison for defamation. Morrison and 2GB stood by the remarks. Morrison further described Trad as \\"typical of people who run around smearing others and the moment they are criticised, run to the courts\\".. The case was won by Morrison and 2GB and described in the media as Australia's longest running defamation case after it went to the NSW Supreme Court, the NSW Court of Appeal,. and the High Court of Australia.. Trad was ordered to pay more than $500,000 in costs. =Al Jazeera= In 2015, Morrison made international news when he told a leading British Islamic scholar he was \\"unfit for civilised society. You are uncivilised\\" during a televised debate on Al Jazeera. The exchange took place during a debate about freedom of the press following the terrorist attack on Charlie Hebdo magazine. Morrison argued that people who thought the publishers had brought the attack on themselves: \\"So, please, spare me the justification garbarge for these terrorists being upset and just responding to provocation. If you think they were even slightly justified for killing people who drew some pictures, then I'm afraid you are over in their column.\\" Awards In 2007, Morrison received the Brian White Memorial award recognising sustained journalistic achievement. In 2009 he again received the same award, the only time it has been awarded to the same person twice. Personal life Morrison is married and lives in Carlingford. He has two children.

It is sometimes written as Lemba, which is also closer to the correct pronunciation. Neighbouring villages are Empa, Kissonerga and Chlorakas. The village is located on top of an escarpment overlooking the Mediterranean Sea, and is set in one of the most fertile parts of Cyprus. The area produces citrus, olives, tomatoes and market-garden vegetables, and is one of the few parts of Europe where commercial banana production is possible. picrolite and on display in Gallery 1 of the Cyprus Museum. The village is one of the most ancient in Cyprus, and since 1976 has been the site of ongoing archaeological excavations by the School of Archaeology at the University of Edinburgh. Lempa is believed to have been first settled in the Chalcolithic Period (c. 3800-2500 BC), and a number of cruciform female figurines, carved in stone, from this period have been found. In 1982, the Lemba Experimental Village was established as an archaeological project to recreate a Chalcolithic village and use it to undertake a number of historic activities, including use of building materials, pyrotechnology, pottery firing and prehistoric cooking methods. With the cooperation of the Cyprus Department of Antiquities, as well as the mayor and villagers of Lempa, the project has developed into an important visitor attraction as well as being for research into many aspects of experimental archaeology. Lempa appears to have been occupied for most of the human history of Cyprus, and much later archaeological remains, including pottery fragments and coins from the Mediaeval period have been found there. In 1958, after the intercommunal fights, the majority of Lempa villagers had to flee to Afania Village. And in 1959 the Lempa villagers has returned their houses right before the British Colonial Government agreed to establish Cyprus Republic. In more recent times, Lempa was until 1963 a Turkish village, but following intercommunal violence on 2 January 1964 the Turkish population abandoned Lempa and settled in Paphos town. Following the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974, the Turkish population moved to the north of Cyprus to primary Morphou, North Nicosia, Famagusta and Kyrenia and the village was fully abandoned except for a small number of Greek refugees. It was then resettled by displaced Greek Cypriots from the north. In 1981, Lempa became home to the Cyprus College of Art. Under the leadership of the Cypriot artist Stass Paraskos, the College renovated the former school building for use as artists' studios. The first artist to use the building was the British painter Euan Uglow.Michael Paraskos (ed). Stass Paraskos (Mitcham: Orage Press, 2009) 26f Following the College a number of other artists have moved into the village which has since become an internationally known artists' colony. As a consequence of the artists, archaeologists and art college in Lempa the Government of Cyprus announced in 2008 that the village was to receive major funding to become a 'Cultural Village'.

The founding of the palace dates back to the late 12th Century. It is situated about 500m from the location of the first officially settled Cathedral Church of the Diocese of Moray, in present-day Spynie Churchyard. For most of its occupied history, the castle was not described as a palace ‚Äî this term first appeared in the Registry of Moray in a writ of 1524.Registrum Moraviense, p. 401 Background The beginnings of the Bishopric of Moray are unclear. The first mention of a bishop was Gregoir whose name appeared on several royal charters in the 1120s. The early Bishops of Moray had no fixed abode but moved between houses at Birnie, Kinneddar and Spynie.Registrum Episcopatus Moraviensis, 40‚Äî43 In 1172, King William I, the Lion, made grants to the church of the Holy Trinity of the Bishopric of Moray and to Bishop Simon de Tosny. Formal permission for the permanent move to Spynie was given by Pope Innocent III to Bishop Bricius de Douglas in April 1206 and the transfer was probably made by 1208.Donaldson, G: The Foundation of Elgin Cathedral, in Maclean, A 1974 (ed): Elgin Cathedral and Diocese of Moray, Inverness, p. 2 Bishop Bricius attended the Fourth Lateran Council in 1215 and may have appealed to Innocent to transfer the See of Moray to Elgin. However, he certainly wrote to him requesting the move before July 1216.Registrium Episcacopatus Moravienses no. 45 The cathedral church at Spynie was considered vulnerable to attack and too far from the market. Elgin with its Royal castle would have been seen as a better option. Bricius did not live to see the changes made, dying in 1222, but his successor, Bishop Andrew of Moray carried them out.Fawcett, R: Elgin Cathedral, Edinburgh, 1991, p. 34 Although the See of Moray was transferred to the Church of the Holy Trinity in Elgin on 19 July 1224, the Bishop of Moray's episcopal palace remained at Spynie.Lewis, Pringle: Spynie Palace and the Bishops of Moray, Edinburgh, 2002, p. 2 The fortified residence =12th and 13th centuries= The first castle was a wooden structure built in the late 12th century and was revealed in excavations carried out between 1986 and 1994.Lewis, Pringle: Spynie Palace and the Bishops of Moray, Edinburgh, 2002, p. 23 The excavated evidence suggests that the buildings were surrounded by a rectangular ringwork and ditch which seem to have enclosed an area of roughly the same as the 14th-century curtain wall, i.e., an enclosure of 45 ‚Äì 65m and is large even by medieval ringworks found elsewhere in Britain. It is likely that the buildings would have consisted of the bishop's house with a hall, a bed chamber and a chapel and also holding a brewhouse and a bakehouse. The early living quarters The stone buildings first appeared in the 13th century with the establishment of what was thought to have been a chapel and which had coloured glass windows.Lewis, Pringle: Spynie Palace and the Bishops of Moray, Edinburgh, 2002, p.29 The first recorded mention of the castle is in a document held in the British Museum. This manuscript dates from the early 14th century but appears to have been compiled between 1292 and 1296 and was apparently for the use of English administrators during King Edward I of England's occupation of Scotland.Skene, W F(Ed): Chronicles of the Picts and Scots, Edinburgh, pp. 214, 215Simpson, W D: The Palace of the Bishops of Moray at Spynie, Elgin, 1927, pp 2, 3 The first writ issued at Spynie Castle was in 1343 and is recorded in the Register of MorayRegistrum Moraviense, p. 127 =14th and early 15th centuries= The remaining wooden buildings were gradually replaced with stone, and this continued through into the 14th century when the first main castle building was erected. This was a near- square structure built within a 7-metre-high curtain wall. The main entrance in the wall faced to the south and a tower that projected from the south-east corner had narrow openings for archers. In this period Alexander Stewart, Earl of Buchan, otherwise known as the Wolf of Badenoch, attacked and burned Elgin Cathedral in June 1390. It also appears that he took Spynie Castle as King Robert III (Buchan's brother) issued an instruction to Buchan in August 1390 forbidding him to 'intromit' the Castle of Spynie for any reason.Simpson, W: The Palace of the Bishops of Moray at Spynie, Elgin, 1927, p. 5 Following Bishop Alexander Bur's death in 1397, the King, in conformity with feudal established practice during the period of the vacant Seat, took possession of the castle and perversely appointed the now reformed Wolf of Badenoch to be warden of the castle. After the election of the new bishop, the King issued a writ on 3 May 1398 to Buchan to hand over the castle and contents to Bishop William without claiming expenses. =Later 15th and 16th centuries= It is thought that Bishop John de Winchester (1435‚Äì60) was responsible for moving the main gate to the east wall which contained a strong portcullis.Simpson, W D: The Palace of the Bishops of Moray at Spynie, Elgin, 1927, pp 13 ‚Äì 15 The architectural detail of the upper section of the gate remain and show the gatekeeper's room complete with small fireplace. John, as well as being the Bishop of Moray, was also the king's Master of Works and had been responsible for alterations to the castles at Inverness and Urquhart as well as the palace at Linlithgow.Lewis, Pringle: Spynie Palace and the Bishops of Moray, Edinburgh, 2002, p.88 The fine stonework and styling of the gate may have been carried out by the master-masons working on the restoration work at Elgin Cathedral following its destruction in 1390.MacGibbon; Ross: Castellated and Domestic Architecture of Scotland, Edinburgh, 1887, Vol. I, pp. 443‚Äì4 David's Tower The most significant buildings were established in the later 15th century through into the 16th century when David's Tower (also known as Davey's Tower) was built along with other substantial accommodation areas. The tower is the largest by volume of all medieval Scottish towers measuring 19m by 13.5m and 22m in height and was started by Bishop David Stewart (1462‚Äì76) and completed by Bishop William Tulloch (1477‚Äì82).Lewis, Pringle: Spynie Palace and the Bishops of Moray, Edinburgh, 2002, p. 51 It has 6 storeys above ground and had a garret on the top. Below ground is a vaulted basement which is approximately 1.5m below the level of the courtyard; it contains a circular dungeon, 5.3m in diameter, lit only by a narrow loop looking to the west and has a slightly domed vaulted roof.Simpson, W D: The Palace of the Bishops of Moray at Spynie, Elgin, 1927, p. 8 The ground floor contained the hall which is 12.8m by 6.7m and lit by large windows with built-in stone seats. At the NE corner was a spiral staircase which led to the upper floors. Each of these floors were similar in design with a single large room and smaller chambers leading off it. The tower is plain and practically lacking in architectural features; the external walls were originally rendered while the internal walls were plastered.Lewis, Pringle: Spynie Palace and the Bishops of Moray, Edinburgh, 2002, Bishops David Stewart's and Patrick Hepburn's armorial shields below Stewart was also responsible for converting the old hall in the west range to kitchens to service the tower. It was said that the building of the tower was a reaction to intimidation from the Earl of Huntly whom Stewart had excommunicated for failing to pay his taxes.Rhind, W: Sketches of the Past and Present State of Moray, 1839 During the mid 16th century, a walled garden to the south of the castle precinct, was established mainly to house an orchard. A deed was signed in the garden in 1556 indicating that it would have been a pleasant place to relax in.Fraser, Sir William: The Chiefs of Grant, Vol. III, p. 124 The household diet was further supplemented when a rabbit warren and a doocot were added in 1569.Registrum Magni Sigilli, 1546‚Äî80, No. 1907 Bishop Patrick Hepburn (1538‚Äì73), the last Roman Catholic bishop at Spynie, installed wide-mouth gun-loops to boost the castle defences and enlarges some windows.Simpson, W D: The Palace of the Bishops of Moray at Spynie, Elgin, 1927, pp. 10, 11, 15 He continued to live at Spynie for a period after the Reformation. Ruxby, an agent provocateur of Elizabeth I of England, who had tried to lead Mary, Queen of Scots, into a plot with English Roman Catholics, was imprisoned in Spynie Castle in 1566 for eighteen months during Bishop Patrick Hepburn's tenure.Stevenson, J (Ed) : Claude Nau's History of Mary Stuart, p. 27 Hepburn fell foul of the Privy Council for sheltering his relative Bothwell in 1567 who had fled from Spynie to Orkney and finally to Denmark.Register of the Privy Council of Scotland, Vol. I, p. 531Stevenson, J: Illustrations of the Reign of Queen Mary, p. 217 As part of the pacification following the abdication of Queen Mary, Regent Morton, in a meeting of the Privy Council at Perth on 23 February 1573, ordered that the castle be made available to the Crown, if needed:Register of the Privy Council of Scotland, Vol. II, p. 195 > the hous of Spyne salbe randerit and deliverit to oure Soverane Lord and his > Regent foirsaid quhen it salbe requirite on XV dayis warning, without > prejudice of ony partiis rycht. On 29 July 1587, King James VI gave the castle and estate to Alexander Lindsay, 1st Lord Spynie; and they remained in his hands until he surrendered them back to the Crown in December 1605.Reg. Magni Sigill, 1580‚Äî93, No. 1727 During this period in 1595, Spynie was one of the castles that had additional fortification installed as protection against a perceived threat from the Spaniards. =17th century= In 1606, King James restored to the bishopric of Moray the endowments that remained.Miscellany of the Spalding Club, Vol. II, Introduction, p. xlviii Bishop John Guthrie, who was a well known royalist, ceased to be the bishop in 1638 when all bishops were deposed by the general assembly ‚Äì he and his family continued to live at Spynie however. Guthrie refused to subscribe to the Covenant and prepared the castle for a siege which duly arrived in 1640 in the form of Covenanter Col. Sir Robert Monro and his 800 men.Buchanan, George: The History of Scotland, Vol III, 1856 p 551 Interior of David's Tower showing put-log holes for floors and plastered wallsGuthrie surrendered the castle immediately on 16 July and the castle was disarmed, however he was allowed, together with his wife and servants, to stay within the castle. Although under house arrest, Guthrie was forced to pay for the upkeep of the garrison of twenty four men. In September 1640, Guthrie was imprisoned in Aberdeen on rather dubious accusations. The castle was then granted to the Earl of Moray by King Charles I. Elgin and surrounding areas were staunchly anti-RoyalistSimpson, W: The Palace of the Bishops of Moray at Spynie, 1927 and after his victory against the Covenanters at Auldearn on 9 May 1645, James Graham, Marquis of Montrose turned his attention towards Elgin. The Laird of Innes and Grant of Ballindalloch and some burgesses from Elgin prepared the castle for a siege.Spalding, J: Memorials of the Troubles in Scotland and England 1624 ‚Äì 1645, Aberdeen, 1850-1, II, p. 447 Montrose occupied Elgin and burned the homes of leading Covenanter supporters in the town and the farmyard buildings belonging to Spynie but did not attempt to take the castle.Simpson, W: The Palace of the Bishops of Moray at Spynie, 1927 pp. 31,32 Spynie had become the centre for the Covenanters in the area and this fact had not gone un-noticed with the Royalists. The Marquis of Huntly laid siege to the castle in late 1645 leaving Lord Lewis Gordon in charge but the castle's defences held until it was relieved by John Middleton, the future Earl of Middleton.Simpson, W: The Palace of the Bishops of Moray at Spynie, 1927 pp. 32,33 Following the restoration of Episcopacy to the Scottish Church in 1662 ownership of the castle passed back to the church, but it was starting to fall into decay. Parliament granted Bishop Murdo MacKenzie ¬£1000 for repairs and this sustained the building up to 1689Acts of the Parliament of Scotland, vol. VII, pp. 409,410 when the last occupant, Bishop William Hay was expelled after refusing to take an oath of allegiance to King William and Queen Mary.MacLean, A (ed): Elgin Cathedral and the Diocese of Moray,, Inverness, 1974, pp. 8,9 The palace passed into the hands of the Crown and the fine ironwork and wood carvings removed. Local people plundered the walls for stonework for building works until the early 19th century when it passed in the ownership of James Dunbar-Brander of Pitgaveny. It was leased to the Departement of the Works in 1974. The tower by that time had a pronounced bulge in the East wall - the structure being undermined by attempts by covenanters to blow it up. Major work to stabilise the structure was undertaken during the late 1970s using a large scaffold. Ultimately a curtain wall was reinstated disguising a large concrete plinth that prevents the tower from collapsing. The Palace was finally opened by Historic Scotland in 1994.Lewis, Pringle: Spynie Palace and the Bishops of Moray, Edinburgh, 2002, p.10 Notes Main references *Buchanan, George: The History of Scotland, Vol III, 1856 *Donaldson, G: The Foundation of Elgin Cathedral, in Maclean, A 1974 (ed): Elgin Cathedral and Diocese of Moray, Inverness, p. 2 *Fawcett, R: Elgin Cathedral, Edinburgh, 1991 *Lewis, Pringle: Spynie Palace and the Bishops of Moray, Edinburgh, 2002 *MacGibbon; Ross: Castellated and Domestic Architecture of Scotland, Edinburgh, 1887 *Simpson, W D: The Palace of the Bishops of Moray at Spynie, Elgin, 1927 External links * *Mysterious Britain & Ireland: Spynie Palace *Mary, Queen of Scots website Images: Bishop's Palace Ruins,, *Bishop's Church: Category:Episcopal palaces in Scotland Category:Castles in Moray Category:Scheduled Ancient Monuments in Moray Category:Culdees Category:Ruins in Moray Category:Elgin, Moray Category:1150 establishments in Scotland ","title":"Spynie Palace"},{"id":"5638081","text":"Sage oils are essential oils that come in several varieties:  Dalmatian sage oil  Also called English, Garden, and True sage oil.

History =Formation and Colonial operations= First formed on 14 November 1639 as the Springfield Train Band, at Springfield, Massachusetts. This original band trained on the highlands, which George Washington later selected as the site of the United States National Armory. Organized on 7 May 1662 as part of the Massachusetts Militia from several existing Western Massachusetts training bands, and named The Hampshire Regiment because the majority of Western Massachusetts ‚Äì including the region's de facto capital, Springfield ‚Äì was, at the time, located within Hampshire County (After the American Revolution, Hampshire County was split into three separate counties, currently administered by two different New England states ‚Äì Hampden County, Massachusetts, with a capital at the City of Springfield; Hartford County, Connecticut, with a capital at the City of Hartford, and the current Hampshire County, Massachusetts, with a capital at the college town of Northampton). The Hampshire Regiment expanded on 16 November 1748 to form the 1st (South) Hampshire Regiment (i.e. near Springfield,) and the 2nd (North) Hampshire Regiment, (i.e. near Northampton and west.) The 1st Hampshire Regiment expanded on 1 January 1763 to form the 1st Hampshire Regiment (near Springfield,) and the Berkshire Regiment, (Northampton and west, encompassing the relatively recently settled Berkshires.) =Massachusetts Army and the American Revolution= The Hampshire Regiment formed the following Massachusetts Militia units on 27 May 1775 for service at Boston: Danielson's Battalion., Fellows' Battalion, Patterson's Battalion. and Woodbridge's Battalion. 1st and 2nd Hampshire Regiments and Berkshire Regiment reorganized 29 November 1772 as the 9th Division. (Hampshire and Berkshire) Volunteer Light Infantry Companies. These companies serve as the light and flank companies for the Massachusetts Line. During the American Revolution (1775-1783) the Hampshire Regiment formed the following Continental Army units: 1st Massachusetts Regiment, 13th Massachusetts Regiment, Porter's Regiment. Flank (Volunteer Militia) companies in Federal Service September‚ÄìOctober 1814 as elements of the Elite Brigade at Boston. 9th Division, reorganized 1 July 1834 to consist of the Regiment of Light Infantry (Volunteer Militia). Regiment of Light Infantry reorganized and redesignated 24 April 1840 in the Massachusetts Volunteer Militia as the 10th Regiment of Light Infantry =Civil War= Redesignated 26 February 1855 as the 10th Regiment of Infantry. Mustered into Federal Service 21 June 1861 at Springfield, Massachusetts, as the 10th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry Regiment; mustered out of Federal service 6 July 1864 at Springfield. Reorganized 11 November 1868 in the Massachusetts Volunteer Militia as the 2nd Regiment of Infantry. =World War I= Shortly after the United States declared war on Germany in April 1917 the regiment was mustered into Federal service and designated as the 104th Infantry Regiment. The 104th was assigned to the 26th Division (nicknamed the Yankee Division) which was formed from National Guard units from New England. Regarding the United States in World War I, on 10, 12 and 13 April 1918, the lines being held by the troops of the 104th Infantry Regiment, of the 52d Infantry Brigade, of the 26th \\"Yankee\\" Division, in Bois Brule, near Apremont in the Ardennes, were heavily bombarded and attacked by the Germans. At first the Germans secured a foothold in some advanced trenches which were not strongly held but, thereafter, sturdy counterattacks by the 104th Infantry‚Äîat the point of the bayonet and in hand- to-hand combat‚Äîsucceeded in driving the enemy out with serious losses, entirely re-establishing the American line. For its gallantry the 104th Infantry was cited in a general order of the French 32nd Army Corps on 26 April 1918. In an impressive ceremony occurring in a field near Boucq on 28 April 1918, the 104th Infantry's regimental flag was decorated with the Croix de Guerre by French General Fenelon F.G. Passaga. \\"I am proud to decorate the flag of a regiment which has shown such fortitude and courage,\\" he said. \\"I am proud to decorate the flag of a nation which has come to aid in the fight for liberty.\\" Thus, the 104th Infantry became the very first American unit to be honored by a foreign country for exceptional bravery in combat. In addition, 117 members of the 104th Infantry received the award, including its commander, Colonel George H. Shelton.Brief History of the 26th Division in Pictures, published by the \\"Committee of Welcome\\" appointed by the Governor of Massachusetts, Hon. Calvin Coolidge, and the Mayor of Boston, Hon.

The relief was completed on July 9 [1918] following delays due to defensive preparations for an expected German attack. [The] 52nd Brigade HQ was established at La Loge Farm, and the 26th Division HQ was moved up to Chamigny. There were no trenches in the area of the front, little wire and no shelters (dugouts). Rather, defenses were designed for open warfare and consisted of shallow fox-holes covered with brush, positioned to provide mutually supporting fire along with numerous machine gun positions. The outpost line and principal resistance line were separated by a 1,000 yard artillery barrage zone designed to break up any attack that overran the outposts. Occupants of the outposts had the usual mission of fighting to the last man with no hope of reinforcement. At all hours, troops of the outpost line were fired on by machine guns and artillery of the German 7th Army. Food and water had to be carried to the forward troops by ration details through machine gun fire under cover of darkness. The troops suffered a high number of casualties due to heavy gas exposure. Belleau Wood itself was a forest of horror from the hard fighting earlier in June [1918] involving the Marines; equipment, unburied bodies and severed limbs were found still strewn everywhere and hanging in trees with the smell of death and decay heavy in the air.\\"Soldiers' Mail, \\"Letters from a Yankee Doughboy 1916-1919, Champagne-Marne Defensive June‚ÄìJuly 1918,\\" https://worldwar1letters.wordpress.com/the-adventure-unfolds/over- there-1918-1919/champagne-marne-defensive-june-july-1918/ \\"From July 9‚Äì14 [1918], 10,350 high explosive shells fell on the 52nd Brigade sector killing 14 and wounding 84.

Another day-long enemy bombardment occurred across the entire Divisional sector on July 15 [1918], drenching it with mustard gas.

The river flows south into lowlands at the base of the mountain and arrives at Chocorua Lake, noted for its outstanding view of Mount Chocorua.

Local history  In the early 20th century, innkeepers purchased the granite mill dam at the southern end of Moore's Pond on the river in Chocorua village. In 1912, the owners of the Chocorua Inn converted the mill dam into a hydroelectric operation hoping to supply energy to part of the town. A year or so later the dam was demolished in a flood, never to be reconstructed. As the eastern portion of the dam was breached, the levee broke and released two thirds of the pond in a few hours, causing the water level to drop and allowing former marshlands to thrive again.

It is both a boarding and a day school. Rabun Gap is notable for initiating the Foxfire magazine project in 1966, experiential education based on interviewing local people, and writing and publishing articles about their stories and oral traditions. This inspired numerous schools across the country to develop similar programs. In addition to its strong academic program, today it is one of the few schools in the country to include a cirque skills program in its curriculum. The students put on an annual performance. Rabun Gap is home to boarding students from 50 countries and 15 states. History Rabun Gap-Nacoochee School is one of the largest coeducational, college-preparatory boarding schools in the South, serving boarding and day students in grades Pre-K through 12th grade. Boarding starts in 7th grade. Located in Rabun Gap, the campus is cradled in the mountains of northeast Georgia. The school combines a strong academic program, mountain setting, and Presbyterian heritage to nurture and challenge students of diverse backgrounds as they prepare for college and a lifetime of service. Andrew Jackson Ritchie, a Rabun County native, and his wife, Addie Corn Ritchie, founded the Rabun Gap Industrial School in 1903 to serve the children of the isolated and poverty-stricken community Rabun Gap. With $1 and a personal note, Ritchie bought a hilltop for the school. Construction began on the two-story main building, designed by Atlanta architect Haralson Bleckley (son of Rabun County native Logan Bleckley), with pledges of cash support and manual labor. The school was open to both boys and girls. Donations to the school declined during the World War I period (1917‚Äì18), but Ritchie traveled to Boston, Massachusetts, and New York City to solicit funding. He had a unique plan for expansion and development called the Farm Family Settlement Program. Whole families would live at Rabun Gap, with the men learning agriculture, the women studying homemaking and health care, and the children continuing with regular studies. The Carnegie Foundation, the John D. Rockefeller family, and other northern philanthropists provided generous support for his idea. However, it was Ernest Woodruff, of the Coca-Cola Company and Trust Company of Georgia, who proved to be the bedrock supporter of Rabun Gap. According to school legend, Ritchie went door to door in Atlanta's Inman Park neighborhood asking for donations; at the Woodruff home, Emily Winship, Woodruff's wife, contributed money from her household fund and urged her husband to help. (Over time, several members of the Woodruff family, as well as the Robert W. Woodruff Foundation, have made donations to the school.) With additional support from the United Daughters of the Confederacy, the school expanded with more acreage and the construction of farmhouses and barns. The farm family program remained successful until the 1970s, when textile manufacturing became key in Rabun County. After a 1926 stove fire destroyed the school, Rabun Gap merged in 1927 with the Nacoochee Institute, founded in 1903 and formerly located in Sautee, Georgia. Headed by the Reverend John Knox Coit, the Nacoochee Institute was a boarding school for boys and girls as well as a public school for the students of White County. Six weeks after Rabun Gap's fire, the schoolhouse of the Nacoochee Institute burned as well. In September 1928 the Rabun Gap-Nacoochee School opened at Rabun Gap with a new school building. Ritchie served as president and Coit as co-president. In 1927 the new school established a covenant with the Presbyterian Church (later PCUSA), a relationship that still exists. In 1934 Ritchie and members of the board of trustees added two years of junior college to the Rabun Gap curriculum. Training teachers for the county was a main goal, and courses were patterned after those offered at the University of Georgia. World War II (1941‚Äì45) brought an end to the junior college program, as the war siphoned off enrollment. The end of the 1930s brought numerous changes in leadership for Rabun Gap-Nacoochee School. Following the retirement of Ritchie and Coit, George Bellingrath served as president from 1939 to 1948. O.C. Skinner, former industrial manager of the Berry School in Rome, Georgia (founded by educator Martha Berry), was president from 1949 to 1956. Several buildings were added during Skinner's tenure, including the Addie Corn Ritchie Dining Hall, the Emily and Ernest Woodruff Chapel wing to Hodgson Hall, the Annie Lee Jones Library wing of Hodgson Hall, and the Arthur W. Smith Industrial Shop. From 1956 to 1984 Karl K. Anderson served as president. Under his leadership the Andrew Jackson Ritchie Gymnasium, the O.C. Skinner Natatorium, and four dormitory residence halls named for George Woodruff (son of Ernest), Irene Woodruff (wife of George), Ernest Woodruff, and Karl Anderson were built. Financial support also came from the Rabun Gap-Nacoochee guilds of Athens and Atlanta, the Rabun Gap-Nacoochee Club of Atlanta, and the Presbyterian Church. In 1966 students in the English class started writing and publishing Foxfire, a quarterly magazine with their articles based on their interviews with local residents about Appalachian culture. It was a project initiated by the teacher Eliot Wigginton to engage students in learning to use proper English. It gained national attention after a collection of articles was published in book form in 1972 and became a surprise bestseller. The magazine and book (followed by more) aroused people's interest in traditional crafts and skills at a time when some people were trying to live more simply. Having partly functioned as a public school for students in the north end of Rabun County, Rabun Gap-Nacoochee School became fully private in the fall of 1977, as Rabun County consolidated its public high schools. Struggling financially with the loss of public monies, the school suffered from less stable enrollment and the need to reconnect with its core strengths from the past. Anderson retired as president in 1984, and his successors were the Reverend Bruce Dodd (1984‚Äì92), Robert Johnston (1992‚Äì96), and Gregory Zeigler (1996‚Äì2004). They moved to create a college-preparatory curriculum and enforce more rigorous admissions standards. A building program, funded in part by a bequest of George Woodruff, resulted in the Morris Brown Science Building, the Arts and Technology Building, a new library, and athletic fields. From 2004 until 2011, John Marshall was the head of Rabun Gap-Nacoochee School. The school gained ground in a host of important areas, including enrollment, student support services, competitive athletics, alumni relations, board development, annual giving growth, and facilities and grounds upkeep. Dr. Anthony Sgro served as Head of School from 2011-2019. Under his leadership, the School opened the Evelyne Sheats Lower School and expanded to serving students of all ages, from Pre‚ÄìK to 12th grade. Dr. Sgro also helped grow Rabun Gap's international student population increase to represent 50 countries. Jeff Miles became the eleventh Head of School in 2019. He came to Rabun Gap after serving almost two decades at Christ School in Arden, NC. At Christ School, Miles worked in administration as Assistant Head of School and has extensive experience in student life, communications, teaching, and coaching. The Rabun Gap motto of \\"Work, Study, Worship\\" is still dominant. Today, a small number of students are the first generation in their families to attend college. Over 75% of students receive some form of financial aid. Enrollment averages 600, with more than 60% boarding students in the Upper School. The School continues its historic commitment to financial aid, allocating over $3.5 million annually through the advent of Georgia's tax credit program coupled with the generosity of the school's constituencies and endowment interest. Student life Rabun Gap is one of few schools in the United States that offer a cirque program as part of the curriculum. They have an impressive array of apparatuses, including trapeze, German wheel, aerial silks, aerial hoop, Spanish web, triple trapeze, and aerial cube. Each spring, the school puts on a cirque performance and packs the Rearden Theater for sold-out performances. The school also has a climbing wall, and a private lake (Indian Lake) for water activities. Ongoing events at Rabun Gap include MAD Fest (the annual talent show and contest) and annual sporting events. Rabun Gap has seven dorms: one middle school and junior girls' dorm (George), one exclusive senior dorm (Jane), three high school boys dorms (one of which is shared with middle school boys) (Bellingrath, Ernest, Irene), one freshman girls' dorm (Anderson), and one sophomore-junior girls' dorm (Coit).

Series creator David Simon next considered American actor John C. Reilly, but he declined because his wife did not wish to move to Baltimore. For his audition tape, West was asked to record a scene between McNulty and his partner, Bunk Moreland. With only a day to record, and no one suitable to record with, he recorded himself reading his own dialogue and left gaps of silence for Moreland's dialogue, reacting appropriately. Simon described watching the tape with casting director Alexa L. Fogel: \\"We fell around the room laughing, like, 'What the...? Despite the unusual tape, and West's dubious American accent, Simon found his ability to react to non-existent dialogue impressive. Fogel described West as \\"too young\\" and \\"too attractive\\" to play the character, but found that he understood McNulty's psychology. She took West to do a reading for Chris Albrecht, then the president of HBO Original Programming, who had final say on the casting. Albrecht assented, but told Fogel \\"You better be right.\\" Character storyline Of Irish Catholic descent, McNulty grew up in the Lauraville neighborhood of Baltimore, Maryland. His father was an employee for Bethlehem Steel before being laid off in 1973. After a year of attending Loyola College in Maryland (now Loyola University Maryland), McNulty joined the Baltimore Police Department [EOD (Entrance on Duty) date April 5, 1994] when his girlfriend Elena (whom he later married) became pregnant. In his first few years on the job, he proved himself to be an effective patrolman in the Western District, under the command of Major Howard \\"Bunny\\" Colvin. After assisting Ray Cole in solving a homicide, McNulty was promoted to detective and assigned to the Homicide Unit, where he was partnered with Bunk Moreland. =Season 1= Before the start of the series, McNulty has noticed that drug kingpin Avon Barksdale is expanding his organization's territory, and that his gang has successfully beaten several murder prosecutions. After Avon's nephew D'Angelo is acquitted thanks to witness tampering, McNulty goes over the head of his superior, Major Bill Rawls, and convinces Judge Phelan to call Deputy Commissioner Ervin Burrell to encourage further investigation of the Barksdales. Because of McNulty's efforts, the Barksdale detail is officially formed, initially comprising Narcotics Lieutenant Cedric Daniels and his three detectives: Kima Greggs, Ellis Carver, and Thomas \\"Herc\\" Hauk. When Burrell asks his majors and shift lieutenants to send additional detectives for the investigative detail, McNulty is also assigned to the unit. Daniels and McNulty argue about how to handle the case at their first meeting: McNulty, after seeing an FBI drug sting, suggests surveillance and wiretaps, but Burrell has ordered Daniels to put together a quick and simple case to appease Phelan. Soon after the investigation begins, McNulty learns from his friend in the FBI, Terence \\"Fitz\\" Fitzhugh, that Daniels had been investigated for having a suspiciously large amount of liquid assets. McNulty's relationship with Daniels continues to be complicated by their mutual distrust. The detail is assigned as a prosecutor Assistant State's Attorney Rhonda Pearlman (\\"Ronnie\\"), with whom McNulty is having a casual sexual relationship. McNulty is officially separated from his wife, who limits his contact with his two sons, Sean and Michael. While at the market with his sons one afternoon, McNulty spots Stringer Bell, Avon Barksdale's second-in-command, and sends his sons to tail him and get his license plate number. When Elena finds out, she seeks an emergency order to stop McNulty from seeing the boys. She is also angry that McNulty continues to see Pearlman casually. Working on the Barksdale detail, McNulty becomes friends with Lester Freamon, who had previously been exiled to the pawn shop unit for 13 years and four months, as punishment for his insistence on charging a politically connected fence. Freamon often tries to temper McNulty's animosity towards Daniels. Frustrated that Barksdale's dealers do not use cell phones, they decide to clone the dealers' pagers instead. They also work together to convince Daniels to allow them to do better police work. With the help of Kima, McNulty tracks down the elusive outlaw Omar Little, and gains Omar's respect and cooperation. Omar agrees to testify against Marquis \\"Bird\\" Hilton, a Barksdale soldier. His assistance also leads to McNulty's inadvertently solving one of Michael Santangelo's old cases; the grateful Santangelo in turn reveals that he is a mole for Rawls, who is looking for an excuse to fire McNulty. Kima introduces McNulty to her confidential informant, Bubbles. When Kima is shot in a buy- bust sting operation gone wrong, McNulty is guilt-ridden, although even Rawls assures him that the shooting is not his fault. McNulty has a frank discussion with Daniels in which he admits that the Barksdale case is no more than an exercise in intellectual vanity and an opportunity to demonstrate the BPD's shortcomings. Daniels tells him that everyone has known this all along, but the case has taken on meaning for those involved. The detail succeeds in arresting Barksdale soldier Wee-Bey Brice for shooting Kima, Bird for murdering a state's witness, and both D'Angelo and Avon Barksdale. McNulty almost convinces D'Angelo to testify against Avon but at his mother's insistence, D'Angelo takes a 20-year prison sentence instead. When the Barksdale detail closes, Rawls reassigns McNulty to the marine unit, having learned from Sergeant Jay Landsman that this is precisely the BPD unit where McNulty does not want to go. =Season 2= While on harbor patrol, McNulty spots the body of a dead woman in the water. When Rawls argues the case is not in his jurisdiction, McNulty spends three hours poring over wind and tide charts to prove the death occurred within city limits. When port authority police officer Beadie Russell finds thirteen dead women in a shipping container on the Baltimore docks, McNulty again intervenes and, with the help of the medical examiner, proves that the deaths were not accidental: the air pipe to the container was deliberately closed off, and, with the help of a mining engineer, the investigators are able to prove that the ship was within the city limits when it happened. The case is given to Bunk and Lester, who don't look forward to investigating these difficult cases. McNulty unsuccessfully searches for the identity of the floater. He also finds himself under pressure from Bunk to find Omar, since Bird is about to go on trial. McNulty coerces Bubbles into tracking down Omar, who testifies against Bird. Meanwhile, McNulty signs an agreement that he will pay alimony to Elena, even though he believes his marriage is still salvageable. He resolves to give up alcohol and detective work, two of the main reasons for the breakup of his marriage. When Elena confirms the marriage is over, he grows despondent and relapses. When Daniels's unit is re-formed to investigate stevedore union boss Frank Sobotka, Rawls refuses to allow McNulty to rejoin the team. McNulty seems to accept this with good grace but tries to help the detail unofficially. Daniels persuades Rawls to let McNulty return by taking on the murders of the fourteen women. McNulty's first assignment is to go undercover as a client visiting a local brothel, much to the amusement of his colleagues'. He also flirts with Russell, who has been assigned to Daniels' detail, although he seems to shy away from a relationship. While on surveillance, McNulty watches Spiros Vondas, an associate of an underworld figure known as The Greek, sending a text message. McNulty reasons that the time and location of the text could be used to retrieve it from the phone company's databases, and it is from this message that the detail learns the Greek had shut down his operations. After McNulty learns from Bubbles that Stringer Bell and Barksdale rival Proposition Joe are sharing territory, he begins investigating them on his own time, convinced that he can gather enough evidence to prompt Daniels to focus the Major Crimes Unit's attention on Stringer. =Season 3= McNulty continues to work with the MCU but is disappointed that their target is not Bell. He begins looking into the Barksdales anyway, finding out about D'Angelo's death and Avon's early release. Investigating D'Angelo's death, which has been listed as a suicide, McNulty quickly realizes that D'Angelo was murdered. McNulty reconnects with Colvin to set up the Barksdale organization as the MCU's primary target. McNulty circumvents the chain of command again to set up the investigation, as Daniels is not interested in the quality of the unit's assigned case targets, blaming his rank in the department for his lack of case target interests. Angered by McNulty's attitude, Daniels makes it clear that he's forcing McNulty out when Stringer is arrested. McNulty begins a relationship with political consultant Theresa D'Agostino but ends it when he realizes that she is only interested in him physically and is pumping him for information about Colvin. Largely due to Freamon's work, the MCU implicates Stringer, but Stringer is murdered before McNulty can arrest him. After Avon is arrested, Daniels reevaluates his decision to get rid of McNulty, but McNulty, thinking about something Freamon had remarked about to him earlier in the season, realizes he has no life outside his work and graciously declines Daniels' offer to keep him in the unit. He transfers to patrol in the Western District, which he remembers as the happiest time of his life, and begins a relationship with Russell. =Season 4= McNulty moves in with Russell and her two children, and enjoys his life as a patrolman in the Western District under Ellis Carver. McNulty's beat includes the corner that Bodie Broadus works on behalf of drug kingpin Marlo Stanfield. Both Daniels and Administrative Lieutenant Dennis Mello ask McNulty to do investigative work in the district, but he declines. Mello is disappointed, but Daniels realizes that McNulty has been able to get his life in order while working as a patrolman. Although other officers make arrests for statistical purposes, McNulty focuses on quality arrests. This is exemplified by the arrest of two burglars who were stealing from churches. McNulty mentors Brian Baker, a younger patrol officer in the Western, whom he and Bunk end up referring to as \\"good police\\". McNulty also significantly reduces his drinking, sometimes resolving to stay sober despite pressure from his friends. Bunk and Freamon are amazed and slightly dismayed at how much McNulty has changed, and Elena even expresses regret for having left him. McNulty soon begins to miss the MCU and quietly begins getting closer to Bodie in the hopes of turning him into an informant against Marlo. After Stanfield lieutenant Monk Metcalf sees Bodie with McNulty, Marlo has Bodie killed as a precaution. McNulty feels guilty and rejoins the MCU, much to Freamon and Daniels' delight. It is revealed during a scene shortly after Bodie's death that McNulty feels he \\"owes it to the kid\\". =Season 5= With the BPD scaled back due to Mayor Tommy Carcetti's budget cuts and the vacant murders unsolved, McNulty is despondent and falls back into old habits. Shortly after being transferred back to Homicide, he visits the morgue, finds two county detectives arguing with the medical examiner, and subsequently learns that pre-mortem and post-mortem strangulations are forensically indistinguishable. He applies what he learns to a probable overdose case he is investigating with Bunk, and tampers with the crime scene to make it seem that a struggle occurred, and over Bunk's protests, McNulty strangles and stages the corpse to make it appear as if a serial killer has come to Baltimore. McNulty sets out on his ruse in the hopes that such a case will secure more funding for Homicide and the Stanfield investigation. Thus, he doctors case files and plants evidence in order to link cases together to create the impression of a serial killer targeting homeless men. When Landsman ignores the case, McNulty approaches reporter Alma Gutierrez of The Baltimore Sun, but only succeeds in the story's getting printed in the middle of the paper instead of on the front page. Bunk repeatedly warns McNulty against this self- destructive course; Lester, however, approves of the endeavor and suggests that it needs sensationalism to succeed. When McNulty finds that most dead homeless men are concentrated in the Southern District, Freamon puts him in touch with an old patrol partner there who agrees to tip them off when new bodies are found. Freamon also devises a plan to show maturation in their serial killer's pattern, and acquires dentures to create bite marks on the victims, thus enhancing the media appeal for the story. While canvassing an area frequented by the local homeless population, McNulty complains that Landsman barely noticed his work on the case, but Freamon reminds him that if their plan works, the case will attract more interest, and sloppiness could be their downfall. Upon returning home, McNulty is confronted by Russell about his drinking and philandering. Upon finding a new body, McNulty mutilates the corpse to show bite marks and defensive wounds. When investigating the \\"homeless killer\\", McNulty and Greggs travel to the FBI Academy in Quantico, Virginia for assistance. McNulty realizes that he can no longer falsify the murders on real corpses as there is too large a police presence, so he instead takes a mentally ill homeless man off the streets and stages a photograph of a murder to send to Sun reporter Scott Templeton, before taking the man to a homeless shelter in Richmond with fake identification. McNulty has been voicing the killer in telephone calls to Templeton. After doing the voice analysis, the FBI provides McNulty and Greggs with a psychological profile of the homeless killer, inadvertently giving a near-perfect description of McNulty himself. Having his character flaws spelled out for him gives McNulty second thoughts about what he has done. He confesses his deception to Greggs, who in turn informs Daniels, now the BPD's Deputy Commissioner for Operations. Daniels and Pearlman subsequently meet with Acting Commissioner Rawls, State's Attorney Rupert Bond, and the mayor's office. Daniels and Rawls confront McNulty, informing him that this will be his last CID case. The case is \\"solved\\" when McNulty encounters a mentally ill homeless man who has started using the modus operandi of the phony serial killer. McNulty brings the man to justice, in his final case. McNulty and Freamon then leave the police department. After attending a detective's wake (for their careers) in their honor, McNulty leaves the bar sober and returns home, where he and Russell have reconciled. The next day, McNulty returns to Richmond, finds the homeless man he had put there, and drives him back to Baltimore. On the way back, he stops his car, gets out, and looks at the city, leading to the series-ending montage. Critical response and analysis Jim Shelley of The Guardian found McNulty \\"irresistibly charming, a classic anti-hero, a modern-day Rockford.\\" Jon Garelick of the Boston Phoenix remarked that McNulty is not precisely the central character despite his actions' starting most of the plotlines, and wrote he preferred other characters to McNulty's ‚Äúone-dimensional functionality as the Dirty Jimmy of the series‚Äù. James Norton of Flak Magazine commented on how McNulty seems to fit to a standard police character archetype (\\"He has poor impulse control. He's personally fearless and outspoken, and he bangs babes like a hunchback rings bells...\\") but ends up subverting the archetype by being self-destructive and ‚Äúkind of a jerk‚Äù. Dan Kois of Salon described McNulty as \\"The heart, soul and oft-impaired nervous system of 'The Wire'\\", characterizing him as a central character. Kois also named McNulty's pride as his main character trait, noting this aspect of his personality made McNulty a successful investigator and a failure in most other aspects of his life. Gillian Flinn of Entertainment Weekly observed McNulty offered one of the show's most wicked ironies: he is one of the characters you would expect to be on the side of law and order as a police detective but they describe him as a \\"boozing cop who pisses on authority and order.\\" An essay from Bowling Green State University uses a hegemonic viewpoint to examine McNulty's stereotyped qualities of ‚Äúwhite macho masculinity‚Äù (such as sexual conquest, alcohol abuse, and resistance to authority), and what the show does in the end to reveal them as emotionally stunting and self-destructive. Origins David Simon, the character's creator, has described his goal of presenting McNulty as ambiguous in his motivations. Based on his experiences with real detectives, Simon feels that most crime dramas present their police characters with the falsehood that they care deeply about the victims in the cases they are investigating. Simon states that in his experience, a good detective is usually motivated by the game of solving the crime--he sees the crime as an \\"insult to his intellectual vanity\\", and this gives him motivation to solve it. The character was originally named Jimmy McArdle, but because no one liked the name, executive producer Robert F. Colesberry suggested renaming him Jimmy McNulty (after his maternal grandmother). The McArdle surname was reused for the character of \\"White Mike\\" McArdle in season 2. Dominic West's original audition tape for the part was recorded with him as the sole actor leaving spaces for the lines that would be spoken back to him. The producers were amused by the tape and agreed that they had to give him an audition.

It was the sixth published of the seven Chrestomanci books (1977 to 2006).Chrestomanci series at ISFDB. Conrad is the protagonist, a twelve-year-old boy sent to work at the local Stallery castle with a magical mission to kill someone neither named nor described. Fifteen- year-old Christopher Chant (The Lives of Christopher Chant) applies for work at the same time on a personal mission. They are both hired. The Chrestomanci books are collectively named for a powerful enchanter and British government official in a world parallel to ours, who supervises the use of magic ‚Äîor the Chrestomanci, an office that requires a powerful enchanter and is responsible for supervising. Conrad's Fate is set perhaps three decades ago in a world quite different from ours, during the adolescence of Christopher Chant who is Chrestomanci in five of the books. Plot summary Conrad Tesdinic lives in Stallery, a small town in the English Alps, a mountain range present in Series Seven worlds where the British Isles are still connected to the European mainland. Conrad's father is dead; his sister Anthea has left home to go to university; and his mother, Franconia, is an eccentric feminist author whose books are sold exclusively in her brother's bookshop, where she and Conrad also live. In the mountains high above Stallery lies Stallery Mansion, known as a \\"possibilities mansion,\\" and home to the Count and his family. Conrad's uncle tells him that someone up at Stallery Mansion is pulling the possibilities ‚Äì that is, changing the details of the world. Judging from the affluence of Stallery, this person is making a great deal of money by doing so, perhaps by playing the stock market; but this is adversely affecting the rest of the world. At first only small details change ‚Äì the colour of the postboxes, the titles of books ‚Äì but the changes keep getting bigger and bigger. According to his uncle, Conrad is going to die within the year unless he kills the person pulling the possibilities‚Äîsomeone he should have eliminated in a past life. To kill this person, Conrad will need to secure a position at Stallery Mansion, and then summon a Walker, someone who will give Conrad what he needs to defeat his nameless foe. Conrad's uncle and his group of magician friends work a strange spell on a cork, giving Conrad, who has possession of it, the power to summon a Walker at will. Conrad needs to be sure who this person is before he summons the Walker, however, so instead of moving forward in school with his friends, he is sent to work at Stallery and study its inhabitants, one of which is the person Conrad needs to defeat. Conrad soon finds that he is not the only one snooping around the mansion. He befriends his fellow servant-in-training, Christopher \\"Smith\\" (really Christopher Chant), who is searching for his friend Millie. Together, they discover that she is trapped in one of the possibilities. Conrad and Christopher must stop the person behind all the mischief, rescue Millie, and fix Conrad's fate, all without spilling soup on the Countess although Conrad's bad Karma isn't helping along the way. Characters Conrad Tesdinic: Conrad decides to take an alias at Stallery, and calls himself \\"Conrad Grant\\", as \\"Grant\\" is his uncle Alfred's surname. Christopher suspects this is false, and so calls him \\"Grant\\" in a superior and often sarcastic way all throughout the book. Conrad's uncle runs the bookshop in town, and so he has a great love of books ‚Äì which makes the pulling of the possibilities very irritating for him, as the book titles and minor details within the books change overnight. He brings his camera with him to Stallery and makes great use of it. Christopher Chant: Christopher also has an alias: \\"Christopher Smith\\". The character we see here is around fifteen, older than in The Lives of Christopher Chant, but younger than in the other Chrestomanci books. He is witty, confident, charming, he also seems to have a very soft spot for Millie. Christopher can often talk his way out of a situation, even though he goes rather vague at times... Millie: Christopher's friend. She becomes lost in the possibilities at Stallery while running away from boarding school. Christopher's chief reason for coming to Stallery is to find her. When found by Conrad she becomes a maid for a while. Mr. Amos: The pear-shaped, severe butler of Stallery. He insists on discipline and impeccable dress at all times. But even through his reiteration of and insistence on a servant's place, Conrad and Christopher cannot help but feel that there is more to his place than he is letting on. Anthea Tesdinic: Conrad's sister, who left home a few years before the bulk of the story. Appears again in a sticky mess she can't see. Count Robert: The supposed owner of Stallery who marries Anthea. His real name is Robert Brown. Awards Seventh rank for the annual Locus Award, young adult book.\\"Diana Wynne Jones\\" .

It was directed by J. Lee Thompson and written by Norman Aladjem, Robert Gosnell and Jeffrey M. Rosenbaum. This was the first comedic role for Norris, giving him a chance to poke fun at his action persona. Plot Max Donigan and Leo Porter are two \\"seasoned\\" treasure hunters whose adventures rarely result in any notable success. After their latest stint gone wrong, they are recruited by a seemingly-psychic woman, Patricia Goodwin, owner of a treasure map. She convinces them that the map leads to a huge stockpile of gold belonging to the \\"Firewalker.\\" She then says that someone, or thing, else is searching for the map: a red cyclops. The map leads them to a cave on a local Native American Reservation. Patricia warns them that the cave is home to \\"old people, sleeping\\"; they later discover it is a mass grave filled with skeletons. They find a Spanish Conquistador helmet and mural depicting Aztec and Mayan art, with an anachronistic date of 1527. As Leo studies the mural, Max finds a ruby-pommeled dagger hidden inside a skull. They are ambushed inside the cave by a small group of men and Patricia is taken by one of them. After killing their attackers, Max and Leo confront the kidnapper; upon seeing the dagger, he screams and throws himself into a pit. While discussing the nature of the dagger at a local bar, Max, Leo and Patricia hear from the barkeep about El Coyote: a local that believes himself descended from the Aztecs ‚Äîand also happens to be a one-eyed man with an eye patch. The barkeep also directs them to Tall Eagle, a local Native American. He tells them that the Firewalker was a powerful being that flew away to walk in the fires of the sun and gives Patricia a small bag of \\"magic\\" to protect her. While trying to figure out where to go next, Patricia stabs the dagger into a map, then faints, giving them a location of San Miguel. Max is later drugged by a woman; El Coyote chants while holding a snake as the woman attempts to murder Max. A chanting Tall Eagle causes Patricia to suddenly wake and rush to Max's defense; she and Leo stop the woman from succeeding. They capture her, but she disappears overnight and a snake appears in her cell. They travel to San Miguel and barter for information. A man named Boggs directs them to a contact in a village named Chajal; Boggs is later seen to have been working for, and is killed by, El Coyote. Dressed as priests and a nun to avoid detection, the trio make it to Chajal and find it completely deserted. Local militia chase them into the jungle on foot; they escape and make camp for the night. They are found in the morning by a friend of Max's: Corky Taylor, leader of a small group of Central American freedom fighters, who provides them with a vehicle to finish their journey. When they stop that night, Leo disappears; Patricia and Max believe him dead when they find blood and his glasses by the alligator-infested river. The next morning, Patricia and Max find the temple they have been searching for. Inside, they find Leo alive and dangling from a rope, along with El Coyote. He offers Leo in exchange for the dagger, claiming he has no use for the three of them. After suggesting that Patricia can go free, she leaves and is sealed in a passageway. El Coyote laughs and explains that he will kill them and sacrifice Patricia to appease the gods and become the Firewalker. Max throws the dagger at El Coyote to kill him, but he catches it and leaves the chamber. Max rescues Leo as El Coyote prepares to kill Patricia. They reach her just in time; Max shoots El Coyote in the chest, seemingly killing him. Patricia finds the gold by placing the dagger in a slot on the altar, opening a chamber below it. After gathering the gold, El Coyote attacks them. Patricia stabs him in the back with the dagger just as he prepares to kill Max. With El Coyote stunned, Max is able to fight back, kicking him onto the altar. Patricia then sprinkles the magic bag on El Coyote's body; he bursts into flame as they leave the temple with the gold and the trio reap the rewards of their successful journey.

Gosnell had written Firewalker and showed it to Norris, who decided to make it instead of the comedy. The film was Norris' first comedy, even though it was still an action movie. It was described as \\"two guys, a girl and a Jeep on the road to a fortune in lost Aztec treasure.\\" \\"It's a detour,\\" said Norris. \\"Max Donegan is really the lighter side of Chuck Norris.\\" He added, \\"It's just an open, friendly, warm film with a lot of humor. It has the adventure of a Romancing the Stone and Raiders of the Lost Ark, the humor of the movie Crocodile Dundee -- where the situations cause the humor -- and the companionship between the two guys like Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.\\" Norris says that Cannon's chairman, Menahem Golan, showed \\"a little skepticism\\" when Norris first took the film to him to develop. \\"It's not the type of film I'm known for doing,\\" said Norris. But Norris had a seven year deal with Cannon and was their leading box office star along with Charles Bronson. \\"Whether I do more lighter-type films beyond this one will be determined by how Firewalker does,\\" said Norris. \\"The audience tells you what you'll be doing or not doing. Like Stallone - - he'll never do Rhinestone again.\\" Norris knew he was taking a risk. He said, \\"When I got crucified in my first film, Good Guys Wear Black, I went to Steve McQueen. He said the bottom line is if you get the best reviews in the world and the movie bombs, you're not going to get work. But if it's a huge success, whether the criticism is good or bad, you'll work. The key thing is -- does the public accept you?\\" Filming took place in Mexico in June 1986. \\"I learned to speak Spanish and had a splendid time,\\" said Anderson. \\"Chuck was incredible to work with, such a nice man... J. Lee was a character. Some days the heat got to him worse than others. He would get tired and cranky, but we got along great. At the time, I had no idea the director in The Exorcist was based on him. And even though it was a Cannon film, I got all my money!‚Äù Reception =Critical response= Firewalker received overwhelmingly negative reviews. On At the Movies, both Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert gave the film \\"thumbs down\\".Siskel & Ebert review Firewalker on At the Movies at YouTube. Retrieved on 2010-11-07 from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ReXLXpmM0M. Siskel said Firewalker was \\"one of the most derivative films in years, imitating elements of Raiders of the Lost Ark and Romancing the Stone\\". He went on saying he believed \\"the movie was probably signed as a deal one month after the grosses started coming in for Romancing, and that was where the creativity stopped\\". Ebert said that he \\"would have tried to make a movie that didn't look like all those other adventure movies but cheap, watered-down, pale and uninteresting\\". In his print review, Ebert gave Firewalker 1 star out of 4: > ...the film is a free-form anthology of familiar images from the works of > Steven Spielberg, subjected to a new process that we could call > discolorization...[the film] lacked the style, witty dialogue and magic of > the current adventure pictures, as it borrowed its closing images from the > Indiana Jones movies, but its press notes optimistically claim the movie is > \\"in the tradition\\" of Romancing the Stone. In literature, it's called > plagiarism. In the movies, it's homage. Vincent Canby of The New York Times called the film \\"a bargain-basement imitation of films on the order of Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom and Romancing the Stone\\". Canby also noted Norris's lack of comedic timing as he \\"stomped on the film's facetious dialogue\\". TV Guide published a largely negative review, criticizing Norris's \\"usual wooden\\" performance, the \\"appallingly bad\\" production values and the \\"flat, uninteresting\\" writing. The publication also noted Firewalker heavily \\"borrowing\\" elements from other successful adventure films, calling it \\"a cross between Raiders of the Lost Ark and a buddy picture\\". A review in Variety said, \\"Chuck Norris' latest outing for Cannon suffers from boilerplate scripting that sabotages whatever hope there may have been that a buddy pic with the estimable Lou Gossett would be compelling. Duo moves predictably through a search-for-the-gold yarn that is devoid of suspense.\\"\\"Film Reviews: Firewalker\\". Variety. November 26, 1986. 14. In a review written by Rita Kempley of The Washington Post, Norris was described as pleasant galoot that lacked Arnold Schwarzenegger's (a more popular and successful action star) sense of self parody and comic timing. Kempley felt \\"the fight scenes were fine, but they only emphasize the plodding pace and the moldy plot; a blend of Poltergeist II, Temple of Doom and Romancing the Stone\\". On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 8% based on reviews from 12 critics. On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 37 out of 100, based on 8 critics, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\". =Box Office= The film was one of Cannon's strongest performing movies at the box office in 1986. However it was a relative disappointment compared to other Norris films, earning a little over $10 million. It was ultimately considered a flop. Cannon went into financial receivership soon afterwards. Home media Firewalker was released on DVD by MGM Home Video March 22, 2005.

In 726, the Annals of Tigernach report that \\"Drest was cast from the kingdom of the Picts; and Alp√≠n reigned in his stead.\\"AT 726.4: Druist de reghno Pictorum iectus et Elphin pro eo [regnat]. In 728-729, a war in Pictland involving Alp√≠n, Drest, Nechtan and √ìengus is reported in various sources. Alp√≠n appears to have been the initial opponent of Nechtan and √ìengus. He was first defeated by √ìengus at Monaidh Craeb, for which Monicrieffe near Perth has been suggested, where his son was killed. A second defeat led to Alp√≠n's flight and Nechtan being restored as king. Drest was killed the following year, but Alp√≠n's fate is not known. Whether this Alp√≠n has any connection to the \\"Elffin son of Crup\\" who the Annals of Ulster say was besieged in 742, by whom is not said, is not known. Likewise, whether there is any connection between this Alp√≠n and the Alp√≠n mac Echdach who may have ruled in D√°l Riata in the 730s is also unknown. Anderson notes that the capture of \\"El√©n son of Corp and of Conamail son of Cano\\" is recorded by the Annals of Ulster circa 673. This Conamail was probably the Conamail son of Cano killed in 705. If the report of 742 refers to this Alp√≠n, then his father's name was Crup. Some versions of the Pictish Chronicle king lists include a king named Alp√≠n son of Feret or Feredach, but this appears to be the later king, Alp√≠n II, Alp√≠n son of Uuroid. The small number of sources which refer to a king named Alp√≠n son of √ìengus, again probably refer to Alp√≠n II.Early Sources, p. cxxxv, note 7 & p. cxxvii, note 1.

It forms a mucus house every four hours at 20 degrees Celsius. This house has a coarse mesh to keep out big particles, and a fine mesh that collects the small particles, down to the nanoplankton that includes (pelagic) bacteria. Abandoned mucus houses sink to the deep, collecting organic particles during their descent. They make an important contribution to marine snow, since Oikopleura is abundant and is a very active filterer, using powerful strokes of its tail. Its abundance is less obvious from preserved samples (that are usually analyzed) because the gelatinous body disappears in the preservation process while leaving hardly any trace. Species of Oikopleura have the smallest genomes in the animal kingdom, only about 75Mb. Oikopleura contains bioluminescent species. About half of Oikopleura species are bioluminescent.

Oikopleura dioica A species of particular interest under this genus is the Oikopleura dioica, which is an anomaly among chordates. It has retained the fundamental body plan of the chordate; yet, it has lost the mechanism for retinoic acid signaling which operates during chordate development. The loss raises the question of the evolutionary constraints that have prevented similar changes in the other chordates. Oikopleura dioica hox genes are distributed in nine locations around the genome whereas other chordates have a cluster of hox genes.[Nature 2 Sept 2004] Of note, this is the first chordate among the eukaryotes found to have operons.

It was followed by seven official sequels, one official spin-off entitled \\"Ghost of Camp Blood\\" and one unofficial film entitled Within the Woods. Camp Blood stars Jennifer Ritchkoff as a young woman who travels to a deserted camp with her friends, only to find themselves at the mercies of a killer clown. The film had a home video release on April 4, 2000 and was released to DVD in 2002. Plot A guide and a tourist are birdwatching in the shades of Camp Blackwood. They are suddenly attacked by a man wearing a boiler suit and clown mask with a machete. Two hunters come and discover the guide still alive. The clown then appears and murders all of them. The story then focuses on four campers, who are planning a trip to Camp Blackwood. On the way, they meet the madcap Bromley Thatcher. After a brief exchange that includes a warning from Thatcher - \\"I'm not talking about a ghost here boy, I'm talking about a man, a REAL man, and he's in those woods!\\" - the group head into Camp Blackwood, now known to the audience as 'Camp Blood'. In the woods, they meet their guide, a butch lesbian known as 'Harris'. After spending the day doing menial tasks such as collecting firewood and setting up camp, the group settle down into their respective tents to enjoy a session of late-night love making. The group awake in the morning to find the burnt-out carcass of Harris on the campfire (apparently murdered by the killer clown). The majority of the plot then revolves around the clown chasing the various characters through the woods and brutally murdering all of them but Tricia, who manages to run away from the clown. In attempting to escape the murderous clown, Tricia runs to her deceased boyfriend's automobile. At this point, she meets Thatcher, who attempts to aid the clown by hindering Tricia's escape. In the ensuing melee, Tricia hacks Thatcher to death with the clown's machete, and enters the car and runs over the clown, who is revealed to be Harris. Just as Tricia is driving away safely, the clown appears in the back seat and strangles Tricia into unconsciousness. When Tricia regains consciousness, she is in a mental asylum. After giving Tricia an injection, the 'doctors' depart from the room. It is at this point that Tricia hallucinates the clown entering the room. Cast * Jennifer Ritchkoff - Tricia Young * Michael Taylor - Steven Jessup/Doctor West * Tim Young - Jason Helman/Detective Hamlin * Bethany Zolt - Nicole Starry/Nurse * Courtney Taylor - Harris Stanley * Joseph Haggerty - Bromley Thatcher * Merideth O'Brien - Sally Brennan * Vinnie Bilancio - Victor Konenkamp * Ron Ford - Gus Franco * Tim Sullivan - George Guffy * Ivonne Armant - Mary Lou Maloney * Randy Rice - Nathan Cobb (Mary Lou's Lover) * Shemp Moseley - The Clown Ivonne Armant's character shares a name with the ghostly slasher Mary Lou Maloney from Hello Mary Lou: Prom Night II (1987) and Prom Night III: The Last Kiss (1990). However, since Armant's character seems strictly mortal in nature, it is presumed that the two characters are not meant to be one and the same. Reception Digital Retribution gave the film a mixed score of one out of five, calling it \\"a fairly typical slasher\\", and criticized the film's acting, script, and poor gore effects.  Sequels  Sykes quickly followed up his 1999 release of Camp Blood with a sequel, Camp Blood 2, in October 2000. A third film, Within the Woods, was released in 2005. Sykes wrote and directed both sequels, and actress Jennifer Ritchkoff reprised her role as Tricia Young for Camp Blood 2, but did not return for the third film. A fourth film was released at the beginning 2014 entitled Camp Blood First Slaughter, which was written and directed by Mark Polonia. Three more films were released in 2016: Camp Blood 4, Camp Blood 5, and Camp Blood 666. These were followed by Camp Blood 7 in 2017, The Ghost of Camp Blood (a spin-off film) in 2018 and Camp Blood 8: Revelations In 2019. These films do not take into account the third movie created by Brad Sykes in the Camp Blood series, Within the Woods.

Gibbs spent the first half of his adult life at Oklahoma as a player, assistant coach, and head coach. He played for the Sooners as a linebacker under Barry Switzer from 1972 to 1974. He began coaching in 1975 as a graduate assistant under Switzer and was promoted to linebackers coach in 1978. He was promoted to defensive coordinator in 1981, and held that post through the 1988 season. In 1989, Gibbs was named head coach after Switzer was forced out following NCAA sanctions and a number of highly publicized off-the-field issues involving the Oklahoma football program.http://www.newson6.com/Global/story.asp?S=10550339 Gibbs stayed as head coach at Oklahoma for six years, leading the Sooners to a record of 44‚Äì23‚Äì2 in that time. While he succeeded in his primary task‚Äîcleaning up the program's image‚Äîhe was perceived as a coach who could not win big games. He went 2‚Äì15‚Äì1 against Oklahoma's biggest rivals, Texas, Nebraska and Colorado, and never won more than five (out of seven) games in the Big Eight Conference. Hobbled by NCAA sanctions during Gibbs' first two years, the Sooners were barred from bowl games, and were also banned from live television in his first year. More seriously, they were only allowed to give out 18 scholarships rather than 25. He wasn't able to field a team with a full complement of scholarships until 1994. Even so, discontent with his lackluster record in big games led Oklahoma to force his resignation after the season. Gibbs was the defensive coordinator at the University of Georgia in 2000 and then at LSU in 2001. From 2002 to 2005, he was the linebackers coach for the Dallas Cowboys. Gibbs was the defensive coordinator for the New Orleans Saints from 2006 through 2008. Fired by the Saints after the conclusion of the 2008 season, Gibbs was subsequently hired by the Kansas City Chiefs as linebackers coach. On November 5, 2012, Gibbs was named defensive coordinator of the Kansas City Chiefs after Romeo Crennel resigned from the position (though staying as head coach).

The osmylids, also called giant lacewings, are found all over the world. A common species through most of Europe is Osmylus fulvicephalus. Description and ecology Adult osmylids are small to moderately-sized net-winged insects, with wingspans ranging from 1.4 to 3 cm. Smaller members resemble typical green lacewings, and larger species resemble antlions. Many species, namely those of the type genus Osmylus, have spotted wings. The thin antennae are short. They have two compound eyes, as well as three ocelli in between. Adult osmylids, like green lacewings (colloquially known as \\"stinkflies\\"), have prothoracal glands which produce foul-smelling compounds used to deter would- be predators. Their larvae are superficially similar to those of spongillaflies (Sisyridae). They have peculiar mouthparts which look like a thin forceps with the ends bending outwards. The body is elongated and slender and terminates in two extensible graspers bearing tiny hooks; these are used to aid in locomotion and to grasp prey. The larvae are associated with damp, mossy habitats and are amphibious. They hunt small invertebrate prey, from which they suck the body fluids with their mouthparts. The adults are diurnal or crepuscular weak-flying insects which mostly prey on small invertebrates, supplemented with some pollen. Eggs are deposited in damp places, usually near freshwater. Systematics and taxonomy The osmylids are rather nondescript as adults, but among the Neuroptera they were generally assigned to suborder Hemerobiiformia (lacewing relatives). The Sisyridae (spongillaflies) were formerly believed to be closely related, even a sister group. But as it seems they are well distinct, the presumed close relationship being mistaken due to their larvae's superficial similarity caused by convergent evolution. Later, the green lacewings (Chrysopidae) were held to be the osmylids' closest living relatives; together with some prehistoric lineages the Chrysopidae form superfamily Chrysopoidea which was considered sister to the presently monotypic Osmyloidea. However, mitochondrial DNA data found the Osmylidae to be basal to these as well as to the Myrmeleontiformia. In other words, the osmylids may be the most ancient living lineage of Neuroptera. Fossils described in 2016 indicate they are of Jurassic or Early Cretaceous origin (see below). Their relationships to the numerous incertae sedis groups of Mesozoic Neuroptera can now be reinvestigated with regard to this hypothesis. The two subfamilies Eidoporisminae and Porisminae each contain only a single species, Eidoporismus pulchellus and Porismus strigatus, respectively. Both are endemic to Australia. A basal extinct member not assignable to a subfamily, Protosmylus, has been found fossilized in middle Eocene Baltic amber.

Smith, The American International Pictures Video Guide, McFarland 2009 p 32 The film introduced Tom Laughlin as the half-Indian Green Beret Vietnam veteran Billy Jack. Since 1954 Laughlin had been trying to produce his Billy Jack script about discrimination toward American Indians. In the 1960s he decided to introduce the Billy Jack character in a quickly written script designed to capitalize on the then-popular trend in motorcycle gang movies. The story was based on a real incident from 1964 where members of the Hells Angels were arrested for raping two teenage girls in Monterey, California. Plot Billy Jack is introduced as an enigmatic, half-Indian Vietnam veteran who shuns society, taking refuge in the peaceful solitude of the California Central Coast mountains. His troubles begin when he descends from this unspoiled setting and drives into a small beach town named Big Rock (Morro Bay). A minor traffic accident in which a motorist hits a motorcyclist results in a savage beating by members of the Born Losers Motorcycle Club. The horrified bystanders (including Laughlin's wife, Delores Taylor, and their two children in cameo roles) are too afraid to help or be involved in any way. Billy Jack jumps into the fray and rescues the man by himself. At this point the police arrive and arrest Billy for using a rifle to stop the fight. (The irony here is that, unknown to Billy, the motorist is the one who starts the fight by inexplicably insulting one of the bikers.) The police throw Billy in jail and the judge fines him heavily for discharging a rifle in public. He is treated with suspicion and hostility by the police. Meanwhile, the marauding bikers terrorize the town, rape four teenage girls (Jane Russell plays the mother of one of the girls), and threaten anyone slated to testify against them. One of the girls, played by Susan Foster, later recants, saying she willingly gave herself to the biker gang. (Foster would go on to play a larger supporting role in Billy Jack.) Co-scriptwriter Elizabeth James plays Vicky Barrington, a bikini-clad damsel-in-distress who is twice abducted and abused by the gang. The second time, she and Billy are kidnapped together. After Billy is brutally beaten, Vicky agrees to become the gang's sexually compliant \\"biker mama\\" if they release Billy. At the police station, Billy is unable to get help from the police or the local residents and must return to the gang's lair to rescue Vicky by himself. Billy, armed with a bolt-action rifle, captures the gang, shoots the leader (Jeremy Slate) between the eyes in cold blood, and forces some of the others to take Vicky, who's been badly beaten, to the hospital. As the police finally arrive, Billy abruptly rides away on one of the gang's motorcycles. The anti-authority sentiment continues up to the end when a police deputy accidentally shoots Billy in the back, mistaking him for a fleeing gang member. He is later found, nearly dead, lying by the shore of a lake. He is placed on a stretcher and is flown to the hospital in a helicopter as Vicky and the sheriff give him a salute. Cast Production The movie was filmed on location in California at Seal Beach, Huntington Beach, Rancho Palos Verdes, University of California, Los Angeles, Big Sur, Morro Bay, Playa del Rey, and other coastal locales. The bikers' lair in Playa del Rey was once owned by silent film star Mae Murray. According to Laughlin's DVD audio commentary, filming was completed in just three weeks on an operating budget of $160,000. To cut costs, a stunt scene of a biker crashing into a pond was taken from American International's 1966 comedy The Ghost in the Invisible Bikini.. Laughlin ran out of money during post production, but showed the film to American International Pictures who bought out the original investors and gave Laughlin $300,000 to finish it.Mark McGee, Faster and Furiouser: The Revised and Fattened Fable of American International Pictures, McFarland, 1996 p252 The film was commercially successful, and resulted in Laughlin being able to raise the funds to make its sequel, Billy Jack. In 1974, after the sequel proved financially successful, American International Pictures re-released Born Losers with the taglines \\"The film that introduced Billy Jack\\" and \\"Back By Popular Demand: \\"Born Losers\\" The Original Screen Appearance of Tom Laughlin as Billy Jack\\". The film was the highest grossing American International release until 1979, when The Amityville Horror was released. Reception Critical response was generally negative. Film critic Leonard Maltin criticized Laughlin's films for \\"using violence as an indictment of violence\\". In 1967 the film earned an estimated $2,225,000 in theatrical rentals in the United States and Canada. The movie was re-released by AIP in 1974 following the success of Billy Jack. AIP issued ads which proclaimed \\"THE ORIGINAL BILLY JACK IS BACK!\\" which led to a lawsuit from Laughlin. Following Laughlin's lawsuit, the advertising for the re-release of Born Losers was changed. All newspaper advertising had to include the disclaimer \\"This is a Re-release\\" to make viewers aware that the film was not the film Billy Jack. By 1977 it had earned $12.5 million in U.S. and Canadian rentals. The film set a record in Mexico City playing at the Teatro Metrop√≥litan for more than 26 weeks, the longest run for a 35mm film, selling over 500,000 tickets.

Ridgway served as the Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment in the Marshall Ministry from 22 March 2018 to 26 July 2020. Background Ridgway was elected state president of the South Australian Rural Youth Movement in 1982‚Äì83. In 1984 he won a six- month youth study tour to the UK. This experience heightened his interest in politics, especially in primary industries and regional development. Ridgway began working on the family farm and at 19 he took on management of the family's horticultural business. After purchasing the business in 1997 with his wife Meredith, they expanded the operation to become the largest producer of gladioli corms in Australia and New Zealand. Parliament Ridgway was elected from fourth position on the Liberal ticket at the 2002 election and from first position on the Liberal ticket at the 2010 election. Ridgway was appointed a Shadow Parliamentary Secretary in 2005, and after the 2006 election was appointed Shadow Minister for Environment and Conservation, the River Murray and Urban Development & Planning, under the leadership of Iain Evans. A leadership change in April 2007, in which Martin Hamilton-Smith assumed Liberal Party leadership, prompted a re-shuffle of the Party's Shadow Cabinet, at which point Ridgway was made Shadow Minister for Police and Mineral Resources Development, whilst retaining his Shadow Urban Development & Planning post.

In February 2013, Ridgway was further promoted to the crucial portfolios of Agriculture, Food and Fisheries, Forests and Tourism.

On 13 January 2020, by proclamation of the Governor, Ridgway was relieved of the Tourism portfolio in his ministerial position.South Australian Government Gazette, 13 January 2020 In July 2020, Ridgway resigned from cabinet, indicating he was unwilling to serve in a reshuffled ministry following the resignation of Stephan Knoll and Tim Whetstone over an expenses scandal.

The character exists in Marvel's main shared universe, known as the Marvel Universe. Publication history Devil- Slayer was created by David Anthony Kraft and Rich Buckler. According to Kraft, Devil-Slayer was a tweaked version of a character he and Buckler had created in Demon Hunter (1975) for Atlas/Seaboard Comics. On his first day back in the Marvel Comics offices after the collapse of Atlas/Seaboard, Kraft bumped into Buckler in the hall and the two discussed bringing back Demon Hunter. Kraft recounted, \\"I changed his costume colors, Rich changed his costume design a little bit, we changed his name, of course - but if you look at his backstory it's a direct continuation from the Atlas issue\\". The character first appeared in Marvel Spotlight #33 (April 1977). Plans for Devil-Slayer to star in additional issues of Marvel Spotlight were halted by the series's cancellation, with Devil-Slayer's debut being the final issue. However, shortly after he was added to the lineup of the Defenders. In September 2008, Marvel released a limited series under their MAX imprint titled Dead of Night Featuring Devil-Slayer. It starred a new Devil-Slayer named Danny Sylva, the great-nephew of the original Devil-Slayer. The series was written by horror novelist Brian Keene and illustrated by Chris Samnee.Richards, Dave WW Philly: Devil-Slayer Returns in \\"Dead of Night\\", Comic Book Resources, May 31, 2008Warren Simons & Brian Keene On Max's Devil- Slayer, Newsarama, June 3, 2008 Fictional character biography Eric Payne was born in Queenstown, Illinois. He was a member of a demon cult called the Agents of Fortune, who helped him unlock the psionic potential of his brain and gave him a mystically created dimensional cloak. He later turned on the cult and, with the aid of the Defenders, he battled Vera Gemini and the Xenogesis and helped prevent the cult's mystical plans from being realized.Defenders #59‚Äì60 He assists the Defenders in confronting a cult leader named David. This man had been granted temporary mystical powers by a coalition of demons known as the Six-Fingered Hand. Despite the passing nature of his abilities, Eric's wife Cory chose to stay with the cult leader.Defenders #97 As the Defenders returned to Doctor Strange's home after this confrontation, they were called into action again by the Avengers. The town of Citrusville, Florida had vanished, into a gigantic hole resembling a six-fingered hand. Eric and the rest of the group confronted a possessed Man- Thing and then traveled through dimensional realms in order to find the source of the problem.Defenders #98 During Eric's time with the Defenders, he helped confront a host of demons, including Balthazar, who had taken over the form of an Air Force commander. The Defenders almost died when Balthazar convinced innocent Air Force pilots that they were spies. Though his demon compatriots were eventually sucked back to their own realm, Balthazar somehow stayed on Earth. Still in the form of the Air Force soldier, he targeted Devil-Slayer personally. Balthazar tricked Devil-Slayer into a bar full of disguised demons where Eric's drink was altered, thus removing his psychic powers. Despite this, Devil-Slayer held his own, using his magical accessories to battle the demons successfully. Balthazar and Eric were drawn into the Borders of the Land of the Dead, where stood many of his Defender allies, now seemingly dead. It was here that Balthazar was seemingly slain again.Marvel Comics Presents #37 There are indications he has returned another time, but this might be Payne's mental instability. Eric questions his tragic life, and reconciles with his wife, then turns himself in for his past crimes.Defenders #110 He later helps war-torn Potega, but loses his shadow-cloak, and then rededicates himself as a hero.Marvel Comics Presents #46‚Äì49 Devil-Slayer was later remitted to an asylum, where he discovers a shard of the Nexus of Realities, and then becomes Payne with his partner Sorrow.Man-Thing #3‚Äì4, Strange Tales #2 Nighthawk mentioned he had talked to Eric Payne and that he was willing to join a new team of Defenders. However, when Richmond suggested it to Initiative boss Tony Stark, he declined the offer.The Last Defenders #1 Shortly afterwards Eric is seen as a member of the Hawaiian Initiative team, the Point Men, serving the team as their \\"Monster Hunter.\\" When the new 3-D Man arrives in Hawaii, Devil-Slayer informs him that he has sensed portents of doom all day. When 3-D Man identifies team member Magnitude as a Skrull impostor, the Skrull attacks and severely wounds the other Point Men, Star Sign and Paydirt. The Skrull is killed, and Devil-Slayer uses his Shadow Cloak to teleport Delroy to Camp Hammond before taking Star Sign and Paydirt to a hospital.Avengers: the Initiative # 14 Devil-Slayer later appears in Utah with the cyborg Jocasta to aid 3-D Man and the Skrull Kill Krew.Avengers: the Initiative #17 He spends some time teleporting the Krew and their ever- increasing allies across the country to kill Skrulls who have infiltrated the Initiative teams.Avengers: the Initiative #18 As forewarned, he runs out of power and faints, leaving the final few confrontations to the speedsters the Krew have recruited.Avengers: the Initiative #19 After Doctor Strange loses his position as Sorcerer Supreme, Devil-Slayer is one of the many magic users approached by the Eye of Agamotto as a potential replacement.New Avengers #53 Devil-Slayer (wearing a totally new costume) is recruited by Wonder Man (whose ionic energy leaking powers were affecting his judgement) to join his Revengers.New Avengers Annual (vol. 2) #1 (2011) He and the Revengers were defeated by the three Avengers teams and remanded to the Raft. When he was interrogated, Devil-Slayer stated that he joined the Revengers in order to make a reality where the Avengers were held accountable for their actions.Avengers Annual #1 Powers and abilities Eric Simon Payne is a trained soldier and hit man, proficient in nearly all forms of hand-to-hand weaponry and an above-average marksman. As Devil-Slayer, Payne uses a mystical device called a shadow cloak. The cloak can elongate itself and respond to his mental commands, forming whips and grappling opponents and objects. The inside of the cloak served as a portal to other dimensions. By wrapping himself and/or others in folds of the cloak, Payne can teleport to and from other dimensions and could even teleport limited distances on Earth by entering and exiting at different locations. Time also runs differently inside the cloak, allowing Payne to place injured people in a form of stasis if he so wills.Avengers: the Initiative #14 Payne had also developed certain psychic abilities. He possesses a sixth sense that can detect mystical influence on people or creatures, useful for tracking and finding demons. He also had some degree of telekinesis and telepathy, the latter of which he typically used to mask his costume with an illusion of civilian clothes. The nature and extent of Payne's current powers remains unrevealed. Payne could also reach into the folds of the cloak and draw out an endless supply of weapons from any time or place. He typically used melee weapons such as swords, axes or maces, but has also removed from it more modern weapons such as automatic rifles and even futuristic weapons such as a plasma rifle. On at least one occasion, he used a staff that conferred upon him a degree of invulnerability and generated energies that he could absorb to enhance his psychic abilities.

Daniels is well regarded in the Baltimore Police Department by making his subordinates focus on decent police work and quality arrests. He occasionally has disagreements with higher-ranking officers but for the most part performs well, and thereby gained a reputation as both a reliable commander and an above-average investigator within the force, in stark contrast to some of his superiors and equivalents, most of whom display varying degrees of corruption and unreliability. Daniels was investigated by the FBI for corruption prior to the start of the series. By the end of the series, he rises through the ranks to police commissioner but resigns after refusing a political request to manipulate crime statistics. As a result, he starts a new career as a lawyer. Biography =Season 1= Daniels is the lieutenant of the Baltimore Police Department's Narcotics Unit, and the shift commander for Detectives Kima Greggs, Ellis Carver, and Thomas \\"Herc\\" Hauk. His commanding officer is Major Raymond Foerster. When Jimmy McNulty prompts Judge Daniel Phelan to start asking questions about the Barksdale Organization, Daniels is unable to give Foerster much information on Avon Barksdale, who has managed to operate under the radar until then. Soon afterward, Daniels is given command of the Barksdale detail and appoints Greggs as lead detective. Daniels meets with Deputy Commissioner Ervin Burrell, who tells him the case should be made with buy busts in a fast, straightforward investigation. Daniels discusses the new assignment with his wife Marla and promises to run the investigation per the wishes of the higher- ups. Marla's own ambitions drive her to pursue a career in politics, and Daniels attends political fundraisers with her. At one such function, Daniels finds himself hiding with the politicians' drivers in the kitchen. There, he meets State Senator Clay Davis' driver Damian \\"Day-Day\\" Price, later discovered to be a bag man involved with the Barksdales. Daniels has a difficult relationship with the insubordinate McNulty, who is informed by his FBI contact that Daniels has $200,000 more in liquid assets than his salary warrants; it is later implied that these were picked up during Daniels' tenure in the Eastern District. Daniels initially tries to follow Burrell's advice that the operation should be fast and simple, and shoots down McNulty's suggestions to mount a surveillance operation. Daniels also has difficulties with several other detectives deliberately assigned to the detail because they are considered the worst in the department: Patrick Mahon is injured by Bodie Broadus during a raid and takes early retirement, after which Mahon's partner Augustus Polk takes to drinking and misses several days' work. However, in contrast, Lester Freamon proves to be quietly capable and a huge asset to Daniels' detail. Another problematic assignee to the detail is Roland \\"Prez\\" Pryzbylewski, a trigger happy detective who had once shot up his own patrol car. Daniels is able to convince Prez's commanding officer, Lieutenant Walter Cantrell, to balance taking Prez out of his hands by assigning him the promising Leander Sydnor. Prez attends an unsanctioned, drunken late-night raid on the Barksdale tower operations with Herc and Carver, during which Prez seriously injures a young boy. Daniels defends Prez to his superiors and gains the respect of his father-in-law, Major Stan Valchek. Under Daniels' supervision, both Prez and Sydnor become valuable assets to the detail. Elsewhere, Daniels suspects Herc and Carver of skimming seized drug money. He leniently gives them one day to return the money rather than immediately turning them in. As the investigation progresses, Daniels' attitude towards the case changes, and he risks his career several times in order to protect it. For example, when Major William Rawls wants to issue a murder warrant for D'Angelo Barksdale based on flimsy evidence, Daniels resorts to bypassing the chain of command and persuading Burrell to delay the warrants. Freamon uncovers the Barksdales' campaign contributions to Baltimore political figures, leading Daniels' team to arrest Day-Day. However, rather than seize the Barksdale money in Day-Day's possession, Daniels is forced to return the funds with no further investigation, to avoid raising Davis' ire. Burrell tries to shut the detail down and threatens to reveal the source of Daniels' liquid assets, but Daniels calls his bluff and points out that doing so would bring bad press to the BPD. Daniels also is able to determine that Burrell is using Carver as a mole. The Barksdale investigation ends with the arrests of Avon and D'Angelo, along with soldier Wee-Bey Brice and several other members of the organization. Convictions are secured against all participants, and Wee-Bey confesses to several unsolved murders to prevent fallout from reaching other members of the organization. Daniels is left unsatisfied because Avon is convicted for minor offenses, and Avon's right-hand man, Stringer Bell, escapes uncharged. Much better results are within Daniels' grasp when his team convinces D'Angelo to testify against the organization. However, D'Angelo's mother Brianna talks him out of it, and he ends up taking a 20-year sentence for his family. At the end of the first season, Daniels is passed over for promotion to major in favor of Cantrell. However, he has won the respect of his unit for his dedication to their cases, which surpasses that of their other commanding officers. =Season 2= As punishment for defying Burrell, Daniels is reassigned to evidence control. Daniels contemplates quitting to become a lawyer, but reconsiders when Valchek insists that he be given command of a special detail to investigate stevedore union leader Frank Sobotka. Daniels realizes Valchek had asked for him personally in exchange for offering Burrell political support, and uses this fact to leverage several promises from Burrell. Daniels insists on picking his own detectives and forces Burrell to agree that he become commander of a permanent unit if the investigation is successful. The new detail initially consists of Prez, Greggs and Herc. At Herc's insistence, Daniels allows Carver the chance to rejoin the team despite his previous treachery. Daniels campaigns for McNulty and Freamon to rejoin the team, but Rawls refuses to reverse his punitive transfer of McNulty to the marine unit. Daniels's detail works closely with Bunk Moreland, who is investigating the discovery of fourteen Jane Does at the Port of Baltimore, and Officer Beadie Russell, detailed to Bunk's investigation from the Port Authority. Russell blossoms into a capable investigator with Daniels's team and is instrumental in coming up with the idea of cloning the port's computers to monitor smuggling. Daniels finally persuades Rawls to let McNulty return by agreeing to take on Rawls's murders from the docks. Meanwhile, Daniels has tensions with Marla due to his career decisions. Eventually, they begin to sleep in different rooms of their home. The detail links Sobotka's union to a smuggling operation run by a mysterious figure called \\"The Greek.\\" Sobotka's son Ziggy is arrested for killing the Greek's fence, George \\"Double G\\" Glekas, and his nephew Nick is proven to be involved in drug dealing. Daniels' detail is not informed of Ziggy's arrest until after he gives a signed confession to Sergeant Jay Landsman, giving the Greek time to clear out his warehouse. Valchek becomes disillusioned with Daniels when he learns that he has shifted his focus away from Sobotka and insults the detail in a heated meeting. Daniels is forced once again to defend Prez after he punches Valchek. Daniels quickly collects statements from everyone present and convinces Valchek that it would be best to accept Prez's apology. Sobotka is arrested along with several other people identified by the detail. It is only after they attempt to arrest Double G that they learn he was murdered by Ziggy. To protect his family, Daniels's team convince Sobotka to act as an informant on the Greek and arranged for him to return with a lawyer the next day. However, Sobotka is murdered before his testimony can be taken and the Greek evades arrest. The investigation is disappointing for the detail, but is deemed a tremendous success for the BPD. Bunk and Freamon secure evidence that solves the Jane Doe homicides, but no conviction is made since the suspect was killed by the Greek. However, \\"White\\" Mike McArdle, Sergei Malatov and Eton Ben-Eleazer are arrested, putting Daniels in the department's good graces once again. =Season 3= Burrell follows through with his promise and lets Daniels form a permanent Major Case Unit, consisting of McNulty, Greggs, Freamon, Prez, Sydnor, and a new recruit, Caroline Massey. The detail returns to investigating the Barksdales and their association with Proposition Joe, an East Baltimore drug kingpin with links to the Greek. Cedric separates from Marla, partly because of her dissatisfaction with his career path, which Cedric blames on her own political climbing. Nonetheless, he continues to support her, attending functions in uniform and acting the part of a devoted husband. Cedric starts a relationship with State's Attorney Rhonda Pearlman, but is skeptical about making it public while Marla runs for Baltimore City Council; he claims that it will look bad for Marla's political career to have him leave her for a white woman. Daniels gets commended several times by several senior figures throughout the BPD due to his good police work, including Burrell, Rawls, and Major Howard \\"Bunny\\" Colvin, amongst others. This, however, is not enough for Daniels, whose promotion to major is being held up due to Marla's political conflicts. Daniels also feels that Burrell is purposefully holding him back due to past incidents. Daniels becomes even more angered when McNulty goes around the chain of command to Colvin, and has the MCU shift its focus back to the Barksdales. Daniels makes it clear that McNulty is done with the MCU after Stringer is arrested. Stringer is murdered before he can be apprehended, but Avon is rearrested on weapons charges. When Colvin is forced to retire from the BPD due to his \\"Hamsterdam\\" experiment, Daniels is promoted to Colvin's old post as major for the Western District, as Mayor Clarence Royce throws support behind Marla. =Season 4= Daniels tries to convince McNulty, now a patrolman in the Western, to return to detective work with no success; he realizes that McNulty is better off with his new rank on a personal level. Greggs meets with Daniels to discuss a transfer after Rawls appoints the abrasive Lieutenant Charles Marimow to head the MCU. Daniels suggests a move to Homicide, and successfully meets with Rawls to facilitate the transfer. Elsewhere, after finding out that his student Randy Wagstaff knows information about Curtis ‚ÄúLex‚Äù Anderson's murder, Prez - now a schoolteacher - meets with Daniels, who suggests that Prez consult with Carver over the matter. Following the mayoral election, Daniels attends a COMSTAT meeting and tells Burrell and Rawls that the homicide rate in the Western has dropped while other felony rates have risen. Mayor-elect Tommy Carcetti observes the meeting and is impressed that Daniels prioritizes quality felony arrests over statistical reductions in crime. Carcetti learns that he is more respected than most other commanding officers in the BPD. Daniels is invited to lunch with Carcetti and takes his offer to be appointed commander of the Criminal Investigations Division (CID) under Rawls. Burrell realizes that the new mayor intends to promote Daniels to commissioner at his own expense. Burrell and Davis convince city council president Nerese Campbell to oppose Daniels, hinting that they plan to revisit the previous corruption allegations against him. As CID colonel, Daniels clears Herc of a racial profiling incident and assists Freamon in building a case against Marlo Stanfield. Freamon discovers evidence of dead bodies in vacant row houses and asks Daniels for more manpower for a citywide search. The city's homicide rate increases dramatically with the discovery of 22 concealed bodies. Daniels transfers McNulty back into the MCU, with the unit again refocused on Stanfield. Rawls comes to believe that Daniels will be moved up the ladder while Burrell and Davis conspire to keep Daniels from getting the commissioner's post. =Season 5= Daniels is outraged when Carcetti closes the MCU due to budgetary problems, leaving the investigations into Davis, Stanfield, and the vacant murders unresolved. He and Pearlman arrange a meeting with Carcetti and State's Attorney Rupert Bond, leading to the mayor approving a two-man detail for the Davis case. Daniels is further angered that Davis has been given priority over the vacant murders. He reluctantly reassigns McNulty and Greggs to homicide, while putting Freamon and Sydnor on the Davis detail. Carcetti finally accrues the political capital he needs to fire Burrell when the commissioner delivers false crime statistics. The mayor plans to temporarily promote Rawls to acting commissioner, with Daniels serving as Deputy Commissioner of Operations to prepare him to permanently take over the post. Carcetti leaks the story to The Baltimore Sun to gauge reaction to Daniels. However, the story runs with a quote, invented by reporter Scott Templeton, falsely implicating Daniels in causing Burrell's departure. Daniels meets with Marla to discuss Burrell's potential reaction to the story, and both become worried that he will reveal evidence of corruption from Daniels's past. Marla persuades Daniels to approach Burrell and promise not to take his post. Burrell gives Daniels the silent treatment. Campbell convinces Burrell to leave quietly in exchange for a comfortable replacement position. Carcetti holds a press conference to announce the promotions. Daniels is promoted to commissioner after the homeless killings and the vacant murders are solved, but resigns from the position over threats from Campbell and his refusal to \\"juke the stats.\\" His last act as commissioner is to confer a set of promotions, including that of Carver to Lieutenant. In the final flash-forward montage, Daniels is shown practicing as a criminal defense lawyer before Pearlman, who recuses herself as a newly commissioned judge. Production =Casting= Lance Reddick was cast in the role after auditioning for the parts of Bunk Moreland and Bubbles. He was told that they were looking for \\"a name\\" to fill the Daniels role. Reddick has described the character as serious, intense and committed. Although a number of actors are credited in every episode regardless of their appearance, Daniels appears in more episodes of the show than any other character (58 out of 60), and is also the last original character to miss an episode.

She was one of the key opposition figures against Marcos' 20-year authoritarian rule and was instrumental in his downfall during the People Power Revolution. As a senator, she authored several laws relating to education in the Philippines, such as the salary standardization for public school personnel, the Magna Carta for Private Schools, the Magna Carta for Students, and an Act to institute a Charter for Barrio High Schools. She was also among the Liberal Party candidates injured during the Plaza Miranda bombing on August 21, 1971. Early life Kalaw was born in Murcia, Tarlac (present-day Concepcion, Tarlac) on June 16, 1920 to Dr. Salvador Estrada and Demetria Reynada. She took up Bachelor of Science in Education, Major in Home Economics from the University of the Philippines in Manila. She was a member of the university's Sigma Delta Phi sorority. An expert pistol shooter, Kalaw was once hailed the national ladies' champion in rapid-fire pistol shooting. She trained under the auspices of Filipino Olympian in shooting Martin Gison. After graduating from UP in 1940, Kalaw taught in several universities such as the Far Eastern University, National Teachers College and Centro Escolar University while taking up postgraduate studies in social work. On June 11, 1944, she married entrepreneur and Bataan Death March veteran Teodoro Kalaw, Jr., son of former Batangas legislator Teodoro Kalaw. They had four children: daughter Chingbee and sons Teodoro III, Salvador and Tyrone. Her son Teodoro followed in her footsteps and became a national pistol shooting champion and Olympic pistol shooter himself. Through her marriage to Kalaw, she became the sister-in-law of fellow senator Maria Kalaw-Katigbak. Kalaw was very active in social work and was part of the different civic organizations in the country. She was the first president of the Jayceerettes Organization, founder and national chairperson of Samahang Filipina, director of the League of Women Voters and the Chamber of Home Industries of the Philippines, board member of the Special Child Study Center for Retarded Children and chairperson of the Youth Welfare Council. She was also active in the Presidential Peace and Amelioration Campaign, the Rizal Red Cross, Anti‚ÄìTuberculosis of the Philippines and the Civic Assembly of Women‚Äôs Clubs in the Philippine Association of the University Women. For her social work, she won a citation for being the Outstanding Volunteer Social Worker of the Year. Political career =First term= A member of the Nacionalista Party, Kalaw first entered politics in 1953 when she campaigned for Nacionalista presidential candidate and former Defense Secretary Ramon Magsaysay, who ran against the incumbent president Elpidio Quirino. In 1957, she also campaigned for Senator Claro M. Recto when he ran for president against incumbent president Carlos P. Garcia. During the Garcia administration, Kalaw headed the National Economic Protectionism Association, a non-government organization that staunchly promoted economic protectionism and promotion of Filipino businesses and products. During the 1965 Senatorial Elections, Kalaw was part of the senatorial slate of the Nacionalista Party candidate Ferdinand Marcos and won. As senator, she introduced a total of 41 bills, including ones for salary increases of public school teachers (RA 5158); the creation of Local School Boards (RA 5447) and of the Barrio High School Charter/Magna Carta for Private Schools (RA 6054); the Educational Financing Act (RA 6728) and the inclusion of the presidents of student councils in the Board of Regents of all state colleges and universities. During her term, she was the chairperson of the Senate Committee on Games, Amusements, and Tourism, as well as the Senate Committee on National Minorities. =Second term and Martial Law= Relations between Kalaw and the ruling Nacionalista Party were uneasy under the Marcos administration. The increasing authoritarianism of the Marcos government led Kalaw to become one of the few people within the party to criticize the administration. By 1971, convinced that the party will not include her in the senatorial slate for the upcoming elections, Kalaw decided to accept the offer from her cousin, opposition senator Benigno Aquino Jr., to become guest candidate of the Liberal Party. During the party's miting de avance at Plaza Miranda in Quiapo, Manila on August 21, 1971, Kalaw was among the senatorial candidates present when an unidentified assailant threw two hand grenades at the stage. She wasn't seriously injured, but fellow party members such as Senator Jovito Salonga, Manila mayoralty candidate Ramon Bagatsing and Manila city councilor Ambrosio Lorenzo, Jr. were among those seriously harmed. On election day, however, Kalaw, together with five other Liberal Party senatorial candidates‚ÄîJovito Salonga, Genaro Magsaysay, John Henry Osme√±a, Eddie Ilarde and Ramon Mitra, Jr.‚Äîwon six out of eight Senate seats. She was the first-ever female Filipino senator to win two consecutive terms. Since the Plaza Miranda incident, Kalaw dedicated her second term to becoming full-time opposition to President Marcos. However, Marcos' declaration of Martial Law and abolition of Congress cut short her term. Nevertheless, she continued in her activism in opposition of Martial Law, resulting in her imprisonment at Fort Bonifacio twice, including one in 1979 for allegedly participating in a coup attempt against Marcos. =Assemblywoman of Manila= Following her release from prison, Kalaw worked to unite a fragmented opposition by bringing together the remnants of the Liberal and Nacionalista parties to form United Nationalist Democratic Organization (UNIDO), which would serve as the main opposition party against Marcos' Kilusang Bagong Lipunan. The assassination of opposition figure Benigno Aquino Jr. on August 21, 1983 further emboldened the opposition parties to fight Marcos, and in 1984, Kalaw ran as assemblywoman and won one of six seats in the Regular Batasang Pambansa for Manila. She was joined by fellow UNIDO assemblymen Jose Atienza Jr., Carlos Fernando, Gemiliano Lopez, Jr. and Gonzalo Puyat II who occupied four of the remaining seats (the last seat going to KBL candidate Arturo Tolentino). =Vice presidential bid= In November 1985, President Marcos called for a snap presidential election in order to convince the American government that he is still in control of the Philippines amid the economic crisis that affected the country since the assassination of Aquino. Kalaw, along with Senator Salvador Laurel, were among the opposition members who expressed their intention to run for president. However, majority of UNIDO members preferred Aquino's widow Corazon Aquino as the party's official presidential candidate. Both Laurel and Kalaw decided to give in to Aquino after nationwide signature campaign gathered more than a million signatures urging Aquino to run for president. In her choice of vice president, however, Aquino chose Laurel over Kalaw, who decided to unsuccessfully ran as a third vice presidential candidate under the Kalaw-wing of the Liberal Party. However, the snap elections on February 7, 1986 were mired with allegations of rampant fraud by the government, and the tandem of Aquino and Laurel came to power as president and vice president respectively after a peaceful People Power Revolution from February 23‚Äì25, 1986 that toppled the Marcos regime. =Post-EDSA Revolution= After the People Power Revolution, Kalaw joined the opposition against Corazon Aquino's administration. She was among the few UNIDO members who joined the Grand Alliance for Democracy, a coalition party that consisted mostly of defectors from Marcos' Kilusang Bagong Lipunan, Nacionalista Party and the UNIDO. She was one of GAD's senatorial candidates during the 1987 Senatorial Elections but lost. In 1992, Kalaw was reunited with former Vice President Laurel, and the two ran together as the Nacionalista Party's candidates for President and Vice President during the 1992 Philippine presidential elections, but they both lost to Aquino's Defense Secretary Fidel V. Ramos and former actor and Senator Joseph Estrada. Kalaw's last foray in public service was her appointment as managing director and resident representative of the Philippines at the Manila Economic and Cultural Office, the country's de facto embassy in Taipei, Taiwan during the Ramos and Estrada administrations. Awards Among Kalaw's many awards, the most prestigious was the Mahatma Gandhi Freedom Award which was conferred to her on April 2, 1985 by the Department of Anthropology of the College of William & Mary in Virginia, United States. The award is given annually to outstanding scholars or public figures who, given by personal example, have given meaning and substance to freedom. Among other recipients of the award were her cousin Senator Benigno Aquino Jr., Senator Jovito Salonga, K. R. Narayanan, H. R. Choudry and K. S. Bajpai. Death Kalaw died on May 25, 2017 at the age of 96 due to an undisclosed ailment. She is survived by her daughter Chingbee Kalaw-Cuenca, sons Teodoro III, Salvador and Tyrone, as well as 13 grandchildren and 12 great-grandchildren. Her remains were laid to rest at Loyola Memorial Park in Para√±aque City.

It was directed by Aaron Norris and written by Don Carmody, Robert Geoffrion and Galen Thompson. Plot Seattle cop Cliff Garret (Chuck Norris) is severely wounded in a drug bust gone bad‚Äîshot by his corrupt partner Ronny ‚ÄúDel‚Äù Delany (Michael Parks). Garret dies momentarily in the emergency room, but is revived with a defibrillator. His police supervisor has the hospital conceal his survival, and Garret is given a new identity. Garret becomes hit man Danny Grogan, and he infiltrates the organization of mob boss mafioso Marco Luganni (Al Waxman). The plan is for Grogan to bring together Luganni and his rival, French Canadian mafioso boss Andr√© LaCombe (Marcel Sabourin), so they can both be taken down together. After two years of working the plan, a gang of Iranian drug dealers looking to muscle in on everyone's territories suddenly enter the picture when they make a hit on one of Luganni's teams just as they finished making a hit on a team of LaCombe's money carriers. Grogan plays all parties against one another while befriending a fatherless boy named Tim Murphy (Salim Grant), who lives in the apartment down the hall and is being bullied by a racist white kid in the neighborhood. Tim's mother works three jobs, so he begins spending time with Grogan. Grogan teaches Tim how to fight after seeing him bullied on the street one day. When Tim stands up to the white kid, he gets the best of him, then watches as the white kid is dragged off by his father and beaten for losing the fight. Grogan walks across the street, punches the father in the nose through a screen door, so hard that it knocks the father to the ground, then Grogan walks away. Grogan‚Äôs past returns to haunt him in the person of Ronny Delany, who is secretly working with Luganni. Delany recognizes Grogan as Garret, and ties Tim to a chair loaded with explosives in a bid to force Grogan to cooperate. Delany sets off the chair bomb, but Grogan is unharmed and Tim survives. Grogan turns the tables on them all. At a meeting to set terms of an alliance, Delany has Luganni's men kill LaCombe and his men. Then the Iranians and Delany kill Luganni, but Grogan arrives on the scene and kills all of them. In the end, Grogan blows up Delany while tied to a chair hanging outside a window, in retribution for what he did to Tim.

Despite good performance, it was built only in small numbers and entirely for the export market. The type was operated in the Second World War by Greece, Yugoslavia and Finland. Development and design In 1934, Dornier's Swiss subsidiary, based at its factory at Altenrhein, designed a three-seat, single- engined military floatplane, the Do C3; two prototypes were built,Smith and Kay 1974, p.119. with the first flown in 1935. It was a parasol wing monoplane of fabric-covered all-metal construction. Its slightly swept back wing was attached to the fuselage by bracing struts, and its two floats were braced to both the wing and fuselage. It was powered by a Hispano-Suiza 12Ybrs engine driving a three-bladed propeller, and could carry a single torpedo or bombs under the fuselage. Defensive armament was one fixed forward-firing machine gun, also two in the rear cockpit and one in a ventral tunnel.Green 1962, p.66. The first production model, known as the Do 22/See when fitted with floats, did not fly until 15 July 1938 from Dornier's factory at Friedrichshafen, Germany, although it did incorporate parts made in Switzerland. While the Luftwaffe was not interested in the aircraft, examples were sold to Yugoslavia, Greece and Latvia.

Background  Aron was born in Kempen (Kƒôpno), in modern-day Poland, at the time a shtetl in the Province of Posen. His father was a chazzan and merchant. The family wanted him to train as a Jewish scholar or scrivener, however wealthy relatives made it possible for him to attend from 1862 the high school at K√∂lln, Berlin and after graduating in 1867, to study at the University of Berlin. Aron began by studying medicine, but changed in the 3rd term to mathematics and natural sciences. From 1870 he studied at the University of Heidelberg, with such notable physics lecturers as Helmholtz and Kirchhoff. He obtained his doctorate from Berlin in 1873 and became an assistant at the physical laboratory of the trade academy (Gewerbeakademie). He taught at the University of Berlin where he became professor of physics, and at the Prussian Army's school for artillery and engineers. He is buried in Wei√üensee Cemetery, Berlin.  Electricity meters  In 1883 he patented the \\"Pendelz√§hler\\" - the first accurate watt-hour meter. The meter contained two pendulum clocks, with coils around their pendulum bobs. One was accelerated and the other slowed in proportion to the current used. A differential gear mechanism measured the difference in speed between the two clocks and counted this on a series of dials. The first meters used clockwork clocks that required manual winding monthly. Later models were self-winding by electricity. This meter was introduced into Great Britain by Hugo Hirst, and made and sold by his General Electric Company from 1888. He also invented another Wattmeter, the eponymous 'Aronschaltung' . This is a circuit for measuring total power in three-phase AC circuits, whilst requiring only two direct measurements of power. These inventions expanded into a business with factories in Paris (1890), London (1893), Vienna (1897) and Schweidnitz, Silesia. By the time of his death in 1913, it employed over 1,000 people.  Nora radio  His son continued the business of H. Aron, watthour meter factory GmbH, changing its name in 1929 to Aron electricity company ltd., Berlin Charlottenburg. The company had diversified into the new market for radios, sold under the name \\"Nora\\". This was \\"Aron\\" spelled backwards: in the increasing atmosphere of anti-semitism, it was prudent to avoid using a name that was so obviously Jewish. In 1933 the company was renamed again, to the fashionably Modernist and anonymous \\"Heliowatt\\". At this time Nora had around 3,000 employees and a market share of around 8%, making them the fourth-largest manufacturer after Telefunken, SABA and Mende. Anti-semitism continued to grow in Germany, and in 1935 the family sold the business to Siemens-Schuckert and fled to the USA. The Charlottenburg factory was bombed in 1943, but the Nora brand continued after the war. After a series of advertisements promising their imminent return, they returned to manufacturing in 1947.

History He was elected with the support of the Lombard king Desiderius. However, in order to maintain necessary good relations with Byzantium and the Franks, two tribunes were elected annually to limit ducal power. Domenico came to resent these checks and was removed after eight years. During his reign, the transformation of the Venetians from fishermen to marine traders happened, with audacious travels as far as the Ionian Islands and the Levant. The art of shipbuilding was improved to make sturdier, faster ships. Venetian wealth increased via trade and the city took on the medieval character it held for the next millennium. When Pope Paul I demanded donations from Venice to the Holy See, the Doge Monegario was deposed, blinded, and exiled as his two predecessors had been. The surname Monegario may derive from ', that is, a friar or monk, or ', that is, a minter. Sources *Norwich, John Julius. A History of Venice. Alfred A. Knopf: New York, 1982.
