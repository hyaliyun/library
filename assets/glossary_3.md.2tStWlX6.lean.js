The song was McLagan's first original composition written for the band.  Background  Ian McLagan joined the Small Faces in October of 1965 as a keyboardist, and performed his first gig with them on 2 November that year at the Lyceum Theatre, in London. McLagan acted as a keyboardist, preferring to play the hammond organ over other organs, but also occasionally played rhythm guitar, an instrument he played in a previous band. However, McLagan had not significantly contributed a song to the band, who either played covers or songs written by Steve Marriott and Ronnie Lane. He had however, received a shared songwriting credits for several instrumentals of the band, including \\"Own Up Time\\" from their debut album, \\"Grow Your Own\\", the B-Side of \\"Sha-La-La-La-Lee\\" and \\"Almost Grown\\", the B-side of \\"Hey Girl\\". By early 1967, the band had experienced with psychedelic drugs, and started coming up with new songs. The song was largely inspired by Ronnie Lane's father Stan Lane, who used to have specific word plays. In a later interview, Stan stated that upon putting Ronnie into bed, he would say \\"Come on, let's go up the wooden hills to Bedfordshire\\". As Stan was a lorry driver, he would occasionally go to Bedfordshire to pick up bricks, often times bringing Ronnie there. Later, during an interview with Ken Sharp, McLagan would state \\"Do you know what that means? Up the stairs to bed. Wooden hills. It was an expression that Ronnie Lane's father used to use when he was about to go to bed \\"....well, it's up the wooden hills to Bedfordshire....\\" I thought it was a lovely line. It's a drug song I suppose. I used to be stoned all the time -- you know, when you \\"sleep\\" -- trying to explain how you felt. \\"When you're slipping into sleep...\\" isn't falling asleep, it's gettin' stoned.\\"  Release and reception  The song was recorded at Olympic Studios during the early months of 1967, with Glyn Johns along with Eddie Kramer engineering.Here Comes The Nice: Immediate Years box set 1967-69, liner notes, page 63 The song was mixed within the following months. \\"Up the Wooden Hills to Bedfordshire\\" was first released on 23 June 1967, when it was featured on the second side of Small Faces, the group's second studio album. The song was first issued in the US on 17 March 1968, when it was featured on the first side of the North American release There Are But Four Small Faces.Here Comes The Nice: Immediate Years box set 1967-69, liner notes, page 68 For this release, the song was promptly renamed to simply \\"Up the Wooden Hills\\", removing the \\"to Bedfordshire\\" suffix. The reason behind this is currently unclear, however, it is believe to be due to the fact that the region of Bedfordshire is virtually unknown to most Americans. An alternate mix of the song was created for radio stations, used to advertise There Are But Four Small Faces. An alternate mix was used on the Here Comes The Nice: Immediate Years box set 1967-69. Often times called an overdue songwriting debut by McLagan, the song received mostly positive reviews. In 1968, Billboard magazine called it one of the best recordings by the group. In an retrospective review, Roland Schmitt writes that the song's harmonic layout bears a similarity to contemporary rock group Procol Harum due to the layers of acoustic guitars and keyboards which layer the track. Upon hearing the composition for the first time, Small Faces drummer Kenney Jones knew that McLagan successfully had written a good song. Coincidentally, the song shares its title with a Vera Lynn song, in 1936, she recorded and released a composition called \\"Up the Wooden Hill to Bedfordshire\\", a song which was written by Nixon Grey and Reginald Connelly. This track was Lynn's first solo single, and it was released on the Crown Records label.

Regalists sought reforms that \\"were intended to redefine the clergy as a professional class of spiritual specialists with fewer judicial and administrative responsibilities and less independence than in Hapsburg times.\\"Taylor, William B. Magistrates of the Sacred: Priests and Parishioners in Eighteenth-Century Mexico. Stanford: Stanford University Press 1996, p. 14. Origins Regalism evolved in Spain from a narrow focus on the excesses of the Catholic Church‚Äôs secular authority to a doctrine that emphasized the supreme power of the monarchy and its role in society and in the international order. Starting in the 1970s, some historians have viewed regalism as being rooted in the Patronato Real, the crown‚Äôs power of appointment of ecclesiastics to Church offices granted to the Catholic Monarchs, Isabel and Ferdinand, giving monarchy the power of appointment of ecclesiastics in their overseas realms of Spanish America and later the Philippines. The original Patronato Real for overseas appointments did not extend to Spain itself. Regalism emerged in the eighteenth century when the Bourbon monarchs of Spain sought to revitalize its peninsular and ultramarine empire. It drew upon other European intellectual traditions that were incorporated and transformed by Spanish intellectuals to become state policy. Although regalists sought crown control over many matters over which the church claimed authority, they considered themselves pious and orthodox in their beliefs.Paquette, Gabriel. Enlightenment, governance, and reform in Spain and its empire, 1759-1808. New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2008, p. 70. According to historian Gabriel Paquette, regalism differs from Jansenism, but that they share some commonalities, including opposition to papal power, and a secular, utilitarian spirit. The papacy sought to maintain its power in what was termed ultramontanism, which emphasized the pope‚Äôs power regarding the Church in all its spheres of activity. Unlike Jansenism, regalism was concerned with power politics rather than metaphysics, and with the power of the state rather than the Church‚Äôs welfare.Paquette, Enlightenment, Governance, and Reform, pp. 70-71 Implementation Regalism's origins were in the medieval period, but under increasingly under the Bourbon monarchy after 1700, regalists asserted authority over all ecclesiastical institutions, including the Inquisition. As early as the rule of Philip V claimed the power of appointment to church benefices in Spain, which had been the prerogative of the papacy. At the end of Hapsburg rule under the weak Charles II the papacy had reasserted control over appointments. Of major importance was the Spanish crown's assertion of the exclusive right of taxation in Spain. The number of bishops was reduced and their but the Bourbon monarchy sought to take back that power, putting appointments back in the hands of the crown. Any disputes could not be resolved directly with the papacy, but were required to go through the Spanish crown.Lynch, John. Bourbon Spain 1700-1808. Blackwell 1989, p. 108. Centralization of crown authority in Spain under the Bourbons did not simply apply to Church-State relations, as can be seen with Philip V's elimination privileges of the kingdom of Aragon and of Catalonia in the Nueva Planta decrees, so that Spain became a unified and centralized administration over practically all of Spain, except the Basque country and Navarre.Payne, Stanley G. A History of Spain and Portugal, Madison: University of Wisconsin Press 1973, pp. 355-56. Under Charles III of Spain and his heir Charles IV, regalism became the doctrine animating the centralization of power in the monarchy and emanating from Madrid.Paquette, Gabriel. Enlightenment, governance, and reform in Spain and its empire, 1759-1808. New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2008. Most debates over what regalism has constituted focus on Church-State relations, especially over property and temporal authority. Regalists saw the Church's only sphere as the spiritual. The papacy and the Spanish crown negotiated a concordat in 1737 which granted the crown the right of appointment to benefices in Spain and to receive revenues previously directed to the papacy.Lynch, Bourbon Spain, p. 109. Regalists contended that the monarchy was to have power in the temporal sphere of life on earth. The papacy had no right to nullify the monarchy‚Äôs exercise of temporal power. The regalists sought to diminish the papacy‚Äôs influence on political life in Spain. A way to undermine clerical autonomy was to restrict or eliminate the Church‚Äôs jurisdiction over clerics and make them subject to the monarchy‚Äôs power, as with any other subjects of the crown. The crown eliminated ecclesiastical privileges (fuero eclesi√°stico) that had given only canonical courts jurisdiction over priests, no matter what the offense, and gave royal courts jurisdiction. The crown also initiated the secularization of parishes, that is taking them out of the hands of the religious orders and placing them under the authority of the secular or diocesan clergy. Regulation of unruly behavior was taken out the hands of priests and put into royal officials' hands.Taylor, Magistrates of the Sacred, pp. 14-15; 542 =Expulsion of the Jesuits= Regalists were especially hostile to the Society of Jesus, the \\"soldiers of the pope.\\" The society was expelled from Spain under Charles III and the Spanish Empire in 1767 and its rich landed estates were sold off, its, and its frontier missions turned over to other religious orders.M√∂rner, Magnus. \\"The expulsion of the Jesuits from Spain and Spanish America in 1767 in light of eighteenth-century regalism.\\" The Americas 23.2 (1966): 156-164. =Leading regalists= In Spain, leading regalists were the Marquis of Ensenada; the Count of Campomanes and the Count of Floridablanca, as well as Francisco de Carrasco, head of the treasury, Jos√© Nicol√°s de Azara, the Spanish Representative to the Papacy; Jos√© de G√°lvez., former Inspector General (Visitador) in New Spain who implemented the Bourbon Reforms and later became head of the Council of the Indies. They sought the \\"expansion of state power in order to modernize Spanish society\\" and to return Spain to its previous preeminent position in geopolitics.Paquette, Enlightenment, Governance, and Reform, p. 71.

He is the leading character in the 1972 novel The Body of a Girl, a somewhat hardboiled police procedural, and appears later in at least three short stories. On the first page of the novel, \\"Detective Inspector William Mercer received... confirmation of his promotion to chief inspector and his appointment in charge of the CID at Stoneferry on Thames, which is one of the larger upriver stations of Q Division of the Metropolitan Police.\\" Gilbert goes on to say that \\"He was a man in his late twenties or early thirties, with a lot of dark hair, worn rather long,, and a thick, sensual face. His appearance was not improved by a puckered white scar which started at the cheekbone and gathered up the corner of the left eye so that it seemed permanently half closed. He had thick shoulders, a barrel of a chest, and legs disproportionately long for such a body\\".The Body of a Girl, Harper & Row, New York, 1972, page 7 In the novel, mention is made of the many girls he has known and discarded over the years, and he carries out a smooth seduction of a beautiful young girl in the course of his investigation. But in the three short stories, which take place over an extended period of time, he is living with, and apparently faithful to, a beautiful Pakistani girl named Shallini whom he had brought back from his time in Bahrain. At the stories' conclusion, he is planning a trip to Pakistan with her at the Treasury's expense. As Gilbert later described him in an introduction to a 1997 collection of stories: \\"He once shared with Hazlerigg the rank of Chief Inspector, but this is about the only thing that he did share. While Hazlerigg plays the game according to the rules, Mercer is prepared to bend any rule that gets in the way of his single-minded pursuit of his objective.... He was going to get his revenge for that scar, whatever the cost.The Man Who Hated Banks, Crippen & Landru, Norfolk, Virginia, 1997, page 8 Short story appearances Mercer was the ruthless protagonist of three connected, and rather grim, stories that appeared in Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine in the issues of April, May, and June of 1979. They were called \\"The Man at the Bottom,\\" \\"The Man in the Middle,\\" and \\"The Man at the Top.\\" Mercer's precise status in the three stories is murky. He is living an apparently hand-to-mouth existence in a bare flat in London and goes to work, at the bottom, for what is obviously a gang of highly organized and highly dangerous criminals. As the head criminal, a Mr. Henderson, sums up Mercer's two previous years when he is first being taken in on probation: He was dismissed from the Metropolitan Police for assault on a prisoner; he was allowed to join the police force of the Ruler of Bahrain but soon dismissed for bribery and corruption; returned to England and worked as a laborer but was dismissed for assaulting a foreman; and finally worked as a protector for criminals smuggling hard pornography into England.Ibid., page 120 By the end of the three stories, it is still impossible to tell what his motivating force has been throughout the series and whether or he has been successfully infiltrated into Henderson's gang as a long-term mole by New Scotland Yard's tough, ruthless, and cunning Chief Superintendent Morrissey. In the final story he is definitely working in coordination with the police, but in the first two this is far from clear.

Khabele arrived at Columbia during the peak of the AIDS epidemic, and was captivated by the urgency that surrounded the battle against HIV/AIDS. She started to wonder whether her political aspirations and scientific interests could contribute to solving the crisis. During her undergraduate studies she completed her pre- medical requirements, and after graduating spent a year working in public health. She remained at Columbia University for her medical studies, before starting a residency in obstetrics at the NewYork‚ÄìPresbyterian Hospital. She was a fellow in gynaecologic oncology at Albert Einstein College of Medicine.  Research and career  After completing her fellowship, Khabele joined Meharry Medical College as an Assistant Professor. She worked there for several years before joining the faculty at Vanderbilt University. In 2017 Khabele joined the University of Kansas School of Medicine. There her research considered the pathology of ovarian cancer in an effort to design new therapeutic strategies.

It covers the windward sides of Viti Levu and Vanua Levu, Fiji's largest islands, as well as the smaller Fijian islands and the three islands that make up Wallis and Futuna, and overseas terrritory of France. Geography Fiji has more than 300 islands. Viti Levu and Vanua Levu are the largest, and together comprise 78% of Fiji's land area. The highest peak in Fiji is Mount Tomanivi (1,324 m) on Viti Levu. The islands are volcanic in origin, formed by the subduction of the Pacific Plate under the Australian Plate. The islands emerged from the sea 5 to 20 million years ago. Wallis and Futuna is made up of three islands, Uvea, Futuna, and Alofi. Futuna and Alofi lie close to one another, approximately 400 km northeast of Vanua Levu. Uvea, or Wallis, is northeast of Futuna and Alofi. The highest peak in the group is Mount Singavi (765 m) on Futuna. Rotuma is a volcanic island 500 km north of Viti Levu and politically part of Fiji. It has an area of 47 km¬≤, and the highest elevation on the island is 250 metres. Climate The ecoregion has a humid tropical climate. Mean monthly temperatures range from 22¬∫ C in July to 26¬∫ C in January. Rainfall occurs throughout the year, and the prevailing winds are mostly from the southeast. Most of the ecoregion receives over 2500 mm of rain per year. Rainfall is higher on southeast-facing slopes, and the windward mountains receive 5000‚Äì10,000 mm of rainfall per year. The islands occasionally experience Tropical cyclones between January and April. The northwestern portions of Viti Levu and Vanua Levu are in the mountains' rain shadow, and receive less rain overall with a winter dry season. These areas are home to the Fiji tropical dry forests ecoregion. Flora The three main plant commmunities in the ecoregion are lowland rain forest, montane rain forest, and cloud forest. Lowland rain forest predominates below 400 meters elevation on all the smaller islands, and in the southeast-facing lowlands of Viti Levu and Vanua Levu. Common trees include Degeneria vitiensis, Pandanus joskei, Myristica macrantha, Endiandra gillespiei, Agathis macrophylla, Calophyllum vitiense, Canarium vitiense, Calophyllum neo-ebudicum, Syzygium spp., and Garcinia myrtifolia. Other lowland forest trees in Wallis and Futuna include Rhus taitensis, Elaeocarpus angustifolius, Elaeocarpus tonganus, Planchonella spp., Pometia pinnata, and Myristica fatua. Montane rain forests are found on windy slopes from 400 to 600 meters elevation. Temperatures are 4 to 6¬∫ C cooler than in the coastal lowlands. The windy conditions creates a low, stunted forest characterized by the trees Agathis vitiensis, Podocarpus spp., Calophyllum vitiense, Endospemum macrophyllum, Myristica castaneifolia, Dysoxylum spp., and Metrosideros collina. The cloud forests occur between 600 and 900 meters elevation on the larger Fijian islands and on Futuna. Rainfall is higher than the lowlands, exceeding 4500 mm per year in most areas. Temperatures are cooler, ranging from 10 to 20¬∫ C. The cloud forest trees form a dense canopy about seven meters high. Common trees include tree ferns (Cyathea spp.), Dysoxylum gillespianum, Hernandia moerenhoutiana, Fagraea spp., Syzygium spp., and Macaranga seemannii. Leptopteris ferns and the climbers Freycinetia spp. are abundant. Fauna The ancestors of Fiji's land animals arrived via long- distance dispersal. There are many endemic species, and some are limited to one or two islands. Fiji has 177 species of birds, including 31 endemic species. The islands have four endemic doves, the orange fruit dove (Ptilinopus victor), golden fruit dove (P. luteovirens), whistling fruit dove (P. layardi), and Barking imperial pigeon (Ducula latrans). The collared lory (Phigys solitarius), red-throated lorikeet (Charmosyna amabilis), and masked shining parrot (Prosopeia personata), are endemic; the red shining parrot (Prosopeia tabuensis) is a Fijian endemic that was introduced to Tonga in ancient times. The bar-winged rail (Rallus poecilopterus) is endemic to Viti Levu and Vanua Levu, and may be extinct. The silktails (Lamprolia) are a Fijian endemic genus with two species ‚Äì the Taveuni silktail (Lamprolia victoriae) is limited to Taveuni, and the Natewa silktail (Lamprolia klinesmithi) to Vanua Levu. The long-legged warbler (Cincloramphus rufus) and pink-billed parrotfinch (Erythrura kleinschmidti) are also endemic. Bats are the only native terrestrial mammals in the ecoregion. The Fijian monkey-faced bat (Pteralopex acrodonta) and Fijian mastiff bat (Chaerephon bregullae) are endemic. Endemic reptiles include the Fiji crested iguana (Brachylophus vitiensis), Lau banded iguana (Brachylophus fasciatus), and Fiji snake (Ogmodon vitianus). The endemic Fiji Ground Frog (Cornufer vitianus) and Fiji Tree Frog (Platymantis vitiensis) are the easternmost native amphibians in the Oceanian realm. Protected areas A 2017 assessment found that 598 km¬≤, or 6%, of the ecoregion is in protected areas. Protected areas include Sovi Basin Protected Area (20.0 km¬≤), Nadarivatu Forest Reserve, Tomaniivi Nature Reserve (11.04 km¬≤), and Colo-i-suva Forest Reserve (4.97 km¬≤) on Viti Levu, and the contiguous Ravilevu Nature Reserve (40.2 km¬≤) and Bouma Lavena Recreation Reserve (37.69 km¬≤) on Taveuni.UNEP-WCMC (2020).

By 1900 it was on the verge of bankruptcy, but also Auckland's largest engineering works, supplying a wide range of goods and often leading in the design of equipment used to exploit the country's resources, such as timber and flax mills, crushers for gold ore and locomotives, pumps, cement and gas works and steamers. The foundry started with engineer, George Fraser, and a handful of employees, but grew to employ hundreds and operated under several names, including Fraser and Tinne and George Fraser & Sons Ltd. 1886 birds-eye view of Stanley St and Grafton Road. The largest buildings in the street were those of the Phoenix Foundry  Origins 1854-1863  In 1854 Henry Allright, a civil engineer, and William Kinloch started a small iron foundry in Mechanics Bay, where the Auckland and Newmarket railway bridge now crosses Parnell Rise, but it was then beside the harbour. From 1859 it traded as Kinlock and Hill. In 1861 George Fraser bought it for ¬£190 and employed about 30 hands to assemble and fit out imported threshing machines and portable engines. Orders for castings and iron work for the army during the 1863 invasion of the Waikato gave George a good start. The cupola for melting iron required 8 men to operate its bellows to provide a blast. George updated the plant. 1864 Phoenix Foundry in Stanley St  Move to Stanley Street - Fraser & Tinne 1864-1882  Notice was given that the foundry site was required under the Auckland and Drury Railway Act 1863, so, in 1864, were acquired in nearby Stanley Street, and a partnership began with Theodore Tinne. He was an engineer from Liverpool, where his family were merchants and had benefitted from government compensation paid when slavery was abolished. The Fraser and Tinne partnership lasted until 1881, 1883, or, more probably, 1882; George said the partnership ended on 10 May 1882, though an advert indicated Theodore left for England in 1885. Theodore's wife had died in 1880, shortly after the birth of his son. The new foundry had a -long machine shop, a 10-ton crane, tramways, 3 forges, a brass foundry with 4 ton-crucibles, planing machines able to take iron up to x , 2 steam hammers, drilling, nibbing, punching, shearing and boiler plate-bending machines and 8 lathes, able to turn anything up to diameter and cut screws up to x . They were powered by a 9hp horizontal steam-engine. In 1865 Phoenix advertised marine and land engines, railway plant, boiler making, saw mills, pumps, ornamental iron work, screw and paddle steamers, windlass metal, rudder bands, patent slips, wool presses, electric telegraphs and marine cables. They also produced flax-dressers, machinery and boilers for the stampers on the Thames goldfields, girders for a new Lunatic Asylum and equipment for a tannery at Panmure and Seccombe and Son's (later Lion) brewery. A report on 26 September 1868 said the foundry had 80 staff and that, \\"On visiting the Phoenix Foundry yesterday, we were surprised to see the quantity of machinery that is being turned out, as well as at the extent of the premises and the mechanical appliances.\\" Phoenix was closely associated with the Onehunga ironworks from 1873, making much of its plant and using its products. A large erecting shop was added in 1874. = Sawmills = Phoenix built all the machinery for the Auckland Sawmill Company, set up in 1863 in Mercury Bay, at what is now Whitianga. It was described as the largest saw-mill manufactured in the colony, with iron saw frames holding one to thirty saws each and patterns prepared for all sizes of saw-mills. The engines, boiler and breaking-down and circular saw benches were designed and erected by George's father-in-law, Alexander Davidson, who had arrived in Auckland by 1860. In the late 1870s Phoenix was providing plant for mills being built at Aratapu (near Te K≈çpuru), Tairua, Shortland (now south Thames), Mercury Bay and Cabbage Bay (now Colville). = Flax = Phoenix Foundry in Stanley St about 1902 George invented and built a flax machine at the foundry, and it was said that nothing better has been devised to supersede it up to the present time and that it was the foundation of the flax-milling industry. The Auckland Rope and Twine Company's machinery in Stanley St was made by Phoenix in 1882, but losses brought about its sale to a Dunedin company, Donaghy, in 1894. = Ships = SS Rotomahana being fitted out at the 1874 Fraser and Tinne foundry, Mechanics Bay in 1876 1886 birds-eye view of 1874 Mechanics Bay foundry In 1867 Phoenix built engines for the kauri-built, twin screw, 70 ton dwt, top-sail schooner, Tauranga, the first coastal trading steamer built and engined in the colony, though a harbour steamer, Governor Wynyard, had been built at Auckland in 1851. The engine, weighing about 30 tons, had to be moved over a poor road to the beach and lifted from the beach in Mechanics Bay with a flax rope spun by the foundry's machinery. In 1872 Phoenix re-engined Southern Cross with , surface-condensing compound engines and high-pressure boilers, almost halving its coal consumption. It was the first marine compound engine in the country and it was reported that George Fraser almost failed to convince her owner, John Sangster Macfarlane, who reluctantly accepted the advice. The conversion was a success and brought many more orders, so that the Mechanics Bay foundry was enlarged in 1874, with its own wharf, to increase boiler and repair capacity. The expanded site was on three sections of the Harbour Board reclamation in Mechanics' Bay. The staff increased to over 300. The first order was for four Government launches, followed by the first bucket dredge in country for the Harbour Board. Part of the reason for the increase was that George and John Sangster formed syndicates between 1872 and 1878, with Alexander McGregor, William Laird, Captain Casey and D. B. and James Cruickshank. They built and operated many new compound-engined ships - Rowena, lona, Argyle, Staffa, Douglas, McGregor, Minnie Casey, Annie Millbank and Lily. Other work included engines and boilers for Star of the South, Kennedy (twin screw), Pilot, Douglas, Little Agnes, Ohinemuri, Weka and Rob Roy. The syndicates went on to form the Northern Steam Ship Company in 1881. On 20 November 1876 Phoenix launched the first iron ship built in Auckland, the Rotomahana'. This was followed by Rose Casey and Robert.flying their yellow house-flag with a phoenix = Railway bridges = Many of the railway bridges on the North Island Main Trunk line were supplied by Phoenix in the 1900s, with girders up to long. = Gold = In 1867 Phoenix erected the first battery on the Thames Goldfields, at Kuranui. A gold extraction plant at Stanley Street could test lots to assess the viability of mining ventures and the works was soon at capacity. By 1868 Phoenix had built 15 batteries in the Thames area. George Fraser III became Engineer to Waitekauri Gold Mining Company in 1896. About 1900 Phoenix built four gold dredges for the South Island goldfields.  George Fraser & Sons 1883-1900  In January 1884 George gained fame by salvaging the steamer Triumph from the shore at Tiritiri Island. Although purchased for ¬£2,100 and being greatly acclaimed, attempts to sell or trade the vessel profitably failed and it had to be sold in Britain in 1888 to stave off bankruptcy as the company struggled with recession. Triumph flew the company flag, depicting a phoenix on a yellow background. In 1888 Phoenix helped build, and then used, Devonport's Calliope Dry Dock for repairs, as shown in a 1908 photo of Whangape. Although generally described as a good employer, ten of Phoenix's employees took the company to court for wage arrears during the period leading up to bankruptcy in 1889. However, it was also described as minor and arrangements were made with creditors. By 1890 Phoenix claimed the problems were over. A fire in 1893 destroyed patterns, drawings and much of the machinery at Stanley Street. Within a year, plant had been replaced and a new head office and smaller foundry opened on Customs Street, in the former Clyde Ironworks.  George Fraser & Sons Ltd 1900-1952  By 1900 the Phoenix Foundry was by far the largest engineering works in Auckland, with moulding equipment, steam hammers, heavy cranes, the shipyard. The lathes could turn up to diameter, there were two 10-ton overhead cranes, castings were up to 8 tons, a 12 ton steam hammer and over 100 staff. The sons were taken into the business, without investing capital, on 10 May 1886, but George Fraser & Sons didn't become a limited company until June 1900, at a time when the partnership, George, George junior and William were facing bankruptcy. Half the shares were issued jointly to George and his son Joseph, with the remaining 3,000 allocated 999 each to George junior and Joseph, 599 to Elizabeth, 400 to John Ernest and one each to George, Elizabeth and Theodore Tinne Fraser. Samuel Fraser was assistant manager in the early 1890s and then built the Waikino Battery for the Waihi Company. William predeceased his father on October 31, 1900. George Fraser IV took over the foundry after the death of his father in 1901. He had trained with Mort's Dock Engineering Co, as manager of their outdoor work. Phoenix closed after his death in 1933, during the Great Depression, but reopened around 1935. Joseph Fraser, the company's secretary and director, died in 1937. John Fraser was George's only surviving son and ran the firm until his death in 1944. The firm continued till 1950, or 1952, when Tappenden Motors took over. Tappenden applied for a licence to sell fuel in 1952. The site was sold after Alan Gibbs bought Tappenden, in a move which has been described as asset stripping. Since then, Grafton Gully Bypass (part of the Central Motorway) was built, from 2001 to 2003, and University of Auckland Business School was built in 2003. Prior to the construction, an archaeological survey of the area of the Phoenix Foundry and the Fraser family house, exposed a furnace for scrap, with two buttressed brick flues. The curved flue, with bevelled arch bricks, was rebuilt on the corner of Stanley St and Grafton Road Bridge, on the Coast-to-Coast walkway. The survey also found 3 brick-lined industrial wells, relating to old breweries, bottlers and engineers,  Further reading  Short History of George Fraser & Sons 1862 - 1952, published in Auckland, April 1958 by W Hampton-Reynolds  References   External links  * Photo of Fraser and Tinne foundry in Mechanics Bay from Constitution Hill * 1903 photo of interior of Stanley St works Category:History of the Auckland Region Category:Engineering companies of New Zealand Category:Construction and civil engineering companies of New Zealand Category:New Zealand companies established in 1861 Category:Defunct companies of New Zealand Category:Manufacturing companies based in Auckland Category:History of Auckland Category:Construction and civil engineering companies established in 1861 ","title":"Phoenix Foundry, Auckland"},{"id":"65245122","title":"1958‚Äì59 Mexican Segunda Divisi√≥n season"},{"id":"65245169","text":"The Sunday Magazine is a two-hour news and current affairs programme hosted by Piya Chattopadhyay on CBC Radio One.

Personal Life Sarah was born on 26 August 1886 in Pennsylvania, the daughter of William Wallace Corbin and Emma Flora Hamilton. She married Henry Martyn Robert, Jr, son of Henry Martyn Robert and Helen M Thresher, on 26 August 1919 in Tioga County, New York. Their son was Henry Martyn Robert III. She died on 1 May 1972 in Annapolis, Maryland and is buried at Saint Anne's Cemetery. Education and Professional Life She graduated from Oswego High School in 1905, and Syracuse University in 1909. Robert taught American History in New York and New Jersey High Schools for a decade. She was an authority on parliamentary procedure, teaching courses on parliamentary law at Columbia University, the University of Maryland, and The United States Naval Academy. She holds the honorary degree of Doctor of Literature. She served as a trustee for Robert‚Äôs Rules of Order, whose creator, Henry Martyn Robert, was her father-in-law. She was head of the authorship team for the 7th edition, printed in 1970. DAR Membership Robert joined the Stewart Tea Party Chapter in 1921, where she soon served in a variety of roles, including Chapter Regent. She also served as Maryland State Recording Secretary, as national chairman on Patriotic Education (1926‚Äì1929), as chairman of the Credentials Committee (1931‚Äì1934), and as Treasurer General (1935-1938). She was an advocate for both DAR Schools and standardization and simplification of DAR publications and practices, such as registration at Continental Congress. =DAR President General Administration= The Golden Jubilee Administration Robert was elected DAR President General in 1938, having run unopposed. The DAR celebrated its 50th anniversary during the Robert administration. Projects overseen by Roberts include funding for a new high-school facility at Tamassee DAR School, which would be completed in 1942 and named for her, the continuation of the Penny Pines project to replant thousands of acres of trees in national forests, and the Valley Forge Bell Tower project at Washington Memorial Chapel in the Valley Forge National Historical Park, which installed 17 new bells.). She also represented the DAR at the 1939 World‚Äôs Fair in New York City. With war on the horizon, Robert initiated War Relief Service Committees and encouraged chapter partnership with the American Red Cross. Marian Anderson Controversy In 1939 the DAR denied the use of DAR Constitution Hall to the famous black contralto Marian Anderson. Anderson was singing as part of a concert series in Washington being organized by Howard University. Her fame required a large venue and the DAR Hall was the largest in the city. However, Robert cited segregation laws and longstanding agreements regarding segregation among D.C. performance venues as the reason for the denying use of the Hall. The concert was instead held at the Lincoln Memorial on the National Mall in Washington, but the DAR's decision created a backlash, including the resignation of First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt from the organization. Four years later, in 1942, the DAR invited Anderson to perform in Constitution Hall in the Army Emergency Relief Fund concert series hosted there. Negotiations resulted in that concert being integrated, but Anderson was unsuccessful in negotiating for the promise of future integrated events. Anderson went on to perform at Continental Hall in 1953 and 1956, and the DAR awarded her the Centennial Medal in 1992 for outstanding service to the nation.

Mammoth central (https://www.elfinanciero.com.mx/nacional/santa-lucia-una-central-de-mamuts- encuentran-200-esqueletos-y-podria-haber-muchos-mas) is a paleontological site on the grounds of the Santa Luc√≠a Airport in the state of Mexico, Mexico which contains the remains of at least 200 Columbian mammoths as well as 25 camels and five horses. The site is the world's largest concentration of mammoth remains; the previous was the Mammoth Site of Hot Springs in South Dakota with only 61 individuals. Human tools and carved bones have also been discovered at the site, suggesting that humans utilized the site to trap and kill large mammals. More fossils continue to be found at the site. The dig will end in 2022, when the airport's construction is projected to conclude.  History  The site is believed to have been the boggy shores of an ancient lake bed where animals were trapped 10,0000 to 20,000 years ago. Human tools have been found at the site. Some have hypothesized that humans drove the mammoths into the area to kill them. Archaeologist Rub√©n Manzanilla L√≥pez, of the Instituto Nacional de Antropolog√≠a e Historia, has also reported that the mammoths appeared to have been \\"carved up\\" by humans. It remains unclear whether the mammoths died of natural causes and were then carved by humans. The site is only from artificial pits which were once used by humans to trap and kills large mammals.  Discovery  A military plane at the airport The site was discovered during the construction of Mexico City Santa Luc√≠a Airport. Due to the frequency of remains and artifacts, all bulldozers and construction workers are accompanied by archeologists. Construction has been stopped multiple times for further excavations.

The song, of the genre Neues Geistliches Lied (NGL), is part of German hymnals and songbooks.  History  Oosterhuis wrote the text in Dutch, \\"Zolang er mensen zijn op aarde\\" in 1959, when he was a priest for students. The melody was composed by Tera de Marez Oyens the same year. Dieter Trautwein's translation from 1966, revised in 1972, was included in the German Catholic hymnal Gotteslob as GL 425, in the section \\"Leben in Gott - Vertrauen und Trost\\" (Life in God ‚Äì trust and consolation). It was also printed in the Protestant hymnal of 1995 Evangelisches Gesangbuch, as EG 427. The song is part of many songbooks.  Text, theme and music  The text is in five stanzas of four lines each which rhyme in Dutch, but not in the translation. It is based on , about God's care for creations as small as birds and flowers. It begins with thanks to God, who is addressed as a personal \\"du\\" (You), for having given life to people and fruits. It alludes to the promise from : \\"While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease.\\" God has nourished birds and made flowers beautiful, as the third stanza says. The second stanza reminds of God's word calling for peace (\\"solang dein Wort zum Frieden ruft\\"). The fourth stanza addresses God as Light and giver of life, with his Son the bread uniting the believers. The final stanza calls all who owe their life to God to stay in communication. The melody has been described as simple (schlicht), with a forward-moving steady rhythm. All four short lines are similar. Its irregular dancing beat has been compared to a tango. The song has been used in the context of preservation of natural environment and peace movement, because the \\"solang\\" (as long), often repeated in the text, is a reminder that the state of both the environment and peace are fragile.

Although 63% of this ecoregion is covered with closed broadleaf evergreen forest or open forest, much of this has been disturbed in the past by human activity, and many of the rare species of the area have been relegated to the isolated areas or higher elevations.  Location and description  Mindanao is the southernmost large island of the Philippines. The Visayas Islands occupy the center of the Philippines; this ecoregion includes the eastern Visayas - the largest islands of the ecoregion being Leyte, Samar, and Bohol. There are also a number of smaller islands, including Camiguin, Basilan, and Dinagat. The lowland forests are below 1,000 meters in elevation, with a few small peak up to 1,400 meters, and the median for the ecoregion being .  Climate  The climate of the ecoregion is Tropical rainforest climate (K√∂ppen climate classification (Af)). This climate is characterized as hot, humid, and having at least 60 mm of precipitation every month. An important factor in this ecoregion is whether the location is in the main typhoon track from July to November. The northern portions of Leyte and Samar are in this track, while the island of Mindanao and its satellite islands are not. For the locations in the typhoon track, up to a third of annual precipiation may occur during typhoons.  Flora and fauna  Although this ecoregion is spread among many islands, the florisic communities are related, as Mindanao and the eastern Visayas were all one connected island in the lower sea levels of the Pleistocene (the ice age from 2.8 million years ago to 11,700 years ago). Currently, 43% of the ecoregion is closed broadleaf evergreen forest, 20% is open forest, 9% is under cultivation for agriculture, and 5% is non-forest herbaceous cover. Beach vegetation merges into beach forest away from the coast, featuring trees of genus Casuarina (a tall evergreen with feather-like leaves) and Barringtonia. The lowland rain forests are dominated by trees of genus (Dipterocarpus) up through 400 meters. As elevations increase the dipterocarps are joined by Pterocarpus indicus, Pandans Pandanus, and others. Upper hill dipterocarp forests are found from 650 meters to 1,000 meters, where the dominant trees are Shorea polysperma, oaks, chestnuts, and elaeocarps. Above 1,000 meters, the ecoregions transitions into montane rain forest. The small outlying islands preserve distinctive sub-ecoregions. Camiguin Island, with an area of 238 km2, that has two endemic mammal species and an endemic frog.

He became famous in Portuguese intellectual circles at the time as being a member of the group that called themselves Life's Vanquished (). Background Lobo de √Åvila was born in Lisbon on 17 March 1860, the son of Joaquim Tom√°s Lobo de √Åvila, 1st Count of Valbom, and his wife, Maria Francisca de Paula de Orta, daughter of Ant√≥nio Jos√© de Orta, 1st Viscount of Orta, and his wife Manuela de Jes√∫s Thoronjo. He was thus linked by birth to the aristocracy of the Portuguese capital, Lisbon, and to its financial and political circles. Writing With a penchant for writing, Lobo de √Åvila first published in 1878, at the age of 18, when he was a law student at the University of Coimbra. This was a travel book entitled A Traveller's Portfolio: Pencil Notes, which was intended to be published as a serial in a Portuguese newspaper, Di√°rio da Manh√£. During that time, he also wrote for the periodical Revista Liter√°ria in Coimbra, publishing, with Lu√≠s de Magalh√£es, a set of pamphlets of social and political criticism that appeared under the title of Zumbidos. He also wrote for several other publications in Coimbra, often using pseudonyms. Lobo de √Åvila published in Ilustrado a set of much-appreciated articles of analysis and criticism about a proposed draft revision of the Constitutional Charter of the Portuguese Monarchy. However, in 1889 he founded and edited the daily O Tempo, which later became the organ of those supporting such proposals. Lobo de √Åvila was responsible for finalising the historical book, O Pr√≠ncipe Perfeito, on the subject of King Jo√£o II of Portugal, by fellow member of the Vencidos da Vida, Oliveira Martins, which the author could not complete before his death. Politics Lobo de √Åvila obtained a Bachelor of Law degree with distinction from the Faculty of Law of the University of Coimbra, but in June 1884, even before obtaining graduation, he had already been elected as a Deputy to Portugal‚Äôs parliament, known as the Cortes, representing the Progressive Party. On December 1893, he became the Minister for Public Works, Commerce and Industry in the first government presided over by Ernesto Hintze Ribeiro. In September 1894, he was transferred to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, a position he held when he died. Life‚Äôs Vanquished Life's Vanquished () was the name given by the members to an informal group of intellectuals in Lisbon in the last two decades of the 19th century. Among the Vanquished were some of the writers, politicians, and aristocrats that had strived to modernise the country in their youth. Their perceived failure led them to channel their disenchantment into an ironic decadent dilettantism. They met weekly for champagne suppers, and Lobo de √Åvila‚Äôs newspaper, O Tempo, was the unofficial organ of the group. Apart from Lobo de √Åvila, members included the novelist Jos√© Maria de E√ßa de Queir√≥s; the diplomat, the Marquis of Soveral; the writer Ramalho Ortig√£o;he aristocratic botanist, the Count of Ficalho; and Oliveira Martins. Others, including King Carlos, were occasionally invited to join their dinners. Death Because of his homosexuality, √Åvila was playfully known as Carlotinha, or \\"little, female Carlos\\". He died in Sintra on 9 September 1895, after returning to Lisbon from the Baths of Ger√™s where he had been taking a water cure.

He did much to establish the Belgian presence on the Upper Congo River in the last two years of his life. Early years (1843‚Äì1881) Edmond-Winnie-Victor Hanssens was born in Furnes, Belgium on 25 July 1843. He entered the √âcole Militaire (Military School) on 1 March 1860 and was appointed second lieutenant on 22 March 1862. He was posted to the 11th line regiment. On 3 July 1867 he was appointed lieutenant. He entered the √âcole de Guerre in 1871 and obtained the certificate of deputy √©tat-major in 1875. He was promoted to captain in 1876, and became a tutor of the military art course at the √âcole Militaire. Journey to L√©opoldville (1881‚Äì1882) In 1881 Hanssens volunteered for the Upper Congo Study Committee of the Military Cartographic Institute. He left for Africa at the end of January 1882, and reached Banana on 5 March 1882. With his travelling companions, Lieutenants Joseph Vandevelde, Th√©odore Nilis and Nicolas Grang, he went up the river to Vivi. There he met Henry Morton Stanley on 4 July 1881. Stanley was exhausted, and was on the way to the coast to return to Europe to recuperate. Eduard Pechu√´l-Loesche, the Brussels appointee, assumed leadership in Stanley's place, but Hanssens was given command of the Bas-Congo region, with authority from Vivi to L√©opoldville. His main responsibility was to organize the Cataracts region to enable rapid delivery of supplies to L√©opoldville. He went up to L√©opoldville, which he reached on 3 September 1882, to find that both Pechuel-Loesche and Charles-Marie de Braconnier, the station commander, were sick. Relations with the local Congolese people were poor, food was scarce and morale was low. He encouraged Pechuel Loesche to return to Europe to explain the situation, and was appointed to serve in his place. First Upper Congo expedition (1882‚Äì1883) Steamer and pirogue from Coquihat's Sur le Haut-Congo (1888) Hanssens decided that the posts in the Cataracts district were in good hands, but the Upper Congo was unoccupied and at risk of being taken by the French. The steamer En Avant was immobilized, with an essential component missing that would only be found when Stanley returned. The only available vessel was the whaler Eclaireur. Hanssens sent Braconnier on leave to the coast, and replaced him at L√©opoldville by second lieutenant Grang. He began construction of a road from Manyanga to L√©opoldville, and renewed relations with the local chief N'Galiema. He decided to set up a depot of food and equipment in M'Suata to supply the future Upper Congo stations, left in the Eclaireur with an agent, Baker, and 11 Zanzibaris on 13 October 1882 and reached M'Suata on 17 October 1882, where Lieutenant Eug√®ne Janssen was in command. He took 12 Zanzibaris from the garrison, and temporarily appointed Boulanger in place of Janssen, who had prepared the expedition up the Congo. Hanssens headed upstream on 23 October 1882 in the Eclaireur with an escort of two pirogues. He passed the mouth of the Kasai River on 24 October 1882 and passed Tshumbiri on 27 October 1882. On 30 October 1882 he reached Bolobo, where he negotiated for ten days with Kuka, chief of the , who then signed a treaty that placed his lands and people under the protection of the AIA. His crews at once began to build a station. Hanssens sent the Eclaireur back to L√©opoldville to collect supplies and to bring back Lieutenant Orban to take command of the new station. On 22 December 1882 lieutenant Camille Coquilhat joined him. Coquilhat had recently arrived from Europe and informed him of the plans by the Haut-Congo Study Committee to establish stations in √âquateur and among the Bangalas. Hanssens returned to L√©opoldville to organize an expedition for this purpose. On his way he made treaties with the Congolese people at the mouth of the Kasai and acquired land for the Kwamouth post. Kouilou-Niari mission (1883) Kouilou-Niari River, entering the Atlantic to the north of the Cabinda Province Hanssens reached to L√©opoldville at the start of January 1883 and heard that Stanley had already returned from Europe and had designated him in command of the entire Kouilou- Niari River basin between the Pool and the Atlantic. Hanssens went down to Manyanga where he met Stanley and received his instructions. On 4 February Stanley 1883 directed him to leave at once for the Upper Kwilu-Niadi, to establish a line of communication between Manyanga and the Kwilu-Niadi, and to continue his explorations downstream until he had joined up with Captain Elliott's party in Stephanieville (Loudima). The operation was in response to a concern by king Leopold II of Belgium that the Portuguese might prevail in their claim to control the mouth of the Congo. If so, Belgium would need an outlet to the Atlantic north of Loango. This was a sensitive task, since Hanssens would have to persuade the Bateke chiefs to give the Belgians priority over the rights granted to Pierre Savorgnan de Brazza for the French, without offending the French expedition. The expedition had left Vivi on 13 January 1883 under Captain Grant-Elliott, and would have Isangila as a base. Hanssens left Manyanga on 23 February 1883 accompanied by Lieutenant Harou, and travelled through untracked forest. He reached the Niadi at Kindamba, then on 2 April 1883 found its junction with Destrain, in St√©plianieville. Ascending the Niadi he founded the Philippeville post at the limit of the territories granted to de Brazza. The post was founded at the confluence of the Bouenza and Niari rivers on behalf of Belgian interests under the cover of the Haut Congo Study Committee. On his way back Hanssens was attacked by local people and injured in the foot by a shot from a flintlock. He returned to Manyanga on 20 May 1883 and went down to Boma to have his foot treated. He returned to the upper Niadi to conclude treaties with the local chiefs and founded the post of Mukumbi on the Manyanga-Philippeville route. With this rapid territorial occupation the problem of access to the ocean was solved. However, in 1885 agreements were made with the French and Portuguese that allowed Belgium to withdraw from the area. Hanssens, like other Belgians, used force to compel the local men to serve as porters. In 1883 he burned twenty villages when people refused to work. Second Upper Congo expedition (1884) While Hanssens was concerned with organization of the territories below L√©opoldville, Stanley undertook to major expeditions in the upper Congo and founded stations at √âquateur and Stanley Falls. The Belgians thought it was urgent to occupy the territory between them, but Stanley was exhausted and suffering from liver disease. Hanssens came to meet him in L√©opoldville on 15 February 1884, and received order to establish presence in the region between √âquateur and the Falls. Hanssens organized an expedition with three small steamers with a total of about 20 tons: the En-Avant, A.I.A. and Royal, and a few small sailboats. There were seven Belgians, about fifty Africans and large amounts of goods and supplies. The flottila left on 23 March 1884, and stopped at M'Suata, where the commander Janssen had recently drowned accidentally. On 29 March 1884 Hanssens met Pierre de Brazza, and had a friendly discussion. The expedition reach Bolobo on 3 April 1884, where lieutenant Charles Liebrechts had formed a good relationship with the Bayanzi. They continued upstream, founded the N'Gandu post and made treaties with the chiefs along the river. Hanssens reached √âquateurville on 17 April 1884 with the three steamers and six Europeans, Wester, Amelot, Drees, Gu√©rin, Courtois and Nicholls. He found that Alphonse van G√®le and Camille Coquilhat had made it into a model station. At the suggestion of Van Gele and Coquihat, Hanssens interrupted his journey to explore the mouth of the Ubangi River He left in the En Avant on 19 April 1884 with Van G√®le, Courtois, Gu√©rin and Amelot, ten Zanzibaris and one local African as an interpreter. Going downstream the steamer skirted the right bank of the Congo River, but was carried by the current into a maze of islands. After three days they saw some native fishermen in a canoe. Van G√®le managed to persuade them to act as pilots, and after four hours of full steam on 21 April 1884 entered a strong stream of yellow water, the Ubangi, which they ascended to the Bisongo village. They received a friendly reception, and Hanssens exchanged blood with Chief Mkoko. The chief agreed to place both banks of the Ubangi under the protection of the International Association of the Congo. After returning to Equateurville Hanssens left Van G√®le in charge and took Coquihat with him to found the Bangala station, the future Nouvelle Anvers. On return to √âquateur, Hanssens made careful preparation for his expedition to the Bangalas, where he expected to place Coquilhat in command of a new station. He took four of the local people to act as guides and interpreters. The flotilla reached Luluonga on 27 April 1884, where the chiefs signed treaties. On 4 May 1884 it reached Makanza, where the local people were distrustful of the Belgians, having had a bad experience with Stanley. Hanssens landed first, armed only with his pipe and tobacco pouch, and walked through the crowd of armed men to the chief, whom he shook by the hand. This broke the ice, and the chief proposed that they become blood brothers, which was done. According to Hanssens, chief Matabwike said, \\"We have to receive the white amongst ourselves because the white is good; wherever he makes his villages, he is loved and has the confidence of the people. And proof of this is the presence of these four men from Ukute [the Bakuti], who have left their wives and their homes to follow Nsassi [Hanssens' name] on his voyages and who don't stop speaking well of him and his sons' (Hanssens 1892:39). A treaty was signed on 7 May 1884 and after some haggling it was agreed that the Belgians could build a post at Iboko. Hanssens left for √âquateur on 11 May 1884 to obtain more supplies for his journey to the Falls, and returned to Iboko on 24 May 1884, where Coquilhat was organizing the post. Captain Hanssens Hanssens left the next day, and briefly explored the Mongala River, signing a treaty with Chief Mobeka near its mouth. On 4 June 1884 the expedition reached the Itimbiri River, and went up it for . On 21 June 1884 it reached Basoko at the mouth of the Aruwimi River, where a post of three Hausas was established. Courtois died from hematuria of 26 June 1884. The expedition reached the Falls on 3 July 1884. Hassens relieved Adrian Binnie, who had commanded there since Stanley's visit in December 1883, and would return to the coast. He replaced him with the Swedish Lieutenant Arvid Wester, with Louis-Gustave Amelot as his deputy. On 11 July 1884 Hanssens left the Falls. He travelled along the left bank, and entered the Lomami River. He landed at Iboko on 19 July 1884. The people there were suspicious, since Hanssens had exchanged blood with their enemies, and he stayed for a few days to reassure them that the Belgians wanted friendship with all the tribes, but would not side with one against another. Hanssens left Iboko on 22 July 1884, and returned to L√©opoldville on 6 August 1884. He met the Association's general administrator, Sir Francis de Winton, in L√©opoldville. He requested and received the emergency dispatch of supplies and reinforcements for the Bangalas. He then returned upstream to obtain new treaties to confirm the rights of the Association over all the territory between Kwamouth and Bolobo. On 18 October 1884 he was in Bolobo with lieutenant Liebrechts when he learned he had been made a Knight of the Order of Leopold, the first Belgian to receive this award for services in Africa. Return to the Vivi and death (1884) Hanssens returned to L√©opoldville on 31 October 1884. On 3 November 1884 he heard that the Association planned an expedition to the Basokos to try to free the Italian explorer Casati, who had been captured by the people of the Nepoko on his return from a journey in the Sudan. He assumed he would take command, but three days later announced that he intended to return to Belgium by Portuguese boat that would leave Banana on 17 November 1884. The reason for this decision are not clear. He left L√©opoldville on 8 November 1884 after dividing his command into two regions. Guillaume Casman was given the territory from the Pool to Equateur, while Van G√®le took the territory from there to the Falls. Hanssens again met Sir Francis de Winton in Vivi and agreed to postpone taking leave and return to the Upper Congo. However, he fell sick and died of hematuria on 28 December 1884.

The exact date of his birth is unknown. The scholar Odysseas Lampsidis estimates his age at the time of his death at 40‚Äì45 years, which would put his birth in the years around 1125. Career and death He held the title of sebastos and the office of megas hetaireiarches. It is unknown when he assumed his office, but was likely appointed to it during the early years of Manuel I Komnenos' reign (1143‚Äì1180). Tyre in 1167 (from a manuscript of William of Tyre's Historia, ) Although the office of megas hetaireiarches was of military origin, George Palaiologos' known career was purely as a diplomat. In 1162 he led a diplomatic mission to Hungary to negotiate the marriage of Manuel I's daughter and heiress, Maria, to the Hungarian prince B√©la, and to escort him back to Byzantium. He also led a similar mission to the Kingdom of Jerusalem in 1167, escorting Manuel I's niece Maria Komnene to be wed to King Amalric of Jerusalem. His secretary, Leo Megistos, wrote at least three monodies in his honour, emphasizing his qualities and his travels in a diplomatic role to foreign lands; according to Leo, these included not only Hungary and Jerusalem, but also Serbia, Italy, the \\"lands of the Danube\\", and Germany, as well as the lands of the Turks. He may also have been sent to missions inside the Empire, in Greece and specifically the Peloponnese. He is also attested as one of the attendants to the Council of Blachernae of March 1166. George Palaiologos was also a patron of art. He dedicated a painting of the Archangel Michael in a church in Triaditza, showing himself and his son Alexios with the saint. He also founded a monastery dedicated to the Theotokos, whose lavish decoration is also well known: it included portraits of the emperors from whom he claimed descent or kinship, as well as a series of paintings celebrating Manuel I's military victories over the Hungarians. Two of his seals of office survive. He died sometime between 1167 and 1170, when his successor John Doukas is attested as megas hetaireiarches. A letter by Eustathius of Thessalonica to John Doukas, which mentions the latter as megas hetaireiarches, may be datable as early as 1168, which would put George Palaiologos's death sometime in late 1167 or 1168. According to Leo Megistos, he fell ill at Adrianople while returning from an embassy to Hungary. This mission is not mentioned in other sources, but probably occurred after the Byzantine capture of Sirmium during Emperor Manuel's invasion of Hungary in 1167. Family George Palaiologos was survived by his wife and several children, as well as by some of his siblings, of whom only the name of a brother, the sebastos Constantine (), is known. The identity of George's wife is not known, but at least one of his sons, Alexios, is known by name. He eventually became despot and heir-apparent to Emperor Alexios III Angelos () before his death in early 1203. Alexios' daughter Theodora married the megas domestikos Andronikos Palaiologos. They had numerous children, the most prominent of whom was Michael VIII Palaiologos, who became emperor of Nicaea in 1259 and restored the Byzantine Empire in 1261, founding the Palaiologan dynasty.

Biography DuMond was born in France as a US citizen. He studied at Caltech, earning his bachelor's degree in 1916 with the construction of a calculating machine, a \\"harmonic analyzer\\". For his master's thesis he built a calculating machine for complex numbers. During World War I, he was employed (1917‚Äì1918) at General Electric as an electrical engineer, working on determining the distance of artillery via sound. In 1919‚Äì1920 he was at the Thomson-Houston Company in Paris, and 1920‚Äì21 at the National Bureau of Standards, where he worked on ballistics. Returning to graduate school at the California Institute of Technology, he in 1929 received his doctorate in physics. He spent the rest of his career at Caltech, originally at the invitation of Robert Millikan. From 1938 he was an Associate Professor and from 1946, a Professor. He retired in 1963. DuMond became a Fellow of the American Physical Society in 1931. He was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1953. Work Starting with his Ph.D. dissertation, DuMond became famous for investigating the line broadening in the Compton effect due to the speed distribution of the electrons in the atom. To this end, he developed a new type of X-ray spectrometer with several crystals and also had the original idea for X-ray spectrometers with curved crystal surfaces. Characteristically, he built his measuring equipment himself, often demonstrating great mechanical skill. Later he dealt with the precise determination of fundamental physical constants, such as Planck's constant and the electron charge. He found a discrepancy in the value of the electron charge between the value that Millikan had measured with his oil drop experiment and the value from X-ray diffraction experiments. Millikan then checked his old experiment and corrected its result. (The viscosity of the air affected the answer. Millikan assigned a student to measure it.) With E. Richard Cohen, DuMond published regular review reports on the status of the determination of the fundamental physical constants. DuMond also developed a gamma-ray spectrometer, finished only after World War II, with which he then pursued nuclear spectroscopy. During the Second World War DuMond worked on rocket technology, the construction of an aerial camera, and the demagnetization of ships as a measure against magnetic mines. Personal life DuMond was married twice and had three children from his first marriage. One daughter married Wolfgang Panofsky, who was DuMond's Ph.D. student. References *Jesse W. M.

W. Gallagher was a steam turbine-powered tanker built in 1938 by Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation of Quincy for Standard Oil Company of New Jersey with intention of operating between the oil-producing ports of the southern United States and Mexico and the Northeast. The tanker spent her entire career in coastwise trade and was torpedoed and sunk on one of regular journeys in July 1942 by German submarine U-67. Design and Construction Early in 1936 Standard Oil Company of New Jersey decided to expand and modernize their fleet of tankers operating between the southern oil ports and New York and New Jersey. A contract for four of them, of approximately 13,000 deadweight, was awarded to the Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corp. and the ship was laid down at the shipbuilder's yard in Sparrow's Point (yard number 4307) on 11 January 1937, and launched on 22 January 1938, with Mrs. Mary E. Gallagher of New York, wife of Ralph W. Gallagher, serving as the sponsor. The ship was named after Ralph W. Gallagher, an acting vice-president of Standard Oil at the time of construction and future president of the company. The ceremony was attended by nearly 800 people including 450 dignitaries, such as James J. Walker, former mayor of New York, accompanied by his wife Betty Compton and Rear-Admiral Emory S. Land, head of Maritime Commission. The ship was built on the modified Isherwood bracketless principle of longitudinal framing developed by the Bethlehem Shipbuilding's naval architect H. P. Frear. It allowed to economize in weight and ease of construction and was used to build ships for the first time during construction of these four tankers. The tanker had 24 oil compartments capable of carrying 4,500,000 gallons of oil, a dry cargo hold in the front of the vessel which could be accessed through a large hatch on the main deck. The ship had one main deck, and was also equipped with radio including a radio direction finder. The tanker was completely fireproof throughout and was specially equipped for operation in the tropics. As built, the ship was long (between perpendiculars) and abeam, a depth of . R. W. Gallagher was assessed at and and had deadweight of approximately 12,950. The vessel had a steel hull with double bottom, and two oil-burning steam turbines, producing 985 Nhp of power, double reduction geared to one screw propeller, that moved the ship at up to . The steam for the engine was supplied by two water-tube boilers fitted for oil fuel. Upon completion, the tanker departed Baltimore for trial trip on August 3 during which the steamer performed satisfactorily. Following successful trials the tanker left for New York on August 8 to get prepared for commercial service. Operational history After completion of sea trials the tanker was transferred to her owners and arrived in New York on 10 August 1938. From there she sailed on her maiden voyage for the oil ports in the Gulf of Mexico and arrived at Baytown for loading on August 18. The ship then proceeded to Corpus Christi where she loaded oil and returned to Boston on September 13 concluding her maiden voyage. The tanker continued working on the same route through mid-1941 transporting oil from the ports of Corpus Christi, Baytown, Galveston and Baton Rouge to Standard Oil refineries in Baltimore, Boston or Philadelphia. In July 1941 the tanker was shifted to operate between Caribbean refineries located on Aruba and Cura√ßao and mainland of the United States. She also conducted one trip from Cura√ßao to Rio de Janeiro in December 1941. Upon return the tanker proceeded to Newport News where after evaluation she was time chartered to the United States War Shipping Administration on 20 April 1942. The vessel then was put into Newport News Shipbuilding & Drydock Corp. dock in Norfolk where she was defensively armed and restructured to include accommodations for armed guardsmen. After being released on 4 May 1942 the tanker returned to her usual coast-wise service. R. W. Gallagher was part of two Caribbean convoys, OT-3 and TO-4, but otherwise sailed independently. R. W. Gallagher sailed from Newport News in ballast on 29 June 1942 as part of convoy KS-515 together with fifteen other merchant ships and reached Key West on July 5. There the tanker as well as two other ships, SS Paul H. Harwood and SS Socony Vacuum, were met by destroyer to serve as an escort to New Orleans. By the end of the day another steamer, SS Gulfbreeze, joined the convoy. The journey was rather uneventful for the first two days, but in the early morning hours on July 7 Paul H. Harwood was hit by a torpedo and had to be temporarily abandoned. Overton searched the area until noon next day but could not find the submarine while the small convoy continued its journey west. =Sinking= R.W. Gallagher left Baytown for Port Everglades transporting approximately 80,855 barrels of No.6 Navy fuel oil on 10 July 1942. The vessel was under command of captain Aage Petersen and had a crew of forty officers and men in addition to twelve Naval guards. The tanker first sailed to Bolivar Roads in Galveston Bay where she stayed for two days awaiting orders from the Navy as she were to continue unescorted on her trip. After receiving the instructions, the ship sailed out to her destination early in the morning of July 12. The journey was uneventful until the vessel reached the Ship Shoal Wreck Buoy. At about 01:20 on July 13 the tanker was detected by lurking outside Louisiana coast in an approximate position , about 80 miles from Southwest Pass. At about 01:40 U-67 fired two torpedoes at the ship from a distance of approximately 600 meters. R. W. Gallagher was struck in quick succession by both torpedoes on her starboard side around No.3 hold and pump-room. The tanker immediately was put ablaze amidships and started listing to starboard as her engines stopped and a short circuit knocked out all electricity. The explosion destroyed several lifeboats and the captain was effectively cut off at the forecastle from the rest of the crew and unable to issue orders. The crew managed to launch one lifeboat and one raft with the rest of the crew jumping off into the water to avoid the flames. Meanwhile, the submarine seeing that the vessel does not sink rapidly fired another torpedo from approximately 500 meters to deliver coup de gr√¢ce about 10 minutes later aiming for the engines, but inexplicably missed. U-67 fired another torpedo several minutes later obtaining a hit, but due to piston malfunction there was no explosion. Lack of bow torpedoes and arrival of patrol vessel on the scene forced U-67 to leave the area. Meanwhile, the captain stayed aboard the ship until she was about to capsize and had to jump off at about 02:20. The tanker finally capsized forty minutes later but did not sink until approximately 05:30. After cutter Boutwell collected all survivors it was determined that three of them required emergency help and a plane was called for to transport them to the hospital. US Coast Guard PH-2 plane from Biloxi Air Station was dispatched and arrived around 07:00 and took all three to New Orleans. All three of them later died at the hospital. The other survivors were landed in New Orleans by Boutwell at 19:15. Overall, there were forty-two survivors and ten casualties in the attack.

The name derives from malai-alam meaning \\"hill-place,\\" denoting an inhabitant of the hills. They are the largest Scheduled Tribe in Tamil Nadu, with a population of around 358,000. They are divided in to three groups: the Periya Malayalis (\\"big\\" Malayalis) who live in the Shevaroys, the Nadu Malayalis (\\"middle\\" Malayalis) from the Pachaimalais, and the Chinna Malayalis (\\"small\\" Malayalis) from the Kollaimalais. Edgar Thurston believed they were once Tamils from the plains who moved up into the hills and developed their own culture. Each group of Malayalis have their own tales about their origins. According to their traditions, the three groups were descendants of three brothers from Kanchipuram who settled at each of the three hill ranges. One story is this: A long time ago the Vedars (hunting community) of Kagundi, having been refused marriage with Vellalar girls, kidnapped them. To recover them, seven Vellalar men set out with dogs, telling their wives that if their dogs returned alone, they should assume they had perished. At the Palar river, the men were able to cross but the dogs returned home. After the men successfully rescued the girls, they returned home to find themselves presumed dead and their wives now considered widows. Therefore they married Vedar women and moved into the hills. The Malayalis are mainly hill farmers, who cultivate thinai and samai (types of millet). Each village is headed by a headman, who has an extra share of goods from the festivals. Under the headman was the kangani, who did duties for the headman and received some grain in return. They have a system of stratification. The durai is the headman of the village and has the highest status. The moopan is an intermediary between the durai and the kudippadai, the common people. These divisions are only present in social and religious rites. The Malayalis have several types of marriage: arranged marriage (known as sellakalyanam), marriage by elopement (less common) are some. During the nitchayadhartham, the engagement, a group of 10 men, including the groom's father (if alive) goes to the bride's house. The group must wear dhotis and thalaipagai (a turban) such that no hair on the head is seen. Although its original reasoning is unknown, some believe it wards off evil omens. The party is given mats to sit on, and are served water by the girl in order to observe her bearing and manners. If they need more time to observe, they ask for more water. They are then invited to stay for dinner: if the match is not OK, the invitation is decline, but if the match is approved, the invitation is accepted. To fix the bride price, or parisam in Tamill, the bride and groom's party meet on an auspicious day, without bad omens being present, and are offered milk (or starch water). Then follows a symbolic conversation about the quality of the milk, which ends with the groom proposing the bride price. This is then negotiated again twice, which is the final bride price. The bridegroom's family is obligated to give the largest parisam they can afford. The day of the marriage is fixed at the same time. They worship Siva and Vishnu, but mainly worship village goddesses also found in the lowlands such as Mariamman and Draupadiamman. They commonly took oaths holding camphor in front of the god and then extinguish it, symbolizing their desire for the deity to \\"snuff out\\" their life if they have told a lie.

He was executed by Sweden for high treason. Early life and education Krabbe was born at Varberg Castle in eastern Denmark in 1633, the son of the Danish Governor-General of Norway, Iver Krabbe. The family's ancestral home was Jordberga in Scania, which at the time was part of Denmark. J√∂rgen Krabbe studied law at the universities of Bologna, Orl√©ans and Copenhagen. Becoming Swedish In 1658, Scania was ceded to Sweden and J√∂rgen Krabbe decided to give up his prestigious position at the Danish Chancery and pledge loyalty to the King of Sweden, since it was against the law for Scanians to own property in Denmark or to work for the Danish state. King Christian V of Denmark had offered him a position as county judge but Krabbe chose to renounce his career and return to Scania where he had his fianc√©e Jytte Thott. The Krabbe family split their property between their two sons: J√∂rgen took over the Scanian lands and became Swedish, Tage remained Danish and took over their Danish lands. J√∂rgen Krabbe and Jytte Thott got married in Malm√∂ in 1664 and had a lavish wedding feast with guests from both Denmark and Sweden, though the celebrations were exclusively in Danish. J√∂rgen Krabbe had high hopes of a career at the bar in Sweden but he found himself having to turn to large-scale farming as his main employment, and in his letters, he complained bitterly of this although he was very fond of Krogholm Castle where he lived with his wife. The same year as his wedding, Krabbe gained recognition as a Swedish nobleman, and was also a representative in the Swedish Diet in Stockholm. In 1676 he became a Swedish Baron, which he found to be an empty title compared to the career he had wished for. Treason That same year, the Scanian War broke out and Krabbe was accused of collusion with the local resistance movement (the snaphaner) and of having a taste for all things Danish. He had offered the Danish admirals Juel and Tromp dinner when they reconquered the town of Ystad earlier that year and he had also been present when a group of local resistance men had captured two Swedes in his brother-in-law Knud Thott's orchard. Krabbe traveled to the Swedish enclave at Malm√∂ of his own free will, hoping to clear up all misunderstandings, but instead he was arrested and charged with high treason. On 6 November 1676, he was sentenced to lose his life, honour and property. He then spent several months in a cell at Malm√∂ Castle before he was shot in Malm√∂'s central square on 16 January 1678. He was buried inside the parish church at Tosterup, near Ystad. Jytte Thott had pleaded with King Charles XI of Sweden to pardon her husband, but the king answered that no amount of tears could save Krabbe. Jytte Thott took to her bed and grieved her husband so deeply that she spent the rest of her life in black. She had to leave their home Krogholm and moved to a smaller estate called H√∂gested, where she had all the windows facing Krogholm walled up. As her property was largely taken over by Swedish creditors, she had to move to a farmstead called Baldringe where she spent her last years. J√∂rgen Krabbe and Jytte Thott had no children, and what was left of their property was inherited by their nephews and nieces.

Campaigning for better pay and working in social welfare projects, she turned to politics in the 1940s at a time when most women were not politically active in Barbados. Though she unsuccessfully ran for a seat in the House of Assembly three times in the 1940s, she was elected to the Christ Church Vestry in 1958, serving for many years. Early life Muriel Odessa \\"Nellie\\" Walcott was born on 26 August 1896 to Daniel Walcott in Saint Michael Parish in the British West Indies' colony of Barbados. Her parents owned and operated a grocery store. She grew up in My Lord's Hill as one of 13 children and attended Belmont Girls' School. After completing her secondary education at Lynch's Secondary School, she studied nursing while working at the Old Barbados General Hospital and midwifery at St. Michael's Almshouse. Career Walcott worked as a nurse and midwife. Wanting to improve the care available in the community, she founded the School of Bedside Nursing and the Culinary School for Women. She was also active in the Choir for the Animation of the Sick and Incapacitated, an organization founded by Harold Rock, which used music therapy to cheer patients confined in children's homes, hospitals, at home or in prison. Participating in many social welfare projects, including the Dorcas League, which championed trade skills for workers, and the Universal Negro Improvement Association, she campaigned for better salaries for teachers and nurses. Walcott married Charles Nathaniel Weekes, a World War I veteran and hotelier. Together they operated a catering business. They were involved in the operations of the Colonial Hotel, the Ritz Hotel, the Standard Hotel, and Weekes' Canteen. After decades of working as a nurse and caterer, Weekes recognized that if women's status were to be improved, they had to be involved in policy-making. Though widely criticized for her outspoken belief in equality, she ran as a candidate for the House of Assembly representing the St. George constituency in 1942. Unsuccessful, she ran again in 1944 as a representative for the City of Bridgetown. That year women were granted the right both to vote and to stand for election for either house of Parliament, if they met the property requirement or had income of ¬£20 per year. At her rally on 13 October, all the speakers were women, but again she was defeated. She contested but lost her bid for the St. George seat again in 1946 but was successful in being elected to the Christ Church Vestry in 1958. In 1959, she became a founder and served as the first vice president for the Barbados Labour Party's Women's League. Issues that she pushed during her time on the vestry included minimum wage standards; higher salaries for civil servants including firemen, nurses, policemen, postmen, and teachers; establishment of public utilities; and measures to require the government to provide proper nutritional meals to those people who were under government care. She also was vocal about the need to provide teaching on African heritage. An active member of the Barbados Women's Alliance, she also advocated for amendments to the Bastardy Act and for rape trials to be held in private chambers, equal opportunities in girls' education, and adequate training in family planning. She remained active in social issues in Barbados into the early 1980s, when she had to have her legs amputated. Death and legacy Weekes died on 11 May 1990 in Bridgetown, Barbados. She is remembered as a pioneer and \\"trailblazer\\" in the struggle for women's rights in the country.

He was killed in action during the Battle of Iwo Jima in World War II and was posthumously awarded the Navy Cross.  Early life and career  John A. Butler was born on September 30, 1910, in New Orleans, Louisiana. After graduating from high school, he attended Loyola University for two years before he accepted an appointment to the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland. Upon graduating with the class of 1934, Butler was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Marine Corps. He then attended the Basic School at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania until April 1935. Butler was then assigned to the Marine detachment aboard the USS Trenton. The Trenton was permanently based out of Panama with the Special Service Squadron. Butler quickly became fluent in Spanish and was often sent ashore to coordinate port calls. He also served aboard the USS Memphis and USS Omaha during this time. In January 1936, Butler attended a course at the Marine barracks in Quantico, Virginia. He remained in Quantico as a staff member until the end of the year. In 1937, Butler was stationed at Washington, D.C., first with Headquarters Marine Corps and then with the Latin American Section in the Office of Naval Intelligence. In July 1938, Butler was assigned to 1st Battalion, 5th Marines in Quantico.  World War II  = Naval attach√© = In February 1940, Butler was made a Naval attach√© at the U.S. Embassy in Ciudad Trujillo, Dominican Republic. That May, Butler was promoted to captain. Butler was in the Dominican Republic when the United States entered World War II. The Dominican Republic sided with the Allies and Butler worked with the dictator, Rafael Trujillo, in tracking down and deporting German spies and sympathizers. By March 1943, Butler was promoted to lieutenant colonel. Despite his success as a Naval attach√©, Butler continually requested a combat assignment. His requests were finally approved and he attended the Command and Staff School in Quantico from October to December 1943. = 5th Marine Division = Upon graduating, Butler was assigned to the newly activated 5th Marine Division in San Diego. Arriving at his new unit in January 1944, he was originally made the executive officer of Colonel Thomas A. Wornham's 27th Marine Regiment. However, he was soon given command of 1st Battalion, 27th Marines. In August, the 27th Marine Regiment moved to Camp Tarawa, Hawaii. In January 1945, the division left Camp Tarawa, conducting mock amphibious landings on Maui before stopping for a brief liberty in Pearl Harbor. On January 26, Butler's battalion embarked for Iwo Jima aboard the USS Hansford.  Battle of Iwo Jima  On February 19, 1945, Butler led his battalion ashore with the fourth wave at Red Beach Two during the battle of Iwo Jima. Under heavy fire, Butler led his Marines 150 yards inland, setting up his battalion command post on top of a blockhouse which was occupied by the enemy. Butler then coordinated his men in assaulting Motoyama Airfield Number One. While the left assault company circled the southern edge of the airfield, the right assault company became pinned down by heavy fire. Butler moved forward from his command post to the base of the airfield, where he directed his right assault company in moving forward. Butler's leadership resulted in the capture of the southern portion of the airfield by the end of February 20. On February 22, the 27th Marines were subjected to rain and artillery fire the entire day, before the regiment was placed in the division reserve. On February 27, the regiment rotated back to the front line, becoming the main assault force during the battle for Hill 362A. Butler led his battalion in a fierce battle for control of Hill 362A for the next two days. C Company advanced just short of the summit, taking heavy casualties. A Company relieved the battered C Company and repelled a Japanese counterattack. On March 1, the 27th Marines again rotated to the division reserve, and Hill 362A was eventually captured by the 26th and 28th Marines after another day of intense fighting. On March 2, Butler was ordered to have his battalion provide defensive support for the 26th Marines. The next day, 1/27 was attached to the 26th Marines and participated in an assault on Hill 362B. On March 4, C Company took heavy casualties while advancing just 100 yards. The entire division was ordered to rest on the next day, as the combat effectiveness of the Marines was now less than 50 percent.  Death  On March 5, 1/27 was detached from the 26th Marines. At roughly 13:00 hours, Butler was riding in his jeep to the regiment command post when the vehicle was struck by a 47mm shell. While his driver and another passenger survived the blast, Butler was instantly killed. The regimental operations officer, Lieutenant Colonel Justin G. Duryea, assumed command of 1/27 after Butler's death. For his actions during the battle of Iwo Jima, Butler was posthumously awarded the Navy Cross. He was buried in the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific in Honolulu, Hawaii. Butler was survived by his wife and four children.

Li was tried in court, and probably sentenced to death for leading a counter-revolutionary movement.  Biography  Li was native to Changxiang Village, Cangnan County, and born into a poor family. He received a primary school education via the anti-illiteracy classes implemented by the Communist government after the Chinese Civil War's end in 1949. From an early age, he dreamed of becoming emperor. Skilled as orator, he rose to leader of his village's farm production team. At some point, he was arrested for alleged crimes in corruption, and sentenced to five years in prison. He attempted unsuccessfully to break out from prison, resulting in an extension of his sentence by another five years. After ten years in prison, Li was released. His desire to oppose the government and to become emperor remained strong. He became a wandering preacher and a ‚Äúswindler‚Äù, repeatedly clashing with the law. By 1981, he was already rather old. In that year, he travelled under the name \\"Zheng Min\\" () to Shuitou, Pingyang County, Zhejiang, claiming that he intended to reconnect with his old friend Wei Zhijian (). The latter had become locally notorious for illegal behavior of various kinds as well as his ambition to become an official one day. The two met and discussed various issues for several days until Li eventually convinced Wei to help organizing a sect termed the \\"Zishen Nation\\". According to a later official report by Chinese authorities, Li convinced Wei that he had been appointed emperor by two individuals, \\"Zhu Gang\\" () from the United States and \\"Wulinbietuo\\" () from the Soviet Union. These two had allegedly founded the \\"Zishen Nation\\" in secret in accordance with the dying wishes of Sun Yat-sen, China's provisional first president, and had built an underground nuclear weapons factory in Tongling. As per these claims, Li believed that a nuclear war would soon break out, resulting in the collapse of China's Communist government and the takeover by his own empire. Li appointed Wei \\"General of the Third Army Corps\\" of Zishen, and urged him to gather local anti-communists for their cause. Li's project was not uncommon by itself, as hundreds of people have proclaimed themselves emperors or empresses in China since 1949; however, most of these pretenders gathered only very small groups of followers and were quickly arrested by government forces. In contrast, Li's group would prove surprisingly successful. Li and Wei moved to Changxiang Village, proclaiming the establishment of Zishen and convincing the locals of their cause. They set up an actual government including various officials, created a state flag featuring a double planet in black, white, yellow, blue, vermillion; a war flag; and a uniform for their army. The center of the statelet was a Buddhist temple. From 1981, Li ruled his miniature empire in de facto independence, while his sect spread among the rural population of Zhejiang and Fujian. He promised wealth and government positions to those willing to follow him, appointing ministers, generals, and magistrates. To raise funds to support his government, Li encouraged donations and issued his own currency. According to researchers Yu Chen and Shenghua Zhang, Wei went to Fujian where he attempted to forge connections to the anti-Communist government on Taiwan, although without success. Instead, Wei encountered a man named Xu in Mingxi who claimed to possess an \\"imperial jade seal\\"; he and Li procured the alleged heirloom, cementing the latter's authority as self-proclaimed emperor. In August 1984, Wei recruited Lin Bingqi, an ex-militiaman, for Zishen; as he had military experience, Li appointed Lin as general. Lin proved to have a talent in leading people, and managed to recruit several more people for his emperor's cause in Qingliu County. In early 1985, Li and Wei travelled to Shanxi, where the former gained the contract-rights for a coal mine, intending to turn it into a \\"major enterprise\\" as well as provisional headquarters for the movement. By 1986, his forces had become active in many counties, including Jiangle, Mingxi, Ninghua, Songxi, and Jianning. Many villagers believed in Li's rhetoric and prepared for dynastic change; others were terrorized by Li's followers. Researcher S.A. Smith described Li as \\"monarch of impressive longevity\\", finding it interesting that no public security bureau (PSB) crushed his statelet for five years despite the fact that Zishen's leadership made no secret of its aims. Li and his ministers spread several claims, arguing that they already controlled large parts of China, had access to nuclear weapons, foretold the arrival of heavenly soldiers, and promised their followers safety when the awaited nuclear apocalypse came to be. The PSB later claimed that the sect had intended to launch an armed uprising in Ninghua on Chinese New Year of 1986, allegedly producing a potion to render people unconscious for this purpose. The uprising was reportedly inspired by the diviner Zhang Ruifang who had promised Li that he would be invincible in battle on a very specific date. The police raided Zishen's headquarters before the planned rebellion took place, and arrested 33 leaders of Zishen in spring 1986. Li initially escaped, but was arrested two months later in Shandong. He was subsequently charged with founding and leading a \\"reactionary secret sect for counterrevolutionary purposes\\". The sentences of Li and his companions remain unclear, but researchers Robin Munro and Mickey Spiegel considered it likely that the self-proclaimed emperor was sentenced to death.

He served as Gauleiter of Gau Halle-Merseburg and was a high-ranking police official for most of the Nazi regime. Early life Hinkler spent his youth in Thorn, where he attended elementary and grammar school and completed teacher‚Äôs training. He began his career as a teacher in February 1914 but, when the First World War was declared in August, he volunteered for service in Foot Artillery Regiment 11. He saw action first on the Eastern Front, and from August 1918 on the Western Front. He suffered a nervous breakdown while fighting near Soissons in September 1918 and was sent to Thorn hospital. Discharged from army service with a partial disability as a Leutnant of the reserve in March 1919, he returned to teaching in Zippow near Schneidem√ºhl, now Pi≈Ça in Poland. In the same year he joined the Freikorps and became a district leader in Posen-West Prussia. In 1920 he became a member of the Marburg student corps in Gotha and Ohrdruf. In 1921 he passed his secondary teacher examinations. In August 1921 he moved to Freyburg. Nazi Party career On 1 July 1922, he joined the Nazi Party and in May 1923, the Sturmabteilung (SA). Between 1922 and 1924 Hinkler was the Freyburg leader of the Stahlhelm, a veterans‚Äô paramilitary organization. During the legal ban on the NSDAP, Hinkler worked as a district leader of Wehrwolf, a nationalist and anti-republican paramilitary military association. He was also a district commander in the Frontbann, a front organization for the also banned SA. After the re-establishment of the NSDAP, he rejoined the party and the SA on 27 May 1925 (membership number 5,492). He became the leader of the SA (Sturmf√ºhrer) of Freyburg in June 1925. Because of his political and SA activities, Hinkler was temporarily suspended from his teaching position on 1 May 1925. On 11 August 1926, he was permanently dismissed from his position due to the commission of a violent offense. In the NSDAP, Hinkler successively held positions as Ortsgruppenleiter (Local Leader), Bezirksleiter (District Leader) and Untergauleiter (Assistant Gauleiter) in Gau Halle-Merseburg. In July 1926 he was named Gau SA-F√ºhrer in Halle-Merseburg, and held this position through 1928. On 25 July 1926, he was appointed Gauleiter of Halle-Merseburg as the successor to Walter Ernst, who had been its first Gauleiter. Between 1927 and 1931 he was also a City Councilor in Halle. In the election to the Prussian Landtag in May 1928, Hinkler was defeated but he was elected to the Provincial Landtag of the Prussian Province of Saxony and became the leader of its NSDAP parliamentary group. On 5 May 1930, Hinkler became a member of the National Socialist Motor Corps with membership number 13. On 10 October 1930, he was elected a member of the Prussian Landtag and he was named Executive Director of the Nazi parliamentary faction, holding this position until February 1933. In May 1932 he also became chairman of the budget committee. Named as a national speaker (Reichsredner) for the Party, he was then granted a leave of absence from his Gauleiter position, and was succeeded by Rudolf Jordan on 19 January 1931. In 1932 Hinkler became a member of the Advisory Board of the Prussian State Bank. He also became the editor of the daily newspaper Der Kampf. Nazi Police career After the seizure of power by the Nazis, Hinkler was appointed Police President of Altona-Wandsbek on 29 March 1933, heading the joint police force for the two independent cities. In that capacity he was also the head of the Secret State Police (Gestapo) there. From 29 July 1933, he headed the Gestapo for the entire Schleswig region of the Province of Schleswig-Holstein. In this position, Hinkler was responsible for the persecution of Jews, Social Democrats, Communists and all other persons and groups who were considered enemies of the new regime. On 11 August 1933, he requested that one of his predecessors, the Social Democrat Otto Eggerstedt, police chief of Altona and Wandsbek from 1929 to 1932, be sent o Esterwegen concentration camp and be closely guarded. Eggerstedt was transferred, subjected to harsh treatment, and on 12 October 1933 was \\"shot while trying to escape\\". On 15 November 1933, Hinkler was briefly appointed head of the Gestapo in Berlin by Hermann G√∂ring as the temporary successor to Rudolf Diels. However, he was forced out of that position after two weeks when rumors spread of alcohol dependence and mental weakness. Hinkler remained Police President of Altona-Wandsbek and head of the Gestapo there until 31 March 1937, when he lost his position as a result of the territorial reorganization mandated by the Greater Hamburg Act. Hinkler had unsuccessfully applied to stand for election to the Reichstag on 29 March 1936. However, on 20 July 1936, Hinkler replaced sitting Reichstag Deputy Cuno Meyer, who was removed from office for financial irregularities. Hinkler represented electoral constituency 8 (Liegnitz) in Lower Silesia but in the 10 April 1938 election, he was elected for electoral district 34 (Hamburg). On 29 August 1938, Hinkler became the acting Police President of Wuppertal and on 8 March 1939 his appointment was made permanent. In 1940 he was temporarily drafted into the Wehrmacht. In his SA career Hinkler was promoted several times, ultimately on 9 November 1942 to SA-Gruppenf√ºhrer. After conflicts with the local D√ºsseldorf Gauleiter Friedrich Karl Florian, Hinkler was placed on indefinite leave, effective 1 December 1943. He was placed at the disposal of the staff of the SA high command to 1945. Toward the end of the war, as Allied soldiers closed in on him, Hinkler committed suicide by taking poison on 13 April 1945 in Ni√ümitz near Freyburg.

Season At the start of the season, Yale announced they would not be playing during the winter break, as they had traditionally done. Rule changes were also adopted that modified offside calls in an attempt to make them more fair and to aid the referees. Yale played well in their opening loss to the St. Nicholas Hockey Club and, after the break, welcomed the first western team to play at the New Haven Arena. The Elis outclassed the American School of Osteopathy, and gave hope that Yale would finally be able to challenge their rival Harvard. Sure enough, in the following game Yale proved to be a match for the mighty Crimson and the defense from both teams was remarkable. Each squad was only able to muster one goal in regulation and two five-minute overtimes were required. O'Hearn scored half way through the first and it appeared that the Bulldogs might be able to take the contest. Harvard's captain, George Owen had other ideas and tied the game at 2-all with less than two minutes remaining in the second overtime. A third, sudden-death overtime was required and with both teams visibly tired Harvard's Hill notched the winning goal. For their next game, Yale travelled south and made their first appearance at the Hobey Baker Memorial Rink, which had been completed in November. The Tigers had already produced several dominating performances and they continued their strong play against the Elis. Much of the scoring was done in the first half of the game, when both teams were still fresh. From the start of the third period both goaltenders grew stout in net, turning aside every chance that came their way. The first two 5-minute overtimes both passed without a goal being scored and Yale played their second consecutive sudden- death contest. This time it took six minutes before the final goal was scored and again Yale found itself on the wrong side. Coming so close in both games was unfortunate for the Bulldogs but the Elis would have a second chance at both teams later in the season. Yale would have to get through a 10-day layoff first and then content with four games in 11 days. The Elis acquitted themselves well, taking three of the games and two with dominating performances. Their only loss came at the hand of an undefeated Dartmouth squad but, again, Yale's defeat was only by a single goal. In the rematch against Princeton, Allston Jenkins did everything he could to keep the tigers from scoring and he was equaled, save-for-save by his counterpart. Neither team was able to score in regulation, or the first two overtime periods, so Yale would have to play in their third sudden-death contest of the Triangular Hockey League season. Both teams had agreed before the session had started to play until one of them had scored and, after 13 minutes had elapsed, the 3,000-strong crowd witnessed the first goal of the game. Yale was finally able to capture a league game when Reid netted the winning tally. Jenkins continued his stellar play, keeping the next two collegiate opponents from scoring as well. While the team's shutout streak was ended by the New Haven Bears, a local amateur team, they entered their rematch with Harvard full of confidence that the team was equal to the task at downing the Crimson. Jenkins was impenetrable in the contest and three goals from Eli sticks were more than enough to take the match. The win was Yale's first over Harvard since 1917 and their first win in Boston in program history. Yale would not have long to savor the victory, as the rubber match against both Harvard and Princeton occurred during the following week. The Elis had a chance to win the Triangular League if it captured both games and both they and the Crimson fought a pitched battle on the 7th. The teams traded goals in the second period but thanks to Jenkins in net and the typically oppressive Harvard defense, neither team could score again and overtime was required once more. Both 5-minute sessions passed without incident and Yale played its fourth triple overtime of the season. Again, however, Harvard was able to outlast the Elis and take the Triangular League championship, having already defeated Princeton in their season series.

The dry forests occupy the leeward northwestern portion of Fiji's two largest islands, Viti Levu and Vanua Levu. Geography The dry forests are in the rain shadow of Viti Levu and Vanua Levu's central mountains, which intercept the prevailing southeast trade winds. The Fijian islands are mostly volcanic in origin, with areas of uplifted coral limestone and sedimentary rock. The islands emerged from the sea between 5 and 20 million years ago. Climate The climate is tropical and seasonally dry. Rainfall is from 1500 to 2250 mm annually, falling mostly during the December-to-April summer. The other months are relatively dry. Occasionally tropical cyclones hit the islands from the northwest between November and April. Flora The natural vegetation of the ecoregion is tropical dry forest. The most widespread dry forest community was characterized Dacrydium nidulum and Fagraea gracilipes, with Myristica castaneifolia, Dysoxylum richii, Parinari insularum, Intsia bijuga, Syzygium spp., Aleurites moluccana, Ficus theophrastoides, the conifers Podocarpus neriifolius and Gymnostoma vitiense, the cycad Cycas seemannii and groves of bamboo (Bambusa spp.). Forests of the endemic sandalwood Santalum yasi, Casuarina equisetifolia, Gymnostoma vitiense and the climbing fern Lygodium scandens are found in drier areas. Frequent burning of the forest and subsequent erosion have reduced the dry forests to fragments. A sparse grass- fern plant community called talasiqa (meaning \\"sun burnt\\") is widespread in degraded areas. Talasiqa is characterized by the grass Sporobolus indicus and the ferns Pteridium aquilinum and Dicranopteris linearis. Other formerly- forested areas have been converted to a shrub savanna, with the tree Casuarina equisetifolia and a brushy understory that includes Mussaenda raiateensis, Decaspermum fruticosum, Dodonaea viscosa, C. seemannii, and the palm Pritchardia pacifica. Protected areas A 2017 assessment found that 204 km¬≤, or 3%, of the ecoregion is in protected areas. Protected areas include Koroyanitu National Heritage Park on Viti Levu.

M. Secrest, was an award-winning American newspaper publisher, editor, and civil rights advocate. He served as a federal mediator for the Community Relations Service under President Lyndon B. Johnson.  Early life and education  Secrest was born on September 15, 1923 in Monroe, North Carolina. He attended Duke University, where he earned a B.A. in 1944, a Master‚Äôs degree in 1970, and a PhD in 1972.  Journalism  After serving as an officer aboard the USS Hammann (DE-131) during World War II, Secrest worked for several newspapers including The Laurinburg Exchange and The Charlotte News. In 1953, he became the owner and publisher of The Cheraw Chronicle, a weekly paper in northeastern South Carolina. His editorials opposing segregation and advocating for civil rights drew criticism and harassment, but also support. During his tenure, the paper sustained its circulation and advertising revenue, and Secrest garnered local and national accolades for his journalism.  Contribution to civil rights  In 1959, Secrest was appointed to South Carolina's State Advisory Committee of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights. During this period, Secrest joined the board of directors of Penn Community Services, Inc. (now Penn Center), where Martin Luther King Jr. and Southern Christian Leadership Conference members planned the March on Washington and the Poor People‚Äôs Campaign. In June 1964, Secrest was appointed to the newly established Community Relations Service as a field conciliator, a role that sent him to different communities in the U.S. to help mediate racial disputes. The behind-the-scenes work of the Community Relations Service under director LeRoy Collins is credited with helping deescalate tensions in Selma, Alabama following the events of Sunday, March 7, 1965, when state troopers and possemen attacked unarmed civil rights demonstrators. Hoping to avoid a repeat of \\"Bloody Sunday\\", President Johnson dispatched Collins and Secrest to Selma to meet with King about plans to resume the Selma-to-Montgomery march. A compromise was negotiated: on March 9, King would lead demonstrators across the Edmund Pettus Bridge, hold a prayer meeting at the site of the Bloody Sunday violence, then turn the march back to Selma. Collins and Secrest secured assurances from Alabama officials that they would not attack demonstrators this time. Selma to Montgomery on March 7, 1965.  Teaching career and retirement  After selling The Cheraw Chronicle in 1968, Secrest taught journalism at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill for five years. From 1976 until he retired in 1985, he taught at North Carolina Central University, a historically black college in Durham. In 2004, Secrest published a memoir, Curses and Blessings: Life and Evolution in the 20th Century South, which includes stories of his encounters with King, John F. Kennedy, Dizzy Gillespie, Richard Nixon, Strom Thurmond, and other notable figures of the time.  Marriage and children  Secrest married Ann Louise Eastman, of Concord, New Hampshire, in 1948. They had three children: David Kilton, Andrew Phillips, and Mary Ann.  Death  In 2010, Secrest died in Chapel Hill, North Carolina after complications from surgery for throat cancer. Honors and awards Secrest received honors for his journalism and contributions to civil rights. In 1957, he won the National Editorial Association's Herrick Editorial Award \\"for the most significant contribution to the extension and strengthening of democracy and individual liberties.\\" He was awarded the Sidney Hillman Foundation's Hillman Prize in 1958. In 1960, he received a Nieman Fellowship, enabling him to study at Harvard University for a year. As a journalism graduate student at Duke University, Secrest was named a Halstead Fellow in 1969 and received a Woodrow Wilson Dissertation Fellowship in 1970. In 2007, Secrest was inducted into the North Carolina Journalism Hall of Fame in Chapel Hill.

History  In the ancient Peru, it was prepared with yellow potatos, which have a soft texture, and kneading it with crushed chilli peppers; although it can also be made with any other variety of potato. During the Viceroyalty era, between the XVI and XIX centuries, the lemon ingredient (originaly from Asia) was added, reaching the actual form, both the ingredients and the presentation. = Etymology = There are many hypothesis about the name of the dish. Firstly it was suggested that it comes from the quechua Kawsay, which means \\"necessary sustenance\\" and \\"food\\", or \\"what feeds\\", a name also given to the potato. There are other hypothesis about the name of the dish that link it to war episodes of the contemporary history of the Andean country. Even though this clearly Limean dish exists since the Viceroyalty, it didn't have a specific name; it was with the arrival of the libertador Jos√© de San Mart√≠n that, in order to solve the expenses of the military campaign, this dish was sold in the corners of the Limean streets, as a way to contribute to the cause (por la causa in Spanish, \\"for the cause\\"). On the other side, it may also be possible that causa lime√±a was a patriotic dish during the Peruvian-Chilean Pacific war. At the time, women would help the soldiers offering them this cold dish. While this dish is called causa in Lima, in the northern city of Trujillo the name is used to designate any spicy meal, even if causa lime√±a is also prepared in this city and is as good as the capital one.  Description  This dish is traditionally made with yellow potato, lemon, boiled egg, yellow chilli pepper and black olives. It also may have avocado for the stuffing and lettuce for decoration purposes. The preparation admits many variants, like the causa filled with tuna, trout, ,chicken, shellfish or other white meat. It is served with a light bath of mayonnaise. Apart from yellow potatoes, the dough can also be made with lima beans or yellow yucca.

Considered as one of the most important representatives of the new generation of fado, she has released six studio albums with producers such as Gustavo Santaolalla and Nelson Motta. She has toured extensively, collaborated with several artists, and appeared in the Portuguese versions of Got Talent, Rising Star, and Dancing with the Stars.  Career  = Beginnings = Cuca Roseta began her musical career singing in her church choir and then as a rock singer, forming part of the group Toranja during her teenage years, recruited by her friend Thiago Benttencourt. She entered the fado scene in the late 1990s, beginning to sing in Lisbon fado clubs encouraged first by composer Mario Pacheco and fado singer Carlos Zel, and later by Ana Moura. She competed in RTP's Festival da Can√ß√£o 2006, and in 2007 appeared in the film Fados by the Spanish filmmaker Carlos Saura, which won the Goya Award. In 2009 she recorded the advertisement \\"Pingo Doce e venha c√°\\", for the Portuguese supermarket chain Pingo Doce. = Albums = Her first album, released in 2011, was produced by Gustavo Santaolalla, who saw her perform at the Clube de Fado, in Alfama. After this initial encounter, in which Cuca was not aware of who the Argentine producer was, she had to wait four years to record the album, due to Santaolalla's busy schedule. In 2013 she recorded Ra√≠z produced by Mario Barreiros. On this album the singer was also the songwriter and lyricist of most of the songs. On her third album she invited the Brazilian producer Nelson Motta to participate. Motta agreed to produce this album even though he had been inactive in the field for 10 years, because he had wanted to do a world fado record and saw in Cuca Roseta a unique potential. The 2015 album, called Ri√ª, brought together several genres, and significant figures of world music such as Bryan Adams, Djavan, Ivan Lins, Jorge Drexler among others. This record features cheerful rhythms and positive messages in the lyrics, which is a departure of the traditional sadness of the fado genre. Her fourth studio album, Luz, was released in 2017, with Diogo Clemente as producer. The album contains several original songs by Cuca Roseta and compositions by artists such as Pedro da Silva Martins, Jorge Fernando, Carolina Deslandes, H√©lder Moutinho and Mario Pacheco. The album's release was preceded in mid-October by the release of the single \\"Balelas\\". In July 2018, the track \\"Don't Be Late\\" was released as a second single. In 2018 she released her fifth album, Luz de Natal, dedicated to Christmas songs, with Portuguese versions of holiday classics such as \\"Jingle bell rocks\\" and \\"White christmas\\". Her 2020 album, Am√°lia by Cuca Roseta, is a tribute album with songs from the repertoire of Am√°lia Rodrigues. = Live performances = The fadist has toured extensively and participated in music festivals such as MEO Sudoeste in 2011. In 2015 Roseta performed in more than 120 concerts, both in Portugal and abroad. For example, that year she participated in Badasom, a flamenco and fado festival in Badajoz, Spain, singing a duet with Ni√±a Pastori. In 2019 she sang in Havana during the celebration of the centenary of diplomatic relations between Cuba and Portugal. = TV appearances = Cuca Roseta has had various appearances, mainly in Portuguese TV. She was part of the expert's panel in Rising Star: A pr√≥xima estrela, and a judge in the third and fourth seasons of Got Talent Portugal. She competed in Dancing with the Stars Portugal (Dan√ßa com as Estrelas), and gave a clue in an episode of The Amazing Race Australia 3. Style Her style incorporates influences such as jazz, bossa nova, and world music, while respecting the purity, minimalism and simplicity of fado, with an emphasis on the songs narrative and meaning. Cuca Roseta has shown her versatility and curiosity with multiple international collaborations. She has sung in languages other than Portuguese, for example, the song \\"B√©same mucho\\" with Julio Iglesias, and \\"Tum Hi Ho\\", a Bollywood hit composed by Mithoon. In her concerts she includes both traditional songs of great emotional depth, as well as songs more in the style of pop, commercial ballad or brasileiro.  Personal life  Cuca Roseta is the daughter of Miguel da Cruz Roseta and Maria Nat√©rcia Rebelo Couto, and paternal niece of Pedro Roseta, a former Minister of Culture in Portugal. She has a son named Lopo, and a daughter called Benedita, born in 2016. Her husband, Joao Lapa, proposed during a concert of hers in Porto while she was on stage performing. They were married by the church in 2017 in Obidos, where she sang \\"Ave Maria\\" during the wedding. Outside of music, Cuca practices painting and is a black belt in taekwondo. She first studied law but did not finish, changing to a degree in psychology instead. In 2019 she was announced as ambassador for the Mirpuri Foundation, a non-profit organization focused in environmental sustainability.

Towering 2,600-feet (790 meters) above the floor of Zion Canyon at the Big Bend area, Cable Mountain is situated immediately northeast of The Great White Throne, separated by the chasm of Hidden Canyon. It is set on the east side of the North Fork Virgin River which drains precipitation runoff from this mountain. Its neighbors include Angels Landing, Cathedral Mountain, The Organ, and Observation Point. This mountain's name was officially adopted in 1934 by the U.S. Board on Geographic Names. It is so named in association with the draw- works which used cables to lower timber from the top of the plateau down to the valley bottom from 1901 through 1927.Cable Mountain Draw Works, National Park Service Wood to construct the Zion Lodge came down the cable works.

From 1904, timber was harvested from the heights above the valley and moved from Cable Mountain down to the draw works in the valley, a vertical distance of . The system fulfilled an 1863 prophecy made by Brigham Young that timber would descend from the cliffs \\"like a hawk flying.\\" Before the draw works were constructed, the timber on Cable Mountain was obtained only by a ten-day round trip. Flanigan sold the operation in 1906 to Alfred Stout and O.D. Gifford of Springdale, who operated it as the Cable Mountain Timber Works. The draw works were destroyed by lighting and rebuilt in 1911. Intermittent operation continued until 1926 when the system was abandoned. The cables were removed in 1930. It is the oldest pre-park structure in Zion. The site was individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places on May 24, 1978, reference number 78000281. The chief remaining structure is a wood headframe on Cable Mountain. The structures at the bottom of the cables consisted of snubbing posts to separate the cables. Nothing remains of the lower end of the draw works.

In service, the rifle was sometimes referred to as a mountain gun, though this might stem from a confusion over caliber sizes. From a design standpoint, the weapon was unique. Like all of Whitworth's designs, the weapon had a hexagon-ally rifled barrel. It was also a breechloader, an usual feature for the time. The piece had exceptional range and accuracy, being capable of firing a 3 pound shell over 9,500 yards. However, the small size of the shell limited its bursting charge, consequently reducing the number of fragments formed when the shell detonated. According to a 1860 New York Times article covering Whitworth's weapons, the relatively small 3-pdr had superior range compared to his larger rifled guns.

Early life  Sarah Jane Yandle (n√©e Turle) was born in 1844 in Taunton, Somerset, England. Her mother was Mary Turle (n√©e Fox), whose occupation on the 1861 Census was stated as \\"Naturalist\\", a commonly used title for a taxidermist. According to family records, Mary was also known as \\"the bird stuffer of Taunton\\", and her father, Joseph, was a watchmaker and musician. Jane's father died in 1855 when Jane was only 11. In 1863, at the age of 20, Jane married William James Yandle.  Taxidermy business  The couple arrived in New Zealand in about 1866 on the SS Percy. Jane Yandle gave birth to at least eight children, although not all of them survived to adulthood. In February 1866, a case of preserved American birds was exhibited by Mrs Yandle at the opening of the Library and Meeting Rooms of the Young Men's Christian Association. Jane presented a dabchick and two whalebirds to the Auckland Institute in 1870. Thomas Kirk paid ¬£2 to Mrs Yandle for a tippet and muff made from kiwi feathers, on behalf of Sir James Hector who had commissioned the items. Te Papa Tongarewa Museum of New Zealand MU000147/004/0054 Te Papa Tongarewa holds a kiwi feather muff in its collection donated by Sir James Hector's daughter in 1948. In 1877, a rare white crane which had been shot by Mr H. McMurdo was sent to Mrs Yandle for stuffing. The Daily Southern Cross newspaper of 5 May 1875 noted that Mrs Yandle's shop contained a large glass case containing around 90 American birds, stuffed and mounted. The birds had been brought back from the US by Samuel Morrin, a Canadian-born entrepreneur who had settled in New Zealand. In the early 1870s, the Yandles were living at 18 Grey Street (now Greys Ave) in Auckland. While William worked variously as a furrier, taxidermist, dog breeder and butcher, Jane operated a furrier and taxidermist business at one time located in Queen Street, Auckland.National Library record William narrowly avoided bankruptcy on a number of occasions, and Jane, having revived the furrier and taxidermy part of the business, took over its management in 1877 in her own right. The Colonist recorded notes about a carriage wrapper made of pheasant skins by Mrs Yandle, who was described as a well-known local taxidermist.  Later life  On several occasions, Jane was the victim of assault at the hands of her husband, for which he was convicted. William acknowledged in court that he had a problem controlling his alcohol intake. Jane herself was convicted and fined 20 shillings plus costs for breaching the 1881 Gaming and Lotteries Act by running an illegal lottery at the Masonic Hall, Newton, Auckland. In 1893, Jane signed the Women's Suffrage Petition on sheet 374. Many women who advocated for suffrage around this time had experienced domestic violence often related to alcohol consumption. In 1894, Jane applied to the court for protection from her husband who was bound over to keep the peace. Two years later after a further court appearance for assaulting his wife, William was advised by the judge to leave Auckland. Jane continued running her furrier and taxidermy business for which she was acknowledged in the local press at the time. She retired from business in 1908. Her daughter, Jane Greacen (n√©e Yandle), followed her mother into the taxidermy trade. Jane Yandle died at her daughter's home in November 1915 aged 72. The New Zealand Timber Museum in Putaruru holds several examples of Jane Yandle's taxidermy work in its collection.

It is located on the rocky cliffs overlooking the eastern bank of the Tigris, 14 kilometers upstream from the city of Cizre. It has been identified with the ancient Pinaka, mentioned by Strabo as one of the principal cities of the region of Gordyene. The medieval Islamic medieval writers al-Ya'qubi and Abu'l-Fida, who called the site Fenek or Fanak, described it as the site of an impregnable fortress, the ruins of which still stand. It gained the attention of some scholars in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, but was not studied thereafter, perhaps in part due to the difficulty of accessing it, with only trails leading along the bottom of the cliffs allowing access. The site is primarily characterized by a prominent rocky outcrop overlooking the Tigris valley, upon which there are the scattered ruins of Islamic-era fortifications. These appear to correspond to the fortress mentioned by al- Ya'qubi and Abu'l-Fida. Some of these ruins also appear to be quite recent. There is also a Parthian rock relief carved into the face of a cliff rising perpendicular to the Tigris, facing northeast, towards the rocky spur that supported the old fortress. It depicts two people, in what appears to be a scene of homage or investiture, with the figure on the left appears to be nobility or royalty, bearing a sword and finely dressed. The relief was probably created in the second half of the second century CE or the beginning of the third, and resembles those found at the sites of Hatra, Palmyra, and Dura-Europos. The sculptor at Finik was probably familiar with the style and techniques used at those places. This relief was first noted by A.H. Layard in 1849. A second Parthian rock relief is also present, located on a concave wall cut into the rock of the north face of the main rock outcrop, although it is rudimentary and nothing but the outline can be discerned. It was probably carved hastily or by a less skilled sculptor.

Education and business Giesea attended Stanford, where he edited Thiel's libertarian student paper The Stanford Review. Giesea worked for Thiel's first hedge fund, Thiel Capital Management, and Thiel later provided the seed money for Giesea's startup. Between Thiel Capital management and his startup, Giesea worked for Koch Industries' public affairs office. He co-founded BestVendor, a free recommendation site for business apps, in January 2011. It entered open beta in November 2011, and by December had over 4800 users. The business received $600,000 in seed money from Peter Thiel, SV Angel, Lerer Ventures, and Softbank Capital. By December 2011, it had received $3.6 million from seed rounds and Series A funding. In 2013, BestVendor was acquired by Docstoc. Alt-right and Trump affiliations Giesea has collaborated on a number of projects alongside Trump-affiliated propagandist Mike Cernovich, neo-Nazi hacker Andrew \\"weev\\" Auernheimer, Pax Dickinson, and fellow Thiel associate and former Breitbart writer Charles Johnson. Gisea organized a dinner prior to the 2016 RNC. Attendees reportedly included Clearview AI's founder, Hoan Ton-That, white supremacist Richard Spencer, Cernovich, Johnson, and VDARE founder Peter Brimelow. Giesea is a major quiet funder of alt-right causes. Giesea funded the \\"Gays for Trump\\" party at the 2016 RNC, which was hosted by Milo Yiannopoulos and attended by anti-Islamic commentator Pamela Geller and far-right Dutch politician Geert Wilders. In October 2016, Giesea again funded an event hosted by Milo, this time one in which the provocateur bathed himself in pig's blood as a pro-Trump performance art piece commemorating victims of undocumented immigrants and Islamic terrorists. Martin Shkreli also presented an art piece at the event, a framed red-and-blue pill. Gavin McInnes presented an image of himself as an antebellum slave. = #Rev18 = Giesea formed a Super PAC called #Rev18 alongside Mike Cernovich and Jack Posobiec in October 2017 to support Josh Mandel as Ohio Treasurer in the 2018 midterm elections, opposing incumbent senator Sherrod Brown. Giesea described the PAC's goal as to promote antiestablishment candidates \\"who support American sovereignty and prosperity and who put the American citizen first\\". All three were on the board, while Giesea handled filing with the Federal Election Commission. Giesea said he was the first donor to the PAC, pledging $50,000. Giesea expresed hope that Peter Theil and the Mercers would pitch in, among others. Mandel expressed appreciation for members of the Super PAC. The three announced the closing of #Rev18 in late November, explaining that they did not have enough time to devote to it. The Atlantic noted that this Super PAC was among the first examples of Trump supporters--a mostly online, Trump-centric group--venturing into electoral politics outside of support for Trump himself. Right Wing Watch described the effort as among the first to institutionalize Trump's movement.  Personal life  =Family= Giesea's mother is Mexican-American.

He is the namesake of the Don Coleman Coliseum in Houston, and retired in 1992 as one of the ten winningest high school basketball coaches in the United States. Early life and education Don Coleman was born on February 2, 1933 in Port Arthur, Texas to Brandon ‚Äì a State Champion tennis player - and Sydney Coleman, a teacher. He was raised with a brother and two sisters. He played high school basketball and tennis for the Thomas Jefferson High School in Port Arthur, and in 1952 he attended Lamar University on tennis and basketball scholarships. He began focusing solely on tennis in his sophomore year, and led the team to three consecutive Lone Star Conference singles championships and won the NAIA doubles title. Upon graduation he was awarded the university‚Äôs John Gray Award given to the best student athlete. Coaching career =Early career= Coleman became an assistant coach for his alma mater under head coach Pete Pense in 1955 until 1957. He then spent five years as the head coach of the Aldine High School men‚Äôs basketball team in Houston. His team placed third in the state championships in 1960. =Memorial Mustangs= In 1962 he then left for Memorial High School in Houston upon the school‚Äôs opening, where he became the first head coach for their basketball team. Coleman was the head coach of Memorial Mustangs high school basketball team from 1962 to 1992 From 1964 to 1971 the team won consecutive district championships and 81 consecutive 5A district games, which remains a record in the State of Texas. He led the Mustangs to eighteen district championships in all. For twenty-six consecutive seasons as coach, the team had twenty or more victories over his career, and averaged 25 wins per season. Coleman coached the Mustangs to the 1966 Texas state championship, and led the team to the final three other times in 1967, 1969, and 1984. One of the things he was known for was the importance of physical conditioning‚Äîhaving his players run five miles before every practice in order to condition them for late game pushes.Slaughter, 120. =Retirement= Coleman retired with 893 wins, which at the time was the all- time third best record in the State of Texas and eighth best record in the United States. In 1992, upon his retirement, the Spring Branch Community Coliseum was renamed the Don Coleman Coliseum in his honor. He also coached the Texas High School All-Star Game in his final year, his second time since he coached it the year his team won the state championship in 1966. He was also awarded the UIL Denius Award for Coaching Excellence.

Context  The 1930s was a time of sweeping changes in the New Zealand education system, and allowed teachers to introduce experiential learning to their classrooms. The headmaster of Jack's Mill School in Kotuku, Edward Darracott, was appointed in 1935. After redesigning the school gardens, the headmaster embarked on a project to have the 10‚Äì12 year old pupils design and build a complete, contemporary, model house of the 1930s. It is possibly the only such example.  Design  Interior of the bungalow showing fireplace The bungalow was designed by 12 year old Rosemary O'Brien, a pupil at Jack's Mill school. It is of the English cottage style with Modernist elements. It shares many features with State House designs of the time, such as standard joinery and a more open plan floor plan, although there is no known connection. As part of the project pupils designed a Modernist abstract carpet design described as of \\"surprisingly high quality\\".  Construction  The bungalow was constructed between 1938 and 1940, at 3/4 scale. The pupils sourced three quarter size interior appliances including a custom-made bath tub, a hot water cylinder, stove, kitchen sink and kitchen units. The house had running water and electricity, and functioned as the home economics classroom until the school was closed in 1955. Interior of the bungalow  Later history  In 1968 the school and grounds were transferred to the ownership of the Department of Education. The Christchurch Teachers' Training College used the site for accommodation while on field trips, but relinquished ownership to the Ministry of Education in 1994. The school was purchased by the Department of Conservation in 2004, and gazetted that year as a Historic Reserve to be managed by the Kotuku Heritage Society. The bungalow, which had been allowed to fall into disrepair, was restored. Most of the volunteers involved in the repair and restoration were former pupils of the school. The Model Bungalow is registered by the New Zealand Historic Places Trust as a Category I structure, with registration number 7232. The other buildings onsite contain displays describing the history of the school and bungalow.

Created by the show's co- creators Aaron Ehasz and Justin Richmond, the character is voiced by Erik Dellums. Aaravos is introduced as an ancient and mysterious Startouch Elf, a type of elf that connects to the magical energy of the stars and is extremely rare. Trapped in a mysterious realm behind a magic mirror, he comes into contact with Viren, one of the series' main antagonists, and eventually forms a partnership with him. Storylines =Background= Aaravos is born on November 14. He is one of the first elves to live inside Xadia, making him approximately 5000 years old when the series begins. He masters all six of the Primal Sources of magic, as well as dark magic. At some point, he shares some undisclosed gifts to humans and saves some of Elarion's citizens from Sol Regem's genocide. Despite this, he is present when humanity is banished to the Western side of the continent. 700 years later, Aaravos, for currently unknown reasons, is imprisoned in an area behind a magic mirror by the Dragon King Avizandum. The Startouch Elf remains in there for the next 300 years, until the mirror is stolen by Viren. =Book 1: Moon (2018)= Aaravos narrates the prologue of the first episode, explaining how humanity was banished from Xadia by the elves and dragons. He also appears in the flashback, standing behind two Sunfire elves and a Moonshadow elf. Aaravos's hand also appears in the credits of the eighth episode. =Book 2: Sky (2019)= When Viren finally manages to see into the realm behind the magic mirror, a cloaked Aaravos comes into view. Viren realizes the elf cannot see him, but Aaravos eventually casts a spell allowing him to see Viren as well. Because they cannot hear each other, Aaravos gestures to Viren to gather specific items for a magic ritual. Before the last step, however, Viren stops and leaves to think, unsure if he can trust Aaravos. Meanwhile, Callum learns that the cube his father led him to find originally belonged to Aaravos. After Viren's failed attempt to rally the other kingdoms, Viren follows through with the elf's instructions. The spell teleports from inside the mirror a small purple caterpillar, which crawls to Viren's ear and allows the two to speak. After some convincing, Aaravos finally introduces himself. When Viren tries searching for information on Aaravos in the library, it magically disappears from the scrolls and books. Viren demands to know what's going on and why he should trust the mysterious elf; Aaravos replies that he shouldn't at the moment. When Viren admits that the leaders of the other human kingdoms refuse to listen, Aaravos agrees to help him. First, he has Viren chant a spell to create ghostly versions of elven assassins to terrorize the other monarchs. When castle guards try to arrest him, Aaravos casts spells to help Viren fight them. However, upon being surrounded and outnumbered, Aaravos orders Viren to stop and the latter reluctantly obliges. Aaravos promises to stay with Viren, and the caterpillar crawls into his ear. =Book 3: Sun (2019)= In a dungeon, Aaravos encourages a despairing Viren not to give up. When Viren's children visit him, and Claudia demands to know why he ordered Soren to kill Callum and Ezran, Aaravos warns Viren that an honest answer will cost him her loyalty, thus subtlety manipulating him into deceiving her. With two monarchs dead and a third severely injured, the latter's son, Prince Kasef, works with Viren to wage war on Xadia. Aaravos's caterpillar weaves silk over Viren's right eye, allowing him to see an apparition of Aaravos's true form. That evening, Viren declares to his subjects that they will march on Xadia. On the way to Xadia, Aaravos asks how Viren slew the Dragon King, and Viren tells the tale, delighting the Startouch elf. Aaaravos reveals that Avizandum is the one who trapped him in the magic mirror, though he doesn't know where his prison is because the Dragon King never told him. As part of the plan to conquer Xadia, Aaravos has Viren enter Lux Aurea, the home of the Sunfire elves. Queen Khessa's attempts to purify Viren of his dark magic give him and Aaravos access to the Sun Forge, the source of their power. Aaravos's caterpillar (now considerably larger) bites the Sunfire High Priest, corrupting not only the latter's Sun staff, but the Sunforge as well. Due to the bite, Aaravos is able to possess the body of the High Priest, and sadistically whispers to Khessa the fate of her grandmother, Queen Aditi, before disintegrating her with a spell. Using the Sun staff, Viren transforms his soldiers into aggressive lava monsters with super strength. As they clash with the elf-human alliance at the base of Storm Spire Mountain, Viren uses the distraction to ascend to the peak, where Aaravos's caterpillar (now the size of a snake) chants a spell to harvest the Dragon Prince's power for Viren. However, before the spell can be completed, Rayla tackles Viren and Aaravos over the cliff edge. Callum rescues her, but Viren falls to his death, Aaravos separating from him mid-descend. Claudia finds and revives Viren with dark magic, and subsequently reveals Aaravos's caterpillar has entered a cocoon, metamorphosing into something else. Development =Characterization and progression= Aaravos is described by the series' creators as a complicated character with a good side and a bad side.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqAuKBdcLQk He is described as \\"mysterious and charismatic,\\" as well as \\"secretive, yet charming.\\" He is also stated by the creators to be manipulate in a \\"very slow and seductive way\\", and the fact he is able to manipulate a person as \\"brilliant\\" as Viren is a great example of this.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJZbyNhXhrw Regarding the character's fascination with humans and the mysterious gifts he shared with them, Ehasz stated that it is partly out of genuine kindness and generosity, and partly out of a desire to be \\"worshiped\\" and \\"revered.\\" Despite his secretive and manipulative nature, Aaravos has stated that he never tells a lie, which both Ehasz and Richmond have confirmed, stating that he is \\"manipulative without being deceptive\\" and \\"always tells the truth.\\" =Powers and abilities= In the world of The Dragon Prince, only magical creatures can use magic, as they have magical energy within them. All magic originates from one of six Primal Sources: the Sun, the Moon, the Stars, the Earth, the Sky, and the Ocean. As a Startouch elf, Aaravos is naturally connected to the stars, but due to being a \\"fallen\\" member of his race, he can only access a fraction of his former power. However, he has also somehow mastered the other five Primal Sources, and his abilities related to them are seemingly limitless. Because of this, he is referred to as an \\"Archmage.\\" An example of Aaravos's mastery is that he is able to perform spells with speaking the required incantations. Aaravos is also a master of Dark magic, which does not directly connect to the Primal Sources, but is instead fueled by the life essence of magical creatures. Aaravos can perform a dark magic spell without speaking an incantation, but at least once says the spell he wishes to perform in reverse. He knows a number of spells which Viren, an expert in the practice himself, does not. Aaravos has a familiar that is affiliated with him; a purple caterpillar-like creature that is not native to the world of Xadia. It heavily resembles a real-life Dragonhead caterpillar, which is the larval form of the butterfly Polyura athamas. Starting in the second season, Aaravos uses this caterpillar to communicate with Viren by channeling his voice through it. He can also perform spells through the form and channel them through Viren's staff to help him defeat enemies. The caterpillar evolves with the ongoing story; initially the size of a regular caterpillar, it grows to the size of a snake throughout the third season, and enters metamorphosis in the season finale. As mentioned above, Aaravos is a master manipulator, and the fact he is able to manipulate and influence the mind and actions of a person as sharp-minded as Viren is a great example of this. Reception Aaravos's mysterious, manipulative nature and how he is affecting Viren's character arc has received praise. Aaravos's character and Dellum's performance has been generally praised by critics and fans. Particular attention has been given to Aaravos's interactions and relationship with the human dark mage Viren. The Daily Dots Gavia Baker-Whitelaw called his relationship with Viren \\"intriguing\\". Praise continued into the third season. Hypable praised Aaravos and Viren's relationship and the contrast between the goals and actions of these two characters and those of Callum, Rayla, and Ezran. Nelson also reacted positively to the relationship between the two characters and how Aaravos \\"preys on Viren's ambition and desperation to fulfill his own mysterious, malevolent goals\\". Kain also took note of how Aaravos was contributing to Viren's descent into villainy.

Described as a \\"philosophical sci-fi adventure\\", the game takes inspiration from classic 1990's shooters Descent, Deus Ex and System Shock. Core Decay is expected to release in 2021. Gameplay Core Decay is an \\"atmospheric immersive sim\\", and a \\"retro shooter\\". The game is experienced through a first-person perspective, and focuses on exploration of the game world to accomplish goals. The player can interact with NPCs, collect logs and messages, hack computer systems, and engage in combat with enemies. First- person shooting is a core game mechanic, though often not necessary for progression. The abilities of the player-character can be enhanced by finding cybernetic implants, which grant improvements such as damage resistance, more powerful attacks, and better hacking ability. There is also a detailed damage model that tracks injury to the player-character across specific body parts, leading to specific debilitating effects as the player is damaged by hostile elements. Plot In the future, ecological collapse has caused society to crumble. Governments have given way to massive corporate powers. Facing extinction, a mysterious group of conspirators has formed to ensure the survival of humanity by any means necessary. The game begins as the player- character wakes up in a cold storage pod without any idea of what is going on, and now as much a machine as human. The player must explore the perilous installations of this shadowy organization and discover what they are planning. Development Ivar Hill created Core Decay as a personal side project while working as a professional game developer. He cites his own love of games like Descent and Deus Ex as inspiration for what he wanted to make. As a one-man team, he could not achieve the depth of such AAA titles, but could borrow many elements of those games such as emergent gameplay styles. As development progressed, other personnel joined the project to help with game programming, music, and art. Hill selected Unity as the game engine mainly due to his own familiarity, but also to allow strong multi-platform support. The game was developed simultaneously for both PC and mobile platforms, with only control schemes changing between versions. Though using a modern game engine, the game world is constructed with low-resolution models and textures. This serves both the retro shooter feel of the game, as well as the small development team. 3D Realms announced that they had partnered with Hill to publish and co-develop the game during their Realms Deep 2020 event.

The Department is headed by Minister for Agriculture and Farmers welfare. History Agriculture sector is vital for Indian economy. As per the data of Census 2011, 54.6% of India's population was engaged in agriculture and it contributed 17.4% to India's Gross Value Added. The importance of agriculture sector led Government of India to launch numerous initiatives. The Department was thus established for sustainable development of the agriculture sector. The DAC&FW; is divided into 27 units and has five attached offices and 21 subordinate offices. The pre-independence India had attached Department of Agriculture, Revenue and Commerce set up in 1871. In 1881 the Department of Revenue and Agriculture was separated from it, further in 1923 the Department of Education and Health were combined in it to form Department of Education, Health and Land. In 1945 three separate department were made out of this, which were Department of Education, Health and Agriculture, respectively. In 1947, the Department of Agriculture was rededicated to the Ministry of Agriculture. The present nomenclature of Ministry of Agriculture, Co-operation and Farmers Welfare and Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers welfare is attributed to the two agencies vide cabinet resolution of 2015. Initiatives =Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana= The Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (National Agriculture Development Programme) was launched in 2007 and has been implemented across two Five Year Plan periods, namely the 11th and 12th Five Year Plans. The scheme incents the states to invest in the agriculture sector for holistic development of Agriculture and allied sector. In 2017, the Ministry of Agriculture extended the programme for three years up to 2019-20 which was to run as the centrally sponsored scheme of Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana - Remunerative Approaches for Agriculture and Allied Sector Rejuvenation (RKVY-RAFTAAR). The centre and state's share in the funding is 60:40 for the General category states while for North-East and hilly areas it is 90:10. In case of Union Territory 100% funding is made by central government. In 2020, under the Innovation and Agri-Enterpreneurship development component of the revamped Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana, the Government of India funded various agricultural startups. =Pradhanmantri Fasal Bima Yojna= Former Minister for Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, Shri Radha Mohan Singh interacting with the regional media through video conferencing on ‚ÄúPradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojna‚Äù, in New Delhi. Launched in 2016, this scheme replaces erstwhile National Agriculture Insurance Scheme and Modified National Agriculture Insurance Scheme. It aims to reduce the burden of premium on farmers who take loans for their agricultural operations. The farmers are required to pay 2% premium for all Kharif crops and 1.5% and 5%, respectively, for Rabi and annual horticultural crops. The scheme is enforced under overall coordination of DAC&FW; and the state governments. The government will pay a balanced premium and there is no upper limit on the government subsidies. Further, the use of cutting-edge technology like GPS is mandated for recording crop-cutting experiment. The insurance plans will be handled under a single company, namely the Agriculture Insurance company of India. =Pradhanmantri Kisan Maan Dhan Yojna= The Pradhanmantri Kisan Maan Dhan Yojna is a pension scheme with Life Insurance Corporation of India as the pension fund manager. The beneficiary farmers will have to pay a monthly premium ranging from Rs.55 to Rs.200, depending upon their age of entry into the scheme and after reaching the age of 60 years they will be paid a monthly pension of Rs. 3000. The spouse is also eligible for pension after making a separate contribution under the scheme. Further, if the farmer dies after the retirement age then the spouse will receive 50% of the pension as family pension. If the farmer dies before completing the retirement age, the spouse is eligible to continue in the scheme after paying the remaining contribution till the retirement age of the deceased farmer. If the spouse does not wish to continue then the total corpus along with the interest will be paid to the spouse. If there is no spouse, the total contribution along with the premium shall be paid to the nominee.

He was the bishop-elect of Ferrara from 1239 until 1252, bishop-elect of Florence from 1250 until 1251 and archbishop of Ravenna from 1250 until his death. He was the apostolic legate in Germany between July 1246 and March 1247, in Lombardy and the Trevigiana between December 1255 and August 1258 and throughout northern Italy between 1267 and February 1270. He served as podest√† (mayor) of Ravenna in 1254. Educated in Spain and France, Filippo was a worldly prelate, a corpulent oenophile who kept a court of musicians and a constant bodyguard. He had at least three sons and a daughter, only finally receiving episcopal consecration in 1260. In spiritual matters, he showed partiality to the Franciscans. His legatine missions were devoted to fostering military alliances and prosecuting wars. He engineered the election of Henry Raspe as king of Germany in opposition to Emperor Frederick II in 1246. He frequently led troops himself in the inveterate contest between pro-papal and pro-imperial forces in Italy, always on the side of the Papacy. He considered himself papabile in the papal election of 1264‚Äì1265, but was passed over. He suffered from declining health in his last two years. Filippo's pastoral works as bishop are poorly known. His career can be told in detail because of the numerous documents issued by him and to him by various popes,See, e.g., . and because of his friendship with the historian Salimbene de Adam. He was overall \\"a man dedicated to action more than the care of souls, and more to military action than diplomacy, [with] a character totally alien to conciliation.\\": fu uomo dedito all'azione pi√π che alla cura delle anime, e pi√π all'azione bellica che a quella diplomatica, visto che dimostr√≤ un carattere del tutto alieno alla conciliazione. Early life Filippo was born in Pistoia in the 1190s and owned a house in Pistoia throughout his life., although see , for a source which places his birth around 1210. In the past he was often linked to the Fontana family of Ferrara, but this appears to be without foundation. He may have been related to the Vergiolesi of Pistoia. His friend and confidante, Salimbene de Adam, who is the main source for his youth, writes that he was related to his predecessor in the diocese of Ferrara, Garsendinus. He apprenticed as a necromancer in Toledo before studying philosophy and theology at the University of Paris. After completing his studies, he lived in Toulouse and then Ferrara until receiving a canonry in the cathedral of his native city. In 1239, Filippo was elected bishop of Ferrara. He was present when the Guelphs swore an oath at Bologna on 20 December 1239 to oppose the forces of Emperor Frederick II. The chronicles refer to him as a bishop then, but he is not otherwise documented as bishop-elect until November 1240. Bishop of Ferrara Since the city of Ferrara was in the hands of pro-imperial forces, Filippo organized the anti-imperial offensive in the Po valley. In January 1240, he seized Bergantino, which belonged to the diocese of Ferrara, and then the castle of Bondeno, which belonged to the abbey of Nonantola. He was checked at Ostiglia. In February, he began the siege of Ferrara, which was held by Salinguerra Torelli. His army consisted of Venetians, Ferrarese exiles, the men of Azzo VII d'Este (who had been banned by the emperor in June 1239) and the Guelphs of Bologna, Mantua and Milan. In June, they took the city. Now that Filippo was in command of his diocese, the diocesan properties that had belonged as fiefs to the Torelli and Ramberti families were confiscated and granted to the Este, who distributed them to their followers. On 21 May 1240, in obedience to an order of Pope Gregory IX, he ceded the revenues of San Pietro di Massa Nuova to the diocese of Cervia to compensate it for the damages it suffered during the war. On 26 November 1240, he placed the castle of Argenta in the care of Azzo VII. Sometime before 25 June 1243, he authorized the construction of a Franciscan church on land donated by the commune. At the height of the Mongol threat to the Holy Roman Empire in 1241, Filippo circulated a letter in Italy claiming to show that Frederick II had sent envoys to the Mongols and was in league with them. The pope's agents spread similar rumours in Germany. Throughout his time in Ferrara, he showed favour to Pistoians in the diocesan service, as he later also did at Ravenna. As bishop, he kept a court more typical of a secular lord: populated with musicians, bards and a guard of forty armed men. He also had a great fondness for wine. Legate in Germany Seal of Henry Raspe before he became king Filippo attended the Council of Lyon, whereat Frederick II was excommunicated again in June 1245. Pope Innocent IV then sent him to Germany to convince Landgrave Henry Raspe to accept election as king in opposition to Frederick. He arrived in Cologne in August and was accompanied or at least given safeconduct by the archbishop, Conrad of Hochstaden, when he traveled to meet Henry. He stayed with Henry throughout the fall and winter. The landgrave only consented to his election in March 1246. In April, he was in W√ºrzburg to prepare for the election, but the opposition of the citizens forced its relocation to a nearby vilalge. After Henry was elected at Veitsh√∂chheim on 22 May, Innocent congratulated Filippo on his successful mission and appointed him apostolic legate to Germany on 5 July. As legate and on the pope's instructions, Filippo excommunicated all of Frederick's ecclesiastical supporters who refused to appear at the Hoftag (assembly) called by Henry that month. The pope also authorized him to name the new bishop of Regensburg, since the diocese had fallen vacant in March 1246. Filippo appointed Albert of Pietengau, but he proved a disappointment to the anti-imperial party. Evidence of Filippo's success in Germany comes also from Frederick II's letters. The emperor complained the pope about Filippo and also wrote to his own supporters demanding they bar the legate's passage. Filippo did, however, exceed the wishes of the pope when he excommunicated Otto II, Duke of Bavaria, and placed his lands under interdict in October 1246. Filippo was with the new King Henry throughout the winter. He had joined the siege of Ulm by 18 January 1247., gives the date of 28 January. When Henry died suddenly on 17 February while the siege was ongoing, the army disintegrated and Filippo was left isolated. According to Salimbene, he went into hiding in a Franciscan convent and ordered the friars not to discuss the death of Henry except in his presence and in Latin. Disguising himself as a Franciscan, he sneaked through a ditch and had to be forcibly pushed through a hole in the town wall because he was so fat. He escaped Germany and was replaced as legate in March. He was back in Ferrara by the summer. Archbishop of Ravenna In February 1250, Filippo was elected bishop of Florence, although he appears to have remained in Ferrara. He was soon after elected to the archdiocese of Ravenna on the initiative of the pope. He appears to have been elected by 5 April 1250, although a papal document of 20 April still refers to him only as bishop of Ferrara. The opposition of the counts of Bagnacavallo prevented his travelling to Ravenna, and so he continued managing three dioceses from Ferrara. Another Pistoian, Giovanni de' Mangiadori, was elected to Florence in his stead in 1251. On 12 March 1251, Filippo received a delegation of Ravennate exiles encouraging him to come to Ravenna with Bolognese assistance. He renewed the emphyteusis of archdiocesan lands belonging to Azzo VII, but the latter was not forthcoming with assistance. He sent a missive to Ravenna from Ferrara on 24 September and another fives days later from Argenta demanding the city's submission to him and the Holy See. Receiving no response, he excommunicated the magistrates and placed the city under interdict. On 5 December, Innocent IV charged him with re-establishing peace in the archdiocese by military means and, on 25 January 1252, confirmed the interdict. An indication of the difficulty of managing more than one diocese as bishop-elect is found in the dispute between Filippo and his Ferrarese chapter in March 1252. The latter refused to recognized an act of Filippo's which had inadvertently been sealed with the seal of Ravenna rather than that of Ferrara. On 17 August 1252, a new bishop was elected for Ferrara and Filippo ceased to administer it. Upkeep of the Porta San Mama was the responsibility of the archbishop of Ravenna. On 3 April 1252, Filippo's appointment as legate in Lombardy was postponed so that the legate Ottaviano degli Ubaldini could finish his work. He would not take up the office for another three years, but in the interim he entered Ravenna on 1 March 1253. He even served a term as podest√† in 1254, combining secular and ecclesiastical offices. He promulgated statutes dealing with the office of podest√†, fines and policing. The archbishop was also responsible for the upkeep of the Porta San Mama. On 28 April 1254, he held a provincial synod. Innocent IV continued to trust important tasks to Filippo. By July 1254, he had appointed him mediator in the dispute between the Republic of Venice and the rector of Cervia, Tommaso da Fogliano, over the Cervia salt pans. On 4 September, Innocent named him mediator in the dispute between the diocese of Forlimpopoli and the counts of Castrocaro. Between November 1254 and December 1255, Filippo was in Apulia trying to foster an alliance against King Manfred of Sicily, whose right to the crown the pope disputed. In early December, he returned to Ravenna. Legate in Lombardy On 20 December 1255, Filippo was finally appointed legate in Lombardy and the March of Treviso by Pope Alexander IV. He and prosecuted the crusade against Ezzelino da Romano, the leading pro-imperial lords in the region, becoming a crucesignatus (crusader) himself. In March 1256, he preached the crusade in Venice and, in May, at Ferrara. He was not only involved in preaching, but also led armies from the front. According to Rolandino of Padua, Filippo incited his forces from the front lines during their final assault on Padua on 20 June 1256. He did not seek to prevent the sack of the city, but on 21 June held a public service of thanksgiving during which he released the city from excommunication. These actions made him notorious, according to Rolandino, and many cities and castles moved to surrender before being sacked. Rolandino's account includes a probably fictitious but powerful dialogue between Filippo and Ezzelino. He does not give the legate the more powerful argument. Following the fall of Padua, the army reinforced by Venetains, Bolognese and Chioggians under the condottiero Giovanni da Schio marched against Vicenza. Filippo appointed his old ally Azzo VII as captain-general of the army, but as it approached Vicenza word of the imminent arrival of Ezzelino caused panic in the ranks. The Bolognese fled, while Filippo and Azzo retreated to Padua. The archbishop began fortifying the city against a possible siege. He refused to give Ezzlino battle, while receiving reinforcements from the patriarch of Aquileia, Venice, Ferrara and Mantua. In January 1257, Filippo took an army to Mantua and opened negotiations with Brescia. Through the efforts of a Dominican friar, he was permitted to enter Brescia, where he convinced them to submit to the Holy See and abandon Ezzelino. After the latter made peace with his brother, Alberico da Romano, on 8 May 1257 at Castelfranco, Filippo excommunicated Alberico. Fearing the Brescia would return to the Romano camp, he and Azzo VII occupied it on 27 April 1258. In May, he visited Milan on a diplomatic mission but failed to strengthen the Guelph alliance there. While at Milan, Filippo placed the city of Forl√¨ under interdict on 30 May. He then returned to Brescia to forestall the takeover by the pro-imperial exiles led by Oberto Pelavicino and Buoso da Dovara. Filippo, who had led forces out to meet Oberto, was forced by the sudden arrival of Ezzelino in August to retire to Gambara and await rescue by Azzo VII. On 30 August, the crusader army was crushed and Filippo captured. Ezzelino entered Brescia on 1 September 1258. Return to Ravenna Filippo was kept imprisoned in Brescia, although he was treated with respect. After the death of Ezzelino on 1 October 1259, he passed into the control of Oberto Pelavicino, who refused all papal entreaties for his release. Filippo eventually escaped his prison and took refuge in Mantua before returning to Ravenna later that autumn. During his four-year absence from his diocese, the bishop of Pistoia, Guidaloste Vergiolesi, operated as his vicar at least between May 1257 and July 1259. Filippo, having only ever been an electus in any see, was finally consecrated archbishop in 1260, sometime before 19 June, when the first document describing him as such was issued. Nevertheless, some documents continued to style him electus as late as 1264. In 1260, Filippo received the Flagellants with approval. On 28 March 1261, he held a provincial synod to coordinate his bishops' actions against usurpations of church rights and properties by the communes and the feudal lords during the wars. According to Salimbene, Filippo showed special favour the Franciscans at this synod. In 1262, under pressure from the new papal legate, Filippo ordered the commune of Ravenna to provide assistance for the papal reconquest of the March of Ancona. He also pressured Rimini to contribute. On 17 February 1264, he took part with other regional Guelph leaders in the election of Obizzo II d'Este as lord (signore) of Ferrara. Although he approved the election, he had preferred Aldighiero Fontana for the role, according to the chronicler Riccobaldo of Ferrara. Legate in northern Italy According to Salimbene, who brought Filippo the news of Pope Urban IV's death on 2 October 1264, Filippo hoped to be elected pope. He was not, but the next pope, Clement IV, appointed him apostolic legate with a wide remit across northern Italy in 1267: his legation covered Lombardy, Romagna, the March of Treviso, the patriarchates of Aquileia and Grado, plus the cities of Ravenna, Milan, Genoa and Dubrovnik with their dioceses and ecclesiastical provinces. His task was to organize an alliance to prevent Conradin, then in Germany, from making his way to Sicily, which he claimed by hereditary right. On 16 August 1267, Filippo was congratulated by Clement IV on his success. When Conradin arrived at Verona on 21 October, Filippo was at Mantua. He immediately excommunicated the Sicilian claimant and his supporters, including Oberto Pelavicino and the cities of Verona and Pavia. Filippo's term as legate was guaranteed until 15 May 1268. Shortly after this date, Clement heard rumours of his death and on 30 July reserved the right to name his successor in Ravenna. Although Filippo was not dead, his health was in decline. He was residing at Argenta on 6 December 1269, when he appointed a procurator to oversee all his diocese's temporalities. On 11 January 1270, he entrusted the bishop-elect of Imola, Sinibaldo, with naming a new prior for Cella Volana. In February, he resigned his office of legate. Argenta was his main residence during this period. The Franciscan church in Pistoia where Filippo is buried Death and children On 19 April 1269, Filippo convoked a provincial synod to meet in the Basilica of San Vitale in Ravenna, but he did not personally attend. The presidency fell to the bishop of Comacchio. By August 1270, he was seriously ill when he left Argenta for his hometown. On 1 September, he met Salimbene in the Franciscan convent in Imola. He continued on to Bologna in a sedan chair. There he ceded Argenta to Obizzo II, as he had ceded it thirty years earlier to Azzo VII. He finally arrived in Pistoia early in September and died there on 18 September 1270. He was buried in the Franciscan church in Pistoia. Salimbene records that Filippo had at least four children. In exchange for Argenta, Obizzo paid a sum of money to a certain Filippo and Francesco, who are referred to as the archbishop's nephews in the charter. In reality, they were his sons. Another son, Nicola, was a judge in Bologna and was killed during the Bolognese siege of Faenza on 7 April 1275. Salimbene mentions a daughter, but does not name her.

The school began operations in December 1992, electing Dr. Rexhep Boja its first dean, Mr. Quemajl Morina as its first vice dean, and Sabri Bajgora as its first secretary. The first seminar on Islamic apologetics was given by the doyen of Islamic journalism in Kosovo, Sherif Ahmeti, who taught a course for three years on aqidah. Enrollment and employment were light in the early days, with only one doctor of science, one master‚Äôs holder, and a few other theologians on staff. By its 10th anniversary in 2002, however, the school had graduated 4 doctors of Islamic Sciences, 5 masters‚Äô candidates, and 6 lecturer-theologians preaching in Cairo, Beirut, Amman, and Damascus among other places. Student amenities Students enroll from throughout the Albanian diaspora, including Kosovo, North Macedonia, Montenegro, Albania, and the Pre≈°evo Valley. A Student Association organizes events such as conferences with FSI and visiting professors. The student publication is known as Zgjimi Islam (‚ÄúIslamic Awakening‚Äù).

Shortly after the Battle of Oravais the Swedish king, Gustav IV Adolf, decided to land a force of 4,000 men under general Albrekt von Lantinghausen on the coast of Nystad, to cut-off the Russian connection between that town and √Öbo. It was also meant to join forces with parts of Eberhard von Vegesack's army which was supposed to land at Bj√∂rneborg (Pori), but instead went as far north as Kristinestad where it landed on 28 August; this made cooperation between the two forces difficult. Nonetheless, the Swedish force under Lantinghausen landed at Lokalaks on 17 September with less than 3,000 men of his initial force; it was badly equipped and with inadequate ammunition. Ready to receive them was the Russian commander Pyotr Bagration with perhaps 1,200 men and 5 guns. After Lantinghausen had landed he made little progress in advancing and after reaching Lokalaks Church he was attacked by the Russians, at 6:00 PM. The fighting remained mild and continued for two hours before it was stopped due to the dark. On 6:00 AM the next day the Russians attacked again while Lantinghausen remained passive and made no effort to counterattack; after six hours Bagration attacked both Swedish flanks and Lantinghausen made the decision to embark his ships and sail away. The Swedes had lost 140 men in the battle while the Russians had lost 200.

It is an Amor asteroid, meaning that its orbit does not cross Earth's orbit, but its perihelion is close to, but greater than, the aphelion of Earth. It was first observed on 25 September 2017, when the asteroid was less than 1 AU from Earth and had a solar elongation of 169¬∞. This asteroid is a lost asteroid. It has a very short observation arc of 0.83 days and has not been seen since 2017, so it has an orbit that is only roughly calculated. Also, there are variations in the absolute magnitude cataloged by various organizations, leading to variations in the estimated size of the asteroid (Sentry list H 23.9 implies 55 m vs MPC H 23.3 implies 75 m). These variations are in addition to the uncertainty in the size estimate caused by the uncertainty in the albedo. This asteroid is in the Risk List and the Priority List of the European Space Agency (ESA) - Space Situational Awareness (SSA). The asteroid is also in the Sentry List of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) - Center for Near Earth Object Studies (CNEOS). According to the Sentry List, of the possible close encounters with Earth in the foreseeable future, an encounter on September 8, 2051 has the highest Palermo Technical Impact Hazard Scale value. According to the Near Earth Objects Dynamic Site (NEODyS), of the possible close encounters with Earth in the foreseeable future, an encounter on 1 August 2023 is the most likely.

Polish language instruction began in the fall semester of 1936 and has been offered at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison ever since. The Polish program is offered by the UW‚ÄìMadison Department of German, Nordic, and Slavic+. As such, the teaching of Slavic languages and literatures at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison began with the establishment of the Department of Polish in 1935.  History  The Polish Studies Program at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison traces its history back to 1935, when the combined effort of the local Polish American community and state legislators led to the establishment of the Department of Polish (1936), the first academic program devoted to the teaching of the Polish language, literature, and culture in the United States. First Polish classes at UW‚ÄìMadison were held in the fall semester of 1936 and have been offered there ever since. Initially, Polish classes were taught by visiting professors from Poland. Chronologically, this cohort included Jerzy Kury≈Çowicz from the University of Lviv (1936), Witold Doroszewski from the University of Warsaw (1936‚Äì1937), and Joseph A. Birkenmajer (1937‚Äì1939). The latter two were also the first chairpersons of the department, which, at the time, consisted of the Polish lecturer exclusively. Edmund Zawacki, who started teaching Polish at UW‚ÄìMadison in 1939, continued to work there until 1978. Zawacki, the first recipient of a Ph.D. degree in Slavic languages and literatures in the United States, also became the third chairperson of the department, a position in which he served until 1960. After Zawacki's retirement in 1978, Lillian Vallee took the post of the Polish lecturer in the department, having worked in this capacity for the next four years. In 1982, Halina Filipowicz was hired as the head of the Polish studies, a position she has held until her retirement. In 2019, ≈Åukasz Wodzy≈Ñski succeeded Filipowicz as the professor of Polish. In 1942, the Department of Polish changed its name to the Department of Slavic Languages, a move that saw the unit broaden its academic scope to include Russian language offerings. This trend continued in the years to come as several other Slavic and non-Slavic languages were added. During that time, the department started offering classes in Bulgarian, Czech, Old Church Slavic, Serbo-Croatian (all Slavic), as well as some Turkic languages: Kazakh, Tatar, and Uzbek. Of those, Czech, Old Church Slavic, and Serbo-Croatian continue to be offered to this day, alongside with Polish and Russian. Currently, the Polish Studies Program at UW‚ÄìMadison makes part of the academic programs offered through the Department of German, Nordic, and Slavic+. In 2011, the then-Department of Slavic Languages and Literatures was awarded the Polonicum Award Distinction, presented by the University of Warsaw Center for Polish Language and Culture for Foreigners, in recognition of its achievements in the area of teaching, researching, and promoting Polish language, literature, and culture. The UW‚ÄìMadison Polish program won for its engagement in the education and popularization of Polish culture among the wider audience. The award was accepted by Dr. Ewa Miernowska, the program's Polish lecturer since 1993, during the 2011 Awards Ceremony that took place on November 28, 2011 in Warsaw, Poland, and included the chancellor of the University of Warsaw, among other guests. The Polonicum Award is presented each year and the Award Committee is made up by the Minister of Science and Higher Education of Poland, the Minister of Culture and National Heritage, and the chancellor of the University of Warsaw, among others. UW‚ÄìMadison remains one of the few U.S. universities that offers a Polish major. As of 2020, Polish is one of the four undergraduate majors offered by the Department of German, Nordic, and Slavic+.  Polish Film Festival  The Polish Film Festival, an annual screening of most recent Polish cinematic productions, is organized by the UW‚ÄìMadison Polish Studies Program and members of the Polish Student Association there, in collaboration with other groups. The Festival has been initiated in the early 1990s by the long-time UW‚ÄìMadison Polish language lecturer, Dr. Ewa Miernowska, who began teaching Polish at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison in 1993. The first edition of the Polish Film Festival took place in 1991. Thus, the Polish Film Festival ranks among the oldest film festivals (co)organized by the UW‚ÄìMadison student body. For 25 years since its inceptions, the Festival has screened more than 120 Polish films, becoming a cultural event for both the Madison-based Polish-American community and the local community a large. In 2010, the Polish Festival Festival in Madison, Wisconsin, hosted the Polish film director Filip Bajon, whose historical drama War of Love (Pol. ≈öluby panie≈Ñskie), a film adaptation of the 1832 play by Aleksander Fredro under the same title, opened the Festival that year. In the 2010s, the Festival became a major cinematic event in Madison, attracting hundreds of viewers. For instance, in 2013, the Polish films presented there were screened to more than 400 viewers, in 2015 ‚Äì to more than 600 viewers, while a year later ‚Äì to more than 500 viewers. Among the films presented at previous editions are such contemporary Polish cinema hits as the drama Little Rose (Pol. R√≥≈ºyczka, dir. by Jan Kidawa-B≈Ço≈Ñski), as well as the comedies Testosterone (Pol. Testosteron, dir. by Tomasz Konecki and Andrzej Saramonowicz) and Planet Single (Pol.

He has also written on native and wild foods of Australia.  Early life  Alan Bridson Cribb (Junior) was born in Ipswich, Queensland on October 5, 1925, the son of Alan Bridson Cribb, a grazier and his wife, Dorothy Shand. He grew up around Longreach and his father instructed him in a love for the Australian bush and an interest in natural history. The extended Cribb family lived in Ipswich, where the family business Cribb and Foote department store was located. Cribb studied at the University of Queensland, taking his B.Sc with first class honours in 1948. He collected algae on a UQ Science Students excursion to Noosa in 1948, and this collection was used to forward his future field of study. Queensland did not have any experts in algae at the time. Cribb travelled to New Zealand where he studied under Professor Val Chapman, before moving into his Honours program. He took up a position as a demonstrator in the Department of Botany and worked with visiting academic Dr Tore Levring of Sweden studying marine algae on Heron Island. Cribb was appointed a research officer with the CSIRO Division of Fisheries and Oceanography at Cronulla in 1950. He escorted Professor Lily Newton, a British expert in seaweeds, when she came to Australia at the invitation of CSIR (now CSIRO) in 1950. Cribb spent two years reviewing algae, especially Macrocystis from Tasmania. He returned to Queensland in 1952, taking up work as a botany lecturer at the University of Queensland. He took his PhD in 1958. He was Head of the Department of Biology from 1978‚Äì1982 and remained in the department until his retirement in 1988.  Extended research  Cribb's research continued into marine algae of southern Queensland and the Great Barrier Reef. He published over 135 papers and books. He also presented evidence to the 1973 Royal Commission into exploratory and production drilling for petroleum of the Great Barrier Reef. He and his wife also contributed on a report on the revegetation of South Stradbroke Island following sand mining activity in 1971. He participated in four expeditions of the Royal Geographical Society of Queensland. He prepared documentation on the distribution of flora in Queensland for use by staff of the National Parks and Wildlife Service. His work on the Great Barrier Reef established classification systems for algae of the intertidal reefs. He and his wife, researcher Dr Joan Cribb completed two volumes on bush and wild foods, with material from Desmond Herbert and notes from Raymond Specht's Arnhem Land Expedition of 1948.  Personal life  Cribb married Joan Herbert in 1954. Together he and Joan Cribb published a number of books on marine fungi and wild foods.

The island has been subject to heavy commercial logging, with the only original forests remaining on the high ridge of the central mountain range. Logging has been reduced long enough on the east side of the mountains to support a regrown forest and a number of endemic species.  Location and description  Although the ecoregion is primarily on the island of Mindoro, it also includes a group of small islands to the southeast centered on (Semirara Island), and to the northwest centered on (Lubang Island). These small islands are isolated enough that they may support endemic species. The main island of Mindoro is divided by a north-south mountain range, with the east side more heavily forested than the west. The highest point is Mount Halcon, at . Because there are deepwater channels between Mindoro and Luzon, and Mindoro and the Palawans, the island was not connected by land bridges during the Pleistocene recent (Ice Age). It thus retains a distinctive community of flora and fauna, but there are affinities to the larger islands.  Climate  The climate of the ecoregion is Tropical monsoon climate (K√∂ppen climate classification (Am)). This climate is characterized by relatively even temperatures throughout the year (all months being greater than average temperature), and a pronounced dry season. The driest month has less than 60 mm of precipitation, but more than (100-(average/25) mm. This climate is mid- way between a tropical rainforest and a tropical savannah. The dry month usually at or right after the winter solstice in the Northern Hemisphere. The wet season in the ecoregion is June to October.  Flora and fauna  Although the original forest has been mostly logged or degraded by human activity, the island is currently about 60% covered with closed forest, mostly broadleaf evergreen. Another 13% is open forest, 10% is herbaceous cover, and the remainder is human settlement and cropland. There are 42 species of mammals on Mindoro, 7 of which are endemic. Mammals of conservation interest include the critically endangered Mindoro dwarf buffalo (Bubalus mindorensis), and the critically endangered Ilin Island cloudrunner (Crateromys paulus).

He lived most of his life in the Italian region of Piedmont and, among several other professional achievements, was appointed advisor of the Italian government under the Giovanni Giolitti government (1920‚Äì1921) and counselor for the Italian Supreme Court. Lavagna is often cited in studies examining the relations between Italy and China in the interwar period, but no author has so far published a biography about his personal and professional life. A testimony of his work is available at the archive of the Italian Ministry of Justice (file 65388). Lavagna is mainly remembered because he served as adviser of Chiang Kai-shek nationalist government with the task of proposing the revision of the new penal code and subsequently the new constitution of China.  Professional career  At the beginning of his professional career, Lavagna studied to become an expert in economic disciplines. He was a student of prof. Cognetti De Martiis, who taught political economics at the University of Turin. Among his available publications, the manuscript 'Il risparmio nelle sue leggi economiche e nella legislazione positiva di Europa ed America'(1895). However, Lavagna preferred the judicial career and in the legal field, he wrote several publications that allowed him to achieve the appointment as an academic lecturer. He traveled to Italy to exercise his role as a magistrate in Bricherasio, Ceva, Orbassano, and finally in Turin in 1909. Shortly after he became president of the Corte d‚ÄôAssise (the court has jurisdiction to try all crimes carrying a maximum penalty of 24 years in prison or more) and political advisor of Giovanni Giolitti government (1920). In 1920, Lavagna received the French L√©gion d'honneur and in 1921 was appointed Grand Officer of the Romanian Crown. During the same year, he returned to the judicial career. He was appointed president of the court of appeal in Turin and in 1926 as a counsel of the supreme court di cassation.  The mission in China (1933 - 1935)  On 30 November 1932, the Italian Embassy in Shanghai, at the time led by Galeazzo Ciano, asked the Italian foreign ministry for an expert in the field of law for the government of the Republic of China (telegram 235524 /466 dated 30 November 1932 to Minister of Justice, Diplomatic Archive Italian Foreign Ministry, China, folder 32). The call to send Italian advisers to augment the political role of the country in China was a high priority of the fascist regime in those years, while the government was trying to find new markets for the Italian industries. Among several choices only Lavagna was available to travel and reside abroad for a few years. The recommendation was presented by the first president of the supreme court of cassation. Lavagna traveled to China with his daughter and worked first at the reorganization of the ministry of justice as well as supervising the translation in Chinese of the Italian penal code (Codice Penale Rocco). Lavagna in his archive's papers also added that at that time, it was the only foreign code translated in the Chinese language. Together with the Chinese jurist Tung K‚Äôan, the Italian judge taught a course of ancient Chinese law and Roman law, which had several elements in common. In a detailed report to the Embassy in Shanghai dated 23 June 1934, Lavagna asserted the accomplishment of presenting the ‚ÄòObservations et Propositions sur le Dispositions Generales du Project Revise‚Äô and confirmed that the lessons at the academy of magistrates received enthusiastic feedback. In the following correspondence to the embassy, Lavagna lamented his critical health condition, having worked the entire summer in a humid and unhealthy environment. The experience in Nanjing was fatal to the professor. Lavagna suffered from high fevers, dysentery, and ophthalmic infections, but continued teaching at the university and started his work of revision on the new Chinese constitution, besides supervising the translation and publication of several political works of Mazzini and Gioberti. As he stated, in one of his regular reports to the Embassy in Shanghai, despite the adversities ‚ÄòI am glad to continue my work, rewarded by much benevolence and gratitude‚Äô. On 9 October 1935, his mission was accomplished, and returned to Italy. Chiang Kai-shek appointed Lavagna as an honorary legal adviser of the republic. Unfortunately, his health conditions got worse. He gradually was forced to retire from the profession of the magistrate and died in Turin on 8 November 1938.

History and description  Various types of interlacing rhombus-like motifs are heavily featured on the surfaces of minarets and other architectural elements in Morocco and al-Andalus during the Almohad period (12th‚Äì13th centuries). They continued to spread to other decorative mediums such as carved stucco over the walls of various buildings in Marinid and Nasrid architecture, eventually becoming a standard feature in the western Islamic ornamental repertoire, often in combination with arabesque elements. This motif is believed by some scholars to have originated with the complex interlacing arches in the 10th-century extension of the Great Mosque of Cordoba by Caliph al-Hakam II. It was then miniaturized and widened into a repeating net-like pattern that can cover surfaces. This motif, in turn, had many detailed variations. One common version, called darj wa ktaf (\\"step and shoulder\\") by Moroccan craftsman, makes use of alternating straight and curved lines which cross each other on their symmetrical axes, forming a motif that looks roughly like a fleur-de-lis or palmette-like shape. Another version, also commonly found on minarets in alternation with the darj wa ktaf, consists of interlacing multifoil/polylobed arches to form a more rounded lobed shape.

He produced fertile tetraploid hybrids of the silkworm species Bombyx mori and Bombyx mandarina. Astaurov was among the few Mendelian geneticists who survived Stalin's purge.  Life and work  Astaurov was born in Moscow to eye surgeon Lev M. Astaurov and gynaecologist Olga A. Tikhenko. His father had trained in Kazan while his mother had studied in Sorbonne and Lyon and the family ran a private medical practice. Astaurov went to the Flerov gymnasium where his contemporaries included B.V. Kedrovsky, N.V. Timofeev-Ressovsky, A.G. Gurwitsch, and G.K. Khrushchov. Astaurov was very good at drawing and learned piano with Boris Shalyapin under professor Feodor Koenemann. After graduating in 1921 he joined the Moscow University and after receiving a degree in 1927 he went to study zoology under N. K. Koltsov. In 1926 he went to work in the laboratory of S.S. Chetverikov, to study the genetics of Drosophila populations. His studies were on the mutant tetraptera with four wings. He went to study the genetics and breeding of Arabian and Bactrian camels in Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan from 1928 to 1929. His PhD could not be completed due to the arrest and deportation of Chetverikov based on the allegations made by Trofim Lysenko that Mendelian geneticists were fascists under Stalin's rule. Astaurov moved to Tashkent and joined the sericulture and silk research institute there. He demonstrated artificially induced parthenogenesis in silkworm eggs. In 1936 he returned to Moscow and was able to complete his doctorate. In 1942, after the death of D.P. Filatov, Astaurov continued to work at the Laboratory of Developmental Mechanics in Moscow and was made head of the department from 1947. After 1948, although not directly targeted by Lysenko, he was decreed to not work on silkworm but instead to study fish. After Stalin's death, he returned to study silkworm. The Tenth Genetics Congress at Montreal included a Soviet delegation consisting of Lysenkoists with the exception of Astaurov who refused to join the delegation. In 1974, a researcher working with Astaurov went to attend a meeting in Italy and defected. Astaurov was called to a meeting of the Soviet Academy where he was questioned about the \\"unpatriotic act\\" of his collaborator. He returned home from the meeting and died from a heart failure.

Convicted for the murder of a woman in 1983, he was sentenced to life imprisonment.  Biography  = Early life = Haliva was born in Hadera, four months after his parents had immigrated from Egypt. Shortly after his birth, the family moved to Acre. After completing 8 years of elementary school, he attended high school for two years, studying for a time at the Air Force Technical School before enlisting in the IDF at the age of 17, where he was assigned to the paratroopers division. = Sexual crimes = Haliva's first entaglement with the law was when he was a soldier in 1969, when he sexually assaulted a Dutch tourist visiting Acre. He met her when he was on his way to his parents' house, and volunteered to give her a tour of the Old City. When they passed under an underground tunnel, he tried to carry out his plot but she managed to fend him off and escaped. At trial, he apologized. He was sentenced to pay a fine 100 Israeli pounds and to two years probation. In April 1969, after the trial had concluded, he was patrolling while carrying a Uzi, when he chanced upon a tourist who was waiting for a ride at the road junction in Atlit. Haliva introduced himself as a member of the Beit Oren kibbutz and suggested that she go with him, so that he could take a car left by the brother and travel to Tel Aviv together. When they reached the entrance, he attacked the woman in a field, wrapping his arm around her neck and raping her, traumatising the woman, who later on would need psychiatric treatment. The newspapers later reported that after committing the rape, Shlomo burst into tears, claiming that he had no idea what he had done. He then presented her his soldier's certificate, escorted the victim to a bus stop and left. From this incident, he was nicknamed \\"The Weeping Rapist.\\" Two months after his sentence, in August 1969, he met another tourist hitchhiking for a ride near a checkpoint in Haifa. They rode together to the workshops in the bay, where he attacked the woman and raped her while threatening with a gun. A few months later, she spotted him by accident while riding in a taxi, which led to his arrest. While still on probation, he committed an indecent act in October 1969 against a girl he met on a dark street in Haifa late at night. He raped the girl after asking her for directions. After some tenants were awoken by her scream, he fled the area. In November 1970, he was sentenced to 7 years imprisonment. The two years of probation imposed on him in June 1969 (following the attempted rape against the tourist) were added up in prison. On October 26, 1975, Haliva was released on parole and returned to his parents' home in Acre. On February 2, 1976, he was arrested again on suspicion of committing five rapes after his release. In November of that year, Haliva escaped from prison custody when he asked the guards to go to the bathroom, but was quickly recaptured in the village of Maccabiah. He was described by the guards as a \\"pleasant and educated guy.\\" In 1978, Haliva was convicted of five counts of rape and sentenced to 22 years imprisonment. He was nicknamed \\"The Weeping Rapist\\" because he would apologize to his victims after the act. = Murders of Leonor Ben Lulu and Irit Yaakovi = In 1976, when he was arrested on suspicion of rape, Haliva was questioned in regard to the rape-murders of two women: Leonor Ben Lulu and Irit Yaakovi. Ben Lulu, 24, disappeared on January 23, 1976, while hitchhiking at the Arlozorov Junction (now Namir Road) in Tel Aviv on her way back home to Tiberias, where her family were celebrating her nephew's birthday. That Friday, employees of the Egged bus company were on strike, and there were no buses that travelled from Tel Aviv to Tiberias. On February 17th, Ben Lulu's body was found in an eucalyptus grove near Netanya. She had been undressed, raped and then redressed, except for her shoes, which were left next to the body. Her killer had suffocated her to death with her own scarf and a hairbrush from her handbag, which he tightened around her neck. Her watch, ring and purse were missing from the crime scene. Yaakovi, 23, disappeared on October 26, 1975, after leaving Haifa to travel to the Maagan Michael kibbutz where she lived. Her body was found on November 2nd in an avocado orchard near the Maagan Michael Junction, naked and in a state of advanced decay, with severe skull fractures sustained after being raped. Haliva confessed to killing Leonor Ben Lulu, with investigators claiming that he provided an accurate description of the body's location, but wrongfully claimed that he had buried it, which was untrue. The prosecution ruled that his confession was inadmissable, with Shlomo himself later claiming that he had confessed under duress. Ben Lulu's brother, a policeman at the time, said he thought it was him nonetheless. = Murder of Orly Dubi = Between November 13th and 16th, 1983, Haliva was on prison leave, and during that period, a soldier named Orly Dubi disappeared on November 15th. Her body was found on December 14th in a state of advanced decomposition, naked and lying on her stomach in the Netanya area, her body been discarded at a chromite processing plant belonging to the Ordan company. Dubi's personal belongings, most of her clothes, purse and identification were found scattered, some in the immediate vicinity and some in the water canal, on the other side of the road. Her bra and straps were tied in a knot around her neck, and from this, pathologists concluded that she had been strangled with it. After finding the body, the police suspected Haliva might've been involved and questioned him about it. Although he wasn't considered a serious suspect, he uncharacteristically asked to visit his ailing father, which was denied, as it was a lie. He then asked again, this time accompanied by police officers, which was granted. While on the trip, Haliva managed to escape, but was recaptured a few days later in a yeshiva in Jerusalem. An examination of his clothes - a black leather jacket, a blue flannel shirt and jeans - revealed traces of chromite. Since this mineral's chemical properties were identical to those found on the victim's clothing, and the fact that it was unique to the Ordan company and couldn't be natural, researchers connected Haliva to the crime scene, using it as their primary evidence at trial. In prison interviews, Haliva sounded concerned about the clothes he was wearing and even tried to disrupt proceedings, apparently out of fear that witnesses would identify his clothing. A blood test of his sperm determined that it matched that found on Dubi's body. On October 31, 1991, Haliva was convicted by the District Court, composed of Justices Shulamit Wallenstein, Yaakov Kedmi and Edna Shatzky, of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of Orly Dubi. According to the verdict, Haliva contacted Dubi while they were travelling together on a bus. Dubi, who was tired, had asked the driver to wake her when they reached Netanya, but the driver had forgotten to stop. Haliva shouted \\"Netanya, Netanya\\", disembarking with her and saying that he would escort her there. The puncture shape of the bus card found on Dubi was the same. However, the bus drivers misidentified both Haliva and Dubi, claiming that he was around 25 and short, and she was short and chubby, while Shlomo was 34 years old and tall, and Orly skinny and tall. Haliva himself claimed that he had an alibi, allegedly staying at his parents' home in Kiryat Yam on that night. The judges ruled that after leaving the local cinema, he had noticed Dubi getting off the bus, following and befriending her. On October 17, 1995, his appeal to the Supreme Court was rejected unanimously in a ruling by Justices Eliyahu Matza, Yitzhak Zamir and Zvi Tal. = Murders of Rachel Heller and Jacqueline Smith = From the late 1960s to the mid-1980s, the bodies of at least ten young women were found along the Coastal Highway. Among them was that of soldier Rachel Heller, 19, in 1974, whose body was found in the sand near the Sdot Yam kibbutz, and the body of British tourist Jacqueline Smith, 24, whose body was found on May 26, 1972. At the time of these murders, Haliva worked as a milkman in prison, but was periodically allowed prison leave. His files were destroyed, making it difficult to verify these murders, although there was some evidence, and it was even mentioned during one of the investigations that he had murdered the two women. But since there was no conclusive evidence, Haliva was never convicted, and another man, Amos Burns, was even wrongfully imprisoned for her murder. The murders were reminiscent in nature and cruelty to the murder of Orly Dubi, the only killing he has been convicted of, done while Shlomo was on prison leave. All victims had been strangled with clothing, their bodies were moved, a foreign object was inserted into the genitalia, they were stabbed with a sharp object and, in the murders of Heller and Smith, were mutilated with a peeler. A serial killer was suspected to be behind all the killings, but since the IPS couldn't give the exact dates of Haliva's prison leaves, it couldn't be determined if he was the culprit in the other murders. In the second season of Shadow of Truth, airing on Hot, it was alleged that Haliva was the elusive \\"Coastal Highway Killer.\\" The creators of the show complained that he threatened to harm them, after they decided to visit him in prison. Haliva never confessed or apologized for his actions, denying that he committed Dubi's killing, despite the fact that he revealed details only the killer would know, which is backed up by prison informers who claim he has bragged about numerous rapes and several murders. Following the second season of Shadow of Truth, the investigation files were reopened, but quickly led to dead ends, as they were not in-depth and lacked conclusive evidence. Shlomo Haliva is currently serving a life sentence, but is expected to be released on parole in 2024. External links * RAA 7785/07 Shlomo Haliva v. Prison Service * Shlomo Haliva v.

The concept evolved in response to high profile cases such as the Bristol heart scandal, the Shipman Inquiry and the Alder Hey organs scandal.

Subsequently, during his position as RDPH in England, he became involved in a number of clinical failure inquiries, including pathology in Swindon, breast screening in Exeter and abuse in Winterbourne. He also led public health improvement programmes including Smokefree South West and Healthy Schools Plus and the creation of the Office of Sexual Health. In March 2012, wishing to oppose the then Health Secretary, Andrew Lansley's, plans for the NHS, Scally resigned from England's Department of Health as a consequence of the then Conservative- Liberal Democrats' coalition government's health policies.

It stars Craig Foster, as himself, capturing a year he spent with a wild common octopus.  Synopsis  The film shows how, in 2010, Foster began free-diving in a cold underwater kelp forest at a remote location in False Bay, near Cape Town, South Africa. The location was near Simon's Town on the Cape Peninsula, which is exposed to the cold Benguela current of the Atlantic Ocean. He started to film his experiences and, in time, a curious young octopus captured his attention. By visiting her den and tracking her movements every day for months, he won the animal‚Äôs trust. In the film, Foster describes the impact on his life of his relationship with the octopus. The film shows the octopus defending herself against pyjama sharks. In one attack, the octopus loses an arm, and then retreats to her den to recover, regenerating the arm. Later, after mating with another octopus and producing a large number of eggs, the octopus dies and the film shows a shark taking her body away. Foster then describes the effect of his experience with the octopus on his relationship with his son, and his son's development as a diver and student of marine life.

There are, from time to time, cases in which some analyst is [angry] at his ex-wife and looks at the wrong thing and he is caught and fired‚Äù After the USA Freedom Act was signed into law by President Obama in 2014 as a compromise between civil libertarian demands and security hawk efforts to preserve certain spying tools, Deitz expressed skepticism that the legislation would offer much anything in the way of reform in either direction, saying \\"it‚Äôs being talked about like it‚Äôs the Declaration of Independence or something, these adjustments are marginal.‚Äù Deitz left the NSA with Director Michael Hayden in September 2006 to follow his boss to the Central Intelligence Agency, where Hayden became Director, and Deitz served as Senior Counselor to the Director. At CIA, Deitz was Director Hayden's personal legal advisor, a role distinct from his previous position at NSA where he oversaw all legal affairs of the agency. Deitz has been a critic of journalistic standards for publication of classified information. At a meeting of the American Bar Association meeting in Washington, D.C. he delivered harsh criticism of industry practices saying ‚ÄúIf you ask senior members of the press about this, they‚Äôll say.. ..‚ÄúWell, of course, we would never print troop movements.‚Äù That‚Äôs very quaint.‚Äù ‚ÄúPublishing troop movements mattered in D-Day‚Äù ‚Äúwhen NSA has spent a gazillion dollars tapping a system and the newspapers blithely explain and publish how it‚Äôs all done. That we care about, because that is a road map for terrorists.‚Äù ‚Äúwe need serious reviews by the editors of the newspapers about what they publish ... giving more credit to people in these positions of authority, people such as the heads of NSA, CIA, DIA, and so forth ‚Äî that these aren‚Äôt a bunch of corrupt pols who are trying to keep secrets simply to cover their careers, that these are well-intended people who are deeply concerned about keeping the American people safe.‚Äù  Academia  Both Deitz and Hayden left public service at the end of the Bush Administration, retiring from the CIA in February 2009. Soon after their departure, both joined the faculty of George Mason University's Schar School of Policy and Government. For Deitz this was just a more permanent role as he had already been teaching at George Mason since 2006 as Distinguished CIA Officer-In-Residence while at the agency. Deitz also currently serves on the Faculty Advisory Board of the Michael V. Hayden Center for Intelligence, Policy, and National Security, a think tank at George Mason University's Schar School founded by his former boss Michael Hayden.  Controversy  Deitz's teaching at George Mason was the subject of criticism from The Intercept's Ken Silverstein, who alleged that Deitz was unfit to teach courses on ethical challenges in public policy on accord of his legal work in defense of NSA warrantless surveillance programs and what Silverstein suggested was a politically motivated investigation Deitz conducted into former CIA Inspector General John Helgerson's review of the agency's extraordinary rendition, black sites, and enhanced interrogation practices at the behest of Director Michael Hayden.  Political affiliations  In the 2016 presidential elections Deitz supported the campaign of Republican candidate Carly Fiorina, and contrasted her foreign policy positions with then-candidate Donald Trump in a debate with Trump Campaign surrogate Peter Navarro on CNBC.  Personal life  Deitz is married to Martina Hofmann and resides in the Old Town neighborhood of Alexandria, Virginia. He is Lutheran.

He was the son of Cornelis van den Eynde, another architect-entrepreneur from Antwerp. Jan van den Eynde II was part of the Van den Eynde family of artists, a nephew of Hubert van den Eynde, and brother to Sebastiaen van den Eynde, both renowned sculptors. Van den Eynde's most famous building is arguably the Averbode Abbey, a peculiar synthesis of Baroque and Gothic with a touch of Renaissance to it, which the Fleming completed between 1664 and 1672. For this project, Van den Eynde was preferred to Lucas Faydherbe. Other than an architect, Jan van den Eynde II, who was tied to the nobility, was also a wealthy entrepreneur. Although some of his estate was inherited and thus unrelated to his business, he was worth over 100 000 guilders (for comparison, the price for a decent house in Antwerp was at the time between one and two thousand guilders). Life =Family= Van den Eynde was born into a renowned Antwerpian family: the Van den Eynde, a clan of artists and entrepreneurs. In the late 17th century, the Van den Eynde became one of the most prominent families of sculptors in Antwerp, forming the Quellinus-Verbrugghen-Willemssens-Scheemaeckers-Van den Eynde consortium, which secured itself monopoly on the sculpture market in Antwerp. The collaboration among the workshops of the aforesaid families in the late 17th century might be the main factor to account for the intricate \\"unity of style and approaches that have made disentangling of hands particularly difficult for art historians.\\" Work =Averbode Abbey= Averbode Abbey's church (centre) In 1664, Van den Eynde was awarded the commission of Averbode Abbey, having been preferred to Lucas Faydherbe, whose plans were rejected. Construction began on July 31, 1664. The ground-plan of the Averbode Abbey's church combined a centralized cruciform space to the west for the laity with a deep choir, necessary for Norbertine choral services. The treatment of space was more emphatic in Averbode Abbey's church than in other Norbertine abbey churches, on account of the happy combination of a radial plan with a very long and axially accentuated choir. The design combined Gothic structural forms, such as ribbed vaults, with Renaissance ornamental details. The church is considered a peculiar synthesis of Baroque and Gothic. No dome was built over the central section because in January 1668 one of the major piers collapsed. Because two other pillars collapsed thereafter, the fourth pillar also had to be pulled down. Works restarted with more solid material and the building was roofed by the end of 1670. The community inaugurated the new abbey church on July 11, 1672, the feast of St. Norbert. The solemn consecration was not celebrated until June 19, 1681. Van den Eynde also produced the church's sculptures.

It exploited four copper lodes, which ran south-east along the coastline. There are two engine houses. The building to the west served the first shaft, Old Engine Shaft, which was in operation by 1834. It housed an engine of cylinder diameter 18 inches, to pump water from the mine.

From 1893 to 1922, she was married to Andreas Heusler, a German scholar, and lived in Berlin for several years.  Life  Hohenschild was the daughter of the Darmstadt physician Ludwig Ernst Wilhelm Hohenschild (1829-1862) and his wife Auguste Hohenschild n√©e Fr√∂hlich. She was probably born in Darmstadt and had a younger sister. From January to October 1870 she studied piano at the K√∂nigliche Hochschule f√ºr Musik and singing from 1872 to 1873, among others as a pupil of Amalie Joachim.Schumann-Briefedition, Serie II (Briefwechsel mit Freunden und K√ºnstlerkollegen), vol. 15: Briefwechsel Robert und Clara Schumanns mit den Familien Voigt, Preu√üer, Herzogenberg und anderen Korrespondenten in Leipzig.

She was also \\"active for a few years as a teacher at the University of Music and Theatre Leipzig.\\" According to an announcement in the Allgemeine deutsche Musikzeitung, Hohenschild taught at the Hochschule Berlin until April 1878. She therefore gave up teaching to devote herself to her work as a concert singer. In the Berliner Adressbuch, her mother Auguste Hohenschild born Fr√∂hlich is registered from 1872 ‚Äì it can be assumed that Hohenschild lived with her mother in Berlin from the 1870s onwards because of her studies. Hohenschild first appears independently in the Berlin address book as a concert singer and singing teacher from 1885.. In 1881, she lived together with her mother in Frankfurt for a short time, probably because of her concert activities In January 1893, Hohenschild married Andreas Heusler. They lived together at Sch√∂neberger Ufer 41. During their marriage, regular music evenings were given in the shared flat.Andreas Heusler an Wilhelm Ranisch. Briefe aus den Jahren 1890‚Äì1940.

There are no more entries in the Berliner Adressbuch from 1909. Hohenschild died on 15 July 1938 in Darmstadt at the age of 86.  Concert activity  Hohenschild gave concerts mainly from the 1870s until her marriage in 1892. Joint concerts with Marie Fillunger are documented: for example on 29 January 1875 in Hamburg in the 2nd subscription concert of the Voigt'schen C√§cilienvereinSchumann-Briefedition, Serie I (Familienbriefwechsel), vol. 8: Clara Schumann im Briefwechsel mit Eugenie Schumann, I: 1857‚Äì1888.

Reconstructions via the Allgemeine Deutsche Musikzeitung refer to concert performances in Hamburg, Berlin, Potsdam, Darmstadt, Frankfurt, Kassel, Basel, Cologne, Aachen and Bremen between 1875 and 1878. She sang in Mozart's Requiem and songs and arias by Schubert, Schumann, Brahms, Beethoven, Cherubini, Hiller, Spohr, in oratorios like Jephtha by Handel and Paulus by Mendelssohn Bartholdy. In 1878, she performed in Bremen with Marie Fillunger, Amalie Joachim, beside Pablo de Sarasate and Joseph Joachim, who also appeared at the concerts. Hohenschild is mentioned in 1886, 1889, 1890 and 1891 in the Neue Zeitschrift f√ºr Musik listed as singer (alto) in the advertisements of the Hermann Wolff concert agency, in the magazine Signale f√ºr die musikalische Welt in 1888. According to a concert review of the Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung, she performed in Stuttgart in 1881 where she sang the aria \\"Hellstrahlender Tag\\" from Odysseus by Max Bruch, as well as \\"Mainacht\\" by Brahms, \\"Sympathie\\" by Joseph Haydn and \\"Im Volkston\\" by Hans Schmidt.

Research needs  Due to the scant sources available, many questions remain unanswered concerning Hohenschild's musical education and concert activities, the duration of her lessons with Amalie Joachim and information about her own singing students. Extensive research of concert reviews in music journals of the 19th century would make it possible to identify further stages of her artistic work and thus to reconstruct approximately the time and place of her concert activities as well as her repertoire.

Synopsis Propaganda poster from Uzbekistan, 1933 Stalin's Peasants is a history from below of the conflict between peasants and Stalinist leaders and apparatchiks during the period of collectivization in the Soviet Union during the 1930s. It attempts to understand the different ways Soviet peasants attempted to resist Joseph Stalin's policy of collectivization and their efforts to adapt and control their lives within the newly collectivized village. It also explores the impact collectivization had on relationships within and between villages, the conflicts it gave rise to, and the changes to the structure of local authority it engendered. The work shatters the myth of the happy peasants and the image of a Potemkin village of plenty, allegiance, and solidarity created by Soviet propagandists to justify collectivization and demonstrates how peasants understood this period as a \\"second serfdom\\". Based on evidence from the Soviet archives, it refutes the claim that the peasants saw Stalin as the \\"good Tsar\\" and shows that they understood he was responsible for the misery and famine they were experiencing. Writing in Slavic Review, Robert E. Johnson states, \\"Sheila Fitzpatrick's book is not a general history of Soviet agriculture, or the Soviet peasantry or collectivization. (It will, indeed, be a challenging read for anyone who is not already familiar with these subjects.) Rather, she offers a thoughtful and provocative reappraisal of the collision between peasants and the Soviet state in the 1930s. Using a wide array of grass-roots sources, she examines the strategies of everyday survival, the limits of Soviet power, and the strains and divisions of life in the countryside.\\" Nellie Hauke Ohr writes in The Journal of Social History, \\"The book builds on Fitzpatrick's work in Soviet social and cultural history, including her studies of the Commissariat of Enlightenment and the Cultural Revolution of 1928-1931 and, most recently, her collection of essays entitled The Cultural Front: Power and Culture in Revolutionary Russia.\\" The author is one of the first to be able to explore this area of Soviet history with access to the Soviet archives which were opened during the period of glasnost during the Gorbachev Era. Her work draws heavily on the police and government records and also the petitions and complaints sent to the Kremlin from Soviet peasants seeking relief from famine and redress for the oppression they were experiencing. Access to this enormous new trove of information proved to be both a blessing for the new information and perspectives it provided and a challenge for understanding, assimilating, and synthesizing the information into a meaningful and accurate revisionist history. Reception Teodor Shanin writes in the American Historical Review, \\"this work marks a major step forward in the development of a rural history of Russia- a point from which to proceed.\\" Writing in Russian History, Stephen Merl states, \\"In sum, we have to thank Fitzpatrick for a stimulating book that gives us a good impression of life in the kolkhozy. This is especially true for the attempt to challenge the traditional view of state-controlled kolkhozy. Fitzpatrick certainly is right in affirming that the kolkhozniks somewhat aligned themselves with the kolkhoz system by getting used to it and that, to a limited extent, they were successful in undermining state demands. However, there is still much work to be done in writing the social history of the peasants before coming to final and fully convincing conclusions. Fitzpatrick's book is an excellent starting point for further research.\\" Academic journal reviews * Davies, R. W. (1996). Book Review.

Kriti Bharti made headlines as the first annuller of child marriage in India. She is the founder and director of Saarthi Trust, a non profit organization that primarily rescues and ensures the recovery and welfare of child marriage victims. Kriti's team has annulled more than 36 child marriages and prevented more than 1,000 from occurring. Early Life Kriti Bharti was born on August 19, 1987 in Jodhpur, Rajasthan. Kriti Bharti's father abandoned her mother, Indu Chopra, when she was still in her womb. This was considered a disgrace in a conservative environment, and relatives demanded her to abort or to be wed again. Despite the pressure, Bharti's mother persisted and raised the child alone. Her mother also suffered medical complications during her pregnancy and Kriti Bharti was born prematurely at seven months. As a child, Kriti Bharti was physically and verbally tortured by relatives who considered her cursed. One went to the extent of giving her a slow poison at 10 years old, and Kriti Bharti managed to survive but she was bedridden and paralyzed. She went through several treatments from different hospitals, until she was able to recover two years later, attributing her healing to reiki therapies. Upon her recovery, she changed her last name to \\"Bharti\\" (Daughter of India) in an attempt to free herself from the caste system, religion and kin. Education Due to the paralysis, kriti Bharti was unable to finish fourth grade. She managed to accelerate to 10nth grade as she cleared her boards. Bharti obtained a Doctorate in Psychology at the Jai Narain Vyas University in Jodhpur. NGOs At college, Kriti Bharti joined many NGOs and started counselling simultaneously. Her first case was a rape victim who was just 9 years old. Bharti thought that a temporary relief via counselling is ultimately pointless. The encounter prompted her to pursue. Through the NGOs, Kriti Bharti was able to work with several street children that suffered from child labour, poverty and child marriage. After seven months, she noticed that a pressing issue among the homeless children is child marriage. Child marriage, although considered illegal in India, remained prevalent, especially in rural areas. Bharti's hometown, Rajasthan, was considered the world's epicenter of child marriage. A report of the UNICEF in 2009, titled State of the Worlds Children, goes on further to say that 40 percent of the world's child marriages happen in India. The report also stated that 56 percent of the women surveyed in rural areas married before 18 years old. Saarthi Trust As Kriti Bharti worked with NGOs, she noticed how they were just spreading awareness; while she believed it is essential, it is merely treating the problem at the surface level. Thus, in 2011, driven by her experience with children in NGOs, she established Saarthi Trust. Saarthi Trust works on grassroots level and ensures the rehabilitation and welfare of child marriage victims after rescue. The organization provides education, vocational training and employment opportunities to ensure the independence of the victims thereafter. In 2012, Kriti Bharti made headlines on her first case, Laxmi Sargara. She was the first woman in India to have her child marriage nullified. Since then, Kriti Bharti and her team have been working on personally visiting villages and schools to discuss the detrimental effects of child marriage and to teach women empowerment. The organization has a helpline for underage brides and grooms to report their case. As victims reach out, Kriti's team obtains proof of the marriage and then talks to the family of both the bride and bridegroom, and then to the elders of the community in an attempt to convince them. If it fails, Kriti's team seeks legal help and takes the case to the court. Throughout years of activism, Kriti has faced countless death and rape threats. Hidebound hindu leaders who approve of the practice of child marriage have threatened to chop her nose and gang rape her. Saarthi Trust has rehabilitated more than 6,000 children and 5,500 women. Since it was established in 2011, Kriti has annulled more than 40 child marriages and halted more than 1,400 from happening.

It operated between 2010 and 2013 and targeted people with public exposure and accusations of l√®se-majest√©.  History  By 2009, incidents of ‚Äúcyber witch hunts‚Äù were occurring in Thailand. The first Facebook group to publicly accuse people of l√®se-majest√© was 'Rally Bangkokians to Oppose Evil Red Shirts'. Subsequently, SS was founded anonymously in March 2010. It was the first such group to be organized and systematic in its operations, with its stated aim being to ‚Äúunite Thais to expose crooks and defend the monarch by social sanction‚Äù. In July 2012, SS launched a campaign against a Lt. Col. Sopa, using a photograph found on the Internet. When it became clear that SS had used a photograph of the wrong person, there was an outcry, which led to SS shutting down.  Tactics  SS targeted people by sharing people's personal profiles, sought to expose their addresses and phone numbers, and via postings accused them of being disloyal to the monarchy and of l√®se-majest√©. If the accused responded to these postings, the campaign re-posted screenshots of the reactions with additional defamatory comments. The main strategy was not to provide evidence of l√®se-majest√©, but simply to attack individuals with the general accusation of being ‚Äòun-Thai‚Äô. The group therefore used 'Thai-ness under absolute monarchy' as its principal ideological point of reference, as illustrated in postings such as: ‚Äú[W]hoever questions, criticizes or does not express love toward the monarch is considered alien, ungrateful, and evil‚Äù. In addition to allegations of l√®se-majest√©, group members insulted supporters of the exiled Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra using dehumanizing with terms like ‚Äòred buffalo‚Äô. Group members also accused them of being ungrateful, traitors, and ‚Äòdead wood‚Äô. Group members stated that they had no faith in the police or any institution other than the monarchy:29 and publicly advocated lynching.:224 This was deliberately framed as being political activism and as a 'social sanction'. The group's tactics and discourse has led to it being characterized as 'fascist'.  Impact  The cyber-mobbing that groups like SS initiated, which threatened political opponents with l√®se-majest√© allegations, and which saw the manipulation of fake online profiles, initiated a \\"cyber guerilla war\\",:224 including the emergence of the Anti-Social Sanction group, which likewise exposed group members‚Äô personal data. The war only lessened with the election of Yingluck Shinawatra and a temporary stabilization of Thai politics.:224 During the three years that the group operated, until July 2013, approximately 40-50 people were ‚Äúexposed‚Äù. At its peak, its Facebook page had over 30,000 'likes'.

She is also a National Geographic explorer, and has produced a 26-part short documentary series about Asian elephants, using the National Geographic Society storytelling award. Sangita rose to prominence and limelight with her debut documentary directorial Gods in Shackles (2016) which was based on captive elephants in Kerala. The film was nominated at the United Nations General Assembly, featured at the prestigious International Film Festival of India (IFFI) and has received over a dozen international film festival awards. The documentary was inspired by the encounters and witnesse gathered by Sangita.  Biography  Sangita Iyer was born in Kerala, and has worked in several countries, including Nairobi Kenya, where she taught biology and ecology to high school students in the early 80's, in Bermuda as the primetime news anchor and nature and wildlife reporter for the ABC/CBS affiliate, the Bermuda Broadcasting Company. She currently lives in Toronto, Canada, where she has served as a videographer and host for Rogers TV network.  Career  She pursued her career in journalism in 1999 as an health and environmental journalist. She completed her MA degree in environmental education and communication in 2012. She produced reports related to nature and wildlife for Discovery Channel programme Daily Planet. She co-founded the Bermuda Environmental Alliance in 2009 and she founded the Voice for Asian Elephants Society in 2016. In 2013, Sangita began to document the horrendous treatment of elephants in Kerala that are exploited by religious institutions, and transformed the evidence into a documentary titled Gods in Shackles which portrays the torture and suffering faced by the temple elephants during cultural festivals in the state of Kerala. She decided to produce and direct the documentary after witnessing the torture faced by the elephants during a trip to India in December 2013. The documentary eventually opened to positive reviews from critics and also won few international awards. Sangita also became the first woman to have made a documentary about captive elephants in Kerala. In 2017, she received the prestigious Nari Shakti Puraskar award for the year 2016 from the then Indian President Pranab Mukherjee. In addition, Iyer has received numerous academic awards and scholarships.  Controversies  In November 2019, a petition was filed by Viswa Gaja Seva Samithi organisation in the Kerala High Court to prevent her from conducting mahout training summit called \\"Gentle Giants Summit\\" at a government owned elephant rehabilitation centre in Thiruvananthapuram.. However, the false allegations did not prevent Kerala's forest department from allowing Iyer to conduct the summit, as she presented her Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) card which afforded her the privileges that Indian citizens were afforded. The plea which was filed claiming that she was a foreign national in contrast to the national policies and was also accused of misusing official emblem of Kerala state government in the brochures prior to conducting a three day workshop. However, it turned out that the Kerala Forest Department had agreed to partner with Iyer and had granted the forest department emblem to be used in the brochures. She claimed that she had been a victim of cyberbullying ever since the release of her debut directorial.

He served as Minister for Postal and Telegraphic communications in the Zanardelli government between 1901 and 1903. In 1929, despite being openly equivocal about the leader's post-democratic approach to politics, he was appointed to the senate. Biography =Provenance and early years= Tancredi Galimberti was born in Cuneo, a midsized town and important regional capital in the hills south of Turin. He was the eleventh of his parents' fourteen recorded children. His father, Bartolomeo Galimberti, was a typographer by trade and something of a \\"self-made man\\" by temperament Bartolomeo Galimberti grew prosperous and became in 1861 the proprietor of \\"Sentinella delle Alpi\\". Family control of this politically pro-liberal and openly pro-masonic newspaper would be helpful in his future political career. Galimberti received a classical college education from the Scolopi (\\"Piarist\\") fathers in nearby Savona and then progressed to university, studying first at Rome where he became involved with republican groups. He moved on to the University of Turin, emerging in 1880 with a degree in Jurisprudence. =Member of parliament= In 1882 he became a co-director of the family newspaper, of which he was now proprietor. The \\"Sentinella delle Alpi\\" was to prove a powerful springboard for a rapid rise in what at least one commentator terms a \\"brilliant\\" political career. In 1883, aged just 26, he was elected to the Cuneo municipal council. Just one year later he was elected to the Provincial Council for the entire Valgrana district. On 3 July 1887 he became a member of the Chamber of Deputies (the lower house of the national parliament), having been elected by the Cuneo electoral district with the public endorsement of Giovanni Giolitti, already a powerful politician locally and a future head of the Italian government. Giolitti's backing had been secured through then intervention of N.Vineis, a co-director of the \\"Sentinella\\" and another man of significant influence in the region. He sat as a member of parliament, representing the Cuneo electoral district, without a break between 1887 and 1913. He was initially very close to his fellow Cunean, Giolitti. When the Giolitti government collapsed in the wake of the 1893 Banca Romana scandal Galimberti even took a lead in defending Giolitti before the High Court. In personal terms he would remain close to Giolitti, but in political terms he was never an uncritical follower. Over the years he would not infrequently take positions in parliament and in his newspaper that respected the left-wing ethos that was baked into Cuneo's liberal traditions, and frequently redolent of the far-left radicalism associated with the eloquent firebrand, Felice Cavallotti. When he entered parliament he was seen as a supporter of the government then in office under Agostino Depretis. Over the ensuing quarter century Giolitti's position shifted in a more reformist direction, and the Galimberti increasingly found himself on the same side as his friend. Throughout his time as a member of parliament, Galimberti prioritised the interests of voters in Cuneo. Many of his parliamentary interventions were in favour of public investment in infrastructure and other \\"public works and services\\" in the Province of Cuneo, and of any other measures that might improve the living conditions of Cuneo residents. An enduring case in point was the railway line linking Cuneo to Ventimiglia (and thereby to Nice), along with a fine new main station at Cuneo-Altipiano. (The station building was subsequently replaced by a more bombastic edifice in 1937.) It should nevertheless be stressed that his commitment to his local electors did nothing to diminish the extent and thoughtfulness of his parliamentary contributions on the major national issues of the day. His default position was in favour of \\"economic rigour\\". He nevertheless opposed the application repressive measures to try and resolve the social issues that were coming to the fore in the context of Italy's rapid industrialisation. He opposed colonial expansion and, on the nearer international front, favoured closer co-operation with France. =Rudini government, Pelloux government= Though politically damaged - at least in the immediate term - by the Banca Romana scandal, Giovanni Giolitti retained huge influence with senior colleagues on the national stage. Early in 1896, describing Galimberti as a man of \\"great influence in the Province of Cuneo\\", Giolitti recommended his friend for inclusion in the Rudin√¨ government. On 10 March 1896 Tancredi Galimberti was included in the new government as Undersecretary in the Ministry for Public Education. He was, understandably, seen by some as \\"one of Giolitti's men\\" in the government, which lasted only for slightly more than four months. Galimberti nevertheless retained his post in the successor government (which was also led by the Marquess of Rudin√¨), remaining in office till October 1897 when his minister also resigned. While Rudin√¨ remained in power Galimberti remained broadly supportive of the government. It can be misleading to apply terms from Anglo-American party politics to Italian national politics during this period, but subject to the caveat that Italian politics were less rigidly structured according to party- political branding, it is not unreasonable to see Rudin√¨ as a figure of the moderate right. The 1897 Italian grain harvest was a poor one at a time when world prices for American grain were surging because of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. Tariff reductions in January 1898 were widely seen as \\"too little too late\\": the Rudini government fell in response to a rapid crescendo in street disturbances not just in the south, but also in the north of Italy. General Pelloux took over, with another new government in June 1898 following a violent police response in Milan to food riots, whereby several thousand were injured and approximately 80 people were killed. Pelloux restored order without recourse to an overt system of full-blown martial law, helped by a better harvest, and demonstrating considerable political dexterity. His government coalition included members from the moderate left, but it also contained other military men, and is widely judged by historians to have been a conservative and militarist \\"law and order\\" administration. In parliament Tancredi Galimberti opposed the Pelloux government, arguing powerfully that it was the paucity of \\"social legislation\\" that was feeding socialist propaganda in the cities and clerical hostility to the government across the country. =Minister for Posts and Telecommunications= The 1900 general election signalled a notable rise in Galimberti's political influence, and he felt able to turn down the offer to joined the short-lived Saracco government coalition as Minister for Agriculture. However, when the Zanardelli government was announced on 15 February 1901, it was apparent that Tancredi Galimberti had accepted an appointment as Minister for Postal and Telegraphic communications. At this stage he was still being identified in sources as one of the \\"Giolittiani\\". That would change over the next couple of years. Galimberti's time in charge at the Posts and Telecommunications ministry lasted till November 1903. It turned out to be the pinnacle of his political career. During this period significant differences in approach surfaced between Galimberti and his mentor, Giovanni Giolitti. Giolitti proved unforgiving, and without his backing Galimberti's political fortunes fell into an unstoppable decline, at least while Giovanni Giolitti remained a towering political presence in Italy. The Italian government in power between 1901 and 1903 is known as the Zanardelli government, but in many ways it was a government with two leaders. One was Giuseppe Zanardelli, who was terminally ill. Giovanni Giolitti, serving as the Interior Minister was the other one. In June 1903 Giolitti resigned from the government. He may have been impatient to take over from Giuseppe Zanardelli as President of the Council of Ministers As a leading member of the \\"Giolittiani\\", Galimberti was evidently expected to follow Giolitti's example promptly. He did not do so. As matters turned out Giolitti, suffered the indignity of having to await the death of the incumbent before the king invited him to form a new government. Zanardelli died on 3 November 1903. At the Ministry for Posts and Telecommunications Tancredi Galimberti was succeeded (albeit only briefly) by the poet-politician Enrico Stelluti Scala. Galimberti would never again hold ministerial office. During this period, in 1902 Tancredi Galimberti married Alice Schanzer (1873‚Äì1936). The bride was the daughter of a financier who was also a friend of Giovanni Giolitti. Her family came from Vienna, but the marriage formalities and ceremony took place in Rome. =Troubles and career reversals= In 1904, following a parliamentary investigation, the former minister Nunzio Nasi was threatened with arrest on charges of embezzlement. Nasi reacted by escaping to France and later to England. Nasi's backers - of whom there were many - insisted that he was guilty of nothing more sinister than helping himself to some of the contents of the ministerial stationery cupboard, and that the whole thing was a political pantomime orchestrated by political rivals. Either way, for a time around 1906 and 1907 the affair assumed the proportions of a scandal comparable to the Banca Romana scandal of 1893. As the matter snowballed, Galimberti found himself on the periphery of the \\"Nasi Affair\\", accused of offences relating to his period as Undersecretary for Public Education. Nothing came of those accusations. One striking aspect of it that nevertheless stood out was the failure of Giolitti to make any move in defence of his former parliamentary ally: the contrast with Galimberti's reaction over Giolitti's troubles with the Banca Romana a dozen years earlier was starkly visible. Recurring political themes in Italy during the first decade of the twentieth century on which Galimberti had conventionally \\"liberal\\" views included anticlericalism and \\"La√Øcit√©\\" (which involved enshrining separation between church and state in the country's constitution and laws). Galimberti's instincts drew him towards secularist solutions. But anticlericalism could easily be presented by opponents as sympathy for socialism, which was still an anathema to mainstream politicians and many middle class electors. Ahead of the election of the March 1909 general election he made a calculated effort to distance himself from Giolitti, presenting himself as an advocate of an informal alliance with moderate catholic voters, necessary to dissuade the liberal-conservative voters in Cuneo from voting for the emerging Socialist Party. As a personal electoral strategy it worked: it was almost certainly because he received the votes of large numbers of moderate and even moderately conservative catholic voters in the small towns and villages of the Cuneo electoral district that, for the eighth general election in succession, Galimberti was once again elected to membership of the Chamber of Deputies. Nevertheless, it cut across the shifting strategy of Giolitti, a former and future head of government who appreciated \\"loyalty\\", and who had recently been trying to find a modus vivendi with at least the \\"more moderate\\" elements in the Socialist Party. Galimberti's electoral strategy in Cuneo was at best a distraction, cementing his status as a \\"renegade Giolittiano\\". Confirmation, were it necessary, of the depth of the rupture between Galimberti and Giolitti came on 9 April 1911 when Giolitti sought a vote of confidence in another new government. Alarmed, he said, by the parliamentary preponderance of Giolitti's broadly based centre-left coalition, he voted against the formal confidence motion in it. In 1912 he led parliamentary opposition to the government's innovative and controversial creation of a nationalised life insurance monopoly. =Electoral defeat in 1913= A particularly important piece of legislation in 1912 was an electoral reform extending the right to vote to all men aged 30, without any restrictions such as the old literacy test. The right to vote was further extended to all men aged 21 and above whose income had reached a certain threshold, or who had completed elementary schooling successfully or who had undertaken military service. The number of men entitled to vote had been more than doubled, from 3¬Ω million to more than 8 million. The October 1913 General Election was the first to be conducted with the widened franchise. In Cuneo this diluted the voting weight of the groups who had become Galimberti's core voters during the previous quarter century. He also faced, in Marcello Soleri, a young energetic opponent whose liberal convictions and credentials created an overlap between the electoral appeal of the two men. Marcello Soleri had already served briefly as Mayor of Cuneo and was well known in the town. Ominously, Soleri was a loyal Giolittiano. Loyalty was mutual. If he was to win the election for a ninth time Galimberti would need to retain the support of large numbers of local catholic voters with whom he had forged close links over many years. Without unforeseen interventions these would undoubtedly have continued to support him in a contest against Soleri, whose extensive political and social network was comparatively secular and \\"modern\\" in character. Galimberti could also continue to rely on strong masonic support, which was important Cuneo and the network of villages in the region. That might have been enough to secure electoral success for Galimberti had it not been for a direct intervention from Giolittiano with Count Gentiloni, a leader of \\"Catholic Action\\", a recently launched and rapidly expanding group dedicated to reversing recent declines in the political influence of the church. In 1913 Gentiloni concluded a pact with Giovanni Giolitti which was intended to swing Catholic voters behind Giolitti's coalition in the forthcoming election. With the church under the direction of a deeply conservative pope since 1903, this would strengthen any Giolitti government's hand in the intensifying struggle against a shared enemy: Socialism. Despite the announcement of the pact, it would have been a step too far for Count Gentiloni to persuade the voters of Cuneo to back Marcello Soleri in a straight contest against Tancredi Galimberti. That was not necessary for Galimberti to lose, however. It was only necessary that catholic voters should be persuaded to abstain, which they did in large numbers. =Opposition from the wilderness= The loss of his parliamentary seat, and Giolitti's pivotal role in securing it, intensified the personal animosity between the two men. At the same time Galimberti drew closer to the socialism of Gaetano Salvemini, becoming a regular contributor to L'Unit√†, a weekly magazine which Salvemini had launched a couple of years earlier. When the great European powers went to war in July/August 1914, Galimberti emerged as a fervent interventionist. Although the Italian government held back from joining in with the war, correctly concluding that Italy was hopelessly unprepared for such a venture, on Galimberti's home turf in Piedmont a deeply embedded awareness of the colonial legacy of Austria-Hungary in northern Italy, meant that the idea entering the war on the opposite side to the Austrians was a popular one. Coincidentally it also placed Galimberti in opposition to Giolitti's resolute rejection of interventionism. Despite the popularity, at least for a few years, of his interventionist advocacy, Galimberti was unable to gain the level of financial and political support that would have been necessary to return him to the Chamber of Deputies. Among the more thoughtful of his once loyal catholic backers, many were indeed appalled by his enthusiasm for war. Nevertheless, in 1915, when Italy did indeed join the war, it was indeed in support of the French and therefore in breach of longstanding Italian treaty commitments. The Italian government had found the British territorial promises more enticing than anything the Germans had to offer. One result among many of Italian participation in the war was that the next general election did not take place till the end of 1919, by which time the social, economic and political context was undergoing significant transformation. This time Galimberti stood for election in Cuneo as a candidate representing a locally based party of \\"autonomous independent farmers\\" (\\"Partito agrario autonomo indipendente\\"), a semi-detached element in the Italian Agrarian Party. In the post-war turbulence of the times, the party succeeded in sending a member to the Chamber of Deputies, but they only attracted enough votes to provide for one member, and the name at the top of their party list for Cuneo was not that of Tancredi Galimberti. = Fascist Italy = During the confused post-war years Galimberti appeared to settle his differences with Giolitti, but any rapprochement proved short-lived. He was associated briefly with some of the grandees of \\"liberalism\\", including Antonio Salandra and Francesco Saverio Nitti, before retreating into a period of political isolation. For the first time in more than thirty years, a General election was held in 1921 in which Tancredi Galimberti was not a candidate. After 1922 it was clear to many that for the foreseeable future, Italy's destiny lay with the Fascists. Through Cesare Maria De Vecchi Galimberti began to move towards Fascism. He could see Mussolini as a defender of order and of the state, while at the same time deploring the Fascist deployment of violence and casual assaults on the constitutional order as political tools. He used the \\"Sentinella delle Alpi\\" to condemn the March on Rome at some length. Galimberti's failure to keep his reservations about the methods of Fascism to himself was undoubtedly an element in the disappointing omission of his name from the National List (of parliamentary candidates) in the 1924 General Election. Consolation came five years later, however, when he accepted nomination to The Senate. Tancredi Galimberti's final years were not spent as an activist senator. He devoted his time, instead, to studying the \\"Risorgimento\\", while supporting himself by means of his legal work. He died at Cuneo on 1 August 1939. Personal Tancredi Galimberti married the poet and literature scholar Alice Schanzer (1873‚Äì1936) in Rome in 1902. The couple's sons Carlo Enrico Galimberti who became and engineer and Tancredi Duccio Galimberti (always known as \\"Duccio\\"), a lawyer, a consistent anti- fascist and, after 1940, a partisan, were born respectively in 1904 and 1906.

However, he was unable to break the well-organised groups of Scipio Aemilianus. The Romans eventually managed to curtail his activities by assaulting his hidden raiding bases.Appian, The Punic Wars In early 148 BC, Scipio and Phameas came to an understanding, and the latter defected to the Romans, along with 2,200 of his cavalry.

He specialized in Indo-European studies. Biography Albert Richard Diebold Jr. was born in New York City, New York on January 20, 1934, the son of Albert Richard Diebold and Dorothy Orizondo. He was educated at Buckley School and Hotchkiss School. He enrolled at Yale University in 1956, receiving his PhD in 1962. He was subsequently a researcher and professor at Harvard University, University of California, Berkeley and Stanford University. Diebold joined the University of Arizona in 1974, where he retired as Professor Emeritus of Anthropology in 1992. Diebold was a linguistic anthropologist who specialized in comparative and historical Indo-European studies, theoretical linguistics, psycholinguistics and transcultural psychiatry. He was known as a world-class expert on the Indo-European languages. His The Evolution of Indo-European Nomenclature for Salmonid Fish (1985) is credited with having solved the salmon problem and having firmly shown that the linguistic evidence supports the Kurgan hypothesis, which argues in favor of a Proto-Indo-European homeland located on the Pontic- Caspian steppe. Together with Edgar C. Polom√©, Diebold co-edited the Journal of Indo-European Studies Monograph Series, which has published more than 34 monographs. Polom√© was friend of J. P. Mallory, who would eventually assume many of his duties at the journal. Diebold was deeply interested in research on Mesoamerican ethnic groups, particularly the Huave people, and contributed greatly to the survival of that people. Diebold founded and directed the Salus Mundi Foundation, which funded research on Indo-European studies. Diebold was a great fan of the Middle-earth legendarium of J. R. R. Tolkien. Diebold died in Tucson, Arizona on March 1, 2014. He was survived by a daughter and a grandson. The Diebold Professor of Comparative Philology at Oxford University is named after him.

Life Gurney was born in Norwich in 1757. Her parents were Christiana Barclay and Joseph Gurney. Her father died whilst she was four and her mother married again to her cousin John Freame who in turn died in 1770. She sorted out her own spiritual life by reading a book that was important to the Quakers, An Apology for the True Christian Divinity. It was written by Robert Barclay in 1676. Barclay was one of her ancestors. and as she read it she realised that she and Barclay were of one mind on many issues. The conclusion was that she was a Quaker and she had been trying to resist this conclusion by enjoying an enthusiastic social life. Around 1784 she had problems with a spurned suitor who was a Quaker. He refused to accept Gurney's refusal of his marriage proposal. She was ill and amongst her visitors was Mary Davis. She and Davis were bosom friends and they wanted to share a home. Through her she met her \\"parental friends\\", Richard and Rebecca Reynolds of Coalbrookdale. Mary died in childbirth in 1791 and the Reynolds became her consolation. In 1792 she was appointed as a Quaker minister and she would preach as far north as Scotland and as far south as the Scilly Isles. She is noted particularly as the person chosen to assist Elizabeth Fry when she was unsure of herself. She went to stay with Gurney in the hope that her steadying influence might assist Elizabeth as she was unsure of her future. Whilst she was staying with her Elizabeth had an important meeting with Deborah Darby who said that she saw that Elizabeth would influence people. It was at this meeting that Elizabeth realised that she was going to be a Quaker. She would later credit William Savery, Darby and Gurney with influencing her decision. Gurney died in Bath in 1828. Six years after her death her autobiography was published. Gurney had written it but had been unsure about its publication.

Designed by Akihiro Hino, Jibanyan is a cat-like Charming tribe Yo-kai who's, notably, shown a liking towards chocolate bars. Jibanyan has appeared in most Yo-kai Watch media, including the video games, the manga, and the TV-series.  Biography  Prior to becoming a Yo-kai, Jibanyan (then named Rudy) was the pet cat of a young girl named Amy. One day, Rudy was run over by a truck. As Rudy was dying, he mistakenly thought he heard that Amy was disappointed with how easily he died, which caused Rudy (who had then become the Yo-kai Jibanyan) to actively fight trucks at an intersection in Uptown Springdale in order to make it up to Amy. One day, Jibanyan meets Nate Adams while fighting trucks at an intersection. After hearing that Adams believes Jibanyan was brave for his actions, the two form a friendship. Later, Jibanyan spends the majority of his time at Adams's house. In a distant future from when the Yo-kai Watch games take place, Jibanyan is transformed into Robonyan („É≠„Éú„Éã„É£„É≥), a robotic version of himself.  Development  Jibanyan's backstory of being run over by a truck is based on an actual event experienced by Level-5's CEO and designer of Jibanyan, Akihiro Hino, when he was a child. During Jibanyan's English localization, some people at Level-5 thought that Jibanyan's backstory of being hit by a car should be changed, however, Hino refused as he thought it was crucial to Jibanyan's story. Jibanyan's future robotic self, Robonyan's, catchphrase is a reference to the T-800 Terminator from the Terminator franchise.  Merchandise and other appearances  A toy of Jibanyan at Hasbro's Yo-kai Watch space at Toy Fair in 2016. Hasbro released multiple toys featuring Jibanyan during their partnership with Level-5 from 2015 to 2016.

Darren Nakamura of Destructoid listed Jibanyan as one of the best video game characters introduced in 2015. Niconico News ranked Jibanyan as the best character voiced by Etsuko Kozakura. Destructoid's Chris Carter praised the Jibanyan T variant of Jibanyan that debuted in Yo-kai Watch Blasters 2.

History =Party founding= The party was established in September 2020, although its establishment was announced in November 2019, and postponed several times, due to technical difficulties, but also ideological disagreements within the membership of the Social Democratic Union (SDU).Partija u kojoj je Jovo Bakiƒá odlo≈æila osnivanje, Danas, 17 December 2019 Notable founders of the Party of the Radical Left include Ivan Zlatiƒá, political activist and the last leader of the SDU and Jovo Bakiƒá, recognized sociologist and a university professor. At the 12th regular Congress of the SDU, which had an electoral character, the party adopted the proposals for its new program and statute, changing the party's name to the Party of Radical Left. The twelfth Congress of the SDU represented the end of the process of uniting the various extra-parliamentary left-wing organizations gathered around the Social Democratic Union into a parliamentary struggle, which began with the invitation of the SDU in mid-2018. This process continued through joint actions of various Serbian leftist organizations and student initiatives from Belgrade and Novi Sad, against violent evictions, as well against the construction of mini-hydro power plants, during 2019 and 2020.

History Gammel Strand 40 and L√¶derstr√¶de 9 were both built in 1799‚Äì1801 for court engraver David Ahron Jacobsen after the previous buildings at the site had been destroyed in the Copenhagen Fire of 1795. Jacobsen designed all the buildings himself. The narrow courtyard was originally divided in two by a warehouse but it was demolished in 1958.

Lifecycle  Van Zuylen was the grandson of Senator Guillaume van Zuylen (1838-1924), and the fourth of the eight children of Baron Joseph van Zuylen (1871-1962) and Ang√®le van Caloen de Basseghem (1878-1973). His father also became a senator, as well as a provincial councilor and mayor of Richelle and Argenteau. His mother was the daughter of Camille van Caloen de Basseghem, mayor of Varsenare and Marie-Louise de Bie de Westvoorde, daughter of the mayor of Sint-Kruis, Jules de Bie de Westvoorde. He studied in Vis√© at the Coll√®ge Saint-Hadelin and in Li√®ge at the Coll√®ge Saint-Louis. Like his older brother Antoine (1905-1983), he went to the minor seminary in Sint-Truiden and to the major seminary in Li√®ge, where he was ordained a priest on September 11, 1932. He continued his studies at the Pontificia Universit√† Gregoriana in Rome, graduating as a Doctor of Philosophy and Licentiate in Theology and Church History. He became professor in 1936 and president in 1945 of the major seminary in Li√®ge. He became a member of the Commission for the Code of Canon Law. In 1940 he was chaplain of a regiment of armoured troops and was taken prisoner of war and held for seven months. From 1943 to early 1945, he was concerned with the work of supporting the families of prisoners of war. During the liberation of Li√®ge, he took part, as chaplain, in the activities of the Secret Army. In 1949 he became Vicar General and in 1951 Bishop Coadjutor of the Diocese of Li√®ge. Ten years later he succeeded Bishop Kerckhofs. At that time, the diocese still extended over the provinces of Li√®ge and Limburg. In 1967 Limburg became the separate diocese of Hasselt.  Bishop  He participated in the Second Vatican Council from its opening in 1962. He became a member of the Commission for the Clergy and the Laity. After the promotion of the Constitution on the Liturgy, he became a member of the Council to monitor the application of the document. In 1985 he received Pope John-Paul II in his city. Bishop van Zuylen made a great effort to put the ideals of the Council into practice in his diocese. In 1968 he founded the council of priests and in 1971 the pastoral council. From 1979 he supported the creation of parish councils and pastoral teams. He was also the first, in 1969, to ordain permanent deacons in Belgium. However, the decline in priestly vocations forced him to close the seminary in Li√®ge and to have his seminarians complete their studies elsewhere. In 1982 he reopened his seminary. He also emphasized the duties of lay people and for this purpose founded the Institut Sup√©rieur de Cat√©ch√®se et de Pastorale, in charge of training teachers of religion and catechists. In his old industrial diocese, he was deeply concerned about the deterioration of the living conditions for the workers. He encouraged Christian communities in the working class and supported worker-priests. He was outspoken on issues relating to economic recession, the closure of companies and unemployment. On May 22, 1969, he took part in the major trades unions rally that took place on the Place Saint- Lambert. In 1975 he visited the workers who occupied the workshops of Val- Saint-Lambert. Every year he took part in the Workers' March on the Tuesday of Holy Week. Van Zuylen was trilingual, being fluent in French, Dutch and Walloon, and was also able to speak German. He sometimes gave sermons or speeches in Walloon. After becoming Bishop Emeritus in March 1986, he retired to Wihou-Richelle. Among other things, he took care of the chaplaincy in a retirement home in 's-Gravenvoeren. He was buried in Saint Paul's Cathedral in Li√®ge.

History The street is believed to follow the line of a Roman road leading south-east out of Eboracum. Although it lay outside the Roman walls, it is known that there was a civilian settlement in the area. There is no evidence of occupation in the Anglian period, but in Scandinavian Jorvik, it was fully built up, mostly for industrial and commercial uses. The street was first mentioned in about 1130. In the Medieval period, it fell within the parish of St Crux, and that church was sometimes regarded as lying on the street, although it was entered from Pavement. In 1295, the York Carmelite Friary was built to the east of the street, and it was entered from a gateway near the Pavement end of Fossgate. In 1357, the Merchant Adventurer's Hall was built, set back from the street. Many of the boundaries between building plots also date from this period. In 1590, a cattle market was established on the street, held every second Thursday, and from 1632, an annual cattle fair was also held. By the 19th-century, it was being held further out of town. In 1663, the St Crux Parish Almshouse was built on the street, but it was demolished in 1935. Most of the buildings on the street were repeatedly reconstructed from the 17th- to the 19th-century, and the street was widened in 1812. A brewery operated on the street. By the 19th-century, Fossgate was regarded as one of the poorer streets in the city, and the York's Chartist Association Room was on Straker's Passage, just off the street. A Methodist Sunday school was built in 1822, and the following year, it also became an infants' school, closing in 1853. With the decline of trade along the River Foss in the 20th-century, Fossgate became less important. It is currently lined with independent shops, pubs and restaurants. Layout and architecture The north-east side of Fossgate, looking south The street runs south-east, from the junction of Pavement, Whip-Ma-Whop-Ma-Gate and Stonebow, to Foss Bridge over the River Foss. Beyond the river, it continues as Walmgate. Lady Peckett's Yard, a snickelway, runs off the south- west side of the street, while Straker's Passage and Franklin's Yard run off its north-east side. Notable buildings on the north-east side include the 17th-century 8 Fossgate; the timber-framed 15-16 Fossgate, built about 1600; and the former Electric Cinema, the city's first purpose-built cinema. On the south-west side lie 35 Fossgate, built in about 1815 as the King's Arms; the tiny Blue Bell pub; 55-56 Fossgate, built in 1796; and the 17th-century gatehouse to the Merchant Adventurer's Hall, with the hall itself hidden behind.

As is typical for peat swamp forests, this ecoregion lies between a thin strip of saltwater-affected mangroves on the coast, and freshwater swamps and lowland rainforest forest on better drained soils further inland. Because the peat soil is has relatively low nutrient levels, this ecoregion has been less used for agriculture, but burning and clearance has degraded half of the forest.  Location and description  The ecoregion stretches for about 1,000 km down the south-eastern side of Sumatra, averaging 75 km wide, and separated from the sea by only a few kilometers of mangroves. It also covers the islands of Rupat, Bengkalis, Tebing Tinggi, Rangsang, and Mendol off the northeast coast of Sumatra. The peat swamps are ombrogenous (rain fed), and form where sediments have piled up behind the tangled brush of the mangroves.  Climate  The climate of the ecoregion is Tropical rainforest climate (K√∂ppen climate classification (Af)). This climate is characterized as hot, humid, and having at least 60 mm of precipitation every month.  Flora and fauna  The soil in the ecoregion is typically over 65%, with the peat at least 50 cm thick. Biodiversity and endemism of plants is relatively low, due to the specialized conditions of the soil. Habitat type depends on the local levels of nutrients and acidity, with the edges of the swamps generally more nutrient rich than the interior. Characteristic trees of the region include (Tristania obovata), (Ploiarium alternifolium), (Polyalthia glauca), and (Stemonurus secundiflorus). Peat swamps tend to support fewer species of wildlife than richer habitat; there are no endemic mammals in this ecoregion, and relatively few species of birds. Land clearance for development, particularly in the south, is putting more pressure on the peat swamp forests.  Protected areas  Over 7% of the ecoregion is officially protected.

She helped develop one of the first in-vitro translation systems, using rabbit reticulocyte lysate to study protein synthesis (a process called translation) in a cell-free context. This allowed her to make a number of contributions to the field including providing some of the first direct evidence for the existence of messenger RNA (mRNA) as a protein template, as well as the existence of polyribosomes (aka polysomes) (multiple ribosomes translating on the same mRNA).  Early life and education  Lamfrom was born into a Jewish family in Augsburg, Germany in 1922, the eldest of three sisters (Gertrude (Gert) Boyle and Eva). Her family fled Germany in 1937, when she was 15, and established themselves in Portland, Oregon. Her father, who had owned a shirt factory in Germany bought a small hat and cap company that the family grew into Columbia Sportswear. Her sister Gert Boyle would later run the company and become an entrepreneurial icon, later donating large amounts of money to cancer research in her sister's honor. Hiledgard graduated from Grant High School in Portland. She then attended Reed College and financed her education by working in shipyards as a welder. She earned a BA in biology from Reed and did research on avian malaria with Ralph Macy. She then earned an MA from Oregon State University. She was accepted to Western Reserve (now Case Western Reserve University)'s medical school, but decided to focus on research. She studied the renin system with pathologist Harry Goldblatt at Case Western and earned her PhD in 1949.  Career  Lamfrom went with her PhD advisor Harry Goldblatt to Cedars of Lebanon Hospital in Los Angeles. There, she continued to research the renin system for five more years. In 1955 went to study at Copenhagen's Carlsberg Laboratory on an American Heart Association Fellowship, working in Linderstrom-Lang's department. In 1958 she moved to Caltech where she did research with Henry Borsook. Here at Caltech, with Richard Schweet, she was able to help work out an in vitro system for studying hemoglobin synthesis in rabbit reticulocyte lysate. From 1962 to 1965 she continued research on protein synthesis at the MRC Laboratory in Cambridge, England, working with Francis Crick and Sydney Brenner. She then went to work at the Institut de Biologie Physico-Chimique in Paris (1965-1967). She went on to collaborate with her close friend Anand Sarabhai at the Institute of Molecular Biology in Eugene, Oregon from 1967-1970. The pair then researched in UCSD's chemistry department, where they collaborated with John Abelson to study tRNA synthesis. In the 1970's Lamfrom and Sarabhai spent extended periods of time in India and established a research laboratory called Biocenter. The last two years of her career were spent at Harvard Medical School, working with Tom Benjamin studying the involvement of middle T-antigen in tumor induction.  Research  The beginning of Lamfrom's career was spent studying the renin- antirenin system with pathologist Harry Goldblatt. She then shifted to studying protein synthesis. Working with Richard Schweet at Caltech, and later with Paul Knopf at MRC, she helped develop one of the first in-vitro translation systems, using rabbit reticulocyte lysate to study protein synthesis (a process called translation) in a cell-free context. This allowed her to make a number of contributions to the field. By mixing components of different animal cells, and showing that sheep ribosomes (protein-making complexes) could make rabbit hemoglobin and vice versa, she provided some of the first direct experimental evidence for the existence of messenger RNA and its role in determining what protein ribosomes make. She also was one of the well as the existence of polyribosomes (aka polysomes) (multiple ribosomes translating on the same mRNA). The last two years of her career were spent at Harvard Medical School, working with Tom Benjamin studying the involvement of middle T-antigen in tumor induction.  Personal life and honors  Lamfrom met her life partner, Anand Sarabha, in India. They hosted artisans, leading to unique collaborations. Lamfrom died from a brain tumor after nine months of illness on August 28, 1984 in La Jolla, California. In 2015, Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU) named a biochemistry building in her honor. OHSU's Knight Cancer Institute provides Hildegard Lamfrom Research Scholar Awards to early-stage cancer researchers, with funding from an endowment established by her nephew, Tim Boyle, CEO of Columbia Sportswear, and his wife Mary. In 2010, her sister Gert Boyle gave an anonymous $100 million donation to the school in her sister's honor. Gert, Tim and Mary Boyle, donated $2.5 million to create the Hildegard Lamfrom Endowed Chair in Basic Science at the OHSU Knight Cancer Institute. Hildegard is remembered as an influential mentor to young scientists, including Brian Druker. In 2014, Tim and Mary donated $10 million to the Knight Cancer Institute at Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU) to create a mentorship fund in her honor.

He never became ruler during his lifetime, but after Fu JiƒÅn killed Fu Sheng and took the throne in 357, he was honored as Emperor Wenhuan.  Service under Pu/Fu Hong  Pu Xiong was the second child to the Di chieftain and Later Zhao general, Pu Hong. From a young age, he had a liking for military scriptures and was also good at riding and shooting. However, he was also described as ugly, having short feet and a big head, earning him the nickname \\"Big-headed Prancing Dragon General\\" later during his military days. He would often use his political skills to have commoners he believed were talented to serve in the Zhao government.

It is based on Coriolanus by William Shakespeare, portraying the life of the Roman general Gaius Marcius Coriolanus. Written in the wake of the 1715 Jacobite Rebellion, it was intended by the Whig Dennis as a patriotic defence of the Hanoverian Succession by drawing parallels with Coriolanus's shift from loyal commander to rebel leader to the contemporary situation. Originally scheduled to be staged in late 1718, it was delayed for almost a year partly due to a desire not to compete with a run of Shakespeare's Coriolanus at the rival Lincoln's Inn Fields Theatre. When it finally opened it lasted just three nights and was not a success. The leading role of Coriolanus was played by Barton Booth with John Mills, Thomas Walker, John Corey, William Wilks and Mary Porter also in the cast. Dennis was furious with what he considered the mishandling of the play by the managers of the Drury Lane Theatre. When he published it shortly afterwards he dedicated it to the Lord Chamberlain the Duke of Newcastle who was also critical of the leadership at Drury Lane, which had supported the opposition Whigs against the Stanhope government, Dennis also made reference to both the 1717 Swedish Jacobite plot and the 1719 Rebellion in Scotland, and suggested a \\"conspiracy\\" to prevent his play's performance.

He played leading roles in early American literary institutions such as The Portico and the Delphian Club and in early American medical institutions such as The Baltimore Medical and Physical Recorder and The Maryland State Medical Society. He served as Assistant Surgeon General of the United States Army, Secretary to the Spanish Commission following the Adams‚ÄìOn√≠s Treaty, and Fourth Auditor of the United States Treasury. The Supreme Court decisions connected to his conviction for embezzlement are relevant to the legal history of the writ of habeas corpus in the US. Education and medical career Tobias Watkins was born on December 12, 1780 in Anne Arundel County, Maryland. He graduated from St. John's College in Annapolis, Maryland in 1798 and received earned a Doctorate of Medicine from a Philadelphia medical college in 1802. Concurrently, Watkins served as an assistant surgeon in the United States Navy between 1799 and 1801. Watkins opened his first private medical practice in Havre de Grace, Maryland in 1803, but moved it shortly thereafter to Baltimore. During the War of 1812 in 1813 Watkins served as a surgeon with the 38th Army Infantry Regiment. The following year he was appointed Major Surgeon at a Marine Hospital, which he served until June 1815. After the army was reorganized following the war, Watkins was appointed Assistant Surgeon General of the United States Army in 1818 under Joseph Lovell and assigned to inspect the medical staff and facilities of the Army Division of the North. Between May and October of that year he traveled as far north as Castine, Maine, as far south as Annapolis, Maryland, and as far west as Niagara Falls, New York. The army reorganized again in 1821 and Watkins returned to private medical practice upon honorable discharge. In 1826 he delivered the anniversary discourse before the Columbian College of Arts and Sciences. Editorship and writing The Portico, co- founded by Watkins in 1816 Watkins founded Maryland's first, and the US's fifth, medical journal, The Baltimore Medical and Physical Recorder, which he edited and published monthly from April 1808 through its final issue in August 1809. The first volume included more than eighty articles on \\"every conceivable subject,\\" including the recently recognized treatment for smallpox by vaccination. In 1816 he co-founded The Portico: A Repository of Science & Literature, in which he published several medical works he translated from French as well as his own literary essays until its final issue in 1818. Before The Portico he published literary essays on Lord Byron in a Philadelphia newspaper edited by his brother in-law, Stephen Simpson. He published the Philadelphia essays under the pen name \\"A.,\\" which many readers misunderstood to refer to historian Paul Allen. The Portico was closely associated with the Delphian Club, which Watkins co-founded with John Neal, John Pierpont, and four other men in Baltimore in 1816 and that disbanded in 1825. Shortly after establishment, Watkins served as the club's president, referred to as the \\"Tripod,\\" and earned the nickname \\"Pertinax Particular.\\" In 1821 he published Tales of the Tripod; Or A Delphian Evening under this nickname, a collection of three stories, two of which are about fellow Delphian Paul Allen. The Delphian Club brought him into association with other eccentric Baltimore professionals of law, literature, art, and medicine at a time when the city was the third largest in the US. Watkins helped John Neal publish his first novel in 1817 and also worked with Neal in 1819 to write most of the History of the American Revolution, otherwise attributed to fellow Delphian Paul Allen. John Neal took over for Watkins as editor of the last issue of The Portico when Watkins left Baltimore on his 1818 tour as Assistant Surgeon General of the army. Political appointments and prosecution Translation by Watkins of Luis de On√≠s's report from his time on the Spanish Commission Tobias Watkins was a close friend of John Quincy Adams, who, as Secretary of State under US President James Monroe, secured Watkins an appointment as Secretary to the Spanish Commission. This commission handled American claims against Spain following the Adams‚ÄìOn√≠s Treaty of 1819 that resulted in Spain's cession of Florida to the US. Part of his work on the commission involved translating from Spanish Luis de On√≠s's 152-page memoir on the diplomatic negotiation, which was published in English in 1821. When the Spanish Commission disbanded in 1824, Adams secured Watkins an appointment as Fourth Auditor of the United States Treasury, which he served through the Adams presidency until 1829. As Fourth Auditor he embezzled money from the treasury, a common crime in this period. Upon assuming office in 1829, President Andrew Jackson replaced Watkins with Amos Kendall, who discovered Watkins had embezzled $3,050. Jackson assigned Attorney General John M. Berrien to prosecute Watkins, who secured a conviction for perjury and misappropriation of public funds. Watkins was sentenced to nine months in prison and a fine equal to his embezzlement, but his sentence was extended two years for inability to pay his fine. Watkins's trial attracted considerable public attention and was an embarrassment to President Adams, who commented, \\"That an officer under my administration, and appointed partly at my recommendation, should have embezzled any part of the public moneys is a deeper affliction to me than almost anything else that has happened; that he was personally and warmly my friend aggravates the calamity.\\" In 1830 and 1833 Watkins made two unsuccessful appeals in the Supreme Court challenging the district court's criminal jurisdiction in his conviction. The resulting opinions by Chief Justice John Marshall documented in Ex parte Watkins are relevant to the legal history of the writ of habeas corpus in the US. While serving his sentence, Jackson ordered a sign attached above the door to Watkins's cell labeled \\"Criminal's Apartment.\\" He was released in 1833. Freemasonry Watkins joined Washington Lodge Number 3 of the Freemasons in 1805 and served as Deputy Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Maryland 1809-1813 and Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Maryland 1813-1814 and 1816-1818. He was the first High Priest of the Encampment of the Knights Templar in 1812. Friend John Neal recalled that Watkins was \\"so pre-eminently popular [with the Masons] that nothing he could say or do, was ever able to shake their faith in him, or their love.\\" Personal and later life John Neal described Watkins as \\"both generous and extravagant\\" in that he \\"would sooner empty his pockets into the lap of a stranger, than pay his butcher or grocer.\\" This character trait Neal blamed for what he saw as Watkins \\"always laboring under embarrassment, up to the day of his death,\\" citing that at the time of his appointment to the US Spanish Diplomatic Commission he was on the break of economic ruin by his own mismanagement of his family's funds. In the 1840s, Watkins served as head of the boys' common school in the Fourth Presbyterian Church in Alexandria, Virginia. In 1849 he co-founded and served as the first Vice President of the Columbian Association of Teachers, an organization with over 100 members. Watkins died on November 14, 1855 in Washington, D.C.

El Houma has been in the centre of several sociologist studies, due to its importance in shaping and showcasing the lifestyle of Algerians It is equivalent to the contemporary concepts of sustainable community and socially sustainable neighbourhood that are based on local socio-cultural practices . It is a socio-spatial product defined by the fact of living, playing and socialising in a shared built environment, which in turn groups local residents around a common identity of belonging to the same of area of living. Hence, El Houma is not used to refer to any typical neighbourhood or area of living that only houses people, but it indicates an urban area in which frequent social use of space emanates high degree of social cohesion, solidarity, trust, intricate social ties, place attachment and sense of belonging .  Etymology  The word Houma is specific to Maghribi Arabic and is only used in the Maghreb. \\"El\\" is the Arabic definite article equivalent to ‚Äúthe‚Äù in English, whereas, the word \\"Houma\\" originates from the Arabic word ‚ÄòHA-WA-MA‚Äô meaning an environment; a circular perimeter within one‚Äôs field of vision. It also connotes a quarter, a section of a city, a main body, main part, density of an area. The word ‚ÄòEl Houma‚Äô is used by residents of Algeria to refer to their area of living; the word is pronounced differently across the country, informed by the accent of each region. In Algiers, residents pronounce it ‚ÄòHouma‚Äô or ‚ÄòH√ªma‚Äô which is the most common pronunciation, and both terms can be found in written archive that dates back to Ottoman era, whilst, people in the eastern and western parts of Algeria, pronounce it ‚ÄòHawma‚Äô.  Origin of el Houma  The origin of El Houma is believed to go back to the first settlements in Algiers, and evolved during the Medieval ages, where residential quarters were a place of production and reproduction of local society. At the time, the town was compact and formed of many enclosed quarters that were close-knit and inhabited by homogenous communities formed of people from the same tribe, family, religion, clan, profession (poetry, jewellery‚Ä¶), all of which contributed to create strong degree of social cohesion between residents, and intricate social ties. Social life in these quarters was intense as every Houma sustained itself through a moderate mix of uses to satisfy residents‚Äô daily needs while also ensuring privacy and maintaining a separation between the hustle of public and private areas. Every Houma had the essential amenities nearby; its own mosque and bakery, Koran school, fountains, stalls, Hammam (bath) and a small market. Every Houma was under the administrative responsibility of a religious chief / qadis (judge) often called Sheikh, who was usually an old, noble and wise man from the quarter, acting as an informal government body; to solve problems and conflicts between people and give blessings for marriages, etc. The streets were constantly cleaned by residents, as they were a playground area for children, and social life in these quarters engendered a great sense of community as residents shared mutual rights and duties, and thus the term Houma was given to every neighbourhood that has strong social relations between residents and represented a sustainable way of life of people. Thus, the word for neighbourhood in Algeria was -and still is- ‚ÄòEl Houma‚Äô to refer to a neighbourhood characterised by such strong social relations between residentsand intense organic urban life.  Significance and relevance of El Houma  Although El Houma has no administrative definition or official recognition in planning policies of Algeria, it constitutes an important component of the city‚Äôs organisation and a vital part in the lifestyle of people. In Algiers, the literal translation of wash hiya Houmtek? - Where do you live? - Is ‚Äúwhich is your Houma?‚Äù In this regard, the term ‚ÄúHouma‚Äù refers to living together in an area . My Houma refers to one‚Äôs area of residence, and the relations and experiences they share with their neighbours and playmates. These social relations grow with local children and are strengthened through time and continuous social interaction. As adults, they recognise each other during gatherings and receptions, for example, when a member of El Houma gets married, usually he invites his neighbours (other members of his Houma) to share a meal and attend a ceremony. Similarly, when someone dies, members of el Houma show their support and solidarity by attending the funeral and gather around their house When People say they no longer have a Houma, is when they lose contact with their neighbours and friends in their area of residence and not when they are homeless, or when they move to a new neighbourhood and struggle to create social relations with their new neighbours. El Houma is a local manifestation of social life through social use of urban spaces; members of El Houma share social relations, rights and duties and belong to a community that is based on neighbourhood relationships rather than just family ties. Members of El Houma feels a strong sense of belonging and allow themselves to use the space to practice their daily life and practice activities like chatting, resting, playing football, playing cards or dominos, informal street vending, occupying streets and public spaces to celebrate weddings‚Ä¶  References  Category:Maghrebi Arabic Category:Neighbourhood of Algiers Category:Populated places in Algeria ","title":"El Houma"},{"id":"65251905","text":"Mogulu is a populated place in the Western Province of Papua New Guinea.

She was known as Duchess Dou or Lady Dou throughout her lifetime, and was the wife of Emperor Gaozu and mother of Emperor Taizong. Background Lady Dou was the daughter of Dou Yi and Princess Xiangyang. Dou Yi was the son of Dou Chi (Á´áÁÜæ), a high-level official for both Northern Zhou and later Sui. Dou Yi also had a brother named Dou Wei, a scribe for Yang Xiu, the Prince of Shu, who later served as chancellor during the early years of the Tang dynasty. Her mother Princess Xiangyang was the fifth daughter of Yuwen Tai, Emperor Wen of Northern Zhou, and the sister of Empress Yuwen.

Lanham, Toronto, Plymouth: The Scarecrow Press, p. 26, . As a young child, Lady Dou was raised in the palace and particularly favored by her uncle Yuwen Yong, Emperor Wu. She once recommended Yuwen Yong to establish a relationship between Northern Zhou and Tujue through the Heqin system. As a result, Yuwen Yong married Empress Ashina, the daughter of Muqan Qaghan. Yuwen Yong didn't favor Empress Ashina at first, but agreed after Lady Dou and her father reminded him of Tujue's power and that he still had to face the rivaling neighbor kingdoms Northern Qi and Chen Dynasty.Bo Yang. Modern Chinese Edition of Zizhi Tongjian. Taipei: Yuan-Liou Publishing Co. Ltd, vol. 1 to vol. 72 Lady Dou persuaded the general Zhangsun Sheng (Èï∑Â≠´Êôü) to form a marriage alliance with the Tang household. Zhangsun Sheng's son Zhangsun Wuji would later become a prominent official and daughter Lady Zhangsun would become Lady Dou's daughter-in-law. After Yang Jian overthrew the Yuwen family and established the Sui Dynasty, Lady Dou lamented that she wasn't able to help her uncle and cousins. Her parents Dou Yi and Princess Xiangyang cautioned her to keep her mouth shut to live. Duchess As Lady Dou grew older, Dou Yi told Princess Xiangyang to marry their daughter to a wise and intelligent gentleman. Dou Yi placed two peacocks between an armorial screen and let the proposers shoot two arrows. The proposer who could shoot two arrows on the peacock's eye would be married to Lady Dou. Several proposers failed, except for a man named Li Yuan. Lady Dou and Li Yuan were married, and Li Yuan would later become the founding Emperor of the Tang Dynasty. Lady Dou and Li Yuan were deeply in love and accompanied each other everywhere. Since Lady Dou grew up in the palace, she was familiar with politics and history books. She assisted her husband in his studies and raised their children. They had four sons, Li Jiancheng, Li Shimin, Li Xuanba, and Li Yuanji, and one daughter who would become Princess Pingyang. Lady Dou established a close bond with her mother-in-law, Lady Dugu. Lady Dugu was the daughter of the prominent general Dugu Xin, and the sister of two Empresses from different dynasties, Empress Dugu and Dugu Qieluo. Li Yuan's father Li Bing had died early, leaving Lady Dugu in charge of the Li household. Lady Dugu suffered from poor health, and Lady Dou assisted her mother-in-law in managing household affairs. Once, Lady Dugu was extremely sick and due to her reckless personality, several of her daughter-in-laws refused to assist her. Only Lady Dou cared for Lady Dugu, and Lady Dugu recovered after a month. Lady Dugu was grateful and favored Lady Dou. Lady Dou passed away at the age of 45. After Li Yuan overthrew the Sui Dynasty and established the Tang Dynasty, he honored Lady Dou as Empress Mu (Á©ÜÁöáÂêé).

A child of indigenous Quechua farmworkers, Machaca learned to read and became a literacy advocate. She coordinated community aid efforts and worked to empower women through forming mothers' clubs. In 1980, she was involved in the founding of the Bartolina Sisa Confederation, the primary union organization of peasant women in Bolivia. Later that year, she was imprisoned and tortured for her social activism, and she was forced to flee the country. After a stay in Cuba, she returned to Bolivia and studied to become a paramedic. In 2005, she was nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize as part of PeaceWomen Across the Globe's initiative to nominate a group of 1,000 women for that year's honor.  Biography  Nicolasa Machaca Alejandro was born in 1952 in the Bolivian municipality of Poop√≥. She grew up in a farming family, which raised sheep and cows and planted potatoes and fava beans. Machaca did not begin school until age 10, and she was bullied for being so much older than her classmates, so she dropped out shortly after enrolling. However, a few years later, she learned to read and began leading literacy courses in her community. She also became involved in the community's Mothers' Club, although she was not yet a mother herself. Machaca began meeting provincial leaders and forming a network there, and in 1974 she represented Kurawara, her ayllu (indigenous community), at the Congress of Peasant Women in Oruro. In 1977, Machaca left Kurawara and settled in Oruro, having been chosen to oversee programs for women in her province. In 1980, she came to be considered a threat to the regime of Lu√≠s Garc√≠a Meza, and one night she was taken by military forces and imprisoned in the Oruro jail. After two months of imprisonment, interrogation, and torture, in early 1981 Machaca's body was thrown in the cab of a truck and she was brought to Obispo Santistevan Province, where they left her. She managed to find another truck to bring her to La Paz. She took refuge in the house of a fellow activist, who found a doctor and helped her flee the country. She traveled to Cuba via Lima, and in Havana she was brought to the hospital. Her condition was critical, and it was feared that she would have to have both legs amputated, but the doctors managed to save them. Machaca stayed in Cuba for a year and a half, returning to Bolivia after Garc√≠a Meza was ousted. She continued her activist work and worked for Radio P√≠o XII in Oruro. In 1985, she enrolled in the Instituto Polit√©cnico Tom√°s Katari, graduating as a paramedic. She went on to lead projects at that institution to bring medical staff to remote communities. As a founding member of the Bartolina Sisa Confederation, Machaca continued her union activism, but she paired it with work on social services. She was among the 1,000 women nominated by PeaceWomen Across the Globe for the 2005 Nobel Peace Prize. In 2011, she was named the first president of the \\"Juana Azurduy\\" Social Organization of Quechua Women, which aims to empower women in peri- urban neighborhoods of Sucre.  Personal life  In 1991, she married Benjam√≠n Cu√©llar, whom she met during her work providing medical services to communities in Potos√≠ Department. The couple moved to Sucre, where they raised their three children: Rosa, Ernesto, and Carmen Julia.  Bibliography  * Machaca, Nicolasa. (1999). Nicolasa Machaca : una mujer que desafi√≥ a su destino.

The term porostromate is also used as a descriptor of textures and microstructure of stromatolites and oncolites which contain tubules or other cellular structures. The group was defined by Pia (1927) as containing calcareous algae bearing calcified tubules; these may run parallel to the growth surface as in Girvanella, Sphaerocodium or perpendicular, as in Hedstroemia, Ortonella, and Mitcheldaenia; however, in 1937 Pia restricted the group to only Girvanella and Sphaerocodium, placing the other genera in the Codiaceae. In reality it seems that most or all of the species included in \\"Porostromata\\" represent fossils of cyanobacteria. Monty (1981) advocated continued use of porostramata in an informal sense to describe a habit and structure of bacterial colonies, rather than in a taxonomic sense. He defined a \\"porostromate\\" microstructure as follows: > \\"Porostromate microstructures are defined by the growth of loose or tangled, > vertical, flabellate or flat-lying, straight or sinuous calcified filaments > or threads, or even of calcified unicells.\\" Porostromate stromatolites and oncolites are mostly absent throughout the Proterozoic, with calcified filaments apparently first appearing in the uppermost Precambrian. They then persist throughout the entire Phanerozoic, though from the Eocene and beyond they are only known from freshwater environments. Stromatolites and oncolites not bearing clear cellular structures are referred to as \\"spongiostromate\\"; throughout geologic history they seem to have always vastly outnumbered porostromate forms.

The sandstones, siltstones and conglomerates were deposited in an alluvial environment.Silveirinha Formation at Fossilworks.org The formation has provided fossils of many mammals, birds, amphibians and reptiles, as well as mollusks and ostracods, and is considered one of the richest Early Eocene faunal assemblages of Europe. The taeniodont, typically known as a North American order; Eurodon silveirinhensis and the ostracod Cypris silveirinhaensis have been named after the formation.  Description  The Silveirinha Formation, named after the Silveirinha clay pit, crops out in the western part of the Mondego Basin in the Regi√£o Centro of central-western Portugal.De la Pe√±a, 1995, p.30 The formation comprises fossiliferous lenticular calcitic conglomerates as well as laminated and cross bedded sands and brownish-red silts. The conglomerates are interpreted as crevasse-splay deposit in a alluvial plain environment, which eventually flooded and where bogs and possibly oxbows developed, crossed by channels depending on a river system that drained higher areas more north or eastwards.Antunes, 2003, p.20 = Climate = The climate in the Early Eocene was substantially warmer than today.  Paleontological significance  The Silveirinha clay pit after which the formation is named was first discovered in 1977 by Rui Pena dos Reis of Coimbra University. The unit is one of few earliest Eocene fossiliferous formations that provided a rich amphibian and reptile fauna.Rage & Aug√©, 2003, p.103 Most fossils were deposited in the channels after short transportation. Vegetation should have been rich in nearby areas, supporting a rich fauna. Ostracods, gastropods, amphibians and pelomedusid chelonians indicate fresh waters, although rare bivalves show that salt or at least brackish waters were not very far away. It is hypothesized that the species D. antunesi in the genus Diacodexis was more primitive than the earliest Wasatchian D. ilicis of North America, strongly supporting a Europe to America dispersal of this genus.Godinot & De Lapparent, 2003, p.262 = Fossil content = The formation has provided the following fossils:  Mammals  ;Primates * Arcius zbyszewskii * Donrussellia lusitanica ;Acreodi * Mondegodon eutrigonusTabuce et al., 2011, p.146 ;Artiodactyls * Diacodexis antunesiEstrav√≠s & Russell, 1989 ;Carnivora * cf.

Early life  Snook was born on 3 February 1861 at Belle Vue, St Julian, Shrewsbury, to Mary (formerly Corfield) and George Snook. His father was a quarry owner and highway surveyor. Snook attended Admaston College. The 1881 census has him at West View House, Copthone, Shrewsbury, with his parents, maternal grandmother and three younger sisters. His occupation is given as \\"clerk\\". An obituary in the Shrewsbury Chronicle of 23 April 1917 notes that he was tall, with a chest.  Career  Snook's earliest recorded athletic success was a third place in a quarter-mile race for under-18s at an 1877 Wenlock Olympians meeting, when he ran for Pengwern Boat Club. In 1879, he won a half-mile handicap race at the same venue, but it was becoming clear that his aptitude was for the stamina of long-distance races, not the speed of sprinting. In the same year he won six of the eight one-mile races he entered. He was invited to join Moseley Harriers, in Birmingham, where his team mate, and rival in individual events, was Walter George. By early 1885 he had joined Birchfield Harriers, also in Birmingham. In July 1881 he visited Paris, where he won a private race against M. Duplay, an army officer and racehorse owner, in the . From August 1882 until the end of that year, he was suspended from AAA events, as the result of an allegation - which he denied - that he had been complicit in a professional runner competing as an amateur, under an assumed name. He won the Amateur Athletics Association (AAA) one-, four- and ten-mile titles in 1883, and in 1885. William Snook On 6 March 1886, he came second in a cross-country race at Croydon. There was much betting on the outcome, and the Southern branch of the AAA accused him of \\"roping\\" - taking a bribe to throw the race - and the AAA banned him from their events, for life. He protested his innocence, but - despite there being only circumstantial evidence - his appeal was rejected by a 15:11 vote. A second appeal, in February 1887, supported by the Midlands branch of the AAA, and a petition signed by over 300 athletic club representatives, was denied by 13:12, but referred to the organisation's Annual General Meeting, where his final attempt to clear his name was rebuffed by a 26:16 vote. He turned professional and ran competitively for another three years, also managing public houses. From 1885 to 1887 he managed The Criterion in High Street, Shrewsbury, and from 1888 to 1890 The Old Stone Cross in Dale End, Birmingham. In April 1890 he was also associated with The Vine in Alma Street, Birmingham. He subsequently moved to France to work as a running and cycling coach. In October 1904, he met members of the Birchfield Harriers, when they visited Paris.  Allegation of theft  While living in Levallois-Perret a town just outside Paris, in September 1895, Snook was tried for the distraction-theft of bonds from a customer in a branch of the bank , . Morny had been robbed by three Englishmen. One of them, Snook's co-defendant and landlord, Matthew Parry (alias Clifford), was convicted and sentenced to five years in prison, after an envelope bearing his address was left at the scene, but Snook was acquitted for lack of evidence.  Personal life, death  Snook married Elizabeth Jane, n√©e Coleman, on 9 August 1884 at St. John's, Toxteth, Liverpool. Their two children, a son and a daughter, each lived only a few months. They separated, and she sued for divorce in 1892 (the case being heard before Francis Jeune) on the grounds of his cruelty, and his adultery with her cousin, who bore him a daughter in January 1892. She became aware of Snook's infidelity when he was called as a witness in a May 1891 trial brought because the cousin had had a (then-illegal) abortion, and admitted the affair. She also said that he had often beaten her, that he had dragged her down stairs by her hair, and that he had fired a revolver in her bedroom, in an attempt to frighten her. Snook did not contest the allegations, nor defend the case, and the divorce was granted, becoming absolute on 31 January 1893. Elizabeth died on 10 February 1900, and was buried at Shrewsbury's General Cemetery. During 1916, Snook's health deteriorated, and he was hospitalised in Paris. This was not ideal, as the First World War was in progress, with fighting just away. An appeal for funds was held in England, from April that year, by the Birmingham-based newspaper Sport & Play and Wheel, attracting many donations from his former teammates, and competitors, and other athletes. The funds enabled Snook's return to Birmingham in October. Being desperately short of money, he initially lodged in Rowton House, a low-rent hostel. After he died in Birmingham Workhouse, Erdington's infirmary on 9 December 1916, his funeral was paid for by his former club, Birchfield Harriers. He was buried in a communal grave at Witton Cemetery on 17 December. He was survived by three sisters. A younger brother pre-deceased him.

After winning his only race as a two-year-old in 2018 he improved in the following year to win the Surrey Stakes and went on to be placed in the Jersey Stakes, Prix Jean Prat and Prix Maurice de Gheest. He was even better as a four-year old in 2020, winning the Spring Trophy, Prix de la Porte Maillot, Lennox Stakes and Prix Maurice de Gheest. Background Space Blues is a chestnut horse with no white markings bred in Ireland his owners, the Godolphin organisation. He was sent into training with Charlie Appleby at Newmarket, Suffolk. He was from the tenth crop of foals sired by Dubawi, whose wins included the Irish 2,000 Guineas and the Prix Jacques Le Marois. At stud, Dubawi has been a highly successful breeding stallion, siring major winners such as Ghaiyyath, Monterosso, Al Kazeem, Makfi, Old Persian, Lucky Nine and Night of Thunder. Space Blues's dam Miss Lucifer showed top-class racing ability, winning three races including the Challenge Stakes, and became a successful broodmare whose other foals included the Al Maktoum Challenge, Round 1 winner Shurooq. She was a great-granddaughter of the British broodmare Sunbittern, whose other descendants have included In The Wings, High-Rise, Virginia Waters and Dubawi. Racing career =2018: two-year-old season= On his first and only appearance as a two-year-old, Space Blues started 2/1 second favourite for a maiden race over eight and a half furlongs on good to soft ground at Nottingham Racecourse on 7 November. Ridden by James Doyle he took the lead a furlong from the finish and won in \\"impressive\\" style by two and a quarter lengths from the favoured Private Secretary with Technician taking third place. =2019: three-year-old season= On his first two starts of 2019 Space Blues was partnered by William Buick. He ran fourth when favourite for a minor race over ten furlongs at Newbury Racecourse on 12 April and was then beaten a head by Fifth Position when going off at odds of 1/3 for a similar event at Nottingham eighteen days later. Doyle took the ride when the colt was assigned top weight of 133 pounds for a handicap race over seven furlongs at York Racecourse on 15 May. He started the 5/2 favourite and despite being repeatedly denied a clear run in the last quarter mile he gained the advantage in the closing stages and sprinted clear to win by two lengths. Sixteen days after his win at York Space Blues was stepped up in class to contested the Listed Surrey Stakes over the same distance at Epsom Racecourse and went off the 6/5 favourite against six opponents. With Doyle again in the saddle he took the lead approaching the final furlong and held off the late challenge of Urban Icon to win by a neck. At Royal Ascot on 22 June Space Blues started favourite for the Group 3 Jersey Stakes but after taking the lead inside the final furlong he was overtaken in the closing stages and was beaten a head by the 25/1 outsider Space Traveller. On 7 July he was sent to France to contest the Group 1 Prix Jean Prat over 1400 metres at Deauville Racecourse and finished second of the twelve runners behind the odds-on favourite Too Darn Hot. At the same track on 4 August he started at odds of 5.8/1 for the Prix Maurice de Gheest over 1300 metres and came home third, beaten a neck and three quarters of a length by Advertise and Brando. =2020: four-year-old season= In the early part of 2020 Space Blues was sent to Godolphin's winter base in Dubai but made only one disappointing start at Meydan Racecourse on 7 March when he started favourite for the Group 3 Nad Al Sheba Turf Sprint but came home seventh behind Wildman Jack after hanging to the right on the left-handed track. On his return to Europe the colt started the 5/2 favourite for the Listed Spring Trophy over seven furlongs at Haydock Park on 7 June. Ridden by Doyle, he came from well off the pace to take the lead inside the final furlong and won by a neck from Safe Yoyage. Eighteen days later Space Blues was sent to France for the Group 3 Prix de la Porte Maillot over 1400 metres at Longchamp Racecourse in which he was ridden by Mickael Barzalona and started odds on favourite against seven opponents. After tracking the leaders on the inside he edged left to make his challenge in the straight, took the lead 120 metres from the finish and won \\"readily\\" by one and three quarter lengths from his stablemate D'Bai. At Goodwood Racecourse on 28 July Space Blues was partnered by Buick when he went off the 5/2 favourite for the Group 2 Lennox Stakes. His ten opponents included Safe Voyage, D'Bai, Sir Dancealot (winner of the race in 2018 and 2019), Duke of Hazzard (Celebration Mile), Maries's Diamond (Anglesey Stakes), Pierre Lapin (Mill Reef Stakes) and Glorious Journey (Hungerford Stakes). After racing towards the rear of the field, Space Blues made \\"smooth progress\\" to take the lead approaching the final furlong and won \\"readily\\" by two lengths from Duke of Hazzard. After the race Charlie Appleby said \\"It was a pleasing performance. He was the class horse in the race. I always felt he travelled into it really well and he got a good run into it... William gave him a nice ride and had a nice clean run at it... He has definitely strengthened for sure.\\" On 9 August, with Buick in the saddle, Space Blues made his second attempt to win the Prix Maurice de Gheest and started the 4.4/1 second favourite behind Earthlight. The other nine runners included Golden Horde, Hello Youmzain, Wichita (runner- up in the 2000 Guineas), Wooded (Prix Texanita), Batwan (Prix de Saint- Georges), Spinning Memories (Prix du Palais-Royal) and Lope Y Fernandez (runner-up in the Prix Jean Prat). Hello Youmzain and Golden Horde disputed the early lead with Space Blues tucked away on the inside rail before making a forward move in the last 400 metres. He accelerated through a gap between the leaders, overtook Hello Youmzain 50 metres from the finish and won by three quarters of a length with Lope Y Fenandez, Earthlight and Golden Horde finishing close behind. After the race Appleby commented \\"This horse couldn't have come into the race in better shape and a better profile, with confidence behind him. Every race he has stepped up in calibre and has won more impressively. Today from halfway, I knew they'd gone a very strong gallop and I thought they were either very good horses in front or it was going to be set up for a horse that comes late\\" while Buick said \\"This horse has been threatening to put up a performance like that... He's got a great constitution. He's a Dubawi, which obviously helps, and they tend to get better with age.\\" Space Blues was emulating his distant female-line ancestor Zariba, who won the inaugural running of the race in 1922.

It is found in Asia, Africa, Melanesia, Australia, New Zealand, and South, Central, and North America. Taxonomy The lichen was originally described as a variety of Cladonia fimbriata by Finnish lichenologist Edvard August Vainio in 1894. The type specimen, collected in 1885, was found in Minas Gerais, Brazil, in the Cara√ßa Mountains, at an elevation of . German botanist Heinrich Sandstede promoted it to distinct species status in 1922. Description Cladonia subradiata has a scaly primary thallus that is small and stands erect. The podetia are whitish, measuring long, abundantly brown, rarely branched, acute or forming, tiny cups, with small scales, especially at the base. Apothecia are scarce; when present, they are reddish or brown, and spherical. In terms of lichen spot tests, Cladonia subradiata is PD+ red and K-. It contains the lichen substances protocetraric acid, fumarprotocetraric acid, ursolic acid, and the chemically uncharacterized compounds called Cph-1 and Cph-2. Cladonia subradiata has been confused with Cladonia balfourii; these species can be separated by chemistry. According to Index Fungorum, however, these species are synonymous. Habitat and distribution This species is widely distributed in Central and South America, extending to North Carolina in North America. In South America the lichen has been collected from Brazil, Chile, Argentina, Paraguay, and Guyana. It has also been recorded from Asia, Africa, Papua New Guinea, New Caledonia, Australia, and New Zealand. Cladonia subradiata grows in primary montane rainforests, preferring substrates such as humus and boulders.

It is found in the Philippines and Malaysia. This species was first described in 1843 by the English zoologist George Robert Gray, who gave it the name Phyllium bilobatum. It has been assigned to the subgenus Phyllium, which is to be distinguished from the second subgenus Pulchriphyllium, within the genus Phyllium. The holotype is a female from the Philippines, which is kept in the Natural History Museum, London where Gray worked cataloguing insects. Distribution Phyllium bilobatum occurs in the Philippines and Malaysia. The Malaysian records, however, might represent other species. Description Phyllium bilobatum grows to a length of about . Like other leaf insects it is well camouflaged, mimicking a leaf; the general colour is mid-green, the wings being patterned by dark lines, arranged to resemble the veins of a leaf, and the limbs having large flanges or flap-like extensions. The female has a broad body while the body of the male is slender. The single pair of wings lie flat on the insect's back, and only the adult male can fly. The abdomen of the female is narrow where it joins the thorax, with the second and third segments being wider than the one in front and the fourth and fifth narrowing again. The sixth and seventh segments are lobed, and the remaining segments narrow abruptly to the tip of the abdomen. The femur of the first pair of legs has a flange on both the front and the back, the inner side being smooth while the outer side is toothed. The tibia is also flanged. The second and third pairs of legs also have flanges. Ecology Leaf insects are herbivorous, feeding mainly on the leaves of trees and shrubs. They are hemimetabolous, the eggs hatching into nymphs which pass through a number of moults as they grow, but do not undergo metamorphosis. Young nymphs tend to hide in withered leaves, which at this stage they resemble more closely in colour than they do green foliage. Both sexes of this species have glands on the prothorax, from which they spray an unpleasant-smelling defensive secretion when disturbed.

She has worked to promote the recognition of Haitian Creole as a valid language in its own right. Chancy is a founding member of the Haitian Creole Academy and served as Haiti's minister for the feminine condition and women's rights from 2004 to 2006.  Early life  Adeline Magloire was born in 1931 in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, and grew up in the suburb of P√©tion-Ville. Her father was an architect and her mother was a teacher. Her sisters were Nicole Magloire and Denise Magloire Fouchard, both of whom also became feminist activists. Chancy studied at L'√âcole Normale Sup√©rieure, a constituent school of the Universit√© d'√âtat d'Ha√Øti, as well as at the university's law school.  Career  In the early 1960s, Chancy became an activist for democracy and women's rights under the Duvalier dictatorship, organizing with the Committee of Patriotic Women and the Unified Democratic Front. This period shaped her advocacy for Haitian Creole: Chancy was forced to go into exile with her family in 1965, and they settled in Canada, taking up residence in Montreal's Outremont neighborhood. Their home became a center of community organizing for Haitians in Montreal, as well as a haven for new arrivals from many countries. In Montreal, while pursuing a professional career in secondary education, Chancy continued her social and political activism both within the Haitian community and across Quebec society. She was chosen by the Government of Quebec to take part in a commission overseeing the implementation of immigrant integration policies. She also worked with the provincial human rights commission on issues of racism. Chancy was a pioneer in literacy efforts through the Maison d'Ha√Øti in Montreal, which she helped found, and the provincial-level literacy organization Regroupement des Groupes populaires en alphab√©tisation. She helped shape literacy and adult education policy, both directly through her teaching as well as through conferences and publications. She received a master's degree in adult education from the University of Montreal in 1981, writing her thesis on illiteracy among Haitian women immigrants. In the 1970s and 1980s, Chancy was a member of the Congress of Black Women of Canada. She also advocated for the recognition and validation of the Haitian Creole language. In 1983, she launched the first International Creole Day in Montreal, on October 28. Chancy returned to Haiti after Jean-Claude Duvalier went into exile in 1986. Since then, she has held several positions in the public sector, including training director at the National Office for Participation and Popular Education from 1986 to 1987, secretary of state for literacy from 1996 to 1997, and minister for the feminine condition and women's rights from 2004 to 2006. A noteworthy accomplishment during her time as women's minister was the July 6, 2005, declaration that recognized rape as a crime and that abolished discriminatory provisions against women in the Penal Code. She has written extensively on women's rights, literacy, and Haitian Creole. In November 2014, Chancy was named a knight of the French Legion of Honour.  Personal life  She married Max Chancy, a philosophy professor and political activist, in 1955. He died in 2002. The couple had three sons: Bernard Chancy, Jean-Pierre Chancy, and .

While serving as a colonial official in the Congo Free State, Fi√©vez became notorious for his harsh methods of enforcing rubber production in his territory, included the wide-scale oppression and killing of local Congolese. Fi√©vez's actions accrued significant coverage in the foreign press, forcing his removal from office and return to Belgium.  Biography  Fieves was born to a farming family in Wallonia, Belgium.Van Reybrouck, David. Congo: The epic history of a people. 2014. HarperCollins Publishers. Pp. 597-618. In 1888 he was recruited into the Force Publique, a military force formed to garrison Leopold II of Belgium's Congo Free State, arriving in the Congo in the town of Boma. Though the conquest of the Congo by the Belgians was well underway by 1888, Fievez quickly became noted as a particular effective soldier, successfully leading military expeditions in the upper Congo. In the late 1891 he was forced by illness to return to Belgium, but by 1893 had returned to the Congo. When the commissioner for the crown-controlled province of √âquateur, former explorer Charles Lemaire, was wounded in 1893, colonial administrations (who had been dissatisfied with Lemaire's level of rubber production) replaced him with Fievez.Alix, Florian. \\"√âric Vuillard. Congo.\\" Afrique contemporaine 4 (2014): 210-213. Upon assuming the roll of commissioner, Fievez implemented a brutal system of oppression on the local Congolese population - the intent of said policies was to intimidate local peoples into giving food and rubber to the Free State as tribute.Friedman, Hershey H., Sarah Adel, and Linda Weiser Friedman. \\"Is greed good? Learning business ethics from King Leopold II, mass murderer.\\" Learning Business Ethics from King Leopold II, Mass Murderer (June 11, 2015) (2015). As part of this campaign, Fieves and his forces (consisting of Force Publique and friendly Congolese tribesmen) force-ably requisitioned food from native Congolese, destroyed crops to cause famine, and carried out massacres to exterminate Congolese who resisted the Free State.Hochschild, Adam. King Leopold's Ghost: A Story Of Greed, Terror, And Heroism In Colonial Africa. Boston : Houghton Mifflin, 1998. Print. Pp. 166, Villages that were unwilling or unable to provide food or rubber were looted and burned. Most infamously, Fi√©vez - who was under orders to expend as little ammunition as possible - mandated that his soldiers and allies provide him with the severed hands of slain enemies to show that they had not wasted ammunition. According to oral tradition, such actions led to Fieves being described as \\"the devil of the Equator\\" and nicknamed \\"Ntange\\" (roughly translating to \\"nap\\" or \\"bed\\", as Fievez was known to nap in the afternoon).Boelaert, E. \\"Ntange.\\" Aequatoria 15, no. 2 (1952): 58-62.

His policy suppressed local resistance, allowed for his district to cut costs, and resulted in √âquateur producing the most rubber (650 tons) out of any Free State district in 1895 - a result which a Belgian government source described as \\"unequaled\\". However, Fievez's methods were increasingly seen as overly brutal and as a liability to the Free State; this issue was compounded as word of the atrocities in his district spread and were reported on by British and American missionaries working in the Congo. His position as commissioner was not renewed in 1896 and he returned to Belgium in May of that year.LUFUNGULA Lewono. \\"LES GOUVERNEURS DE L'EQUATEUR, 1885 - 1960.\\" Annales Aequatoria 7 (1986): 149-66.

Openly lesbian, Frede was the first to allow women to dance together in a classic cabaret. She is known for her relationships with actresses Marlene Dietrich, Zina Rachevsky, Lana Marconi, and Maria F√©lix. She has been featured as a character in Patrick Modiano's books.  Biography  = Debut at Monocle and meeting with Marlene Dietrich = Suzanne Jeanne Baul√© was born in Paris on 8 November 1914, to a plumassier and an insurance agent, who called her Jeannette. They lived at 19 Rue Labat, in the in the 18th arrondissement of Paris. Baul√© studied at the √âcole Duperr√© before starting to work by painting sets at the Folies Berg√®re. She became a trainer at Le Monocle, a women's nightclub located on in Paris. At this time that she adopted the pseudonym of Frede, as well as male clothing, both of which she would keep throughout her life. One evening in December 1935, at Le Monocle, she met Ana√Øs Nin. In her diary, Nin describes Frede's \\"bright\\" blue eyes, \\"round face\\", \\"little nose\\" and \\"soft features\\". It was also at Le Monocle that she met Marlene Dietrich in 1936, with whom she had a romantic affair until the war. Correspondence in the Marlene Dietrich archives in Berlin indicates that he two women remained friends until the 1970s. With the support of Dietrich, Frede left Le Monocle and opened her own female cabaret in December 1938. Located at 58 Rue Notre- Dame-de-Lorette, near Quartier Pigalle, it was named La Silhouette, after a famous women's cabaret in Berlin which Dietrich was fond of. = World War II = Shortly after the outbreak of World War II in September 1939, Frede left Paris and La Silhouette, and went on an exodus to Biarritz. In December 1939, with her partner Germaine Dupuy, she opened a night establishment, Le Touch- Wood, on Boulevard de la Grande-Plage [Big Beach Boulevard]. She remained in Biarritz until 1943, when she temporarily returned to Paris. She then worked for a while at the Triolet, , at the top of Champs-√âlys√©es, then temporarily reverted back to her Suzanne Baul√© name and hid until the end of the war with her younger brother Pierre in Voisines, Yonne. = Le Carroll's = Returning to Paris at the end of the war, Frede ran a bar in 1945-46 located at . In 1948, she was hired as director of the cabaret Le Carroll's, located at 36 , near the Champs-Elys√©es. It became one of the most chic cabarets in Paris, with shows with Charles Aznavour, Dany Dauberson, and Mouloudji. Some of the other performers recorded a 1959 record, Une soir√©e exceptionnelle au Carroll‚Äôs pr√©sent√©e par Frede. These shows attracted many personalities, particularly from the world of cinema: Brigitte Bardot, Arletty, Orson Welles, Gary Cooper, Rita Hayworth, Marlon Brando, Jean Gabin, Fran√ßoise Sagan, and Erich von Stroheim. In 1949, Frede was the first to allow women to dance together in a classical cabaret, although the law prohibited it. Little by little, she changed the atmosphere of Le Carroll's, which became a place for lesbians to meet. During this period, she maintained relationships with actresses Zina Rachewsky and Lana Marconi, the last wife Sacha Guitry. \\"I practically lived with Sacha for four years,\\" said Frede in 1974. Frede also had a passionate affair with Mexican actress Mar√≠a F√©lix. The two women met in 1950, and lived together at the Hotel George V. The relationship was captured in a painting made by Leonor Fini of a plant with two flowers; one had the face of F√©lix and the other Frede's. Frede followed F√©lix on her filming trips to Buenos Aires and S√£o Paulo, confronting F√©lix in the former upon learning of F√©lix's relationship with Carlos Thompson during the filming of La pasi√≥n desnuda. F√©lix and Frede's relationship was interrupted by F√©lix's marriage to Jorge Negrete in 1952, but upon Negrete's death the following year, F√©lix returned to Paris to briefly rekindle her relationship with Frede. However, they would violently break-up for good in 1954, leading to a trial in which F√©lix wanted to take back jewellery she had given to Frede and accused her of theft. F√©lix lost her lawsuit, and Frede was acquitted and kept the jewellery. Despite this, F√©lix held ownership of the painting Fini made of the two women, and afterwards asked Fini to modify it to erase Frede's face, painting F√©lix's face over Frede's, resulting in the painting's two flowers both having Felix's face. In 1960, the owner of Carroll's, Jacques Sicre, felt that Frede already had her day. He entrusted the establishment to a former actor, Fran√ßois Patrice, who renamed it La Licorne. Frede and her American companion, Miki Leff, created a nightclub also called Le Carroll's, at 12 Rue Sainte-Anne, the site of the former La Vie Parisienne, held before the Second World War by Suzy Solidor, and then picked up by . Here, the patrons included Salvador Dali, Mich√®le Morgan, Pauline Carton, Darryl Zanuck, and, once again, Dietrich. Suffering from leukemia, in September 1970, Frede finally sold this second Carroll's to Fabrice Emaer. She retired to her country house in Mareil-Le- Guyon. Frede died there, attended by Leff, on 13 February 1976. The France- Soir newspaper wrote in her obituary that \\"The one who, for civil status, was never more than , must be considered as one of the greatest seducers of her time.\\" She is buried in the cemetery of Mareil-le-Guyon.  Portrayal by Patrick Modiano  A woman who always dressed as a man fascinated writer Patrick Modiano, the 2014 Nobel Prize in Literature recipient whose mother knew Frede. Modiano portrayed her as a character in his novella [Suspended Sentence] and a drawing representing her illustrates the covers of the first paperback editions. He also mentioned Frede in his autobiography .

According to some scholars, Malladeva has been referred to as the \\"forgotten King of Mithila\\" as most records and traditions note that his brother Gangadeva succeeded his father as ruler of the dynasty. Nevertheless, Malladeva seems to have founded his own stronghold in the village of Bheet- Bhagwanpur in Darbhanga in modern-day Bihar, India. In the village, an inscription was found which read \\"Om Shree Malladevasya\\" and many Karnat-era sculptures have been found in the area. Malladeva has also been mentioned in the work of the poet, Vidyapati who described him as a \\"valiant warrior\\" who served in the army of King Jayachandra of Kannauj but left as his quarrelsome nature led to major disagreements and he was forced to return back to Mithila. Local tradition asserts that he was not on good terms with his brother Gangadeva. Folk tradition also asserts that the villages of Maldiha in Purnea district and Malhad in Supaul district were founded by Malladeva. The village of Bheet-Bhagwanpur is today home to a prominent family of Gandhavariya Rajputs who are considered by some to be descended from Malladeva.

The event featured television tapings for future subsequent episodes of Fusion that followed the Saturday Night SuperFight pay-per-view. Fifteen matches were taped at the event. The main event was a battle royal won by Grogan. In other prominent matches on the card, Jacob Fatu retained the MLW World Heavyweight Championship against Ross Von Erich, Alexander Hammerstone successfully defended the MLW National Openweight Championship against Douglas James and Myron Reed defeated Teddy Hart in Hart's final MLW match to win the MLW World Middleweight Championship. Prominent non-title matches including Low Ki versus Timothy Thatcher, Tom Lawlor versus Davey Boy Smith Jr. and a Falls Count Anywhere match between Mance Warner and Jimmy Havoc. Event The event kicked off with a non- televised match, in which Dr. Dax defeated Budd Henning in a quick match. =Preliminary matches= The first match to be taped for Fusion featured Low Ki taking on Timothy Thatcher. Thatcher hoisted Ki on his back and Ki capitalized by applying a rear naked choke on Thatcher making him submit to the hold. Next, Dominic Garrini and Douglas James took on The Dynasty (Alexander Hammerstone and Richard Holliday) in a tag team match. Garrini avoided a Nightmare Pendulum by Hammerstone and then James hit a meteora to Hammerstone and then delivered a Tornado DDT to Hammerstone from the apron onto the floor to knock him out which led to Hammerstone getting counted out. Next, Tom Lawlor took on Davey Boy Smith Jr. Near the end of the match, Lawlor poked in Smith's eyes but Smith recovered and attempted to hit a running powerslam but Lawlor moved out of the move and slammed on Smith's knee to pin him for the win. Next, Teddy Hart defended the World Middleweight Championship against Myron Reed. After avoiding repeated interference by Reed's Injustice teammates Jordan Oliver and Kotto Brazil, Hart executed a Hart Destroyer on Reed and covered him for the pinfall but Brazil pulled out the referee. Oliver distracted Hart, which allowed Josef Samael to throw a fireball into Hart's face and Reed executed a springboard 450¬∞ splash on Hart to win the title. Next, Marshall Von Erich took on Contra Unit member Ikuro Kwon. Kwon's teammate Josef Samael interfered in the match by attacking Von Erich, who had applied an iron claw on Kwon, which resulted in Kwon getting disqualified. However, Ross made the save forcing Samael and Kwon to retreat. Next, Alexander Hammerstone defended the National Openweight Championship against Douglas James. After a back and forth match, Hammerstone executed a Nightmare Pendulum to James to retain the title. Next, Zeda Zhang took on The Spider Lady in the first and only women's match on the card. Spider Lady was disqualified by the referee after applying a mandible claw and refused to release the hold. She then removed her mask and revealed herself to be Priscilla Kelly and then applied the hold on Zhang again and kicked the referee in the groin. Next, Injustice members Jordan Oliver and Kotto Brazil took on Gringo Loco and Zenshi in an elimination tag team match. Brazil eliminated Zenshi by nailing a By Any Means Necessary. Loco then quickly executed a kneeling reverse piledriver to Brazil to eliminate him. Myron Reed then came to ringside to punch the referee to Gringo while Oliver distracted the referee and Oliver executed a diving cutter from the middle rope for the win. Next, mixed martial artist King Mo made his MLW debut by competing against Ricky Martinez. Mo speared a diving Martinez mid-air and followed with a body splash and a gutwrench powerbomb and then applied a leglock on Martinez forcing him to submit to the hold. Next, The Hart Foundation (Brian Pillman Jr. and Davey Boy Smith Jr.) took on Contra Unit members Ikuro Kwon and Simon Gotch. Pillman and Smith executed a Hart Attack combination on Gotch for the win. Later, Jacob Fatu defended the World Heavyweight Championship against Ross Von Erich. Marshall Von Erich was originally scheduled to challenge Fatu for the title but he was mysteriously attacked and injured which led to Ross replacing him. The referee was knocked out during the course of the match when Fatu threw a knee at Von Erich which led to him crashing into the referee. Josef Samael interfered in the match by bringing a chair but Von Erich knocked him out and then Von Erich's cornerman Tom Lawlor grabbed the chair and turned on Von Erich by hitting him with a chair. Fatu then hit a moonsault to Von Erich to retain the title. It was followed by the penultimate match, a falls count anywhere match between Mance Warner and Jimmy Havoc. The battle spilled to the parking lot where Havoc stole a car and escaped the arena and Warner followed him. They brawled in various places throughout the Orlando city including Havoc's house and then a parking lot before returning to the arena where Havoc stabbed Warner with a fork. Havoc then attempted to hit an Acid Rainmaker but Warner avoided it and pinned him with a roll-up for the win. =Main event match= The main event was a Mystery Box Battle Royal. Barrington Hughes was the first one to get eliminated after a number of wrestlers teamed up to eliminate him. The eliminations continued throughout the match which led to Grogan and Timothy Thatcher remaining the final two participants. Thatcher landed on the apron where Grogan hit him with a big boot, causing Thatcher to get eliminated and Grogan subsequently won the battle royal. Aftermath Blood and Thunder marked Teddy Hart's last appearance in MLW as it was noted by MLW that Hart had been severely injured due to the fireball attack by Josef Samael.

Following the October 2016 local elections, the Democrats and the Democratic Front managed to form a local government in Budva, replacing the Democratic Party of Socialists (DPS) after 25 years in power, against which several corruption proceedings were conducted during the previous term.

Dapo, Descher, and Verdugo joined the cast in February 1964. Harry Grafton is a factory foreman at Osborne Industries, a company in Los Angeles, California, which manufactures a constantly changing line of items.nostalgiacentral.com NEW PHIL SILVERS SHOW, THEimbd.com The New Phil Silvers Showtv.com The British Phil Silvers Appreciation Society: The New Phil Silvers Show Retrieved 7 September 2020 Trying to earn as much as possible while doing as little as possible, Harry is manipulative and a conman, and always is trying to beat the system. He makes money off his fellow employees by running the Osborne Industries coffee cart service and through his ownership of the company‚Ä≤s vending machines. From his office at the factory, he also secretly operates his own company, Grafton Enterprises, through which he habitually pursues scams and get-rich-quick schemes which never seem to work out for him. Harry has to get around his boss, Mr. Brink, to pursue his schemes, and often enlists the much-suffering workers on the factory floor in his efforts to fulfill them. His plans usually end in disaster. In February 1964, Harry moved in with his widowed sister Audrey and her two children, Susan and Andy. Harry's family issues then also began to play an increasing part in his misadventures. Production Phil Silvers had a successful four-season run from 1955 to 1959 portraying Sergeant Ernie Bilko in The Phil Silvers Show. Four years after that show ended, The New Phil Silvers Show represented his attempt after a four-season absence from series television to reincarnate the successful Bilko character in the guise of Harry Grafton, with Silvers playing essentially the same character, albeit as a civilian factory foreman rather than a United States Army sergeant.That's Entertainment: Bilko Bounces Back (Briefly): A Look at THE NEW PHIL SILVERS SHOW, March 11, 2020 Retrieved 7 September 2020 Where Bilko had been popular, however, the Harry Grafton character turned viewers off: While Bilko had a soft spot, Harry was dishonest and manipulative through and through, and while Bilko was an underpaid, underdog sergeant trying to swindle faceless and implacable things like the United States Government and the U.S. Army just to make a little extra money, Harry had a good-paying job but still refused to do an honest day's work for a day's pay, and his scams and schemes involved exploiting and cheating blue- collar workers who were trying to make an honest living on the factory floor. With The New Phil Silvers Show struggling in the ratings and after receiving many complaints about the show's premise and the Harry Grafton character‚Ä≤s lack of appeal, CBS moved The New Phil Silvers Show to a later time partway through November 1963. When that did not improve ratings, the show began a transition to a new premise as a domestic comedy in February 1964, adding Harry's family to the show in the eighteenth episode and beginning a process of gradually shifting the show‚Ä≤s focus to Harry's domestic life, with him as a father figure to his niece and nephew. The shift came too late to save the show. Rod Amateau produced the show, and Harry Geller wrote its theme music. Silvers‚Äô wife, Evelyn Patrick, appeared on the show in the role of Mr Osborne‚Äôs niece. Silvers's old friend Herbie Faye, who had mentored Silvers in comedy in 1932, played Waluska. Broadcast history The New Phil Silvers Show premiered on September 28, 1963, and initially aired on Saturdays at 8:30 p.m. Partway through November 1963, it moved to 9:30 p.m. on Saturdays, where it remained for the rest of its run. CBS cancelled it after only one season, and its last original episode aired on April 25, 1964. After the show ended, NBC rebroadcast seven episodes of The New Phil Silvers Show as prime-time reruns during its normal time slot, four in May 1964 and three in June 1964. The last prime-time rerun aired on June 27, 1964. In the United Kingdom, ITV broadcast The New Phil Silvers Show during 1964.

Early Nazi career Not much is known about Ernst's early life. In February 1925, the Nazi Party was reestablished after having been outlawed as a result of the Beer Hall Putsch. Ernst joined the Party early after its formation and received membership number 4,476. At the time, the Nazi Party leadership in the area around Halle and Merseburg was largely unorganized. The Ortsgruppe (Local Group) in the city of Halle, under its chairman Gro√üclaus, reported directly to the central Party leadership in Munich. Walter Ernst was able to persuade other, smaller party groups in the region to coalesce around him. With the support of the Sturmabteilung (SA) leader in Halle, Wolf-Heinrich Graf von Helldorff, Ernst was able to consolidate his position, and the two succeeded in excluding Gro√üclaus from the Party leadership. Ernst was elected Nazi State Association Leader (Landesverbandes-Fuhrer) for the newly-formed Gau Halle-Merseburg on 27 June 1925. He thus became, effectively, the first Gauleiter of the region. Also in 1925, Ernst founded a newspaper, the Mitteldeutscher Beobachter, to support the Party‚Äôs position on issues. Still, the Gau remained factionalized and, on 25 July 1926, Ernst himself lost his leadership position and was expelled from the Party by decision of the Halle Ortsgruppe on 30 July. His successor as Gauleiter was Paul Hinkler. Later career and death From October 1927 to November 1931 Ernst studied law at the University of Halle. He worked as a law clerk and reenrolled in the Nazi Party in 1932. He also joined the SA, and held the rank of Sturmf√ºhrer. Ernst passed his second state law examination in 1935. From 1936 to 1939 he was City Syndic (City Counsel) in Quedlinburg. Then in 1939, he became B√ºrgermeister (Mayor) of Schneidem√ºhl, today Pi≈Ça. He remained in that position until June 1942 and then became B√ºrgermeister for Bromberg (today Bydgoszcz). As the Red Army approached his city, Ernst resisted the order that civilians should defend it to the last man. Judging further resistance pointless, he abandoned the city without a fight before its fall on 27 January 1945. He fled to Danzig where he was arrested, incarcerated at the Danzig-Matzkau prison camp and charged with cowardice, together with the Police President of the city of Bromberg, von Salisch, and the Regierungspr√§sident (Regional President) of the Bromberg District, Walther K√ºhn. On orders of Heinrich Himmler, then in charge of the area's defense as Commander-in-Chief of Army Group Vistula, von Salisch was executed. Ernst and K√ºhn were placed in a penal battalion and ordered to undertake especially dangerous missions. Though K√ºhn survived the war, Ernst was killed in action in defense of the greater Danzig area sometime in March 1945.

He lived in Nova Scotia from 1845 to 1851. He then moved to London and had a successful career as a homeopath there. In London he lived variously at Connaught Terrace, 11 Russell Place and 4 Denmark Hill.https://www.sueyounghistories.com/2008-10-26-the-wielobycki-brothers-and- homeopathy/ In the 1861 census he appears in lodgings at 25 Montagu Street in Edinburgh.

For a short introduction and a translation of the Cyzicene epigrams see Paton, pp. 149-169\\\\. For discussions of the epigrams see Livingstone and Nisbet, pp. 99-101, and Demoen, pp. 231-248. each accompanied by a short prose preamble, which, together with a one-sentence introduction, constitute the third and shortest book of the Palatine Anthology.Livingstone and Nisbet, p. 99. The epigrams are supposed to have been inscribed somewhere on the columns of the temple of Apollonis at Cyzicus, a monument which no longer exists.Livingstone and Nisbet, p. 99; Demoen, p. 231. Apollonis was the wife and queen of Attalus I, first king of Pergamon, and the mother of two sons, Eumenes and Attalus, when she died in the mid-second century BC, her sons built a temple in Apollonis' home town of Cyzicus, and dedicated it to her.Livingstone and Nisbet, p. 99; Paton, p. 149. According to the one- sentence introduction, each epigram was, apparently, a kind of subtitle for a relief decorating each column of the temple, illustrating a scene from Greek mythology. The prose preamble, taking the place of the carved image, provides a description of it.Livingstone and Nisbet, p. 99. As befitting a temple built by sons to honor their mother, the preambles describe scenes of love between mothers and sons.Livingstone and Nisbet, p. 100; Paton, p. 149. The author and date of the collection is unknown.If we are to believe the introduction, the epigrams would apparently have been composed shortly after Apollonis' death in the early-second century BC. However, although some scholars accept the epigrams as authentic (see Livingstone and Nisbet, p. 99 n. 2), Livingstone and Nisbet, p. 101, describes a Hellenistic date for the epigrams as \\"extremely unlikely\\", while Demoen, p. 248, dates the collection as no earlier than the 6th century AD.

Many motorsport and supply companies, such as Bosch Motorsport, ABB, and Michelin, worked together in collaboration with Jaguar, specifically the Special Vehicle Operations department, to develop the racecar. On January 11, 2018, Michelin would be announced to be the official tire supplier for the racecar.  Specifications  The racecar was built by Jaguar Land Rover Special Vehicle Operations, and developed from the road going Jaguar I-Pace. Many aerodynamic improvements have been made over the standard I-Pace, such as the addition of a rear wing and a revised exterior, a new front splitter, especially the front fascia and the sides, to create anti- lift and better direct air flow to cool the battery and motors. Additional changes include a lower ride height (by 30 mm), longer length (by 173 mm). slightly longer width (by 6 mm), a weight slash of up to 450 lb, etc. The length of the wheelbase of the I-Pace eTrophy racecar is the same as the road car. Power is increased to 436 hp (442 PS), from 395 hp (400 PS) as that of the road car, with a slight increase in torque to 700 Nm (513.4 lb-ft) of torque, from the 696 Nm (513 lb-ft) of the road car. The all-wheel drive format also remains the same, with 2 electric motors, one at each axle, powered by the same 90 kWh lithium-ion battery. An upgraded A/C system is used to not only further cool the battery pack, but also the electric motors. The racecar also features a full FIA-approved roll-cage and a bespoke 11-setting ABS system developed by Bosch Motorsport. The racecar also sits on 22-inch Michelin Pilot Super Sport all-condition tires. The regenerative braking, with brakes by ABB, can allow the racecar to go through a maximum of 0.4 g of deceleration. Torque distribution can be adjusted, up to a maximum of 50% at the front and 50% at the rear. The racecar takes 4.5 seconds to go from 0 to 60 mph (100 km/h), slashing 0.3 seconds from the roadcar. The racecar also has a top speed of 121 mph (200 km/h), the same as the roadcar. Only 20 units were made, and each one cost $260,000.  Debuts  The Jaguar I-Pace eTrophy had its first track unveiling at the 2018 Ad Diriyah ePrix. Earlier, the racecar had its first public view anywhere as a concept at the 2017 Frankfurt Motor Show. It was also a competitor at the 2019 Goodwood Festival of Speed.

It is a right tributary of the Niari River. It feeds the Moukoukoulou Hydroelectric Power Plant. Course The Bouenza River meanders for most of its course. The northern part of the river flows in a southwest direction, forming the border between the L√©koumou and Pool departments. Lower down it flows southeast and then south through the Bouenza Department to its confluence with the Niara at the town of Kimpombo. History In 1883 the Belgian Captain Edmond Hanssens established the post of Philippeville at the limit of the territories granted to Pierre Savorgnan de Brazza. The post was founded at the confluence of the Bouenza and Niari rivers on behalf of Belgian interests under the cover of the Haut Congo Study Committee. The operation was in response to a concern by king Leopold II of Belgium that the Portuguese might prevail in their claim to control the mouth of the Congo River. If so, Belgium would need an outlet to the Atlantic north of Loango. Hydroelectricity The 74-MW Moukoukoulou hydroelectric power plant on the Bouenza River is the most important in the country. It was built by Chinese technicians in 1974. During the 1999 civil war the plant was damaged, and since then only provided 25 MW. In May 2007 President Denis Sassou Nguesso visited Moukoukoulou, where all four turbine generators had been rehabilitated at a cost of US$12 million, although work on transformers was still not complete. Damage to the transmission network was preventing its power from reaching Brazzaville, which was relying on power from the Inga plants in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

Small Faces objected the request for an English release of the album, and the tracks remained officially unreleased there for another six months, until they were finally packaged along with various other singles, album tracks and B-sides on Immediate's first double album The Autumn Stone on 14 November 1969.  Background  The Small Faces had by mid-1968 began to fall apart. \\"Lazy Sunday\\", which was an unauthorized release by Immediate records, had reached number 2 in the UK Singles Chart, and according to Kenney Jones, their drummer, this had been a \\"nail in the coffin\\" for lead vocalist and guitarist Steve Marriott, since Marriott had wanted to lose the image of a boy band idol, and wanted to be seen as a more serious musician. Small Faces followed \\"Lazy Sunday\\" with \\"The Universal\\", which was recorded on a track recorder in Marriott's backyard. Small Faces keyboardist Ian McLagan did not play on the recording, as he had been fed up with Marriott. However, this was a disappointing chart failure, reaching only number 16 on the UK chart. Marriott thought that \\"The Universal\\" was the best song he had written so far, and he got writer's block and stopped composing music for a while after this. However, at the same time, they released their third studio album Ogdens' Nut Gone Flake, to both great critical and commercial success, as it reached number 1 in the UK, staying on top of the charts for six weeks. Despite the immense success of the album, the Small Faces started to drift apart even more. Marriott had wanted to invite guitar player Peter Frampton into the line-up of Small Faces in order to focus on his singing. However, this idea was heavily opposed by the remaining three members of the band, much to a Marriott, who was growing sour on the direction the band would take. With Frampton, Small Faces performed as a backing band for the sessions of a new Johnny Hallyday album, where tensions grew even worse. On 31 December 1968 at a performance at the Alexandra Palace, Marriott would finally storm off stage, yelling \\"I Quit!\\"  Recording  As In Memoriam was not a standard studio album, the recording of it were not intended, and they were very sparse. The first attempt at recording songs which would eventually end up on the album occurred on 21 October 1967, when the song \\"Call It Something Nice\\" was recorded in 9 takes at Olympic Studios in Barnes, London.Here Comes The Nice: Immediate Years box set 1967-69, liner notes, page 57 This song is thought to be one of the earliest recorded songs for Ogdens' Nut Gone Flake, however, the contrast in both the genre and sound led to it being excluded. Another Ogdens' Nut Gone Flake outtake was recorded in four takes on 3 April 1968, a song titled \\"A Collibosher\\".Here Comes The Nice: Immediate Years box set 1967-69, liner notes, page 60 It was recorded the same day as \\"Mad John\\", which appeared on Ogdens'. This song was previously thought to be an outtake of their unfinished studio album 1862. This song, an instrumental, is also thought to be a backing track, which never got any vocals added to it. The day before Ogdens' Nut Gone Flake was released, on 23 May, the band entered Trident Studios in Soho, London to record \\"Red Balloon\\", a song which was originally recorded by Tim Hardin on his album Tim Hardin 2 the previous year. The band recorded 6 takes of the song, and the final mix is a combination of takes 4 and 6.Here Comes The Nice: Immediate Years box set 1967-69, liner notes, page 58 The final studio track recorded was \\"The Autumn Stone\\", a song which is credited solely to Marriott. This song was recorded on 11 September 1968, and is the final studio-recorded song the Small Faces recorded.Here Comes The Nice: Immediate Years box set 1967-69, liner notes, page 61 The songs on side one are live tracks, recorded at the Newcastle City Hall in Newcastle upon Tyne on 18 November 1968.

Release and reception  Shortly after the Small Faces breakup, Immediate started compiling these various tracks onto an album for an English release, titled In Memoriam. However, this release was largely objected by the former members of the band, including McLagan, who thought that the titled implied that they were dead. However, these tracks were not all intended to appear on a compilation album. \\"The Autumn Stone\\" was originally slated for single release, along with the double A-side \\"Wham Bam Thank You Ma'am\\". However, this was objected by Immediate Records. Marriott later noted the irony of rejecting this single, but later naming an album after it. Nonetheless, the material was still packaged together, and the final result, In Memoriam was first released in West Germany on 1 May 1969 without the band's consent. The material would later receive a British release on the 14 of November when it was released on The Autumn Stone. This compilation album compiles most of the Small Faces singles, and their B-sides.The album received mostly mixed to positive reviews, in a mixed retrospective review by AllMusic Bruce Eder, he states that In Memoriam was a hastily conceived album in order to capitalize on the Small Faces recent breakup, noting the oddity of combining outtakes along with five live tracks, but also states that the collection isn't that bad. He states his pleasure in hearing Small Faces perform live on side one, considering Marriott one of Britain's best singers. However, he finds the material on side two a bit more mix, but notes \\"The Autumn Stone\\" as an odd, but interesting track, commenting on its similarity with the music of Syd Barrett. His review ends in stating that In Memoriam, while not the worst farewell, was not the best either.  Track listing  All tracks written by Steve Marriott and Ronnie Lane unless noted.

Freedom U provides tuition-free college classes to undocumented youth unable to access higher education in Georgia due to the state's out-of-state tuition requirement. The school formed in 2011 in response to the University System of Georgia's passage of a policy banning undocumented students from the state's top public universities. For safety reasons, Freedom U students attend classes in undisclosed locations throughout Atlanta. Freedom U's liberatory curriculum emphasizes dialogue, participatory decision-making, and understanding personal immigrant experiences within the broader context of the civil rights movement and history of human rights struggle. The public activism undertaken by Freedom U students, faculty, and allies has resulted in many universities committing to admit and provide scholarships for undocumented students.  History  Four University of Georgia (UGA) professors founded Freedom U in 2011 after the Jessica Colotl controversy ignited state and national debates over the educational rights of young undocumented people. Many Georgians felt undocumented students threatened the admission of U.S. citizens to its universities. The University System of Georgia Board of Regents (USG BOR) summarized three concerns: \\"that the University System was being swamped by thousands of undocumented students, that Georgia taxpayers were subsidizing the education of these students through in-state tuition, and that undocumented students were taking seats in college from academically qualified Georgians\\". In response to those concerns, during the summer of 2010, a USG BOR committee reviewed all 310,000 students enrolled in University System of Georgia institutions in the fall, and \\"found only 501 undocumented students enrolled in the system, with all paying out-of- state tuition, which is set at the full cost of instruction\\". The USG BOR then passed Policies 4.1.6 and 4.3.4 in 2011. Policy 4.1.6 banned undocumented students from the state's top public universities. At the time of passage, this included Georgia Tech, Georgia State University, University of Georgia, Augusta University, and Georgia College & State University. Policy 4.3.4 required institutions to \\"verify lawful presence,\\" ensuring no undocumented persons received in-state tuition benefits. The USG BOR's ban began the year the University of Georgia celebrated 50 years of an integrated student body. = Founding and early years, 2011-2014 = Freedom U opened in Athens, Georgia, on October 9, 2011, as a direct response to legislative actions to exclude undocumented students from access to Georgia's public universities. Founding faculty began consulting with local undocumented students, community leaders, and various local and national activists and organizations, including Atlanta's Georgia Undocumented Youth Alliance and Athens' Economic Justice Coalition. After hearing from affected youth that they most desired to be continuing their education, the professors decided to open a school. Professors and students came up with the name Freedom University to honor the history of Southern Freedom Schools and their instrumental role in the civil rights movement. Classes took place on Sundays in undisclosed donated spaces throughout Athens because the KKK had threatened the fledgling school. Members of the UGA and Athens communities arranged transportation and raised money for textbooks. Writer Junot Diaz sat on the advisory board of this first incarnation of Freedom University, helping to publicize its existence and mission on the national stage. By spring 2014, all four founding professors ceased being involved with Freedom University, three of the four leaving for posts at Ivy League universities. = Move to Atlanta and growth, 2014-present = In the summer of 2014, Laura Emiko Soltis, a human rights activist-scholar who had just received her PhD from Emory, became Freedom University's first Executive Director. That summer Freedom University relocated to Atlanta to be more centrally located to the majority of the state's undocumented population. The move also allowed Freedom U to call on Atlanta's long history and infrastructure of civil rights movement community. Under Soltis's leadership, Freedom University adopted a human rights framework and student-centered activist direction. Freedom U classes also took on a more formal structure. Soltis expanded the curriculum to include more arts classes and college preparatory instruction as well as mental health counseling. During this time, the school grew from serving 30 to 40 enrolled students. Freedom University continues to meet for weekend classes in changing, unpublicized locations throughout Atlanta. As of 2020, the school serves a community of 25 undocumented students who emigrated from countries in South America, Asia, and Africa. Most came to the U.S. as young children with families fleeing various forms of economic oppression and violence in their native countries.Park, Jeesoo. (June 22, 2020). . As the school's Community Engagement and Volunteer Coordinator, Arizbeth Sanchez became Freedom University's first undocumented staff member. Freedom U employs two full-time staff members who are undocumented. File:Bettina Kaplan at MIT Media Lab.jpgBettina Kaplan File:Bethany Moreton at MIT Media Lab.jpgBethany Moreton File:Pamela Voekel at MIT Media Lab.jpgPamela Voekel  Pedagogy  Since 2014, Freedom U has enacted an experiential, liberatory pedagogy based on dialogue, democratic participation, an intersectional human rights framework, and civil rights movement strategies. In addition to offering science, math, history, art, and music courses, FU teaches its students to become social movement leaders. Learners uncover the significance of their life experiences in the context of the complex sociocultural history of immigration, labor, racism, and segregation. Freedom U enacts the belief that access to education is a basic human right. Students often cite the school's son jarocho music class and performance group as a favorite aspect of their Freedom U experience. Freedom U students participate in decisions about their learning trajectory and what classes they would like to take. This participatory model encourages agency and peer learning, disrupting the traditional dynamic of teacher as ultimate authority and dispenser of knowledge.  Public activism  Freedom University engages in advocacy and education around how citizenship is understood, integrating discussion of slavery, apartheid, and labor exploitation in the United States, particularly in the Jim Crow South, and throughout the world. Freedom U has collaborated with civil rights leaders such as Lonnie King, John Lewis, Rita Schwerner Bender, Roslyn Pope, Loretta Ross, and Charles Black in educating and helping students perform civil disobedience actions. At these public events, students often wear painted monarch butterfly wings to symbolize the naturalness of migration and their experience as immigrants. In 2015, several Freedom U student activists were arrested for integrating a University of Georgia classroom on the anniversary of the University's desegregation. That same year, Freedom University students debated against the UGA Debate Union over whether college admissions processes should consider an applicant's national origin. Freedom U students argued that colleges should be able to consider national origin while UGA students argued against the practice. Freedom University students, faculty, and allies continue to attend random University System of Georgia Board of Regent's meetings to protest the discriminatory policies. In 2019, several faith leaders and Comedy Central comedian Jordan Klepper were arrested for joining Freedom U faculty and students at one such demonstration.  Recognition and social impact  On March 4, 2019, Atlanta City Council honored Freedom University's work to educate and empower undocumented youth in the city. In 2018, one out of three Freedom U students secured a full-ride scholarship to a college or university outside of Georgia. In 2019, half of its graduating students secured full scholarships. Beyond securing higher education funding and access for its own students, Freedom University's education and advocacy campaigns have resulted in several private universities in the U.S. changing their admissions policies. These changes open doors for all future undocumented applicants. Freedom U's coalition building efforts at Emory University resulted in Emory's 2015 decision to begin accepting DACA recipients. In 2017, Emory further revised their policy to admit qualified undocumented students, regardless of DACA status. Activism also influenced the Board of Regents to remove, in 2016, Georgia State University and Augusta University from the list of Georgia public universities banning undocumented students. Some Georgia lawmakers recognize how its exclusionary policies harm the state's economy and contribute to a \\"brain drain\\". After Georgia has invested in the public K-12 educations of undocumented youth, many leave the state to pursue higher education and work elsewhere. Larry Gordon of PBS quoted Freedom U student and activist Jacqueline Delgadillo: \\"It's a loss for our state. It doesn‚Äôt make sense to me how [state officials] are OK with so many students going out of state and then contributing to other states.\\" References  External links  *Freedom University website Category:2011 establishments in Georgia (U.S. state) Category:Alternative schools in the United States Category:Educational organizations Category:Illegal immigration to the United States Category:Immigration to the United States Category:Unaccredited institutions of higher learning in the United States Category:Universities and colleges in Atlanta ","title":"Freedom University"}]`),H={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{visibleCount:3,poemsData:P}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=3}}},B={class:"card-container"};function R(s,e,o,c,u,i){const m=y("PoemCard");return t(),n(h,null,[e[1]||(e[1]=a("section",null,[a("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[a("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"üéâ your libraryü•≥")])])],-1)),a("section",null,[a("div",B,[(t(!0),n(h,null,p(i.visiblePoems,(r,g)=>(t(),b(m,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...r)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...r))},"See more")):w("",!0)])],64)}const I=d(H,[["render",R]]),D=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"glossary/3.md","filePath":"glossary/3.md"}'),F={name:"glossary/3.md"},N=Object.assign(F,{setup(s){return(e,o)=>(t(),n("div",null,[v(I)]))}});export{D as __pageData,N as default};
