He was an organizer of the Texas Revolution, attending the Convention of 1836 and signing the Texas Declaration of Independence. He fought in three major battles, including the victory at San Jacinto. He was the first Chief Justice of Harrisburg County, Texas. Early life Andrew was born in Claiborne County, Mississippi on November 25, 1810. Career Briscoe emigrated to Texas, gained Mexican citizenship in 1833, then settled in Anahuac, Texas, where he opened a store. He was among the local businessmen who protested the manner in which Mexican authorities collected import duties. He was jailed with DeWitt Clinton Harris, catalyzing an armed confrontation led by William B. Travis, the second of the Anahuac Disturbances. He volunteered on behalf of the Texian rebels at the Battle of Concepci√≥n, Siege of Bexar, and led Company A, Infantry Regulars at the decisive Battle of San Jacinto. Briscoe signed the Texas Declaration of Independence. Briscoe was a delegate to the Texas Convention of 1836. After Texas Independence, President Sam Houston appointed him to served as the first Chief Justice of Harrisburg County, later renamed Harris County, Texas. After his term ended in 1839, he retired from office and became a cattle dealer. In 1839, he planned a new railroad from town of Harrisburg, Texas to the Brazos River. He hired workers to grade a roadbed and lay ties for about two miles before running short of capital. His wife, Mary Jane (Harris) Briscoe, was a surviving daughter of John Richardson Harris, who had received a land grant from the Austin Col ony, founded Harrisburg, Texas, and was the namesake of Harris County. Mary Jane Briscoe was not an heir, but the Briscoes did invest in Harrisburg.

The following novels in the Johnny Maxwell Trilogy are Johnny and the Dead (1993) and Johnny and the Bomb (1996). The setting of the novels in the modern world was a departure for Pratchett, who writes more regularly in fantasy world settings. Plot summary Twelve- year-old Johnny receives a pirate edition of the new video game Only You Can Save Mankind from his friend Wobbler. However, he hasn't been playing for long when the ScreeWee Empire surrenders to him. After accepting the surrender he finds himself inside the game in his dreams, where he must deal with the suspicious Gunnery Officer as well as the understanding Captain, and work out exactly what they're all supposed to do now. This might all be the result of an over-active imagination except that the ScreeWee have disappeared altogether from everyone else's copy of the game. With the help of another player, Kirsty, who calls herself \\"Sigourney\\" (as in Weaver), Johnny must try to get the ScreeWee home. Ideas and themes It plays with the effects of perception. For instance, since Kirsty refuses to see the ScreeWee as anything other than alien monsters who exist to be shot, they are much less human-like in her presence than when only dealing with Johnny. Wobbler writes a computer game entitled Journey to Alpha Centauri. The game is meant to be played in real-time, meaning it would take three thousand years to finish the journey. If the game were actually played for three thousand years, the player would be rewarded with a message saying \\"Welcome to Alpha Centauri. Now go home\\". This inspired an interactive fiction game developed by Julian Fleetwood, Journey to Alpha Centauri (In Real Time). It was released in 1998, with the same premise of requiring three thousand years of game play to complete. Adaptations In 1996, Only You Can Save Mankind was adapted into a three-part radio drama on BBC Radio 4, starring Tim Smith as Johnny.The L-Space Web: Events: Only You Can Save Mankind retrieved 2010-02-21 In 2004, a musical adaptation for the stage was premiered at the Edinburgh Festival, with music by Leighton James House and lyrics by Shaun McKenna.

Her novel La storia (History) is included in the Bokklubben World Library List of 100 Best Books of All Time. Life and career Elsa Morante was born in Rome in 1912, the daughter of Irma (n√©e Poggibonsi), a schoolteacher, and Augusto Morante. Her mother came from a Jewish family in Modena.Patrizia Acobas, \\"Elsa Morante\\", Encyclopedia, Jewish Women's Archive. When she was a teenager Morante discovered that Francesco Lo Monaco, a family neighbor, was her biological father. Except for a brief period during World War II, she resided in Rome until her death in 1985. Morante started writing at an early age. Without having much support from her parents, she relied mostly on self-education. She began writing short stories in the mid-1930s. Some were published in various publications and journals, including periodicals for children. Her first book, a collection of short stories called Il Gioco Segreto (The Secret Game), was published in 1941. In the same year she married fellow novelist and film critic Alberto Moravia. In 1942 she wrote her first children's book, Le Bellissime avventure di Cater√¨ dalla Trecciolina (republished in 1959 as Le straordinarie avventure di Caterina). During the German occupation of Italy at the end of World War II, Morante and Moravia, fearful because of their Jewish heritage, fled Rome to repair in the Ciociaria area near Frosinone. The experience would inspire Morante's La storia (1974) and Moravia's La Ciociara (translated in English in 1957 as \\"Two Women\\" and later made into a film by Vittorio De Sica). During her time in Ciociaria, she began translating the work of Katherine Mansfield. Morante decided to briefly return to war-torn Rome at great personal risk to retrieve the manuscript of what would be her first published Menzogna e sortilegio and get winter clothes. At the end of the war, Morante and Moravia met American translator William Weaver, who helped them to break into the English-speaking market. Her first novel, 1948's Menzogna e sortilegio, won the Viareggio Prize, and was published in the United States in 1951 as House of Liars. Despite her international success, Morante found the English translation quite disappointing. Morante's next novel, L'isola di Arturo, was published in 1957 and won the Strega Prize. In 1961 Morante and Moravia separated, and Morante's writing became more sporadic. She destroyed much of the work written during that period, although she did publish a novel, The Andalusian Shawl (1963), and a poem, The Adventure. Her next work, Il mondo salvato dai ragazzini (The World Saved by Children), a mix of poetry and songs mostly addressed to her new lover, artist Bill Morrow, was published in 1968. In 1963 Pier Paolo Pasolini invited Morante to select the music for his film The Gospel According to St. Matthew. She also collaborated in casting the actors. In 1974 Morante published La storia, a book chronicling the events surrounding Rome during World War II. It became a national bestseller in Italy, partially due to Morante's insistence that publisher Einaudi would put it out in an economical paperback edition. Despite its commercial success, the book provoked furious and at times negative reactions from left-wing literary critics, who disliked its anti-ideological tone. After Pier Paolo Pasolini wrote a negative review of the book, Morante broke off their friendship. La storia was adapted into a Rai television series in 1986.La Storia (RAI), 1986 Morante's final novel, Aracoeli (1982), has been perceived as a summary of all the motifs and trends present in her writing, such as the innocence of childhood and the importance of creating fantastic worlds to escape from dreary realities. The first English-language biography of Morante, A Woman of Rome, by Lily Tuck, was published in 2008.  Major themes  Morante cultivated a love for music, books and cats. Her favorite books included Achilles, Don Quixote, and Hamlet. She was also interested in Freudian psychology, Plato and Simone Weil. Southern Italy is also used as the backdrop for much of her work. Most of Morante's greatest works are shaped by her choices and experiences in life and are reflected in her protagonists. One of the central themes in Morante's work is Narcissism. The majority of Morante's leading characters use autobiography as a way to seek self-therapy and hope. Narration becomes a leading tool. Her writing is essential for the formation of a positive consciousness about her personal memories. Another important aspect of Morante's work is the metaphor of love. According to her, love can be passion and obsession, and can lead to despair or destruction. This trajectory is connected to her love for a nine-year-old boy when she was only two and a half years old. According to her, her first love was a heaven, but then it transformed into a hell. The metaphor of love can easily be traced back to one of her most famous poems, \\"Alibi.\\" Love and Narcissism are themes well connected to each other. Most of Morante's characters seek love, not because they have true feelings for the person they fell in love with, but because they need to cover the feelings of emptiness from their childhood. It is through love and narcissism that Morante introduces other themes such as the role of motherhood and the meaning of childhood experiences.

She began her career as a teenager writing for the AOL-based ABC Kidz site before interning at Spin Magazine. It was at that time she received the moniker of \\"Ultragrrrl\\", by which she continues to be known. After briefly working at the defunct Kurt Andersen-run Inside.com in 1999, Lewitinn was hired as an assistant to Michael Hirschorn at VH1. Lewitinn graduated with a degree in Advertising and Marketing from Fashion Institute of Technology in 2001. In 2002, she was the first manager for both rock bands stellastarr* and My Chemical Romance, both prior to their first major record deals. Her blog, Ultragrrrl.com (launched in July 2003), further established her as a taste-maker in the New York indie rock scene, as did her early championing of the rock band The Killers before they were signed to Island Def Jam. She returned to Spin several months later, this time as an assistant editor with her own column. In 2005, Lewitinn quit Spin to start her own record label, Stolen Transmission in partnership with Island Def Jam and Rob Stevenson, the Island Def Jam A&R; executive responsible for signing The Killers as well as Fall Out Boy, Thrice, and The Bravery.

He is a young boy (twelve in the first book, but a teenager in the later ones) living in the (fictional) typical late-20th- century English town of Blackbury (also the setting of Pratchett's Truckers). Johnny has a difficult home life. Over the course of the three books his parents split up and he and his mother move in with his grandfather. This may be why he starts seeing things no one else sees, including an alien surrender party, ghosts and a time travelling bag lady. On the other hand, it is possible that he sees them because they are actually there and he lacks the filters that stop most people noticing how amazing the world is (a favourite theme of Pratchett's). Apart from this tendency Johnny is almost unnaturally normal. His friend Kirsty often gets exasperated by his tendency to simply accept that strange things happen to him, rather than doing something about it. He has a strong sense of fair play, which leads to him fighting for what's right even when he has no idea what's going on. Pratchett has said that Johnny is based, very loosely, on an idea of what Richmal Crompton's Just William character would be like in a 1990s setting. The Gang Johnny has a sort of a gang consisting of the kids who hang around with each other because they don't fit into any of the school cliques. They are: *Stephen 'Wobbler' Johnson. Johnny's best friend and the second main character in the book. He is overweight and heavily into computers, an expert at piracy. He wants to be a nerd, but they wouldn't let him join. It is his considered opinion that Johnny is mental. His real name is Stephen Johnson in the books, although the television adaptation of Johnny and the Bomb gives it as Walter. In Johnny and the Bomb Wobbler got stuck in 1941- due to the gang's actions in the past accidentally changing history so that he was never born and therefore couldn't return to the future where he didn't exist- and grew up to be a billionaire calling himself Sir John (Sir Walter in the TV version) but, due to the time travel and multiple timelines involved, where and if this happened is questionable. Certainly a Wobbler returned successfully from 1941. *Simon 'Bigmac' Wrigley. An asthmatic skinhead who is deeply embarrassed by his instinctive grasp of mathematics. He lives with his brother in a rundown tower block on the edge of Blackbury. He is not exactly a criminal but has a confused grasp of car ownership. He has a casual friendship with Yo-less, and shows confusion when he is asked to justify why he has a jacket covered in swastikas and pro-Hitler slogans. Wrigley hides his true emotions, and, as seen in Only You Can Save Mankind overtries to be, as he puts it \\"hard\\", hanging out near pubs with boys years older than he is. Wrigley is constantly bullied by his older brother, although he knocks his brother out during Johnny and the Dead. He is strangely intelligent, and is probably the third most intelligent in the gang, after Kirsty and Yo-less. A running gag is his attraction to cars with the keys still in the ignition. He has apparently stolen and crashed the minister of education's car, and was thrown into juvenile hall. His favourite band is Heavy Mental. Wrigley's best friend is undoubtedly Wobbler, while he appears to dislike Kirsty. His relationship with Johnny is unclear, although he treats him with a mix of pity and cruelty. *Yo- less. A West Indian boy so nicknamed by Johnny because he doesn't say \\"Yo!\\". Interested in Star Trek, train spotting, Morris dancing and brass band music. His reaction to those who are surprised a black kid has such \\"uncool\\" hobbies varies from amusement to irritation. When faced with genuine racism he has a brittle anger that manifests itself in cold, almost emotionlessly delivered, sarcasm. *Kirsty. (Also known as Sigourney, Kimberly, Klytemnestra and Kasandra). Unlike the rest of the gang, Kirsty is a highly organised person who knows exactly where she's going in life. She is highly intelligent but has very poor people skills, something she views as a character flaw in everyone else. She is trying to get Johnny's life organised since he is clearly incapable of doing it himself, but hasn't realised that he doesn't especially want his life organised. He finds her very easy to talk to since she never listens. Unlike her most obvious Discworld counterparts, Susan Sto Helit and Granny Weatherwax, Kirsty has a tendency to romanticise things hidden beneath her practicality and finds Johnny's down-to-Earth attitude to things almost as annoying as his lack of direction.

Johnny was played by Andrew Falvery. In 1996 BBC Radio 4 dramatised Only You Can Save Mankind. Johnny was played by Tim Smith. A CBBC serial based on Johnny And The Bomb was broadcast in January 2006. Johnny was played by George MacKay. \\"I just see things other people don't see\\" Regarding whether the things that happen to Johnny really do happen or are all a matter of perception, as Johnny escapes his problems by projecting fantasy onto reality, Pratchett has said: I can't be having with that pernicious rubbish ... To Johnny it's all real, and that's what counts ... He deals with all the problems on their own terms and half the time he's projecting reality onto fantasy.... So: is what happens in the books real?

He was also the majority owner of the Buffalo Sabres franchise of the National Hockey League. In 2005, he was convicted on multiple charges of fraud and sentenced to 15 years in prison. Beginnings Born in Wellsville, New York, to Greek immigrants James and Eleni Rigas who sought a better life in the United States for their children, John had three siblings: Gus, Mary and Katherine. James was an entrepreneur of some repute in Wellsville, beginning as a shoe-shine man, then in 1921 introducing the Texas hot to Wellsville. The Texas hot stand remains in operation, currently co- owned by John's nephew, Chris Rigas. John's first job was, at the age of nine, busing tables. After graduating from Wellsville High School, he enlisted in the U.S. Army and was placed in an armored infantry division in 1943 and he saw combat in France. After the war ended he returned to life in Wellsville and, soon afterward, enrolled at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, New York. He studied engineering and earned a bachelor of science degree in management engineering. He was also a member of the Nu Theta Chapter of Phi Mu Delta. He then returned to Wellsville, only to take a job with the Sylvania corporation in Emporium, Pennsylvania. Business career In 1952, Rigas started his first business venture by buying a movie theater in Coudersport, Pennsylvania, a town midway between Wellsville and Emporium. He borrowed the money from his family and friends, including his godfather, James Lucas, to purchase the theater and started operating it in the evenings while he worked days at the Sylvania plant. The Rigas cable television enterprise first started in Coudersport when the family purchased the town's TV cable franchise. Always looking to grow his company, John had teamed with his brother Gus to start Adelphia after buying out his partners. They borrowed heavily to buy more and more suburban cable companies and avoided city franchises. Eventually, Adelphia became the largest cable provider outside Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Cleveland, and South Florida and had systems reaching over 30 states and over 5.6 million customers. Adelphia also launched product lines such as high-speed cable Internet service and long-distance telephone service. Rigas was honored numerous times, including honorary degrees by three universities. In 1997 he bought the Buffalo Sabres from team co-founder Northrup R. Knox, installing his son Timothy as team president. After considering buying a professional baseball franchise, Rigas opted to relaunch the Wellsville Nitros as a collegiate summer baseball team in 1998.John Rigs throws first pitch at Nitros game. Olean Times Herald. Retrieved June 15, 2016. His political contributions include a total of $50,750 to the Republican Party, with which he had affiliation, and placed a strong value in conservative Republican family values. Criminal indictment and incarceration Rigas resigned from his position as CEO in May 2002 after being indicted for bank fraud, wire fraud, and securities fraud. His sons Timothy and Michael, as well as James Brown and Michael Mulcahey, were also charged with participation in these crimes. The executives were accused of looting the corporation by concealing $2.3 billion in liabilities from corporate investors and of using corporation funds as their personal funds. John Rigas was convicted of the charges in summer 2004 and on June 27, 2005, was sentenced to 15 years in federal prison. Adelphia Corporation filed for bankruptcy after it acknowledged that the three Rigases had taken $3.1 billion in loans that were not recorded on the books. In 2005 John and Timothy were charged with tax evasion and pleaded not guilty in October 2005. On January 27, 2012, the charge of tax evasion was officially dismissed. Following John's arrest, the NHL virtually stripped him of his authority over the Sabres. After more than a year as a ward of the league, the franchise was purchased by another western New York multibillionaire, Tom Golisano. On May 24, 2007, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals upheld John's and Timothy's 2004 convictions on 17 of the original 18 counts. On June 27, 2007, John and Timothy were ordered to report to prison on August 13 for their fraud convictions. On August 13 John and Timothy reported to the Federal Correctional Complex, Butner, located about 45 minutes northwest of Raleigh, North Carolina, unsuccessful in their request to be allowed to serve their time together at a facility close to their homes in Coudersport, Pennsylvania. On November 1, 2007, after a 20-day bidding war involving 31 bidders, the palatial $30 million former Adelphia Headquarters building in Coudersport was sold to an undisclosed buyer at auction for $3.4 million. On March 3, 2008, the Supreme Court rejected the final appeal without comment. The case was Rigas v. U.S., 07-494. John's original release date was September 4, 2020, but a federal judge reduced his sentence by three years, and his new release date is scheduled to be January 23, 2018. Rigas applied for a presidential pardon in January 2009, but George W. Bush left office without making a decision. Rigas sold his house in Indigo Run, Hilton Head Island, South Carolina, in order to pay for legal fees. Sometime during the week of November 6, 2011, both John and Timothy were transferred to the Low Security Facility of the Allenwood Federal Correctional Complex in Pennsylvania. The Allenwood FCC is located 2 miles north of Allenwood on Route 15, about 11 miles south of Williamsport. On December 14, 2015, Rigas' lawyers announced that he was terminally ill with bladder cancer and had between one and six months to live. Rigas was diagnosed with the cancer prior to his conviction and, under his sentencing, could seek compassionate release if he had less than three months to live. Judge Kimba Wood issued an order allowing for Rigas's release on February 19, 2016. As of June 2016, Rigas is well enough to make public appearances. As of August 2020, Rigas is still alive.

An S&L; or \\"thrift\\" is a financial institution that accepts savings deposits and makes mortgage, car and other personal loans to individual members (a cooperative venture known in the United Kingdom as a building society). The Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC) closed or otherwise resolved 296 institutions from 1986 to 1989, whereupon the newly established Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC) took up these responsibilities. The RTC closed or otherwise resolved 747 institutions from 1989 to 1995 with an estimated book value between $402 and $407 billion.Curry, T., & Shibut, L. (2000). The Cost of the Savings and Loan Crisis. FDIC Banking Review, 13(2), 26-35. In 1996, the General Accounting Office (GAO) estimated the total cost to be $160 billion, including $132.1 billion taken from taxpayers.Wilentz, Sean. The Age of Reagan, p. 199. In 1979, the Federal Reserve of the United States raised the discount rate that it charged its member banks from 9.5 percent to 12 percent in an effort to reduce inflation. The building of S&Ls; had issued long-term loans at fixed interest rates that were lower than the interest rate at which they could borrow. In addition, the S&Ls; had the liability of the deposits which paid higher interest rates than the rate at which they could borrow. When interest rates at which they could borrow increased, the S&Ls; could not attract adequate capital, from deposits to savings accounts of members for instance, and they became insolvent. Rather than admit to insolvency, some S&Ls; took advantage of lax regulatory oversight to pursue highly speculative investment strategies. This had the effect of extending the period where S&Ls; were likely technically insolvent. These adverse actions also substantially increased the economic losses for the S&Ls; than would otherwise have been realized had their insolvency been discovered earlier.Black (2005, p. 5) One extreme example was that of financier Charles Keating, who paid $51 million financed through Michael Milken's \\"junk bond\\" operation, for his Lincoln Savings and Loan Association which at the time had a negative net worth exceeding $100 million.Black (2005, pp. 64‚Äì65) Others, such as author and financial historian Kenneth J. Robinson or the account of the crisis published in 2000 by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), give multiple reasons as to why the S&L; crisis came to pass. In no particular order of significance, they identify the rising monetary inflation beginning in the late 1960s spurred by simultaneous domestic spending programs of President Lyndon B. Johnson's \\"Great Society\\" programs coupled with the military expenses of the continuing Vietnam War that continued into the late 1970s. The efforts to end the rampant inflation of the late 1970s and early 1980s by raising interest rates brought on a recession in the early 1980s and the beginning of the S&L; crisis. Deregulation of the S&L; industry, combined with regulatory forbearance, and fraud worsened the crisis.Robinson, K. J. (2013). The Savings and Loan Crisis. Federalreservehistory.org. Retrieved from http://www.federalreservehistory.org/Events/DetailView/42 Background The \\"thrift\\" or \\"building\\" or \\"savings and loans associations\\" industry has its origins in the British building society movement that emerged in the late 18th century. American thrifts (also known as \\"building and loans\\" or \\"B&Ls;\\") shared many of the same basic goals: to help the working class save for the future and purchase homes. Thrifts were not-for-profit cooperative organizations that were typically managed by the membership and local institutions that served well-defined groups of aspiring homeowners. While banks offered a wide array of products to individuals and businesses, thrifts often made only home mortgages primarily to working-class men and women. Thrift leaders believed they were part of a broader social reform effort and not a financial industry. According to thrift leaders, B&Ls; not only helped people become better citizens by making it easier to buy a home, they also taught the habits of systematic savings and mutual cooperation which strengthened personal morals. The thrift associations and their ideals were famously portrayed in the 1946 film It's a Wonderful Life. The first thrift was formed in 1831, and for 40 years there were few B&Ls;, found in only a handful of Midwestern and Eastern states. This situation changed in the late 19th century as urban growth and the demand for housing related to the Second Industrial Revolution caused the number of thrifts to explode. The popularity of B&Ls; led to the creation of a new type of thrift in the 1880s called the \\"national\\" B&L.; The \\"nationals\\" were often for-profit businesses formed by bankers or industrialists that employed promoters to form local branches to sell shares to prospective members. The \\"nationals\\" promised to pay savings rates up to four times greater than any other financial institution. The Depression of 1893 (resulting from the financial Panic of 1893, which lasted for several years) caused a sharp decline in members, and so \\"nationals\\" experienced a sudden reversal of fortunes. Because a steady stream of new members was critical for a \\"national\\" to pay both the interest on savings and the hefty salaries for the organizers, the falloff in payments caused dozens of \\"nationals\\" to fail. By the end of the 19th century, nearly all the \\"nationals\\" were out of business (National Building and Loans Crisis). This led to the creation of the first state regulations governing B&Ls;, to make thrift operations more uniform, and the formation of a national trade association to not only protect B&L; interests, but also promote business growth. The trade association led efforts to create more uniform accounting, appraisal, and lending procedures. It also spearheaded the drive to have all thrifts refer to themselves as \\"savings and loans\\", not B&Ls;, and to convince managers of the need to assume more professional roles as financiers. In the 20th century, the two decades that followed the end of World War II were the most successful period in the history of the thrift industry. The return of millions of servicemen eager to take up their prewar lives led to an unprecedented post-war housing crisis and boom with a dramatic increase in new families, and this so-called \\"baby boom\\" caused a surge in new mostly suburban home construction, and vast expansion beyond the central core cities with additional commercial development on radiating spoke roads and highways plus the additional construction by 1956, during the Eisenhower administration of the Interstate Highways system throughout the country allowed the explosion of suburban communities in formerly rural surrounding counties. By the 1940s S&Ls; (the name change for many associations occurred gradually after the late 1930s) provided most of the financing for this expansion, which now had some sort of state regulation which predated the later similar regulation of banks instituted after the 1929 Stock Market \\"Crash\\" and the later \\"bank holiday\\" of the beginning of the administration of 32nd President Franklin D. Roosevelt in March 1933, and the subsequent requirements and regulations in the \\"New Deal\\" programs to combat the Great Depression. The result was strong industry expansion that lasted through the early 1960s. An important trend involved raising rates paid on savings to lure deposits, a practice that resulted in periodic rate wars between thrifts and even commercial banks. These wars became so severe that in 1966, the United States Congress took the highly unusual move of setting limits on savings rates for both commercial banks and S&Ls.; From 1966 to 1979, the enactment of rate controls presented thrifts with a number of unprecedented challenges, chief of which was finding ways to continue to expand in an economy characterized by slow growth, high interest rates and inflation. These conditions, which came to be known as stagflation, wreaked havoc with thrift finances for a variety of reasons. Because regulators controlled the rates that thrifts could pay on savings, when interest rates rose depositors often withdrew their funds and placed them in accounts that earned market rates, a process known as disintermediation. At the same time, rising loan rates and a slow growth economy made it harder for people to qualify for mortgages that in turn limited the ability of the S&Ls; to generate income. In response to these complex economic conditions, thrift managers resorted to several innovations, such as alternative mortgage instruments and interest-bearing checking accounts, as a way to retain funds and generate lending business. Such actions allowed the industry to continue to record steady asset growth and profitability during the 1970s even though the actual number of thrifts was falling. Despite such growth, there were still clear signs that the industry was chafing under the constraints of regulation. This was especially true with the large S&Ls; in the western United States that yearned for additional lending powers to ensure continued growth. Despite several efforts to modernize these laws in the 1970s, few substantive changes were enacted. In 1979, the financial health of the thrift industry was again challenged by a return of high interest rates and inflation, sparked this time by a doubling of oil prices and exacerbated by dwindling resources of the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC) It was not a small problem: In 1980 there were more than 4,000 savings & loans institutions with assets of $600 billion, of which $480 billion were mortgage loans, many of them made at low interest rates fixed in an earlier era. In the United States, this was 50 percent of the entire home mortgage market. In 1983, the FSLIC's reserves for failures amounted to around $6 billion, whereas, according to Robinson (footnoted), the cost of paying off insured depositors in failed institutions would have been around $25 billion. Hence, regulators were forced into \\"forbearance\\"‚Äîallowing insolvent institutions to remain open‚Äîand to hope that they could grow out of their problems. Causes =Deregulation= The Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act signed by President Jimmy Carter on March 31, 1980. In the early 1980s Congress passed two laws with the intent to deregulate the Savings and Loans industry, the Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act of 1980 and the Garn‚ÄìSt. Germain Depository Institutions Act of 1982. These laws allowed thrifts to offer a wider array of savings products (including adjustable-rate mortgages), but also significantly expanded their lending authority and reduced regulatory oversight.Black (2005, pp. 7, 30‚Äì31) These changes were intended to allow S&Ls; to \\"grow\\" out of their problems, and as such represented the first time that the government explicitly sought to influence S&L; profits as opposed to promoting housing and homeownership. Other changes in thrift oversight included authorizing the use of more lenient accounting rules to report their financial condition, and the elimination of restrictions on the minimum numbers of S&L; stockholders. Such policies, combined with an overall decline in regulatory oversight (known as forbearance), would later be cited as factors in the collapse of the thrift industry. Between 1982 and 1985, S&L; assets grew by 56% (compared to growth in commercial banks of 24%). In part, the growth was tilted toward financially weaker institutions which could only attract deposits by offering very high rates and which could only afford those rates by investing in high-yield, risky investments and loans. The deregulation of S&Ls; in 1980, by the Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act signed by President Jimmy Carter on March 31, 1980, gave them many of the capabilities of banks without the same regulations as banks, without explicit FDIC oversight. Savings and loan associations could choose to be under either a state or a federal charter. This decision was made in response to the dramatically increasing interest rates and inflation rates that the S&L; market experienced due to vulnerabilities in the structure of the market. Immediately after deregulation of the federally chartered thrifts, state-chartered thrifts rushed to become federally chartered, because of the advantages associated with a federal charter. In response, states such as California and Texas changed their regulations to be similar to federal regulations. =End of inflation= Paul Volcker Another factor was the efforts of the Federal Reserve to wring inflation out of the economy, marked by Paul Volcker's speech of October 6, 1979, with a series of rises in short- term interest rates. This led to a scenario in which increases in the short- term cost of funding were higher than the return on portfolios of mortgage loans, a large proportion of which may have been fixed-rate mortgages (a problem that is known as an asset-liability mismatch). Interest rates continued to rise, placing even more pressure on S&Ls; as the 1980s dawned and led to increased focus on high interest-rate transactions. Zvi Bodie, professor of finance and economics at Boston University School of Management, writing in the St. Louis Federal Reserve Review, \\"asset-liability mismatch was a principal cause of the Savings and Loan Crisis\\".Bodie, Zvi. \\"On Asset- Liability Matching and Federal Deposit and Pension Insurance.\\" Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis Review. July/August 2006, 88(4), pp. 323‚Äì29. =Forbearance= The relatively greater concentration of S&L; lending in mortgages, coupled with a reliance on deposits with short maturities for their funding, made savings institutions especially vulnerable to increases in interest rates. As inflation accelerated and interest rates began to rise rapidly in the late 1970s, many S&Ls; began to suffer extensive losses. The rates they had to pay to attract deposits rose sharply, but the amount they earned on long-term, fixed-rate mortgages did not change. Losses began to mount. This led to a regulatory response of forbearance, which is arguably the cause to the symptoms and causes found below. Forbearance was the practice and enabling of policy that is the cause to the turmoil that the S&L; market experienced. Many insolvent thrifts were allowed to remain open, and their financial problems only worsened over time. Moreover, capital standards were reduced both by legislation and by decisions taken by regulators. Federally chartered S&Ls; were granted the authority to make new (and ultimately riskier) loans other than residential mortgages. =Imprudent real estate lending= In an effort to take advantage of the real estate boom (outstanding U.S. mortgage loans: 1976 $700 billion; 1980 $1.2 trillion)Lewis, Michael (1989). Liar's Poker, p. 83. and high interest rates of the late 1970s and early 1980s, many S&Ls; lent far more money than was prudent, and to ventures which many S&Ls; were not qualified to assess, especially regarding commercial real estate. L. William Seidman, former chairman of both the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Resolution Trust Corporation, stated, \\"The banking problems of the '80s and '90s came primarily, but not exclusively, from unsound real estate lending\\". Peter Lynch, a mutual fund manager at Fidelity Investments, believed lack of oversight on property debt was a key factor in the savings and loan crisis. He was heavily invested in S&Ls; before and during the crisis via the Magellan Fund. Lynch generally thought they were good investments but also noted most of the troubled S&Ls; were privately held, and thus faced less scrutiny from shareholders who might have noted and objected to questionable property loans and holdings that contributed to the crisis.Peter Lynch and John Rothschild, Beating the Street Simon & Schuster; Revised edition (May 25, 1994) 0671891634 =Brokered deposits= Deposit brokers, somewhat like stockbrokers, are paid a commission by the customer to find the best certificate of deposit (CD) rates and place their customers' money in those CDs. Previously, banks and thrifts could only have five percent of their deposits be brokered deposits; the race to the bottom caused this limit to be lifted. A small one-branch thrift could then attract a large number of deposits simply by offering the highest rate. To make money off this expensive money, it had to lend at even higher rates, meaning that it had to make more, riskier investments. This system was made even more damaging when certain deposit brokers instituted a scam known as \\"linked financing\\". In \\"linked financing\\", a deposit broker would approach a thrift and say he would steer a large amount of deposits to that thrift if the thrift would lend certain people money. The people, however, were paid a fee to apply for the loans and told to give the loan proceeds to the deposit broker. =Major causes according to United States League of Savings Institutions= The following is a detailed summary of the major causes for losses that hurt the savings and loan business in the 1980s: # Lack of net worth for many institutions as they entered the 1980s, and a wholly inadequate net worth regulation. # Decline in the effectiveness of Regulation Q in preserving the spread between the cost of money and the rate of return on assets, basically stemming from inflation and the accompanying increase in market interest rates. # Absence of an ability to vary the return on assets with increases in the rate of interest required to be paid for deposits. # Increased competition on the deposit gathering and mortgage origination sides of the business, with a sudden burst of new technology making possible a whole new way of conducting financial institutions generally and the mortgage business specifically. # Savings and Loans gained a wide range of new investment powers with the passage of the Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act and the Garn‚ÄìSt. Germain Depository Institutions Act. A number of states also passed legislation that similarly increased investment options. These introduced new risks and speculative opportunities which were difficult to administer. In many instances management lacked the ability or experience to evaluate them, or to administer large volumes of nonresidential construction loans. # Elimination of regulations initially designed to prevent lending excesses and minimize failures. Regulatory relaxation permitted lending, directly and through participations, in distant loan markets on the promise of high returns. Lenders, however, were not familiar with these distant markets. It also permitted associations to participate extensively in speculative construction activities with builders and developers who had little or no financial stake in the projects. # Fraud and insider transaction abuses from employees. # A new type and generation of opportunistic savings and loan executives and owners ‚Äì some of whom operated in a fraudulent manner ‚Äì whose takeover of many institutions was facilitated by a change in FSLIC rules reducing the minimum number of stockholders of an insured association from 400 to one. # Dereliction of duty on the part of the board of directors of some savings associations. This permitted management to make uncontrolled use of some new operating authority, while directors failed to control expenses and prohibit obvious conflict of interest situations. # A virtual end of inflation in the American economy, together with overbuilding in multifamily, condominium type residences and in commercial real estate in many cities. In addition, real estate values collapsed in the energy states ‚Äì Texas, Louisiana, and Oklahoma ‚Äì particularly due to falling oil prices ‚Äì and weakness occurred in the mining and agricultural sectors of the economy. # Pressures felt by the management of many associations to restore net worth ratios. Anxious to improve earnings, they departed from their traditional lending practices into credits and markets involving higher risks, but with which they had little experience. # The lack of appropriate, accurate, and effective evaluations of the savings and loan business by public accounting firms, security analysts, and the financial community. # Organizational structure and supervisory laws, adequate for policing and controlling the business in the protected environment of the 1960s and 1970s, resulted in fatal delays and indecision in the examination/supervision process in the 1980s. # Federal and state examination and supervisory staffs insufficient in number, experience, or ability to deal with the new world of savings and loan operations. # The inability or unwillingness of the Bank Board and its legal and supervisory staff to deal with problem institutions in a timely manner. Many institutions, which ultimately closed with big losses, were known problem cases for a year or more. Often, it appeared, political considerations delayed necessary supervisory action. =Major causes and lessons learned= In 2005, former bank regulator William K. Black listed a number of lessons that should have been learned from the S&L; Crisis that have not been translated into effective governmental action:Black (2005, ch. 10) # Fraud matters, and control frauds pose unique risks. # It is important to understand fraud mechanisms. Economists grossly underestimate its prevalence and impact, and prosecutors have difficulties finding it, even without the political pressure from politicians who receive campaign contributions from the banking industry.Black (2005, esp. p. 247) # Control fraud can occur in waves created by poorly designed deregulation that creates a criminogenic environment. # Waves of control fraud cause immense damage.Black (2005, pp. 248‚Äì249) # Control frauds convert conventional restraints on abuse into aids to fraud.Black (2005, p. 250) # Conflicts of interest matter. # Deposit insurance was not essential to S&L; control frauds. # There are not enough trained investigators in the regulatory agencies to protect against control frauds. # Regulatory and presidential leadership is important. # Ethics and social forces are restraints on fraud and abuse. # Deregulation matters and assets matter. # The SEC should have a chief criminologist. # Control frauds defeat corporate governance protections and reforms. # Stock options increase looting by control frauds. # The \\"reinventing government\\" movement should deal effectively with control frauds. Failures President Ronald Reagan signs the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 (ERTA) bill at Rancho del Cielo in 1981 In 1980, the United States Congress granted all thrifts, including savings and loan associations, the power to make consumer and commercial loans and to issue transaction accounts. Designed to help the thrift industry retain its deposit base and to improve its profitability, the Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act (DIDMCA) of 1980 allowed thrifts to make consumer loans up to 20 percent of their assets, issue credit cards, accept negotiable order of withdrawal accounts from individuals and nonprofit organizations, and invest up to 20 percent of their assets in commercial real estate loans. The damage to S&L; operations led Congress to act, passing the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 (ERTA) in August 1981 and initiating the regulatory changes by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board allowing S&Ls; to sell their mortgage loans and use the cash generated to seek better returns soon after enactment;The S&L; Crisis: A Chrono-Bibliography, FDIC. the losses created by the sales were to be amortized over the life of the loan, and any losses could also be offset against taxes paid over the preceding ten years., Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981, 95 Stat. 172, , 13 August 1981, Title II, 97th Congress. This all made S&Ls; eager to sell their loans. The buyers ‚Äì major Wall Street firms ‚Äì were quick to take advantage of the S&Ls;' lack of expertise, buying at 60% to 90% of value and then transforming the loans by bundling them as, effectively, government-backed bonds by virtue of Ginnie Mae, Freddie Mac, or Fannie Mae guarantees. S&Ls; were one group buying these bonds, holding $150 billion by 1986, and being charged substantial fees for the transactions. In 1982, the Garn-St Germain Depository Institutions Act was passed and increased the proportion of assets that thrifts could hold in consumer and commercial real estate loans and allowed thrifts to invest 5 percent of their assets in commercial loans until January 1, 1984, when this percentage increased to 10 percent. A large number of S&L; customers' defaults and bankruptcies ensued, and the S&Ls; that had overextended themselves were forced into insolvency proceedings themselves. The Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC), a federal government agency that insured S&L; accounts in the same way the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insures commercial bank accounts, then had to repay all the depositors whose money was lost. From 1986 to 1989, FSLIC closed or otherwise resolved 296 institutions with total assets of $125 billion. An even more traumatic period followed, with the creation of the Resolution Trust Corporation in 1989 and that agency's resolution by mid-1995 of an additional 747 thrifts.Curry, Timothy; Shibut, Lynn. \\"The Cost of the Savings and Loan Crisis: Truth and Consequences.\\" FDIC Banking Review. Dec. 2000. pp. 26‚Äì34. A Federal Reserve Bank panel stated the resulting taxpayer bailout ended up being even larger than it would have been because moral hazard and adverse selection incentives that compounded the system's losses. There also were state-chartered S&Ls; that failed. Some state insurance funds failed, requiring state taxpayer bailouts. =Home State Savings Bank= In March 1985, it came to public knowledge that the large Cincinnati, Ohio-based Home State Savings Bank was about to collapse. Ohio Governor Dick Celeste declared a bank holiday in the state as Home State depositors lined up in a \\"run\\" on the bank's branches to withdraw their deposits. Celeste ordered the closure of all the state's S&Ls.; Only those that were able to qualify for membership in the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation were allowed to reopen.Home State Savings Bank's Failure, Ohio History Central website Claims by Ohio S&L; depositors drained the state's deposit insurance funds. A similar event involving Old Court Savings and Loans took place in Maryland. =Midwest Federal Savings & Loan= Midwest Federal Savings & Loan was a federally chartered savings and loan based in Minneapolis, Minnesota, until its failure in 1990.Anderson v. Resolution Trust Corp. , 66 F.3d 956 (8th Cir. 1995). The St. Paul Pioneer Press called the bank's failure the \\"largest financial disaster in Minnesota history\\". The chairman, Hal Greenwood Jr., his daughter, Susan Greenwood Olson, and two former executives, Robert A. Mampel, and Charlotte E. Masica, were convicted of racketeering that led to the institution's collapse. The failure cost taxpayers $1.2 billion. The Megadeth song \\"Foreclosure of a Dream\\" is presumed to have been written about this particular failure. Megadeth's then bassist Dave Ellefson contributed lyrics to the song after his family's Minnesota farm was in jeopardy as a result of the S&L; financial crisis. =Lincoln Savings and Loan= The Lincoln Savings collapse led to the Keating Five political scandal, in which five U.S. senators were implicated in an influence-peddling scheme. It was named for Charles Keating, who headed Lincoln Savings and made $300,000 as political contributions to them in the 1980s. Three of those senators, Alan Cranston (D‚ÄìCA), Don Riegle (D‚ÄìMI), and Dennis DeConcini (D‚ÄìAZ), found their political careers cut short as a result. Two others, John Glenn (D‚ÄìOH) and John McCain (R‚ÄìAZ), were rebuked by the Senate Ethics Committee for exercising \\"poor judgment\\" for intervening with the federal regulators on behalf of Keating. Lincoln Savings and Loan collapsed in 1989, at a cost of $3.4 billion to the federal government (and thus taxpayers). Some 23,000 Lincoln bondholders were defrauded and many investors lost their life savings. =Silverado Savings and Loan= Neil Bush Silverado Savings and Loan collapsed in 1988, costing taxpayers $1.3 billion. Neil Bush, the son of then Vice President of the United States George H. W. Bush, was on the Board of Directors of Silverado at the time. Neil Bush was accused of giving himself a loan from Silverado, but he denied all wrongdoing. The U.S. Office of Thrift Supervision investigated Silverado's failure and determined that Neil Bush had engaged in numerous \\"breaches of his fiduciary duties involving multiple conflicts of interest\\". Although Bush was not indicted on criminal charges, a civil action was brought against him and the other Silverado directors by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation; it was eventually settled out of court, with Bush paying $50,000 as part of the settlement, The Washington Post reported. As a director of a failing thrift, Bush voted to approve $100 million in what were ultimately bad loans to two of his business partners. And in voting for the loans, he failed to inform fellow board members at Silverado Savings & Loan that the loan applicants were his business partners. Neil Bush paid a $50,000 fine, paid for him by Republican supporters,\\"O, Brother! Where Art Thou?: Like Hugh Rodham, the Bush Bros. Have Capitalized on Family Ties\\" The Austin Chronicle. and was banned from banking activities for his role in taking down Silverado, which cost taxpayers $1.3 billion. An RTC suit against Bush and other Silverado officers was settled in 1991 for $26.5 million.  Scandals  = Jim Wright = Jim Wright On June 9, 1988, the House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct adopted a six- count preliminary inquiry resolution representing a determination by the committee that in 69 instances there was reason to believe that Rep. Jim Wright (D‚ÄìTX) violated House rules on conduct unbecoming a Representative. A report by special counsel implicated him in a number of influence peddling charges, such as Vernon Savings and Loan, and attempting to get William K. Black fired as deputy director of the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC) under Gray. Wright resigned on May 31, 1989, to avoid a full hearing after the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct unanimously approved a statement of alleged violation April 17. = Keating Five = On November 17, 1989, the Senate Ethics Committee investigation began of the Keating Five, Alan Cranston (D‚ÄìCA), Dennis DeConcini (D‚ÄìAZ), John Glenn (D‚ÄìOH), John McCain (R‚ÄìAZ), and Donald W. Riegle, Jr. (D‚ÄìMI), who were accused of improperly intervening in 1987 on behalf of Charles H. Keating, Jr., chairman of the Lincoln Savings and Loan Association. Keating's Lincoln Savings failed in 1989, costing the federal government over $3 billion and leaving 23,000 customers with worthless bonds. In the early 1990s, Keating was convicted in both federal and state courts of many counts of fraud, racketeering and conspiracy. He served four and a half years in prison before those convictions were overturned in 1996. In 1999, he pleaded guilty to a more limited set of wire fraud and bankruptcy fraud counts, and sentenced to the time he had already served.  Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989  As a result of the savings and loan crisis, Congress passed the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA), which dramatically changed the savings and loan industry and its federal regulation. The highlights of the legislation, which was signed into law on August 9, 1989, were: # The Federal Home Loan Bank Board (FHLBB) and the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC) were abolished. # The Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS), a bureau of the United States Treasury Department, was created to charter, regulate, examine, and supervise savings institutions. # The Federal Housing Finance Board (FHFB) was created as an independent agency to replace the FHLBB, i.e. to oversee the 12 Federal Home Loan Banks (also called district banks) that represent the largest collective source of home mortgage and community credit in the United States. # The Savings Association Insurance Fund (SAIF) replaced the FSLIC as an ongoing insurance fund for thrift institutions (like the FDIC, the FSLIC was a permanent corporation that insured savings and loan accounts up to $100,000). SAIF is administered by the FDIC. # The Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC) was established to dispose of failed thrift institutions taken over by regulators after January 1, 1989. The RTC will make insured deposits at those institutions available to their customers. # FIRREA gives both Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae additional responsibility to support mortgages for low- and moderate-income families. The legislation also required S&Ls; to meet minimum capital standards (some of which were risk-based) and raised deposit-insurance premiums. It limited to 30% of their portfolios loans not in residential mortgages or mortgage-related securities and set down standards preventing concentrations of loans to single borrowers. It required them to completely divest themselves of junk bonds by July 1, 1994, meanwhile segregating junk bond holdings and direct investments in separately capitalized subsidiaries. Consequences While not part of the savings and loan crisis, many other banks failed. Between 1980 and 1994 more than 1,600 banks insured by the FDIC were closed or received FDIC financial assistance.\\"The Banking Crises of the 1980s and Early 1990s: Summary and Implications,\\" FDIC. From 1986 to 1995, the number of federally insured savings and loans in the United States declined from 3,234 to 1,645. This was primarily, but not exclusively, due to unsound real estate lending.Seidman, L. William. \\"Lessons of the Eighties: What Does the Evidence Show?,\\" FDIC The market share of S&Ls; for single family mortgage loans went from 53% in 1975 to 30% in 1990. U.S. General Accounting Office estimated cost of the crisis to around $160.1 billion, about $124.6 billion of which was directly paid for by the U.S. government from 1986 to 1996. That figure does not include thrift insurance funds used before 1986 or after 1996. It also does not include state run thrift insurance funds or state bailouts. The federal government ultimately appropriated $105 billion to resolve the crisis. After banks repaid loans through various procedures, there was an estimated net loss to taxpayers of somewhere between ($123.8‚Äì132.1) 124 and 132 billion dollars by the end of 1999. The concomitant slowdown in the finance industry and the real estate market may have been a contributing cause of the 1990‚Äì1991 economic recession. Between 1986 and 1991, the number of new homes constructed dropped from 1.8 million to 1 million, the lowest rate since World War II. Some commentators believe that a taxpayer-funded government bailout related to mortgages during the savings and loan crisis may have created a moral hazard and acted as encouragement to lenders to make similar higher risk loans during the 2007 subprime mortgage financial crisis.

The Terror from Beyond Space is an independently made 1958 American science fiction horror film, produced by Robert Kent, directed by Edward L. Cahn, that stars Marshall Thompson, Shawn Smith (Shirley Patterson), and Kim Spalding.Warren 2000, p. 160. The film was distributed by United Artists as a double feature with Curse of the Faceless Man.Ma√ßek III, J.C. \\"Building the Perfect Star Beast: The Antecedents of 'Alien'.\\" PopMatters, November 21, 2012. The story involves Earth's second mission to Mars to discover the fate of the first. They find a sole survivor of that mission and bring him back. The survivor, the expedition's former commander, claims that his crew were killed by a hostile Martian life form. No one believes him until the creature, now a stowaway, begins hunting the rescue ship's crew as they return to Earth. The film's premise has been cited as an inspiration for screenwriter Dan O'Bannon's screenplay for Ridley Scott's 1979 film Alien. Plot In 1973, a nuclear-powered spaceship blasts off from Mars for Earth, bringing with it the sole survivor of the first mission, Col. Edward Carruthers (Marshall Thompson). He is suspected of having murdered the other nine members of his crew for their food and water rations, on the premise that he had no way of knowing if or when an Earth rescue mission would ever arrive. Carruthers denies this allegation, attributing his crew's deaths to a hostile humanoid life form on the Red Planet. Commander Col. Van Heusen is unconvinced and makes sure that Carruthers is constantly accompanied by another member of his crew. While the ship was on the Martian surface, a large external exhaust had been left open, allowing the creature easy access. The crew are at first skeptical that something crawled aboard while they were on Mars. However, when Kienholz investigates odd sounds coming from a lower level, he is killed and his body hidden in an air duct. Next is Gino Finelli. He is found, barely alive, but the creature attacks his would-be rescuer. Bullets have no effect, forcing the crewman to leave Gino behind, much to the distress of his brother Bob. An autopsy of Kienholz's body reveals that it has been sucked dry of all fluids. The crew use hand grenades and gas grenades, but the creature proves immune to both. They next try electrocution, with no effect. When \\"It\\" is tricked into going into the spaceship's atomic reactor room, they shut the heavily shielded door and expose the creature directly to the ship's nuclear pile. It easily crashes through the door and escapes. The creature is so strong that it can tear through the metal hatches separating each of the ship's levels. The survivors (except for an injured crewman, who is trapped below in a spot inaccessible to the creature) retreat to the control room on the topmost deck. When Carruthers notices the ship's higher-than-normal oxygen consumption rate, he surmises that this is due to the creature's larger lung capacity, needed for the thin Martian atmosphere. In a last desperate move, everyone puts on their spacesuits, and Carruthers opens the command deck's hull airlock directly to the vacuum of space. A violent decompression follows, and the plan works: \\"It\\" suffocates and finally expires, stuck part way through the final hatch. A press conference is later held on Earth, revealing the details of what happened aboard the rescue ship. The project director emphasizes that Earth may now be forced to bypass the Red Planet \\"because another word for Mars is death\\". Cast * Marshall Thompson as Col.

Creature stop-motion effects were by Harryhausen, the last dinosaur-themed film that he animated. He had inherited the film project from his mentor Willis O'Brien, responsible for the effects in the original King Kong (1933). O'Brien had planned to make The Valley of Gwangi decades earlier but died in 1962 before it could be realized. Producer Charles Scheer called it \\"probably the least of the movies Ray and I made together.\\"Swires p 67 Plot In Mexico at the turn of the 20th century, a cowgirl named T.J. Breckenridge hosts a struggling rodeo. Her former lover, Tuck Kirby, a heroic former stuntman working for Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show, wants to buy her out. Along the way, he is followed by a Mexican boy named Lope, who intends to join the rodeo on a quest for fame and fortune. T.J. is not interested in Tuck because of this, but Tuck is still attracted to T.J., especially when T.J. jumps off a diving board on her horse. T.J. finally accepts Tuck when he saves Lope from a bull and the two kiss. T.J. has an ace she hopes will boost attendance at her show - a tiny horse called El Diablo. Tuck meets a British paleontologist named Horace Bromley, who is working in a nearby Mexican desert. Bromley shows Tuck fossilized horse tracks, and Tuck notes their similarity to El Diablo's feet. Tuck sneaks Bromley into the circus for a look at El Diablo, and Bromley declares the horse to be a prehistoric Eohippus. The tiny horse came from a place known as the Forbidden Valley. A gypsy known as Tia Zorina claims that the horse is cursed, and demands that it be immediately returned. Later, she and the other gypsies collaborate with Bromley to steal El Diablo and release it back in the valley. Bromley hopes to follow the horse to its home in search of other prehistoric specimens. Carlos, an ex-member of the Gypsy tribe now working for T.J.'s circus, walks in on the theft and tries to stop it, but is knocked out. Tuck arrives just as the Gypsy posse leaves. Carlos sees him as he is regaining consciousness. Tuck notices that the horse is missing, and sets off after Bromley. When T.J. and her crew discover Carlos, Carlos claims that Tuck has stolen El Diablo for himself. Carlos, T.J., and the others decide to follow Tuck and Bromley into the valley. Making their way into the Forbidden Valley, Tuck, T.J., and the rest of the group meet up and soon discover why the valley is said to be cursed when a Pteranodon swoops down and snatches Lope but due to the weight it falls back to the ground. After Carlos kills the Pteranodon by twisting its neck, they spot an Ornithomimus, which they chase after in the hopes of capturing it. Just as it is about to escape, it is killed by Gwangi, a vicious Allosaurus which chases Bromley and the rest of the group. However, a Styracosaurus appears and drives Gwangi away. As Gwangi leaves, he takes the dead Pteranodon with him. Later, Gwangi pursues the group to their base camp and they try to rope him down, but he breaks free when the Styracosaurus reappears. Gwangi battles and kills the Styracosaurus and later manages to catch and kill Carlos, but is knocked out by a rockslide while trying to exit the valley in pursuit of the rest of the group. Securing the creature with ropes, Tuck and the other men in the group take Gwangi back to town to be put on display in T.J.'s show. On the opening day of the show, the dwarfed Gypsy sneaks in and begins to unlock Gwangi's cage in an effort to free him, only to be killed when Gwangi breaks free. The crowd begins to flee as Gwangi attacks, and Tia Zorina is trampled to death in the chaos. Bromley is crushed by a broken piece of the cage, and Gwangi attacks and defeats a circus elephant before rampaging through the town. Tuck, accompanied by T.J. and Lope, tries to hide the crowd in a cathedral, but Gwangi finds them and breaks in. Tuck urges the crowd out through a back exit, leaving Tuck inside with Gwangi, T.J. and Lope. Though Gwangi tries to eat them, he is distracted when the cathedral's organ is accidentally sounded off as Tuck falls backwards into the keyboard. Tuck then manages to wound the dinosaur with a flag and throws a torch onto the floor near Gwangi, setting the building on fire. Tuck and the others manage to escape, leaving Gwangi trapped in the burning, collapsing building. Shrieking in agony, Gwangi is finally crushed to death by the falling debris, as Tuck, T.J., Lope (with tears in his eyes), and the townspeople look on.

The plot was inspired by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's book The Lost World (1912), with added elements from King Kong (capturing a creature and bringing it to civilization where it runs amok). In O'Brien's scenario, then called Valley of the Mists, cowboys discover an Allosaurus in the Grand Canyon. After finally roping the dinosaur, they put it in a Wild West show but the creature, now called \\"Gwangi\\", breaks free and fights lions from the show that have also escaped. After killing the lions, Gwangi goes on a rampage around the town and is run off a cliff by a man in a truck. O'Brien worked on the project at RKO during most of 1942. The studio cancelled the production reportedly because of research done that the public did not want to see a picture about dinosaurs.Creating Dinosaurs for BABY Lee, Nora. American Cinematographer; Hollywood Vol. 67, Iss. 3, (Mar 1985): 57-63. According to Harryhausen the project \\"didn't get to the shooting stage. They built a series of Dioramas in three-dimensional cardboard cutouts for each set-up. I saw those and I saw a lot of O'Brien's drawings at the time, but that's as far as it got.\\"The Thirteen Voyages of Ray Harryhausen Stein, Elliott.

New York Times 25 June 1950: 76. In 1949, Hollywood columnist Hedda Hopper reported that Jesse Lasky was going to Central America to film scenes for Valley of the Mists with O'Brien, with a script by Richard Landau.HEDDA HOPPER: Lasky to Location in Central America Los Angeles Times 9 Aug 1949: 14. However no film resulted. Seven years after O'Brien died in 1962, The Valley of Gwangi was released in 1969. A similar film The Beast of Hollow Mountain (1956 United Artists / produced by a Mexican film company and also employing stop-motion effects, but not by Harryhausen), was the only other feature film in the history of cinema to have the unusual story combination of cowboys and dinosaurs.FROM A 'MISSING LINK' TO TYRANNOSAURUS REX: Four Decades of 'Animation-in-Depth' Technique Marked by New Feature By VANCE KINGHOLLYWOOD. New York Times 26 June 1955: X5. =Ray Harryhausen= In the late 1960s Ray Harryhausen and producer Charles Schneer decided to reunite after several years of making films apart. Harryhausen suggested reviving two old O'Brien projects, War Eagles, which had been developed for MGM, and Gwangi which had been done for RKO. Schneer did not see how they could get a script out of War Eagles but was enthusiastic about the Gwangi script and bought the rights from O'Brien's widow.Swires p 66 Although O'Brien was the creator of the original Gwangi story, an on-screen credit for him was not included in The Valley of Gwangi . Schneer had the script rewritten by William Bast and offered the project to Columbia, who had made all Scheer's previous collaborations with Harryhausen. The studio turned it down but Warner Bros agreed to finance. James O'Connelly signed to direct. Harryhausen said they decided to keep the story's early 20th Century time period to eliminate the \\"cliches about the army moving in with tanks and missiles.\\" Newsom p 28 Gwangi was described in O'Brien's original script as an Allosaurus, although O'Brien apparently did not draw much distinction between Allosaurus and Tyrannosaurus, as he also referred to the Tyrannosaurus in the original King Kong (modeled by Marcel Delgado) as an \\"Allosaurus\\". According to Ray Harryhausen, his own version of Gwangi (and O'Brien's Gwangi too, as well as Delgado's Tyrannosaurus) was based on a Charles R. Knight painting of a Tyrannosaurus - one of the two most famous paintings by Knight, and one that is instantly recognizable by the eye being placed too far forward on the skull (this was based on concurrently incomplete skeletal remains and the eye was mistakenly placed in one of the antorbital fenestrae), as well as ultimately and incorrectly portraying Tyrannosaurus with a three-fingered hand. This famous Tyrannosaurus image is also reflected in Harryhausen's \\"Rhedosaurus\\" in The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms. In an interview featured on the 'Valley of Gwangi' DVD, Harryhausen said \\"We sometimes called it an Allosaurus... They're both meat eaters, they're both Tyrants... one was just a bit larger than the other.\\" Gwangi was scaled to be 14 feet tall, within the size range of an average adult Tyrannosaurus (although not the largest), and at the upper limit of the largest Allosaurus specimens. Special effects The Valley of Gwangi was the last dinosaur-themed film that Harryhausen animated, and he made much use of his experience in depicting extinct animals from his earlier films. Close to a year was spent on the special effects (there were more than 300 'Dynamation' cuts in the film, a record number for Harryhausen), with the roping of Gwangi being the most labor-intensive animated sequence. It was achieved by having the actors hold on to ropes tied to a \\"monster stick\\" that was in the back of a jeep. The jeep and stick when filmed with Gwangi are on a back rear projection plate and hidden by his body, and the portions of rope attached to his body are painted wires that are matched with the real ropes. The coordination of Gwangi's animation with live actors on horseback (and the horses appearing to react to Gwangi) was particularly difficult to film, and the source of an editorial lapse in a following scene. Gwangi bites through the ropes around his neck when first lassoed and later has his jaws roped together when unconscious. However, he is then shown being transported in a cart again held only by ropes around his neck but with jaws now un-bound. The first animated sequence in the film is a diving act done by T.J. and her horse. Because it was decided that it was too risky to have a rider and horse jump off a 40-foot high platform into a tank of water, a model horse and rider were used. After tempting Gila Golan's horse to jump from a mock-up platform onto a trampoline, the film cut to an animated model suspended on wires (actually it was just a tiny toy horse and rider bought in a toy store). The splash was real, triggered by an electric charge inside the tank. After local Gypsies steal the Eohippus, it is released back into the Forbidden Valley. For all the scenes where the cowboys are chasing the creature, the animated model was used. However, in one long shot, a baby goat was used instead because the model would have been too small. The pterosaurs were mistakenly given bat's wings (with elongate fingers supporting the membrane; pterosaurs had one finger forming the wing's leading edge but none on the membrane). The wings appear to mimic those of a pterosaur from an earlier Harryhausen film, One Million Years B.C. (1966). Close-up sequences of the pterosaurs in Gwangi were provided by life-size models. For the scene when Lope is snatched from his horse by the Pteranodon, the boy was raised by wires painted out in the studio and Harryhausen animated the eight-inch-high model pterosaur to correspond with his movements. However, once the creature gets up to a certain altitude the real boy was replaced with a model which was used until he crawls away from the creature which is being killed by Carlos on the ground. Bromley the paleontologist correctly identifies it as a pterodactyl (the classification of pterosaurs that Pteranodon is a part of) while he is inspecting it on the ground. The scene where Gwangi pounces on the Ornithomimus has been copied many times in dinosaur films, primarily in Jurassic Park, when the Tyrannosaurus pounces on the Gallimimus. The smaller dinosaur had never appeared on the film screen before and although its movements were unlikely it was one of Harryhausen's favorite sequences in the film. The battle between Gwangi and the Styracosaurus features battle moves such as biting, stabbing, butting, and pinning. After Gwangi is captured, he is wheeled back to town in a cart; and for several of the long shots of this scene the crew built and used a full-sized mock-up of Gwangi, again because an actual model would have been far too small. Harryhausen originally planned to have used a real elephant in some of the scenes for the fight with Gwangi. This did not work out because he wanted to have used a 15-foot tall elephant (the world's biggest elephant was two feet shorter than this). So the live 8-foot elephant was only used in the beginning when a woman is seen briefly riding on its back. For some of the elephant fight scenes Harryhausen used the animation table as the bullring floor.Excerpts taken from Ray Harryhausen: An Animated Life, ch 8, pgs 204-212) For Gwangi's death scene a number of special effects were used. When the torch hits the ground near Gwangi, the flames are seen quickly developing and surrounding Gwangi. The flames were added in by double printing the camera. The outside of the burning church was a mixture of composites: the lower half was the real church photographed on location in Spain, and the upper, burning half was a miniature, again added in by double printing the camera. The model of the Eohippus was supposed to have toes but appears to have regular hooves with 'toes' painted on (the sound effects of the animal moving also resemble hooves). The model of the Styracosaurus featured an inflatable air 'bladder' to simulate the animal breathing heavily after its combat with Gwangi (a feature first used in models made for much earlier films by Marcel Delgado). Some of the models used in the film were reused model armatures from earlier films. Gwangi, the Ornithomimus, and the Styracosaurus were all made from the Ceratosaurus, the Phorusrhacos and the Triceratops, who were stripped down and had their armatures modified for further use. The actual model of Gwangi was about 12 inches high and the Ornithomimus was about 5 inches high. A solid-latex, non-armatured model of Gwangi was also used for the scenes when he knocks himself out while trying to exit the valley in pursuit of the cowboys (but Harryhausen was never pleased with this, as the solid model did not look right). Cast Actress Gila Golan was cast at the insistence of Warner Bros. Her Israeli accent was so strong that all of her lines were redubbed on the film by a voice actress.Swires 67 Actor Laurence Naismith, who plays Professor Bromley, had earlier appeared in Harryhausen's Jason and the Argonauts as the shipbuilder Argos. =Location shooting= Interior of Cuenca Cathedral where the movie's climax takes place. The film was filmed in Almer√≠a and Cuenca, Spain. The bullring scenes were shot in Almer√≠a's Plaza de Toros and the finale at Cuenca's cathedral. Some scenes with dinosaurs like the Pteranodon scene or the fight between the Tyrannosaurus and Styracosaurus were filmed in Almer√≠a, in Tabernas Desert. The unusual rock formations of Ciudad Encantada near Cuenca were used for the forbidden valley.Silver Screen Spain: English Language Films Made in Spain, The Valley of Gwangi (1969) Scheer says the director \\"lost interest in the middle of shooting. I don't think he enjoyed it. He just didn't have his heart in it, when he was halfway through.\\" According to Bast, \\"the director was monumentally stupid.

I thought, 'This is going to be a mess.'\\" Reception =Box office= According to Harryhausen \\"we got trapped in a change of management shuffle at Warner Bros.

A lot of people who would have loved it never got a chance to see it, never knew it was playing.\\" \\"\\"The new administration didn't give it the kind of release I expected,\\" said Schneer. \\"They didn't know how to market our type of picture as well as Columbia did. It was their money and their property, and they did what they wanted. I had no rapport with that new management. There was nothing I could do to change their minds.\\" =Critical reception= Schneer later said he \\"wasn't very keen about\\" the film. \\"Because of the subject matter and the period in which it was set, it just didn't have the same appeal to me that our other pictures had. The central image of the cowboys roping the dinosaur was imaginative, but it didn't hold up for feature length.\\"Swires 68 Comic book adaption * Dell Movie Classic: The Valley of Gwangi (December 1969) Legacy By the time of the film's release, interest in monster movies of this type was waning. Management at Warner Bros. and Warner Bros.-Seven Arts also changed, and the film was released with little promotional effort on a double-bill with a biker film; it thus missed its target audience and was not as successful as earlier Harryhausen efforts, but has since become a cult classic. Among the critics, The New York Times called it a \\"generally run-of-the-mill monster rally.\\" The scene where Gwangi suddenly appears from behind a hill and snatches the fleeing Ornithomimus in his jaws was later copied in Steven Spielberg‚Äôs big- budget dinosaur film, Jurassic Park. During the 1980s hit TV series Scarecrow and Mrs. King, anytime a television was shown on in the series, The Valley of Gwangi was on the screen. In episode 2-28 (2000) of the American version of the TV series Whose Line Is It Anyway?, the scene of Tuck fighting the pterodactyl was used for the green screen video during the Newsflash segment. Artist Mark Cline's 2005 attraction Dinosaur Kingdom was inspired by The Valley of Gwangi. Justin Parpan's 2006 children's read-aloud book, Gwango's Lonesome Trail (Red Cygnet Press, Inc., ) features a prehistoric dinosaur named \\"Gwango\\" roaming the contemporary American Southwest. In the episode \\"The One Where Joey Speaks French\\" of the situation comedy Friends, Ross watches the film while in a hospital. In the 2011 animated film, Scooby-Doo! Legend of the Phantosaur, during a night time chase scene through the town a movie theater can be seen in the background playing two dinosaur-themed monster movies, The Valley of Gwangi and The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms (another Harryhausen film from Warner Bros). In July 2018, The Valley of Gwangi was shown at the Pickwick Theater in Park Ridge, Illinois as part of the G-Fest convention events going on in Rosemont, Illinois.

The most popular and developed model of OOP is a class-based model, instead of an object-based model. In this model, objects are entities that combine state (i.e., data), behavior (i.e., procedures, or methods) and identity (unique existence among all other objects). The structure and behavior of an object are defined by a class, which is a definition, or blueprint, of all objects of a specific type. An object must be explicitly created based on a class and an object thus created is considered to be an instance of that class. An object is similar to a structure, with the addition of method pointers, member access control, and an implicit data member which locates instances of the class (i.e., objects of the class) in the class hierarchy (essential for runtime inheritance features). Encapsulation Encapsulation prevents users from breaking the invariants of the class, which is useful because it allows the implementation of a class of objects to be changed for aspects not exposed in the interface without impact to user code. The definitions of encapsulation focus on the grouping and packaging of related information (cohesion) rather than security issues. OOP languages do not normally offer formal security restrictions to the internal object state. Using a method of access is a matter of convention for the interface design. Inheritance In class-based programming, inheritance is done by defining new classes as extensions of existing classes: the existing class is the parent class and the new class is the child class. If a child class has only one parent class, this is known as single inheritance, while if a child class can have more than one parent class, this is known as multiple inheritance. This organizes classes into a hierarchy, either a tree (if single inheritance) or lattice (if multiple inheritance). The defining feature of inheritance is that both interface and implementation are inherited; if only interface is inherited, this is known as interface inheritance or subtyping. Inheritance can also be done without classes, as in prototype-based programming. Critique of class-based models Class-based languages, or, to be more precise, typed languages, where subclassing is the only way of subtyping, have been criticized for mixing up implementations and interfaces--the essential principle in object-oriented programming. The critics say one might create a bag class that stores a collection of objects, then extend it to make a new class called a set class where the duplication of objects is eliminated. Now, a function that takes an object of the bag class may expect that adding two objects increases the size of a bag by two, yet if one passes an object of a set class, then adding two objects may or may not increase the size of a bag by two. The problem arises precisely because subclassing implies subtyping even in the instances where the principle of subtyping, known as the Liskov substitution principle, does not hold. Barbara Liskov and Jeannette Wing formulated the principle succinctly in a 1994 paper as follows: > Subtype Requirement: Let be a property provable about objects of type . Then > should be true for objects of type where is a subtype of . Thus, normally one must distinguish subtyping and subclassing. Most current object-oriented languages distinguish subtyping and subclassing, however some approaches to design do not. Also, another common example is that a person object created from a child class cannot become an object of parent class because a child class and a parent class inherit a person class but class- based languages mostly do not allow to change the kind of class of the object at runtime. For class-based languages, this restriction is essential in order to preserve unified view of the class to its users. The users should not need to care whether one of the implementations of a method happens to cause changes that break the invariants of the class. Such changes can be made by destroying the object and constructing another in its place. Polymorphism can be used to preserve the relevant interfaces even when such changes are done, because the objects are viewed as black box abstractions and accessed via object identity. However, usually the value of object references referring to the object is changed, which causes effects to client code. Example languages Although Simula introduced the class abstraction, the canonical example of a class-based language is Smalltalk. Others include PHP, C++, Java, C#, and Objective-C.

Journey to Salt Lake City After being converted by the Mormons, Emma Lee arrived in Chicago from England, then headed to Iowa, where she pushed a cart filled with goods given by her church and headed to Salt Lake City, Utah. She pushed the cart herself for the entire 1,400 mile walk, as one of the many Mormon handcart pioneers. She joined a company of her church's members for that trip, of which 150 died during snowstorms. Many others suffered other illness, such as frozen feet, noses and other diseases. Emma Lee helped care for them, eventually leading to most of them having a full recovery. During the trip, she also served as midwife to a pregnant woman, carrying her in the cart as the woman was close to delivering. Life with John D. Lee Upon arriving in Salt Lake City, she worked for seven years as an indentured servant to pay for her trip from England. Afterwards, she met John D. Lee, a prominent man among Latter-day Saints members. Brigham Young himself married the couple on January 7, 1858. Emma was John‚Äôs 17th wife. John D. Lee is said to have participated in a massacre of California immigrants (see: Mountain Meadows massacre) that left 140 people dead. For this, John and Emma Lee were followed by federal marshals for about twenty years. At one time John Lee was tried but was freed after a hung jury. In 1868, George Hicks, a columnist from Harmony, Utah, wrote in a local newspaper that the Lees had to leave town in ten days or John would be hanged. Emma then spoke personally with George Hicks, warning him not to keep making threats against her and her husband. Hicks relented, never speaking against the Lees on his column again. He did, however, complain about the Lees to the town's Bishop, who proposed that Hicks and Lee should be baptized together. Emma Lee agreed, but not without complaining; she told the bishop she'd do it \\"seeing that (the bishop) are so inconsiderate as to require a woman to be immersed when the water is full of snow and that too for defending the rights of her husband\\". She continued on, saying: \\"Perhaps if (the bishop's) backside gets wet in ice water (he) will be more careful how (he) decide again\\". Impressed by her speech, the bishop then agreed not to go on with the baptism. John D. Lee was ordered to carry out important tasks for the Mormons, and, in 1871, he was sent to the Colorado River, near the border between Arizona and Utah, to establish a ferry service, in a location now known as Lee's Ferry. Because, under Mormon doctrine, John Doyle Lee was allowed to have multiple wives, he had to travel much of the time, to attend to his other wives and children. Lee often left to visit his \\"gold mines.\\" As a consequence, Emma Lee was left to attend both the ferry and her children. When Emma Lee left Lonely Dell after Lee's death, she had several coffee cans of gold. At one time there was a gold map showing the location of the mine which is now under Lake Powell. In 1873, a settlement of Navajos came to camp near the Lee home. Fearful for her children's fate, she decided to befriend the Navajos, and discovered that the tribe's chief was a friend of her husband's. They spent one night at the Navajo camp, after which the Indians left. At one time, a Navajo Chief came into Emma's lodge to attack her, but Emma had a steaming pot of water on the stove. She threw the hot water into his face. Later the chief came back and apologized and asked medical attention for the burns. Afterwards, he told his tribe that Emma was a very powerful woman and had a great spirit and to leave her alone. Another time, a group of warriors camped nearby, Emma heard them talking about killing her and the children. She took the children and camped with the Navajos. They were amazed she knew their language . Later that year, Emma Lee gave birth to her sixth baby. With John Doyle gone, she had to ask the oldest person besides her at the Lee house, her son John Jr., to help her cut the umbilical cord. They did this task to perfection, and a daughter was safely born. John Doyle Lee was caught by the US Army, tried again for the Meadow Mountain Massacre, found guilty, and shot by a firing squad on March 23, 1877, and buried at the site of the massacre. With small children and economically in need, Emma Lee sold the ferry to the LDS Church for 100 milk cows in 1879. She was helped by a Civil War veteran, Franklin French. French was a wandering gold prospector. Life with Franklin French On August 9, 1879, Emma Lee and French married, in Snowflake, Arizona. They found a home near Holbrook, Arizona. They next moved to the White Mountains, but their ranch was just out the reservation. The White Mountain Apaches had an uprising in 1882 and killed 150 settlers that night. Emma was warned just before the attack on her ranch and was able to escape with her children and some ranch hands. She heard the shooting of the livestock and saw the smoke from the burning buildings. Later French sued the government for $10,000 for the loss of the ranch, but the land was resurveyed and was found to be on Apache land. In 1887 she and Franklin moved to Winslow, Arizona, and established a dairy ranch. At that time the Santa Fe railroad was being built. Many times the railroad would send a special train to bring Emma to help take care of the railroad workers injuries. She was known as \\"Dr. French\\" although she had no official medical title, because of her ability to cure the ill. She helped multiple women, including Navajos and prostitutes, give birth. In 1888, her daughter, Victoria Lee, committed suicide. In 1892, her son Ike confronted a man who was trying to seduce his wife and was murdered by the man. Death In November 1897, as her husband was on an expedition looking for gold, she had a premonition of her own death. When French returned on November 16, the next day she was fixing breakfast and said \\"I don't feel too well\\" and suffered a heart attack. A crowd of businessmen, Navajos and prostitutes kept vigil outside her home as she lay in bed dying that night. Her funeral was one of the largest held in Winslow. The Santa Fe stopped their trains for a tribute to her. Her tombstone is in the old cemetery in Winslow, Arizona, marked \\"Dr. French\\".

The Beast from Space) is a 1957 American horror science fiction monster film directed by Nathan H. Juran and starring William Hopper, Joan Taylor, and Frank Puglia. It was produced by Charles H. Schneer's Morningside Productions for Columbia Pictures. The screenplay was written by Bob Williams and Christopher Knopf from an original treatment by Charlott Knight. As with several other Schneer-Columbia collaborations, the film was developed to showcase the stop-motion animation of Ray Harryhausen. Plot The first U.S. spaceship to Venus, the XY-21, crashes into the Mediterranean sea off the coast of Sicily, Italy as fishermen watch. They row to the spacecraft, enter through a hole in the spacecraft and pull two spacemen from the nose-down craft before it completely sinks. In Washington, D.C., Major General A.D. McIntosh discovers that the missing spaceship, piloted by Colonel Bob Calder, has been located. As McIntosh flies to the site, Pepe, a little boy, finds and opens a translucent cylinder marked ‚ÄúUSAF‚Äù on the beach. It contains a gelatinous mass, which he sells to Dr. Leonardo, a zoologist studying sea creatures. Meanwhile, Leonardo's granddaughter Marisa, a third-year medical student, is summoned to take care of the injured spacemen. When Calder regains consciousness, he finds his crewmate, Dr. Sharman, in the last throes of the fatal disease that killed his other eight crewmen. After Marisa returns to the trailer shared with her grandfather, a small creature hatches from the mass, and Leonardo locks it in a cage. By morning, the creature has tripled in size. McIntosh arrives, accompanied by scientist Dr. Justin Uhl, and meets with two representatives of the Italian government, informing them the spaceship has returned from Venus. Leonardo and Marisa hitch the trailer to their truck and head for Rome. Calder's spacecraft carried a sealed metal container bearing an unborn Venusians species. As police divers begin to search for it, McIntosh offers a half-million lira reward for the capsule's recovery, prompting Pepe to lead them to the empty container. When Pepe tells them that he sold the mass to Dr. Leonardo, McIntosh and Calder pursue him. That night, Leonardo discovers that the creature has grown to human size. Soon after, it breaks out of the cage and heads to a nearby farm, terrorizing the animals. The creature eats sulfur and rips open several bags it discovers in a barn. While feeding, the creature is attacked by the farmer's dog, and the creature kills the dog, alerting the farmer. Calder and the others reach the barn, trapping the creature inside. Calder explains that the creature is not dangerous unless provoked. However, he provokes it by trying to prod the creature with a pole into a cage-like cart, and the creature injures the farmer after he stabs the creature with a pitchfork. After the creature breaks out of the barn and disappears into the countryside, the police commissioner insists that it must be destroyed. After the Italian government grants Calder permission to capture the creature alive, he devises a plan to ensnare it in a giant electric net dropped from a helicopter. The Italian police conduct their own pursuit, shooting at it with flamethrowers. Gunfire has little effect on the creature, as it has no heart or lungs. Aware that sulfur is the creature's food of choice, Calder uses bags of sulfur as bait, luring the creature to a secluded site and subduing it with an electric jolt from the net. Later, at the American Embassy in Rome, McIntosh briefs the press corps and allows three reporters to view the creature, which has been placed in the Rome zoo. There, Calder explains that the creature is being sedated with a continuous electric shock so it can be studied. Marisa, who is aiding her uncle, begins flirting with Calder. Suddenly, electrical equipment shorts out and the creature awakens. The fully grown ymir from 20 Million Miles to Earth. The creature battles a zoo elephant and sends the panicked patrons scurrying. Taking their fight to the streets of Rome, the two beasts destroy cars and damage buildings. The creature finally kills the elephant and continues its rampage. Calder rams the creature with his car and tracks the creature to the River Tiber, where it submerges. Soldiers lob grenades into the river, and the creature surfaces, now gargantuan in size. It heads for the Colosseum and destroys an ancient temple, killing a few soldiers. As the creature disappears into the ruins, Calder charges after it with a group of bazooka-carrying soldiers, driving it to the top of the structure. Calder scores a direct bazooka hit. Direct fire from a tank then destroys the ledge the creature is clinging to, and it plunges to its death. A relieved Marisa runs into Calder's arms.

Rome was chosen as the location for filming because Harryhausen wanted to vacation there. The working title of the film was The Giant Ymir, and it has also been released as The Beast from Space. All references to the name Ymir were removed from the released version of the film, as Harryhausen was concerned that audiences might confuse it with the Arabic title \\"Emir\\". Most of the noises made by Ymir are recordings of elephant noises played at a higher speed. Ray Harryhausen wanted the film to be shot in color, but the filmmakers were not given a budget large enough to accommodate color filming. In 2007, five years after the death of the film's director, Harryhausen worked with restoration and colorization company Legend Films to create a colorized version of the film. That version, along with the original theatrical black-and-white version, was released on July 31, 2007 on DVD as part of a 50th Anniversary Edition of the film. There are minor differences between the two versions. One example: the black-and-white version begins in \\"A Fishing Village in Sicily\\" (the fictional Gerra), not Sperlonga, Italy. It was the first of three collaborations between Harryhausen, Schneer, and Nathan Juran. Juran only directed the American sequences, while Schneer and Harryhausen directed the Italian sequences. Reception 20 Million Miles to Earth has an 80% positive rating at the film review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, based on ten reviews. Marco Lanzagorta of PopMatters gave the film 9 out of 10 stars, calling it \\"required viewing for those interested in modern cinema\\". Time Out wrote, \\"Don't worry about the dotty script or cardboard performances - just sit back and watch this gelatinous blob in action\\"; while the Radio Times called it \\"one of animation master Ray Harryhausen's best fantasy films, and his own personal favourite. The snake-tailed giant ymir creature is also one of Harryhausen's finest creations: It has a well-defined personality and manages to evoke sympathy for its bewildered plight. The ymir's fight with an elephant and the Roman locations - especially the climactic Colosseum battle - add unique touches to this minor classic\\". Legacy The four-issue comic book mini- series 20 Million Miles More (2008), released by TidalWave Productions as part of their Ray Harryhausen Signature Series, picked up the story 50 years after the events of the film. A preview of the first issue was included on the 50th Anniversary DVD release of the film.

You start from a standstill, and move the stick up to accelerate, down to decelerate, right and left move the car sideways. The object is to keep driving for as long as possible, without crashing into any of the other cars. If you ever slow to a stop then your car gets run over. =Spin-out= Spin-out is a two- player game, in which each player controls a car around a loop of racetrack. The winner is the one who completes three or fifteen laps the fastest, there are time penalties for crashing into a wall or spinning when hit by the other car. =Cryptogram= Cryptogram is also for two players, one types in a message of up to fourteen characters, then hits enter to scramble it.

In the Bible, it is frequently a reference to Hadad, although it is sometimes used to refer to other specific deities, including Yahweh, and on other occasions is used to refer to an arbitrary lord of this area. The following is an alphabetical list of names referring Ba'al, and their meanings in Hebrew: :Baal - master; lord :Baalah - her lord; she that is governed or subdued; a spouse :Baalath - a rejoicing; our proud lord :Baalath- Beer - subjected pit :Baal-berith - lord of the covenant :Baale - same as Baalath :Baal-gad - lord Gad, or lord of Gad, or lord of fortune/felicity :Baal-hamon - he who rules a crowd :Baal-hanan - Ba'al is gracious :Baal- hermon - lord of destruction / of a cursed-thing :Baali - my lord; lord over me :Baalim - lords; masters; (later Jewish use: false gods) :Baalis - a rejoicing/proud lord :Baal-meon - lord/master of the house :Baal-Peor - master of Peor; master of the opening :Baal-perazim - lord of divisions :Baal- shalisha - the lord that presides over three; the third idol :Baal-tamar - master of the palm-tree :Baal-zebub - lord of the fly (satirical corruption of Ba'al-zebul - lord of princes) :Baal-zephon - the lord/possession of the north/hidden/secret :Jerub-baal the lord contends =Bosheth= In later biblical and Jewish writing, some of the theophories in Ba'al were bowdlerised, with ba'al replaced by bosheth ((the) shameful (thing)): :Ishbosheth, from Ishba'al, man of ba'al. :Jerubbeshet, from Jerubbaal \\"Ba'al contends\\" Yam theophory Yam is the Canaanite god of the Sea. :Abiyam - My father is Yam (1 Kgs. 14:31) Zedek theophory Zedek (or Sydyk or Sedek) was the name of a Phoenician deity worshiped in Canaan.

Pickaxe Pete was designed by Ed Averett, who wrote the majority of the games for the system. A U.S. national competition, \\"The Pick Axe Pete Pick-Off,\\" was held at the World's Fair in October 1982. Gameplay The player controls a miner named Pickaxe Pete, and starts off in the middle of the screen with a pick-axe. There are three doors from which boulders are coming, bouncing down the mine- shafts; every time Pete destroys one of these he gains 3 points, although the axe wears out after a while and disappears. When two boulders collide, they explode, and out comes either a pick-axe which floats to the bottom of the screen, a key which floats to the top, or nothing. If Pete has no axe, the player can either jump over boulders (gaining him 1 point), or get to the bottom of the mine to retrieve a new axe (gaining a 5-point bonus). If Pete collects a key then he can enter the doors, which lead him to the next level.

In North America for the Magnavox Odyssey 2 it was called K.C. Munchkin!, an inside reference to then president of Philips Consumer Electronics Kenneth C. Menkin. Designed and programmed by Ed Averett, Munchkin is very heavily based on Namco's 1980 arcade game Pac-Man, but not a direct clone. It was, however, similar enough for Atari to sue Philips and force them to cease production of Munchkin. Atari was exclusively licensed to produce the first play-at-home version of Pac-Man, but Munchkin hit store shelves in 1981, a year before Atari's game was ready. Atari initially failed to convince a U.S. district court to halt the sale of Munchkin, but ultimately won its case on appeal. In 1982, the appellate court found that Philips had copied Pac-Man and made alterations that \\"only tend to emphasize the extent to which it deliberately copied the Plaintiff's work.\\" The ruling was one of the first to establish how copyright law would apply to the look and feel of computer software.Legal Battles that Shaped the Computer Industry, by Lawrence D. Graham; published 1999 by Quorum Books; via Google Books  Gameplay differences  Munchkin plays much like Pac-Man, with the following key differences: * There are only 12 pills (called munchies) in each maze, which begin in four groups of three but move through the maze independently and at speeds that increase as each one is eaten. The final munchie moves at the same speed as the Munchkin and must be intercepted rather than followed. * The super-pills are called blinking munchies because they flash and change colour. * Some of the mazes become invisible as soon as the player starts moving. * It has a programmable mode, where the player can create mazes. * It has a random mode, where a new map is generated each time the game is played. * The box where eaten ghosts regenerate rotates, so the ghosts may exit from any side. Also, the player character is free to enter the box and, if powered up, can consume new monsters at the moment they regenerate. Although the box is always at the center of any maze, the maze design allows walls to be placed against the box so it doubles as a revolving door and danger zone to pass through. * The ghosts are called munchers, and the player's character is called Munchkin. * There are three munchers rather than four ghosts. * Compared with the Atari 2600 version of Pac-Man, Munchkin has fewer objects on the game board but renders them with more color and animation. * When the Munchkin is killed by the munchers, the score resets itself back to zero. After Munchkin was forced off the market, Philips released a sequel called K.C.'s Krazy Chase! (Crazy Chase outside the U.S.) which implicitly depicts the conflict between Phillips and Atari by pitting the Munchkin character against an insectoid, tree-eating opponent called the Dratapillar, which very strongly resembles the antagonist of Atari's Centipede. In Crazy Chase's maze, the Munchkin character powers up and advances not by eating pills, but by devouring the Dratapillar's segmented body. Redesigned to avoid another copyright dispute, the Munchkin character rolls through Crazy Chase's mazes without the continuous chomping motion characteristic of Pac-Man.

A promise may be illusory for a number of reasons. In common law countries this usually results from failure or lack of consideration (see also consideration under English law). Illusory promises are so named because they merely hold the illusion of contract. For example, a promise of the form, \\"I will give you ten dollars if I feel like it,\\" is purely illusory and will not be enforced as a contract. It is a general principle of contract law that courts should err on the side of enforcing contracts.Kirby J in Biotechnology Australia Pty Ltd v Pace (1988) 15 NSWLR 130 Parties entering into the arrangement presumably had the intention of forming an enforceable contract, and so courts generally attempt to follow this intention.See Portland Gasoline Co. v. Superior Marketing Co., 150 Tex. 533, 243 S.W.2d 823, 824, (1951), overruled on other grounds by Northern Natural Gas Co. v. Conoco, Inc., 986 S.W.2d. 603 (Tex. 1998). A promise conditioned upon an event within the promisor's control is not illusory if the promisor also \\"impliedly promises to make reasonable effort to bring the event about or to use good faith and honest judgment in determining whether or not it has in fact occurred.\\"1 Corbin on Contracts, s 149, at 659. Methods of finding potentially illusory contracts enforceable include: * Implied-in-law \\"good faith\\" terms * Implied-in-fact terms * Bargaining for a chance Implied-in-law \\"good faith\\" terms Many contracts include \\"satisfaction clauses\\", in which a promisor can refuse to pay if he isn't subjectively satisfied with the promisee's performance. Strictly speaking, this is an illusory promise, since the promisor has no actual legal burden to pay if he chooses not to. However, courts will generally imply in law that the promisor must act in good faith and reject the deal only if he is genuinely dissatisfied. As another example, if a contract promises a promisee a certain percentage of the proceeds of a promisor's business activities, this is illusory, since the promisor doesn't have to do anything: any percentage of zero is zero. However, courts may find that the promisor made an implied promise to use reasonable efforts to try to make money, and cite him for breach of contract if he does absolutely nothing.See Wood v. Lucy, Lady Duff- Gordon, 222 N.Y. 88, 118 N.E. 214 (1917). The U.C.C. in contracts exclusive to both sides requires \\"best efforts\\" in such contracts. This may be read to be the same as a good faith effort, but is seen by some courts as a higher duty. Implied-in-fact terms Judges will often infer terms into the contract that the parties did not explicitly cite. For instance, in the \\"satisfaction clause\\" case, judges might infer that the parties intended a \\"reasonableness test\\" - that the clause could be satisfied if a reasonable person would be satisfied by the promisee's performance, regardless of whether the promisor himself asserts he is satisfied. (This interpretation is often used in cases in which a performance can be objectively evaluated, such as with the construction of a warehouse; the implied-in-law interpretation above is preferred where satisfaction is more subjective, as with the painting of a portrait.) Bargaining for a chance Many judges would consider the \\"bargaining for a percentage of the proceeds\\" example above an enforceable contract, even without an implied-in-fact or implied-in-law good faith term. They would view the opportunity to enter into a business relationship to itself be acceptable consideration. Put differently, the mere possibility that the promisor would do business is a valuable product of the bargain even if he does not do anything. Of course, if the promisor entered into the relationship purely with the intent of fraudulently harming the promisee, he could be cited for fraud or bad faith principles that apply to all contracts. Changes to a \\"contract\\" without notification The \\"terms and conditions\\" of some websites and Software applications may be deemed an illusory contract and unenforceable if the language can be changed at any time by the company without notifying users and giving them a chance to accept the new changes.Harris v.

Tsui's areas of research include electrical properties of thin films and microstructures of semiconductors and solid-state physics. Tsui shared the 1998 Nobel Prize in Physics with Robert B. Laughlin and Horst L. St√∂rmer \\"for their discovery of a new form of quantum fluid with fractionally charged excitations.\\" Biography Tsui was born into a humble Chinese family with two illiterate parents in Fanzhuang (), Henan, China, on February 28th, 1939. Born in the midst of the Japanese invasion of China during the Second World War, Tsui described his early childhood memories as being \\"filled with the years of drought, flood and war which were constantly on the consciousness of the inhabitants of my over-populated village.\\" In 1951, Tsui left for Hong Kong to attend Pui Ching Middle School in Kowloon, beginning his formal education at the level of sixth grade in his second year in Hong Kong. Tsui recalled facing difficulties due to his lack of familiarity with Cantonese dialect. Due to the war, many teachers at Pui Ching were graduates from China's most distinguished universities, such as Peking University, who otherwise would have likely been esteemed academics and scientists. Upon graduating in 1957, Tsui was admitted to the National Taiwan University Medical School, but due to uncertainties over whether he would be able to return to his family in China, he remained in Hong Kong to enroll in Special Classes Centre, a special two-year government program intended to prepare high school graduates for entrance into the University of Hong Kong. While preparing for the entrance examination to the University of Hong Kong in spring of 1958, Tsui was awarded a full scholarship to attend Augustana College, his church pastor's Lutheran alma mater in the United States. Accepting the scholarship, Tsui arrived at Augustana College just after Labor Day of 1958. After spending three years at Augustana College, Tsui graduated Phi Beta Kappa in 1961 as the only student of Chinese descent in his college. Tsui continued his study in physics at the University of Chicago, from where he received his Ph.D. in physics in 1967 after completing a doctoral dissertation, titled \\"de Haas-van Alphen effect and electronic band structure of nickel\\", under the supervision of Royal Stark. He remarked that due to the influence of prominent Chinese theoretical physicists and Nobel laureates C. N. Yang and T. D. Lee, both of whom studied at the University of Chicago, he had always knew that he wanted to pursue graduate studies in physics at the institution. While a graduate student at the University of Chicago, Tsui met Linda Varland, who was an undergraduate student there at the time, and the two married after the latter's graduation. Tsui is a naturalized U.S. citizen. Tsui and Varland have two daughters, Aileen and Judith. Judith graduated magna cum laude from Princeton University with an B.A. in anthropology in 1991 and is now an associate professor of medicine at the University of Washington School of Medicine. After receiving his Ph.D. and then remaining in Chicago for a year of postdoctoral research, Tsui joined the research staff at Bell Laboratories to perform research in solid state physics in 1968. At Bell Laboratories, instead of studying main stream topics of interest in semiconductor physics such as optics and high energy band- structures or their applications in devices, Tsui devoted his attention to a new field called the physics of two-dimensional electrons. Tsui and St√∂rmer made the groundbreaking discovery of the fractional quantum Hall effect in 1982, while Laughlin provided a theoretical interpretation for the discovery the following year. This discovery will eventually be the reason of their winning of the 1998 Nobel Prize in Physics. Shortly after the discovery, Tsui departed from Bell Laboratories and joined the faculty of the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at Princeton University with the support of two Nobel laureates in February of 1982. After 28 years at Princeton, Tsui transferred to emeritus status in 2010. He was also an adjunct senior research scientist in the physics department of Columbia University, and a research professor at Boston University. Tsui is one of the 20 American recipients of the Nobel Prize in Physics to sign a letter addressed to President George W. Bush in May of 2008, urging him to \\"reverse the damage done to basic science research in the Fiscal Year 2008 Omnibus Appropriations Bill\\" by requesting additional emergency funding for the Department of Energy‚Äôs Office of Science, the National Science Foundation, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology.

Conway. It is discussed in chapter 18 of Winning Ways for Your Mathematical Plays. This article summarizes that chapter. The two players take turns naming positive integers greater than 1 that are not the sum of nonnegative multiples of previously named integers. The player who cannot name such a number loses. For instance, if player A opens with 2, B can win by naming 3. Sylver coinage is named after James Joseph Sylvester, who proved that if a and b are relatively prime positive integers, then (a ‚àí 1)(b ‚àí 1) ‚àí 1 is the largest number that is not a sum of nonnegative multiples of a and b. Thus, if a and b are the first two moves in a game of sylver coinage, this formula gives the largest number that can still be played. More generally, if the greatest common divisor of the moves played so far is g, then only finitely many multiples of g can remain to be played, and after they are all played then g must decrease on the next move. Therefore, every game of sylver coinage must eventually end. When a sylver coinage game has only a finite number of remaining moves, the largest number that can still be played is called the Frobenius number, and finding this number is called the coin problem.  Example  A sample game between A and B: * A opens with 5. Now neither player can name 5, 10, 15, .... * B names 4. Now neither player can name 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, or any number greater than 11. * A names 11. Now the only remaining numbers are 2, 3, 6, and 7. * B names 6. Now the only remaining numbers are 2, 3, and 7. * A names 7. Now the only remaining numbers are 2, and 3. * B names 2. Now the only remaining numbers is 3. * A names 3, leaving nothing for B, and wins. Each of A's moves was to a winning position. Analysis Unlike many similar mathematical games, sylver coinage has not been completely solved, mainly because many positions have infinitely many possible moves. Furthermore, the main theorem that identifies a class of winning positions, due to R. L. Hutchings, guarantees that such a position has a winning strategy but does not identify the strategy. Hutchings's Theorem states that any of the prime numbers 5, 7, 11, 13, ‚Ä¶, wins as a first move, but very little is known about the subsequent winning moves: these are the only winning openings known. When the greatest common divisor of the moves that have been made so far is 1, the remaining set of numbers that can be played will be a finite set, and can be described mathematically as the set of gaps of a numerical semigroup. Some of these finite positions, including all of the positions after the second player has responded to one of Hutchings' winning moves, allow a special move that Sicherman calls an \\"ender\\". An ender is a number that may only be played immediately: playing any other number would rule it out. If an ender exists, it is always the largest number that can still be played. For instance, after the moves (4,5), the largest number that can still be played is 11. Playing 11 cannot rule out any smaller numbers, but playing any of the smaller available numbers (1, 2, 3, 6, or 7) would rule out playing 11, so 11 is an ender. When an ender exists, the next player can win by following a strategy-stealing argument. If one of the non-ender moves can win, the next player takes that winning move. And if none of the non-ender moves wins, then the next player can win by playing the ender and forcing the other player to make one of the other non-winning moves. However, although this argument proves that the next player can win, it does not identify a winning strategy for the player. After playing a prime number that is 5 or larger as a first move, the first player in a game of sylver coinage can always win by following this (non- constructive) ender strategy on their next turn. If there are any other winning openings, they must be 3-smooth numbers (numbers of the form for non- negative integers and ). For, if any number that is not of this form and is not prime is played, then the second player can win by choosing a large prime factor of . The first few 3-smooth numbers, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, and 12, are all losing openings, for which complete strategies are known by which the second player can win. By Dickson's lemma (applied to the pairs of exponents of these numbers), only finitely many 3-smooth numbers can be winning openings, but it is not known whether any of them are. offered a $1000 prize for determining who wins in the first unsolved case, the opening move 16, as part of a set of prize problems also including Conway's 99-graph problem, the minimum spacing of Danzer sets, and the thrackle conjecture.

Vicky Walsh argued for the existence of \\"exo-artifacts\\" using the principle of mediocrity and the Drake equation. She proposed that a theoretical and speculative field of archaeology be established in order to test outlandish claims, and to prepare for a time when undeniably extraterrestrial artifacts needed to be analysed. \\"If it is possible to construct an abstract archaeology that can be tested and refined on earth and then applied to areas beyond our planet, then the claims for ETI remains on the moon and Mars may really be evaluated in light of established archaeological theory and analysis\\".Walsh, Vicky, 2002, The case for exo- archaeology, in Miles Russell (ed), Digging Holes in Popular Culture, Bournemouth University School of Conservation Sciences Occasional Paper 7, Oxbow Books, Oxford, pp. 121‚Äì8. Ben McGee similarly proposed the creation of a set of interdisciplinary, proactive xenoarchaeological guidelines, arguing that identifying suspected artifacts of astrobiology is all that is required to justify establishing a methodology for xenoarchaeology. He emphasized the necessity of proactive xenoarchaeological work in order to avoid future bias, mischaracterization, and information mismanagement, and he cites three scenarios under which such a methodology or set of guidelines would be useful, those being \\"remote sensing\\" of a potential xenoarchaeologial artifact, encountering an artifact during \\"human exploration,\\" and \\"terrestrial interception\\" of an artifact.

Planetary SETI Planetary SETI is concerned with the search for extraterrestrial structures on the surface of bodies in the Solar System. Claims for evidence of extraterrestrial artifacts can be divided into three groups, the Moon, Mars, and the other planets and their satellites.

These controversial \\"structures\\" (such as the Face on Mars) are not accepted as more than natural features by most scientists, examples of the pareidolia phenomenon. Palaeocontact or ancient astronaut theories, espoused by Erich von D√§niken and others, are further examples of fringe theories. These claim that the Earth was visited in prehistoric times by extraterrestrial beings. Science fiction Xenoarchaeological themes are common in science fiction. Works about the exploration of enigmatic extraterrestrial artifacts have been satirically categorized as Big Dumb Object stories. Some of the more prominent examples of xenoarchaeological fiction include Arthur C. Clarke's novel Rendezvous with Rama, H. Beam Piper's short story Omnilingual, and Charles Sheffield's Heritage Universe series. Jack McDevitt's science fiction novels often revolve around human or alien historical and archaeological mysteries. The plot of the video game Mass Effect revolves around technologies in the form of structures, transportation, buildings and machines left behind by an extinct alien race. The primary setting of Halo: Combat Evolved takes place on a massive structure created by an ancient, extinct alien super race. These structures feature prominently in the sequels Halo 2, Halo 3, and Halo 4. In the video game Borderlands, and its sequels, the Atlas corporation started mining the planet Pandora after finding evidence of an ancient material called Eridium. This material was supposedly created by extraterrestrial creatures or is a natural product of long-term planetary production. In the video game Stellaris, players can often find extraterrestrial artifacts from an extinct civilization before actually encountering native spaceborne creatures or other present-day extraterrestrial civilizations. =Novels= * Gateway by Fred Pohl * Noon Universe by Strugatsky brothers. * 2001: A Space Odyssey by Arthur C.

The connected elements (typically straight) may be stressed from tension, compression, or sometimes both in response to dynamic loads. The basic types of truss bridges shown in this article have simple designs which could be easily analyzed by 19th and early 20th-century engineers. A truss bridge is economical to construct because it uses materials efficiently.  Design  The integral members of a truss bridgeScience and Industry, Members of a Truss Bridge by Benj. F. La Rue, Home Study Magazine, Published by the Colliery Engineer Company, Vol 3, No. 2, March 1898, pages 67-68. The nature of a truss allows the analysis of its structure using a few assumptions and the application of Newton's laws of motion according to the branch of physics known as statics. For purposes of analysis, trusses are assumed to be pin jointed where the straight components meet. This assumption means that members of the truss (chords, verticals and diagonals) will act only in tension or compression. A more complex analysis is required where rigid joints impose significant bending loads upon the elements, as in a Vierendeel truss. In the bridge illustrated in the infobox at the top, vertical members are in tension, lower horizontal members in tension, shear, and bending, outer diagonal and top members are in compression, while the inner diagonals are in tension. The central vertical member stabilizes the upper compression member, preventing it from buckling. If the top member is sufficiently stiff then this vertical element may be eliminated. If the lower chord (a horizontal member of a truss) is sufficiently resistant to bending and shear, the outer vertical elements may be eliminated, but with additional strength added to other members in compensation. The ability to distribute the forces in various ways has led to a large variety of truss bridge types. Some types may be more advantageous when wood is employed for compression elements while other types may be easier to erect in particular site conditions, or when the balance between labor, machinery and material costs have certain favorable proportions. The inclusion of the elements shown is largely an engineering decision based upon economics, being a balance between the costs of raw materials, off-site fabrication, component transportation, on-site erection, the availability of machinery and the cost of labor. In other cases the appearance of the structure may take on greater importance and so influence the design decisions beyond mere matters of economics. Modern materials such as prestressed concrete and fabrication methods, such as automated welding, and the changing price of steel relative to that of labor have significantly influenced the design of modern bridges. = Model bridges = A pure truss can be represented as a pin-jointed structure, one where the only forces on the truss members are tension or compression, not bending. This is used in the teaching of statics, by the building of model bridges from spaghetti. Spaghetti is brittle and although it can carry a modest tension force, it breaks easily if bent. A model spaghetti bridge thus demonstrates the use of a truss structure to produce a usefully strong complete structure from individually weak elements. History in the United States Warren-type through-truss of the former Seaboard Air Line Railway, located near the village of Willow, Florida; abandoned since the mid-1980s Because wood was in abundance, early truss bridges would typically use carefully fitted timbers for members taking compression and iron rods for tension members, usually constructed as a covered bridge to protect the structure. In 1820 a simple form of truss, Town's lattice truss, was patented, and had the advantage of requiring neither high labor skills nor much metal. Few iron truss bridges were built in the United States before 1850. Truss bridges became a common type of bridge built from the 1870s through the 1930s. Examples of these bridges still remain across the US, but their numbers are dropping rapidly, as they are demolished and replaced with new structures. As metal slowly started to replace timber, wrought iron bridges in the US started being built on a large scale in the 1870s. Bowstring truss bridges were a common truss design during this time, with their arched top chords. Companies like the Massillon Bridge Company of Massillon, Ohio and the King Bridge Company of Cleveland, Ohio became well-known, as they marketed their designs to cities and townships. The bowstring truss design (photo) fell out of favor due to a lack of durability, and gave way to the Pratt truss design, which was stronger. Again, the bridge companies marketed their designs, with the Wrought Iron Bridge Company in the lead. As the 1880s and 1890s progressed, steel began to replace wrought iron as the preferred material. Other truss designs were used during this time, including the camel-back. By the 1910s, many states developed standard plan truss bridges, including steel Warren pony truss bridges. As the 1920s and 1930s progressed, some states, such as Pennsylvania, continued to build steel truss bridges, including massive steel through-truss bridges for long spans. Other states, such as Michigan, used standard plan concrete girder and beam bridges, and only a limited number of truss bridges were built. Roadbed types The truss may carry its roadbed on top, in the middle, or at the bottom of the truss. Bridges with the roadbed at the top or the bottom are the most common as this allows both the top and bottom to be stiffened, forming a box truss. When the roadbed is atop the truss it is called a deck truss (an example of this was the I-35W Mississippi River bridge). When the truss members are both above and below the roadbed it is called a through truss (an example of this application is the Pulaski Skyway), and where the sides extend above the roadbed but are not connected, a pony truss or half-through truss. Sometimes both the upper and lower chords support roadbeds, forming a double-decked truss. This can be used to separate rail from road traffic or to separate the two directions of road traffic. Since through truss bridges have supports located over the bridge deck, they are susceptible to being hit by overheight loads when used on highways ‚Äì the I-5 Skagit River Bridge collapsed after such a strike, and such impacts were common and required frequent repairs before the collapse. =Gallery= Image:ErieCanalRRBridge04 1A.jpgDeck truss railroad bridge over the Erie Canal in Lockport, New York Image:General Hertzog Bridge over Orange River at Aliwal North.jpgThe four span through truss General Hertzog Bridge over the Orange River at Aliwal North carries vehicular traffic File:05-23-13 Skagit Bridge Collapse.jpgThe through truss Skagit River Bridge on Interstate 5 collapsed after an overhead support was hit by a passing truck File:Old San Jacinto River Truss Bridge -- Humble, Texas.jpgOld San Jacinto River Truss Bridge -- Humble, Texas Image:Puente Tacuaremb√≥ 02.jpgPony truss bridge of reinforced concrete Image:Sky gate bridge01s3200.jpgSky Gate Bridge R at Kansai International Airport, Osaka, Japan, is the longest double-decked truss bridge in the world.

There are many types, some of them dating back hundreds of years. Below are some of the more common designs. = Allan truss = Allan truss The Allan truss, designed by Percy Allan, is partly based on the Howe truss. The first Allan truss was completed on 13 August 1894 over Glennies Creek at Camberwell, New South Wales and the last Allan truss bridge was built over Mill Creek near Wisemans Ferry in 1929. Completed in March 1895, the Tharwa Bridge located at Tharwa, Australian Capital Territory, was the second Allan truss bridge to be built, the oldest surviving bridge in the Australian Capital Territory and the oldest, longest continuously used Allan truss bridge. Completed in November 1895, the Hampden Bridge in Wagga Wagga, New South Wales, Australia, the first of the Allan truss bridges with overhead bracing, was originally designed as a steel bridge but was constructed with timber to reduce cost. In his design, Allan used Australian ironbark for its strength. A similar bridge also designed by Percy Allen is the Victoria Bridge on Prince Street, Picton, New South Wales. Also constructed of ironbark, the bridge is still in use today for pedestrian and light traffic.Google-maps \\"-34.180255,150.610654\\" clearly shows bridge with traffic = Bailey truss = thumb Bailey truss over the Meurthe River, France The Bailey truss was designed by the British in 1940-1941 for military uses during World War II. A short selection of prefabricated modular components could be easily and speedily combined on land in various configurations to adapt to the needs at the site and allow rapid deployment of completed trusses. In the image, note the use of pairs of doubled trusses to adapt to the span and load requirements. In other applications the trusses may be stacked vertically, and doubled as necessary. = Baltimore truss = thumb The Baltimore truss is a subclass of the Pratt truss. A Baltimore truss has additional bracing in the lower section of the truss to prevent buckling in the compression members and to control deflection. It is mainly used for rail bridges, showing off a simple and very strong design. In the Pratt truss the intersection of the verticals and the lower horizontal tension members are used to anchor the supports for the short-span girders under the tracks (among other things). With the Baltimore truss, there are almost twice as many points for this to happen because the short verticals will also be used to anchor the supports. Thus the short-span girders can be made lighter because their span is shorter. A good example of the Baltimore truss is the Amtrak Old Saybrook ‚Äì Old Lyme Bridge. = Bollman truss = Bollman truss in Savage, Maryland. Built in 1869, moved to Savage in 1887. It is still in use today as a pedestrian bridge. The Bollman Truss Railroad Bridge at Savage, Maryland, is the only surviving example of a revolutionary design in the history of American bridge engineering. The type was named for its inventor, Wendel Bollman, a self- educated Baltimore engineer. It was the first successful all-metal bridge design (patented in 1852) to be adopted and consistently used on a railroad. The design employs wrought iron tension members and cast iron compression members. The use of multiple independent tension elements reduces the likelihood of catastrophic failure. The structure was also easy to assemble. The Wells Creek Bollman Bridge is the only other bridge designed by Wendel Bollman still in existence, but it is a Warren truss configuration. = Bowstring truss = Bowstring truss A bowstring truss bridge, in London, Ontario, Canada The bowstring truss bridge was patented in 1841 by Squire Whipple. While similar in appearance to a tied-arch bridge, a bowstring truss has diagonal load-bearing members: these diagonals result in a structure that more closely matches a Parker truss or Pratt truss than a true arch. =Brown truss= Brown truss In the Brown truss all vertical elements are under tension, with exception of the end posts. This type of truss is particularly suited for timber structures that use iron rods as tension members. =Brunel truss= See Lenticular truss below. =Burr arch truss= A covered bridge with a Burr arch truss structure (Baumgardener's Covered Bridge located in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania) This combines an arch with a truss to form a structure both strong and rigid. = Cantilever truss = Forth Bridge across the Firth of Forth in the east of Scotland Most trusses have the lower chord under tension and the upper chord under compression. In a cantilever truss the situation is reversed, at least over a portion of the span. The typical cantilever truss bridge is a \\"balanced cantilever\\", which enables the construction to proceed outward from a central vertical spar in each direction. Usually these are built in pairs until the outer sections may be anchored to footings. A central gap, if present, can then be filled by lifting a conventional truss into place or by building it in place using a \\"traveling support\\". In another method of construction, one outboard half of each balanced truss is built upon temporary falsework. When the outboard halves are completed and anchored the inboard halves may then be constructed and the center section completed as described above. = Fink truss = Fink truss (half span and cross section) The Fink truss was designed by Albert Fink of Germany in 1854. This type of bridge was popular with the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. The Appomattox High Bridge on the Norfolk and Western Railway included 21 Fink deck truss spans from 1869 until their replacement in 1886. There are also inverted Fink truss bridges such as the Moody Pedestrian Bridge in Austin, Texas. =Howe truss= Howe truss ‚Äì the diagonals are under compression under balanced loading The Howe truss, patented in 1840 by Massachusetts millwright William Howe, includes vertical members and diagonals that slope up towards the center, the opposite of the Pratt truss.Matsuo Bridge Company, Bridge Types ‚Äì Truss , accessed September 2007 In contrast to the Pratt truss, the diagonal web members are in compression and the vertical web members are in tension. Few of these bridges remain standing. Examples include Jay Bridge in Jay, New York; McConnell's Mill Covered Bridge in Slippery Rock Township, Pennsylvania; Sandy Creek Covered Bridge in Jefferson County, Missouri; and Westham Island Bridge in Delta, British Columbia.

Image:Westham island bridge.jpgWestham Island Bridge showing its wooden truss design. = K-truss = K-truss I-895 K-truss The K-truss is named after the K formed in each panel by the vertical member and two oblique members. Examples are the S√ºdbr√ºcke rail bridge over the River Rhine, Mainz, GermanyPanoramio- Reviewed 2020-03-23, the bridge on I-895 (Baltimore Harbor Tunnel Thruway) in Baltimore, Maryland, the Long‚ÄìAllen Bridge in Morgan City, Louisiana (Morgan City Bridge) with three 600-foot-long spans, and the Wax Lake Outlet bridge in Calumet, LouisianaHistoric Context for Louisiana Bridges- Retrieved 2020-03-23 (section 3, pp 71) = Kingpost truss = King post truss One of the simplest truss styles to implement, the king post consists of two angled supports leaning into a common vertical support. = Lattice truss (Town's lattice truss) = Lattice, or Warren quadrangular truss illustrated Plank lattice truss of a covered bridge This type of bridge uses a substantial number of lightweight elements, easing the task of construction. Truss elements are usually of wood, iron, or steel. = Lenticular truss = thumb The Ouellette Bridge or Aiken Street Bridge in Lowell, Massachusetts, built in 1883 by the Berlin Iron Bridge Co., is the longest lenticular truss bridge in the USA, with 5 spans, as well as the second-oldest lenticular truss bridge in Massachusetts. Royal Albert Bridge under construction, 1859 A lenticular truss bridge includes a lens-shape truss, with trusses between an upper chord (functioning as an arch) that curves up and then down to end points, and a lower chord (functioning as a suspension cable) that curves down and then up to meet at the same end points. Where the arches extend above and below the roadbed, it is called a lenticular pony truss bridge. The Pauli truss bridge is a specific variant of the lenticular truss, but the terms are not interchangeable. One type of lenticular truss consists of arcuate upper compression chords and lower eyebar chain tension links. Brunel's Royal Albert Bridge over the River Tamar between Devon and Cornwall uses a single tubular upper chord. As the horizontal tension and compression forces are balanced these horizontal forces are not transferred to the supporting pylons (as is the case with most arch types). This in turn enables the truss to be fabricated on the ground and then to be raised by jacking as supporting masonry pylons are constructed. This truss has been used in the construction of a stadium, with the upper chords of parallel trusses supporting a roof that may be rolled back. The Smithfield Street Bridge in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, is another example of this type. The old Gro√ühesselohe bridge before 1905, designed by Friedrich von Pauli An example of a lenticular pony truss bridge that uses regular spans of iron is the Turn-of-River Bridge designed and manufactured by the Berlin Iron Bridge Co.. The Pauli truss is a variant of the lenticular truss, \\"with the top chord carefully shaped so that it has a constant force along the entire length of the truss.\\" It is named after , whose 1857 railway bridge (the ) spanned the Isar near Munich. (See also Grosshesselohe Isartal station.) The term Pauli truss is not interchangeable with the term lenticular truss and, according to Thomas Boothby, the casual use of the term has clouded the literature. = Long truss = HAER diagram of a Long truss The Long truss was designed by Stephen H. Long in 1830. The design resembles a Howe truss, but is entirely made of wood instead of a combination of wood and metal.CoveredBridgeSite, Long truss The longest surviving example is the Eldean Covered Bridge north of Troy, Ohio, spanning .Eldean Covered Bridge ‚Äì Troy, Ohio ‚Äì Covered Bridges on. Waymarking.com. Retrieved on 2013-07-23. One of the earliest examples is the Old Blenheim Bridge, which with a span of and a total length of long was the second-longest covered bridge in the United States, until its destruction from flooding in 2011. The Busching bridge, often erroneously used as an example of a Long truss, is an example of a Howe truss, as the verticals are metal rods. = Parker (camelback) truss = thumb The Woolsey Bridge is an example of a Parker camelback truss A Parker truss bridge is a Pratt truss design with a polygonal upper chord. A \\"camelback\\" is a subset of the Parker type, where the upper chord consists of exactly five segments. An example of a Parker truss is the Traffic Bridge in Saskatoon, Canada. An example of a camelback truss is the Woolsey Bridge near Woolsey, Arkansas. = Partridge truss = Partridge truss design Designed and patented in 1872 by Reuben Partridge, after local bridge designs proved ineffective against road traffic and heavy rains.Kennedy, Willella Shearer. \\"Heritage: Being Little Stories of Union County\\". Union County Historical Society, Printed by The Marysville Journal Tribune. 1963. Pg. 48. It became the standard for covered bridges built in central Ohio in the late 1800s and early 1900s. = Pegram truss = Pegram truss The Pegram truss is a hybrid between the Warren and Parker trusses where the upper chords are all of equal length and the lower chords are longer than the corresponding upper chord. Because of the difference in upper and lower chord length, each panel is not square. The members which would be vertical in a Parker truss vary from near vertical in the center of the span to diagonal near each end (like a Warren truss). George H. Pegram, while the chief engineer of Edge Moor Iron Company in Wilmington, Delaware, patented this truss design in 1885. The Pegram truss consists of a Parker type design with the vertical posts leaning towards the center at an angle between 60 and 75¬∞. The variable post angle and constant chord length allowed steel in existing bridges to be recycled into a new span using the Pegram truss design. This design also facilitated reassembly and permitted a bridge to be adjusted to fit different span lengths. There are twelve known remaining Pegram span bridges in the United States with seven in Idaho, two in Kansas, and one each in California, Washington, and Utah. = Pennsylvania (Petit) truss = thumb The Fair Oaks Bridge is an example of Pennsylvania Petit truss bridge. The Pennsylvania (Petit) truss is a variation on the Pratt truss.Bridge Basics ‚Äì A Spotter's Guide The Pratt truss includes braced diagonal members in all panels; the Pennsylvania truss adds to this design half-length struts or ties in the top, bottom, or both parts of the panels. It is named after the Pennsylvania Railroad, which pioneered this design. It was once used for hundreds of bridges in the United States, but fell out of favor in the 1930s, and very few bridges of this design remain.National Register of Historic Places Registration Form for Healdsburg Memorial Bridge, California State Park System, accessed 2011-12-26. Examples of this truss type include the Lower Trenton Bridge in Trenton, New Jersey, the Schell Bridge in Northfield, Massachusetts, the Inclined Plane Bridge in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, the Easton‚ÄìPhillipsburg Toll Bridge in Easton, Pennsylvania the Connecticut River Bridge in Brattleboro, Vermont the Metropolis Bridge in Metropolis, Illinois and the Healdsburg Memorial Bridge in Healdsburg, California. = Post truss = A Post truss A Post truss is a hybrid between a Warren truss and a double- intersection Pratt truss. Invented in 1863 by Simeon S. Post, it is occasionally referred to as a Post patent truss although he never received a patent for it. The Ponakin Bridge and the Bell Ford Bridge are two examples of this truss. = Pratt truss = A Pratt truss Gatton Railway Bridge showing the Pratt truss design A Pratt truss includes vertical members and diagonals that slope down towards the center, the opposite of the Howe truss. The interior diagonals are under tension under balanced loading and vertical elements under compression. If pure tension elements are used in the diagonals (such as eyebars) then crossing elements may be needed near the center to accept concentrated live loads as they traverse the span. It can be subdivided, creating Y- and K-shaped patterns. The Pratt truss was invented in 1844 by Thomas and Caleb Pratt. This truss is practical for use with spans up to and was a common configuration for railroad bridges as truss bridges moved from wood to metal. They are statically determinate bridges, which lend themselves well to long spans. They were common in the United States between 1844 and the early 20th century. Examples of Pratt truss bridges are the Governor's Bridge in Maryland, Dearborn River High Bridge near Augusta, Montana, built in 1897, and the Fair Oaks Bridge in Fair Oaks, California, built 1907‚Äì09. The Scenic Bridge near Tarkio, Montana is an example of a Pratt deck truss bridge, where the roadway is on top of the truss. =Queenpost truss= Queen post truss The queenpost truss, sometimes called \\"queen post\\" or \\"queenspost\\", is similar to a king post truss in that the outer supports are angled towards the center of the structure. The primary difference is the horizontal extension at the center which relies on beam action to provide mechanical stability. This truss style is only suitable for relatively short spans.Covered Bridge's Truss Types =Smith truss= Smith truss The Smith truss, patented by Robert W Smith on July 16, 1867, has mostly diagonal criss- crossed supports. Smith's company used many variations of this pattern in the wooden covered bridges it built. While most all of the bridges built in the 19th century in the Jackson County, Ohio area used the Smith truss design, the Johnson Road Covered Bridge is the last known surviving example in the state. =Thatcher truss= thumb The Thatcher truss combines some of the characteristics of a Pratt truss with diagonals under tension and of a Howe truss with diagonals under compression. It is quite rare. = Truss arch = Truss arch bridge A truss arch may contain all horizontal forces within the arch itself, or alternatively may be either a thrust arch consisting of a truss, or of two arcuate sections pinned at the apex. The latter form is common when the bridge is constructed as cantilever segments from each side as in the Navajo Bridge. =Vierendeel truss= A Vierendeel bridge The Vierendeel truss, unlike common pin-jointed trusses, imposes significant bending forces upon its members ‚Äî but this in turn allows the elimination of many diagonal elements. It is a structure where the members are not triangulated but form rectangular openings, and is a frame with fixed joints that are capable of transferring and resisting bending moments. While rare as a bridge type due to higher costs compared to a triangulated truss, it is commonly employed in modern building construction as it allows the resolution of gross shear forces against the frame elements while retaining rectangular openings between columns. This is advantageous both in allowing flexibility in the use of the building space and freedom in selection of the building's outer curtain wall, which affects both interior and exterior styling aspects. = Waddell truss = Waddell \\"A\\" truss (1898 bridge) Patented 1894 (); its simplicity eases erection at the site. It was intended to be used as a railroad bridge. One example was the Waddell \\"A\\" Truss Bridge (Parkville, Missouri). = Warren truss = A Warren truss The Warren truss was patented in 1848 by James Warren and Willoughby Theobald Monzani, and consists of longitudinal members joined only by angled cross-members, forming alternately inverted equilateral triangle-shaped spaces along its length, ensuring that no individual strut, beam, or tie is subject to bending or torsional straining forces, but only to tension or compression. Loads on the diagonals alternate between compression and tension (approaching the center), with no vertical elements, while elements near the center must support both tension and compression in response to live loads. This configuration combines strength with economy of materials and can therefore be relatively light. The girders being of equal length, it is ideal for use in prefabricated modular bridges. It is an improvement over the Neville truss which uses a spacing configuration of isosceles triangles. = Whipple truss = thumb thumb Bridge L-158, a double-intersection Whipple rail truss over the Muscoot Reservoir in Golden's Bridge, New York A Whipple truss, named after its inventor Squire Whipple, is usually considered a subclass of the Pratt truss because the diagonal members are designed to work in tension. The main characteristic of a Whipple truss is that the tension members are elongated, usually thin, and at a shallow angle, and cross two or more bays (rectangular sections defined by the vertical members).

He wrote a considerable number of novels, biographies, histories, essays (especially about the dangers of alcohol and the plight of the poor) and popular fantasy stories, mostly in the 1860s and 1870s. Some of these have been reprinted in recent decades and are still available today. He is best remembered, however, as the father of dramatist W. S. Gilbert of Gilbert and Sullivan. Life and career Gilbert was born at Bishopstoke, Hampshire, the eldest son of William (1780‚Äì1812), a grocer in Commercial Row, Blackfriars, London, and his wife Sarah n√©e Mathers (1782‚Äì1810).Ainger, family tree and pp. 5 and 13. Gilbert's ODNB entry says her name was Catherine, but Ainger's extensive, and later, research on family history is clear. Both his parents died of tuberculosis by the time William was seven years old, and thereafter, he and his younger siblings, Joseph and Jane, were raised in London by their mother's sister and her husband, Mary nee Mathers (b. 1778) and John Samuel Schwenck (d. 1865), a childless and financially comfortable couple. Gilbert's father had also left the children legacies that would be invested by their uncle until the youngest had reached age 21, so Gilbert's would not be due to him until age 26. With the three young Gilbert children, the Schwencks soon moved from Lambeth to a larger house in Clapham, where they raised the children with affection.Ainger, pp. 13‚Äì14 Gilbert served the East India Company as a midshipman from 1818 (age 14) to 1821 but was unhappy with the conditions, and so he quit the service. He then spent several years in Italy, returning to England about 1825. There he studied at Guy's Hospital and served as an assistant surgeon in the navy, and then he entered the Royal College of Surgeons in 1830. At this time, he received his an annuity from his father's estate, giving him financial independence, and also published a volume of his poetry. He first married Mary Ann Skelton in 1832, who died two years later at around age 20. By this time, he had privately published another book, but after the death of his wife, he published no more for many years. He married Anne Mary Bye Morris (1811‚Äì1888), age 24, on 14 February 1836. She was the daughter of Thomas Morris (1760‚Äì1849), an apothecary, and Christiana nee Sutherland (1777‚Äì1845). The couple's famous son, W. S. Gilbert, was born on 18 November 1836 at the Morris's house in Southampton Street. The Gilberts then moved to Hammersmith, near Anne's sister Harriet and her family.Ainger, family tree and pp. 14‚Äì16 In 1838, Gilbert took his wife and toddler on a long trip to Italy, where he had lived as a young man. There, their daughter Jane Morris Gilbert (1838‚Äì1906) was born. In 1841, Gilbert's brother and sister, Joseph and Jane, both died of tuberculosis. Gilbert received some property owned by his sister and became a potential co-guardian to Joseph's two young sons, together with the Schwencks. In 1843, his daughter Mary Florence (1843‚Äì1911) was born. In early 1845, Gilbert decided to take custody of his two young nephews from their mother, Catherine, who had begun a relationship with an officer of the East India Company. She brought a custody lawsuit and her children were returned to her. Amidst considerable publicity critical of Gilbert and the Schwencks, Gilbert fled with his young family to Boulogne, France, where his daughter, Anne Maude (1845‚Äì1932), was born. The family lived there for two years and returned to London in 1847, moving to Brompton.Ainger, pp. 17‚Äì20 Gilbert and Anne \\"led an increasingly quarrelsome life\\" in London.Stedman, Jane. \\"Gilbert, William (1804‚Äì1890)\\", Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 21 January 2013 =Early writing career= Gilbert began his writing career around 1857. He was concerned, throughout his life, with the welfare of the poor and served as honorary secretary of the Society of the Relief of Distress. His interest in the poor is evident in his writing, and one of his recurring themes was that poverty and alcohol, not genealogy, was the major cause of crime and the main factor in one's later fortunes. This theme would also be seen in his son's writing.Plumb, p. 293 One of the elder Gilbert's first pieces was a pamphlet entitled, \\"On the Present System of Rating for the Relief of the Poor in the Metropolis\\" (1857). In 1858, anonymously, Gilbert published Dives and Lazarus, or the adventures of an obscure medical man in a low neighbourhood. The book was a fictional account focusing on what Gilbert saw as the increasing disparity in the lives of the rich and the poor. A similar theme pervades another early Gilbert novel, The Weaver's Family (1860). This theme continued to concern Gilbert throughout his career including in Contrasts; dedicated to the ratepayers of London (1873) and in one of his fiercest attacks on social abuses, The City; An Inquiry into the Corporation, its livery companies, and the administration of their charities and endowments (1877),Online googlebooks version of The City describing how 50,000 working-class people were evicted from their dwellings to make room for the Metropolitan Railway.Plumb, p. 300 In an age of male chauvinism, Gilbert also wrote several articles about discrimination against women.Jones, Brian. \\"The Beginnings of Bab: a perspective\\", W. S. Gilbert Society Journal, vol. 3, issue 21, Summer 2007, pp. 662‚Äì63 In 1859, Gilbert published a novel, Margaret Meadows, A Tale for the Pharisees. This was made into a play called Mary Warner by Tom Taylor in 1869, who was forced to pay Gilbert a settlement for plagiarising his novel. Gilbert's most successful early novel was Shirley Hall Asylum: Or the Memoirs of a Monomaniac (1863), which told the stories of inmates of a lunatic asylum from the point of view of an escapee driven mad by trying to solve the problem of perpetual motion. Gilbert's first novel published under his own name was Christmas Tale: The Rosary, a Legend of Wilton Abbey (1863). The story purports to be the written confession of one Alicia Longsp√©e, who had been Lady Abbess of the Benedictine Convent at Wilton in the 15th century. Gilbert's next novel, De Profundis, a tale of the social deposits (1864) is the story of a foundling rescued by a Scottish Fusilier Guardsman stationed in London. The foundling grows up to marry the guardsman's daughter. Another 1864 book was The Goldsworthy Family, or the country attorney, about an unethical lawyer.Plumb, p. 295 Gilbert's 1865 book, The Magic Mirror (about a mirror that grants wishes), containing stories with a moral was illustrated by his multi-talented son. Gilbert also wrote histories and articles and stories for numerous periodicals (often anonymously), including Cornhill, Temple Bar, St. Paul's, the Quiver, The Contemporary Review, The Sunday Magazine, Good Things, Good Words, Strahan's Boy's and Girl's (sic) Annual and The Fortnightly Review.Plumb, p. 296 Among Gilbert's best-known, and most popular, works were his Innominato tales of the supernatural, published in various magazines, including Argosy, and finally collected in The Wizard of the Mountain (1867). One of the best-known is \\"The Last Lords of Gardonal\\" (1867). These stories concerned the adventures of an enigmatic wizard and astrologer called the Innominato (in English, \\"Nameless\\"), in 14th century Italy, who tried to use his powers to help people.Article about the Innominato character =Later years= In 1868, Gilbert wrote The Doctor of Beauweir, an autobiography, told from the point of view of a South Wales medic. King George's Middy (1869), also illustrated by W. S. Gilbert, relates the adventures of a Leicestershire squire's son who becomes a midshipman and is marooned of the coast of Africa. Another 1869 novel was Sir Thomas Branston. Later that year, Gilbert produced his most famous biography, Lucrezia Borgia, Duchess of Ferrara: a biography: Illustrated by rare and unpublished documents. In this work, Gilbert concluded, after extensive research, that there was no evidence of the acts of gross immorality of which Borgia was accused, including murder. This was followed in 1870 by The Inquisitor, or the Struggle in Ferrara, about the life of Ren√©e of France, Duchess of Ferrara, set in 1554.Plumb, pp. 297‚Äì98 In 1871, the novel Martha was followed by The Landlord of the \\"Sun\\", again describing a descent into degradation, this time involving a villainous seducer, an illegitimate child and drunkenness, and, in 1873, by Clara Levesque. Another theme that was seen in Gilbert's writings was his dislike of established religion and the Roman Catholic Church in particular. Two works on this theme included Facta non Verba: a comparison between the good works performed by the ladies in Roman Catholic communities in England and the unfettered efforts of their Protestant sisters (1874) and Disestablishment from a Church point of view (1875).Plumb, pp. 298‚Äì99 Gilbert had a mercurial temper and was difficult to live with, imposing arbitrary restrictions on his wife and daughters. After many years of strained relations with his wife, Gilbert left home and separated from her in 1876 after forty years of marriage. He left his wife and daughters substantial incomes and the family home, assuming that he would be able to earn a good living from his writing.Ainger, p. 121 However, he soon became seriously ill and appeared to be dying, and his doctors advised him not to write. His wife did not assist in his care and did not, ultimately, allow him to return home. Her son appealed to her on his father's behalf, but she would not change her mind. W. S. Gilbert apparently never contacted his mother again.Ainger, p. 122 Instead, Gilbert went to live with Jane, his only married daughter, and her husband in The Close at Salisbury, where he resided for the rest of his life.Plumb, p. 299 In 1877, Gilbert published Them Boots, another description of characters from the lowest class of society, as well as The City. Pursuing another favourite theme, the dangers of drink, Gilbert also published in 1877 Nothing but the Truth, an unvarnished picture of the effects of intemperance, and example of his many writings about the dangers of alcohol. 1879 saw the publication of Mrs. Dubosq's Bible, about a French Huguenot group in Spitalfields in the 18th century, and the possession of a 1650 Geneva Bible by a poor person. In 1880, Memoirs of a Cynic was a protest against cruelty and hypocrisy. This was followed in 1881 by Modern Wonders of the World, or the new Sinbad, a series of 10 stories told to London children by Hassan, the son of an Egyptian slave dealer. His last book, published in 1882, Legion, or the modern demoniac, returns to Gilbert's campaign against drink, which, he illustrated, leads to \\"crime, profligacy, suicide, homicide, brutality, cruelty, pauperism, idiocy and insanity.\\"Plumb, pp. 300‚Äì01 Gilbert died at the age of 86 and was buried in The Close at Salisbury.

Its festivals, including the Calle Ocho Festival, Viernes Culturales/Cultural Fridays, the Three Kings Parade and others, have been televised to millions of people every year on different continents. It is also known for its landmarks, including Calle Ocho (SW 8th Street/Tamiami Trail), and its Walk of Fame (for famous artists and Latin personalities, including Celia Cruz, Willy Chirino, and Gloria Estefan), the Cuban Memorial Boulevard, Plaza de la Cubanidad, Domino Park, the Tower Theater, Jos√© Mart√≠ Park, the Firestone/Walgreens Building, St. John Bosco Catholic Church, Municipio de Santiago de Cuba and others. Little Havana is the best known Cuban exile neighborhood in the world. It is characterized by its street life, restaurants, music and other cultural activities, small business enterprises, political passion, and great warmth among its residents. In 2015, Little Havana was included in the National Trust for Historic Preservation‚Äôs annual list of 11 Most Endangered Places. In 2017, the Trust declared it a national treasure. History =Origins= Originally a lower-middle-class Southern and thriving Jewish neighborhood in the 1930s, \\"Little Havana\\" emerged in the 1960s as the concentration of Cubans in the area grew sharply. Today, \\"Little Havana\\" refers to the neighborhood lying immediately west of Downtown Miami, stretching west from the Miami River for roughly two and a half miles. This sobriquet was applied to the Shenandoah and Riverside neighborhoods in the 1960s, following the beginnings of a vast influx of Cuban refugees there. Little Havana is famous as the cultural and political capital of Cuban Americans, and the neighborhood is a center of the Cuban exile community. =Cuban solidification= In the 1960s, the number of Cubans fleeing the Castro regime led the area to become a hotbed of counter- revolutionary activity. Arriving residents expected their stay in Miami would be temporary, hoping Castro would be deposed. By 1970, the neighborhood was more than 85% Cuban; rather than return to Havana, where Castro remained in power, Cuban Americans began permanently settling in neighborhoods across Miami. Little Havana, however, remained the main landing point for new immigrants and a stronghold for Cuban-owned businesses. =Contemporary population= As of 2011, Little Havana boasts the highest concentration of Hispanics (98%) in Miami. Within the Hispanic population, the Cuban population has experienced a substantial decrease from 84% in 1979 to 58% in 1989; groups of Hispanics from other places, especially Nicaragua, Honduras, and other Central American countries, have substantially increased since the late 1990s. Despite the increasing diversity, most neighborhood businesses are still Cuban-owned.

Demographics  As of 2000, Little Havana had a population of 49,206 residents, with 19,341 households, and 11,266 families residing in the neighborhood. The median household income was $15,213.16. The ethnic makeup of the neighborhood was 85.08% Hispanic or Latino of any race (mainly Cubans, but also many Nicaraguans and Hondurans, as well as other Latinos), 3.79% Black or African American (not including Afro-Cubans, Afro-Nicaraguans, Afro-Hondurans, and other Afro-Latinos), 10.14% Non-Hispanic White, and 0.96% of other races. South River Drive Historic District The South River Drive Historic District is a historic district within the City of Miami's Little Havana neighborhood. In 1987, the Miami City Commission created the locally designated district. Later that year, the National Park Service added the district to the National Register of Historic Places. Located on the eastern end of the neighborhood along the Miami River, the district is just west of Downtown Miami. The district includes 428, 438 Southwest 1st Street, 437 Southwest 2nd Street, 104, 109, 118 Southwest South River Drive. It contains 9 historic buildings. The South River Drive Historic District derives its significance from both its architectural and cultural history. Developed principally in the first two decades of the twentieth century, the historic district contains the city's oldest extant group of vernacular frame buildings near the Miami River. Riverview Historic District Designated on April 7, 2015 by the Historic and Environmental Preservation Board, the Riverview Historic District is a City of Miami historic district located west of Downtown Miami and within the Little Havana neighborhood. The locally designated historic district comprises single and multi-family residences and commercial structures in the Bungalow, Mission, Mediterranean Revival, and Miami Modern styles of architecture.  Viernes Culturales  Cuban men playing dominos in Little Havana's famous M√°ximo G√≥mez Park. Dominos is a popular game in Cuban culture, and the park is famous for its many domino players who meet daily in the park. Viernes Culturales (English: Cultural Fridays) is an artistic, cultural, and social arts and culture fair that takes place on the last Friday of each month in the historic Little Havana neighborhood of Miami in the heart of Calle Ocho (8th St. SW between 14th and 17th Avenues). The event consists of outdoor musical performances on a stage and along the sidewalks of Calle Ocho, art exhibits along the sidewalk and in plazas and open spaces, visits to art galleries and cultural centers, cuisine tasting at participating restaurants, and films, art exhibits, and educational programs at the historic Tower Theatre. Free walking tours, led by Miami historian Dr. Paul George leave from the Tower Theater at 7pm during each festival day.

It is a free street festival with a Caribbean carnival feel sponsored by the Kiwanis Club of Little Havana. Calle Ocho is where different ethnic communities wear colors or flags representing pride in their heritage. Flags from Colombia to Nicaragua to Puerto Rico to Costa Rica and even Ireland flood the streets. Foods from different countries are usually present for purchase, and popular Latin music like reggaeton, salsa, bachata and merengue can be heard throughout the festival. In 1977 tensions among Miami's different ethnic groups were running high. Eight Cuban- Americans, mostly from the Kiwanis of Little Havana, were trying to come up with ideas to address the situation. They considered a bicycle race on SW Eighth Street (Calle Ocho). It was turned down because the organizers feared that it would pit one ethnic group against another. Willy Bermello came up with the idea of doing something similar to the block parties and street festivals of Philadelphia. Calle Ocho was born.Bernadette R Giacomazzo, \\"Calle Ocho Festival: The History of Little Havana's Most Famous Music Celebration\\" Latin Post, February 28, 2014 The festival takes place between 27th Ave and 4th Ave along Southwest 8th Street. Over 30 stages and hundreds of street vendors participate in the live music street festival now in its 4th decade. Calle Ocho earned an entry in the Guinness Book of World Records when 119,986 people formed the world's longest conga line on March 13, 1988. In 2010, the Florida legislature identified the Calle Ocho-Open House 8 festival as the official state festival.

It is part of the Dodecanese group of islands, situated between the islands of Kos and Tilos. Its shape is approximately round, with a diameter of about , and an area of . Several other islets are found in the direct vicinity of Nisyros, the largest of which is Gyali, with a population of 22 citizens. The Municipality of Nisyros includes Gyal√≠, as well as uninhabited Pachei√°, Pergo√∫ssa, Kandelioussa, √Ågios Ant√≥nios and Strogg√Ωli. It has a total land area of and a total population of 1,008 inhabitants. The island was also called Nisiro in Italian and ƒ∞ncirli in Turkish.  Geology  Stefanos, the largest crater of the volcano. Landscape The island has a wide caldera, and was formed within the past 150,000 years, with three separate eruptive stages, ranging from explosive and effusive andesitic eruptions to explosive and effusive dacitic and rhyolitic activity. Its coasts are generally rocky or pebbled, but there are also a few sandy beaches (mainly in the northeastern part). The volcano is currently active but not erupting, and fumaroles are found at the craters. It has had four historical eruptions, all of which had a VEI of 2. Almost all of its eruptions involved phreatic activity. The latest eruptive activity was a steam explosion in 1888, after small ash eruptions in 1871 and 1873, and earthquakes are not infrequent. A period of seismic unrest in 1996-1997 led an international team of scientists to initiate monitoring of the volcanic unrest, as part of the European Union sponsored Geowarn project. The entire volcanic complex includes the seafloor between Nisyros and Kos, the island of Gyali and a part of Kos island.  Geography  Nisyros can experience the Meltemi Etesian wind through June - August. This is most obvious on the eastern and western flanks of the volcano, where trees are bent towards the south from the force of the winds. The wind may be especially strong on the island due to jet effects as it passes over Kos.  Settlements  Street of Mandraki The island is reachable by ship from Piraeus, Rhodes and Kos, and in summer, there are many daily trips from the village of Kardamena on Kos. There is also a heliport. The main town and port of the island is Mandraki (pop. 660). Other villages are Paloi (239), Nikia (61), and Emporeios (27). According to the 2011 census, the municipality's resident population is 1,008 (including 21 on Gyali), although in summer it is augmented by many tourists as well as expatriate Nisyrians who visit the island for their vacations. Tourism is not so heavily developed as on other Greek islands. Deposits of perlite and pumice on Gyali provide much of the wealth of the island. The island used to be self- sufficient, and many crops were grown on its terraced slopes. Today, though, they are cultivated on a smaller scale.  History  Nikia village According to Greek mythology, the island was formed when Poseidon cut off a part of Kos and threw it onto the giant Polybotes to stop him from escaping. The ancient name of the Nisyros was Porphyris. Ancient walls, dating from the 5th century BC, part of the acropolis of the island, are found near Mandraki. It was apparently also a source of millstones used in some of the earliest watermills, being referred to by epigrammatist Antipater of Thessalonica in the 1st century BC.M. J. T. Lewis, Millstone and Hammer: the origins of water power (University of Hull Press 1997), pp. vii 66-7. The island is mentioned by Homer in the Iliad.2.675-679 In Roman times it became part of the Insulae province. The Knights Hospitaller conquered the island in 1315 and built the crusader castle. The island passed from the Ottomans to the Italians in 1911 during the Italo-Turkish War, along with the rest of the Dodecanese islands. It finally was annexed to the Greek Kingdom after the Second World War, in 1947.  Christianity  The patron saint of the island is Saint Nikitas. Many Orthodox Christian churches are found on the island, as well as four monasteries which are not inhabited by monks today, although various celebrations take place in them. The largest monastery is the one of Panagia Spiliani (Blessed Virgin Mary of the cave) at Mandraki. It is built beside the medieval castle erected by the Knights Hospitaller. =Diocese of Nisyrus= Nisyrus was a suffragan of Rhodes, but the bishopric faded. Known bishops included Matthaeus de Cheselles (appointed 1436), Pierre Fridaricus (served from the 1480s),Catholic Hierarchy: \\"Bishop Pierre Fridaricus\\" retrieved January 30, 2016 Pedro Xague (appointed 1560),Catholic Hierarchy: \\"Bishop Pedro Xague, O.P.\\" retrieved January 30, 2016 and Jer√≥nimo Clavijo (appointed 1564).Catholic Hierarchy: \\"Bishop Jer√≥nimo Clavijo, O.P.\\" retrieved January 30, 2016Catholic Hierarchy: Diocese of Nisyros retrieved January 30, 2016 = Latin titular see = The diocese was nominally restored in 1927 as Titular See of the lowest (Episcopal) rank, initially named Nysirus (Curiate Italian Nisiro), and renamed Nisyrus in 1928.

Currently, its government in exile, the Rada (Council) of the Belarusian People's Republic is the oldest still functioning government in exile.  History  Land claimed by the BNR at the time The Belarusian People's Republic was declared on the German-occupied territory of modern-day Belarus three weeks after the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk was signed on March 3, 1918 between the new Bolshevik government of Soviet Russia and the Central Powers in the border city of Brest-Litovsk. After the 1917 February Revolution in Russia, active discussions started in Belarus about either gaining autonomy within the new Russian Republic or declaring independence. Representatives of most Belarusian regions and of different political powers, including the Belarusian Socialist Assembly, the Christian democratic movement and the General Jewish Labour Bund, formed a Belarusian National Council in late 1917. The Council started working on establishing Belarusian governmental institutions. Both the Bolsheviks and Germans refused to recognize it and interfered in its activity. However, the Germans saw an independent Belarus as part of the implementation of their plan for buffer states within Mitteleuropa. The Bolsheviks had negotiations with the Belarusian Democratic Republic regarding an eventual recognition, but later decided instead to establish a pro-Soviet government of Belarus - the Soviet Socialist Republic of Belarus. Parallel with negotiations that started between the Germans and Bolsheviks, the Belarusian Council started actively demanding recognition of autonomous status for Belarus, with continuing internal discussions on whether it should become an autonomous region within Russia or declare national independence. The first government of the People's Republic, Sitting left to right: Aliaksandar Burbis, Jan Sierada, Jazep Varonka, Vasil Zacharka Standing, left to right: Arkadz Smolich, Pyotra Krecheuski, Kastus Jezavitau, Anton Ausianik, Liavon Zayats In its First Constituent Charter, passed on February 21, 1918, the Belarusian Council declared itself the only legitimate power in the territory of Belarus. On March 9, following the signing of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk between the Germans and Bolsheviks, the Belarusian Council issued a Second Charter where it declared the establishment of the Belarusian People's Republic. The Belarusian Council became the provisional government of Belarus and was renamed the Council of the Belarusian People's Republic. On March 25, 1918, the All-Belarusian Congress proclaimed the independence of the Belarusian National Republic (Bielaruskaja Narodnaja Respublika, abbreviated as BNR). The Government of the BNR left Minsk in December 1918 for the Lithuanian Republic, and in spring 1919 went into exile. =Territory= In its Third Constituent Charter, the following territories were claimed for BNR: Mogilev Governorate (province), as well as Belarusian parts of Minsk Governorate, Grodno Governorate (including Belastok), Vilna Governorate, Vitebsk Governorate, and Smolensk Governorate, and parts of bordering governorates populated by Belarusians, rejecting the then split of the Belarusian lands between Germany and Russia. The areas were claimed because of a Belarusian majority or large minority (as in Grodno and Vilna Governorate), although there were also numbers of Lithuanians, Poles and people speaking mixed varieties of Belarusian, Lithuanian and Polish, as well as many Jews, mostly in towns and cities (in some towns they made up a majority). Some of the Jews spoke Russian as their native tongue; others spoke Yiddish. =Military= President and General Stanis≈Çaw Bu≈Çak-Ba≈Çachowicz There were attempts to create regular armed forces of the newly-established Belarusian People's Republic. Belarusian military units started to form within the disorganized Imperial Russian Army already in 1917. According to the historian Oleg Latyszonek, about 11,000 people, mostly volunteers, served in the Army of the Belarusian People's Republic. General Stanis≈Çaw Bu≈Çak-Ba≈Çachowicz supported the Government of the People's Republic and openly positioned his army as a Belarusian national army, also acting as the first President of the Belarusian Provisional Government shortly after the exile of the People's Republic before again handing power to the populace. For his resistance against Bolshevik forces, members of Belarusian minority in Poland regard him as their national hero. The major military action of the Army of the People's Republic was the Slutsk defence action in late 1920. The Council of the BNR, based at that time in Lithuania, sent officers to help organize armed anti- Bolshevik resistance in the town of Slutsk. The Belarusian army managed to resist a month against the greater strength of the Red Army. =Foreign relations= During its short existence, the government of Belarus established close ties with the Ukrainian People's Republic, organized food supplies to Belarus from Ukraine and thereby prevented hunger in the country. Diplomatic representations of Belarus had been created in Germany, Estonia, Ukraine and other countries to lobby for Belarusian interests or to support Belarusian soldiers and refugees who landed in different parts of the former Russian Empire. Beginning in 1918, Anton ≈Åuckieviƒç, the Prime Minister of Belarus, met with Vladimir Lenin hoping to gain recognition for the independence of Belarus by Soviet Russia. The Belarusian delegation even proposed the creation of a federation with the RSFSR and the adoption of the Soviet Constitution in Belarus in exchange for Russia recognizing the independent status of Belarus, but Lenin did not agree to these proposals. Military and Diplomatic Mission of the Belarusian Democratic Republic in Riga In 1919, a delegation of the Belarusian People's Republic under Prime Minister Anton ≈Åuckieviƒç participated in the Paris Peace Conference, attempting to gain international recognition of the independence of Belarus. On the way to the conference, the delegation was received by Czechoslovak president Tom√°≈° Masaryk in Prague. During the conference, ≈Åuckieviƒç had meetings with the exiled Foreign Minister of Admiral Kolchak's Russian government Sergey Sazonov and the Prime Minister of Poland Ignacy Jan Paderewski. In October 1919 the Belarusian People's Republic was officially recognized by Estonia and in December 1919 by Finland. P√§ewauudised.

Being surrounded by more powerful neighbours and having no allies, the BNR quickly lost its independence and did not become a real state with a constitution or defined territory. However, many modern Belarusian historians suggest that creation of the Belarusian People's Republic was the reason for Bolsheviks creating the Belarusian Soviet Socialist Republic and allowing some elements of national cultural life in the 1920s. Exile In December 1918, the German army retreated from the territory of Belarus and the Red Army moved in to establish the Socialist Soviet Republic of Belarus. The Rada (Council) of the BNR moved to Grodno, the center of a semi-autonomous Belarusian region within the Republic of Lithuania. During the subsequent 1919-1920 Soviet-Polish War, the Rada went into exile and facilitated an anti-Communist struggle within the country during the 1920s. In 1925, the exiled Rada of the Belarusian Democratic Republic (Rada BDR) discussed relinquishing its authority in favor of the Belarusian Soviet Socialist Republic controlling the eastern part of Belarus. Despite many members of the democratic government advocating this idea, the proposal was not approved. During World War II, the Belarusian government-in- exile, based in Prague, refused to cooperate with Nazi Germany or with the Belarusian Central Rada, the pro-German puppet government and issued statements in support of the Western Allies. The advance of the Red Army in 1945 forced the BNR's Rada to relocate to the western part of Germany, occupied by British and American troops. In February 1948, the Rada passed a special manifesto, by which it declared its return to activity. In April 1948 the Rada, together with representatives of the Belarusian post-war refugees, held a conference in Osterhofen, Bavaria. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union in the 1990s, similar governments-in-exile of the neighboring countries (Lithuania, Poland and others) handed back their mandates to the corresponding independent governments. Upon declaration of independence of the Belarusian Soviet Socialist Republic in 1990, it was stated then that the Rada was ready to hand its status to a democratically elected parliament of Belarus. The parliament of Belarus of that time had been elected under Soviet rule. However, these plans were dropped after president Alexander Lukashenko, elected in 1994, established an authoritarian regime accompanied by a return to Soviet policies in regards to Belarusian language and culture. The Rada BNR still exists as a government in exile and attempts to lobby for interests of the Belarusian diaspora in countries where it has its representatives. Since the late 1980s, March 25, the Independence Day of the Belarusian Democratic Republic, is widely celebrated by the Belarusian national democratic opposition as Freedom Day (). It is usually accompanied by mass opposition rallies in Minsk and by celebration events of the Belarusian diaspora organizations supporting the Belarusian government in exile.

Its four bores carry California State Route 24. Named after Thomas E. Caldecott, former mayor of Berkeley, it opened in 1937 as a two-bore tunnel. The third bore opened in 1964 and the fourth bore in 2013. Currently, the two oldest bores carry eastbound traffic and the two newest bores carry westbound traffic. Description The east‚Äìwest tunnel is signed as a part of California State Route 24 and connects Oakland to central Contra Costa County. It is named after Thomas E. Caldecott (1878‚Äì1951), from 1930‚Äì1932, member of the Alameda County Board of Supervisors 1933-1945, and president of Joint Highway District 13, which built the first two bores. Bore 1 (the southernmost bore) and Bore 2 were completed in 1937 and are 3,610 feet (1,100 m) in length. Both carry two lanes each of eastbound traffic. Bore 3, completed in 1964, is 3,771 feet (1,149 m) in length. Bore 4 (the northernmost bore), completed in 2013, is 3,389 feet (1,033 m) in length. Bores 3 and 4 carry two lanes each of westbound traffic. The active Hayward Fault runs just west of the western portals of the tunnel. History Traffic patterns in 1937 In the 19th century, traffic over the Berkeley Hills in this area went up Harwood Canyon, now known as Claremont Canyon (behind the Claremont Hotel). The road leading up the canyon from the west was initially called Harwood's Road, later changed to Telegraph Road, and finally, Claremont. The road on the other side of the hills became known as Fish Ranch Road, its current name, some time after 1870, the year the Oakland Trout Company incorporated its fish and frog farm in the vicinity.Sacramento Daily Union, 2 January 1871, p.2 An inn and stage coach stop called the Summit House once existed at the summit. The idea of a tunnel through the hills began as early as 1860. In that year, the idea was proposed and rejected by the citizens of Alameda and Contra Costa Counties. It was revived in 1871 with a proposal which described a route running from the end of Broadway, similar to the actual routing of today's Caldecott Tunnel although it is not clear from the description exactly which canyon was being referred to. The proposed tunnel would be only some 500 feet long and would have its outlet in the San Pablo Creek watershed with a road leading into Lafayette. A franchise was granted to a group of developers who passed the franchise onto another group. The proposal languished until the turn of the century.\\"Old Road That Ruined Three Pioneers To Be Completed\\", San Francisco Call, November 14, 1902, p.9 In 1903 a tunnel was finally built above the present location of the Caldecott Tunnel, near the top of Temescal Canyon, the next canyon south of Claremont Canyon. This tunnel was approached by a new road dubbed \\"Tunnel Road\\" which started at the top of Ashby Avenue in Berkeley. The west end of the tunnel was at about while the east end of the tunnel is now in private property owned by the East Bay Regional Park District, on the former site of the Canary Cafe. This tunnel was dedicated as the \\"Inter-County Tunnel\\", later called the \\"Kennedy Tunnel\\". The tunnel was very narrow and arched, such that two tall buggies could not pass each other. A system of lighting a small fire with a newspaper was used to control this one-way traffic. The tunnel height was increased in 1915 by 3 feet to accommodate larger vehicles. When the new Caldecott tunnel was completed, the Kennedy tunnel was used mostly by pedestrians until it was sealed in 1947. =Original twin bores= In November of 1926, the Counties of Alameda and Contra Costa, and the City of Oakland agreed to the construction of a new tunnel through the Berkeley Hills to replace the old, decrepit and increasingly inadequate existing tunnel.California Highways and Public Works, Official Journal of the Division of Highways, Department of Public Works, State of California, May, 1934, p.16 In 1929, Alameda and Contra Costa County formed Joint Highway District 13 to accomplish this goal.California Highways and Public Works, Official Journal of the Division of Highways, Department of Public Works, State of California, Jul-August, 1960, p.31 Surveys and preliminary work on the approaches began in 1931.California Highways and Public Works, Official Journal of the Division of Highways, Department of Public Works, State of California, December, 1937, p.12California Highways and Public Works, Official Journal of the Division of Highways, Department of Public Works, State of California, May, 1934, p.15 On June 17, 1934, construction of the first two bores of the Caldecott Tunnel began.California Highways and Public Works, Official Journal of the Division of Highways, Department of Public Works, State of California, July, 1934, p.16 They were completed in 1937, and opened to traffic on December 5 of that year.California Highways and Public Works, Official Journal of the Division of Highways, Department of Public Works, State of California, December, 1937, p.4 They were originally known as the Broadway Low Level Tunnel (commonly shortened as the Broadway Tunnel), since the approach was from the top of Broadway in Oakland, and was below the portal of the old tunnel. However, access from Ashby Avenue was retained as it was designated the connecting thoroughfare from the Eastshore Highway (now Freeway) and the San Francisco‚ÄìOakland Bay Bridge, and dubbed State Highway 24. The approach to the east portal on the other side of the Berkeley Hills was via Mount Diablo Boulevard, also at that time part of State Highway 24. In 1960, the Broadway Low Level Tunnel was renamed, becoming the Caldecott Tunnel.California Highways and Public Works, Official Journal of the Division of Highways, Department of Public Works, State of California, Vol.39, Nos.9-10, September- October, 1960, p.60 =Third bore and traffic reversal= The Caldecott Tunnel prior to the construction of the fourth bore as seen from the western end. From left to right: Bores 3, 2, and 1. By 1960, the Division of Highways had upgraded the eastern approach to the tunnel into a modern freeway. With Contra Costa County accessible by freeway, its change from an agricultural community into a major suburb accelerated. The Division of Highways purchased sufficient right-of-way to the north of the existing twin bores to build another pair of bores. Given the traffic counts and the expense of tunnel construction, the construction of two additional bores would have been seen as unnecessary and extravagant. However, with the traffic count exceeding 50,000 vehicles per day, the state embarked on a project to build a third bore at the Caldecott Tunnel.California Highways and Public Works, Official Journal of the Division of Highways, Department of Public Works, State of California, Vol.39, Nos.7-8, July-August, 1960, p.31 The project broke ground in 1960 and was completed by October 1964. When the third bore was opened, the other bores were closed one at a time for maintenance, including the installation of a continuous row of fluorescent lights. Eventually the new third bore made it possible to reverse the traffic flow of the middle bore, providing four lanes to accommodate the heavier commute-direction traffic. The third bore also brought new technology to the tunnel with the installation of the \\"pop-up\\" lane control. Plastic lane delineators were set in tubes within the pavement. With the touch of a button, water would fill tubes to cause the delineators to pop up from the pavement; the middle bore was closed to one direction of travel, while opening it to another. During the week, the middle bore of the Caldecott was reversed between 2:00 am and 5:00 am to favor westbound traffic, and then switched again sometime between 11:30 am and noon to favor eastbound traffic. Ballgames, concerts and other events made balancing weekend traffic through the tunnel very difficult. It was not uncommon to reverse the middle bore six times on a Saturday or Sunday. The pop-up system still required substantial manpower to implement. While it did eliminate the need to set down individual cones to separate traffic, Caltrans maintenance workers had to direct traffic out of the closing lanes to prevent vehicles from getting caught on the wrong side of the pop-up delineators. A portion of the material excavated for the third bore was used in the construction of embankments for the MacArthur Freeway project between the MacArthur Maze and Broadway in Oakland.California Highways and Public Works, March-April, 1960, p.9 In the late 1960s the Grove- Shafter Freeway was completed and replaced Broadway as the main route to the Caldecott Tunnel from Oakland as well as replacing Ashby for traffic coming from San Francisco. Ashby Avenue and Tunnel Road were redesignated State Highway 13 and aligned with the new Warren Freeway through the Montclair District of Oakland. The Grove-Shafter Freeway was then designated State Highway 24. In 1980, the freeway was renamed after William Byron Rumford. =Tunnel fire= On April 7, 1982, an accident involving a gasoline tanker truck in the third (then-northernmost) bore set off the Caldecott Tunnel fire. The accident caused major damage and the bore was closed to traffic for several months while repairs were made, with traffic temporarily reverting to the pre-third-bore configuration. During the fire, the tunnel acted as a natural chimney, venting the smoke, flames and heat uphill towards the eastern entrance to the tunnel. The accident and fire killed seven people, most of whom were overcome by toxic smoke. The fire occurred shortly after midnight when there were few cars in the tunnel; had it occurred during normal commute hours, hundreds could have died. As a result of the fire, it is now illegal to transport hazardous material in a tanker truck through the tunnel, except between the light-traffic hours of 3:00 am and 5:00 am. =Oakland firestorm= On October 20, 1991, the catastrophic Oakland firestorm started on the ridge north of the Caldecott Tunnel. The fire spread quickly west down both sides of the west portal of the tunnel and jumped the freeway, eventually killing 25 people and destroying over 3,000 homes, apartments and condominiums. =Awards= The Caldecott Tunnel was designated a City of Oakland Landmark in 1980, and received a Preservation Award from the Art Deco Society of California in 1993. =Fourth bore= To relieve traffic congestion in the reverse commute direction, the California Department of Transportation began planning for a fourth bore in 2000. In 2007, the California Transportation Commission approved the final funding needed to build the fourth bore. Construction started in 2010. Commencement of the project was stalled as a result of the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008, but was quickly back on track as a beneficiary of President Obama's American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA). Construction got underway until completion in 2013. Much of the excavated material from the bore was trucked to Treasure Island for use in soil augmentation and remediation during the subsequent redevelopment of the island. The fourth bore contains a roadway with two traffic lanes, one shoulder, and one shoulder,https://mtc.ca.gov/sites/default/files/Tunneling_FactSheet.pdf ventilation, air and traffic monitoring systems, traffic lights, and electronic message boards. There are emergency exits to the third bore. When the fourth bore was opened to traffic, the need for the daily traffic reversal was eliminated; two bores (four lanes) serve each direction at all times, although individual bores may be closed during periods of light use for maintenance purposes. Weather phenomena Weather conditions can vary greatly from one end of the tunnel to the other. In summer, for example, motorists may enter the tunnel from the east where it is sunny and warm, and emerge on the west end into fog and cold. In winter, during spells of inland tule fog, the reverse can occur.Weather of the San Francisco Bay Area, by Harold Gilliam, University of California Press, 1962 See also * Berkeley Hills Tunnel ‚Äî BART rail transit tunnel, running approximately parallel to, and north of, the Caldecott Tunnel. * Solon, Mary; McCosker, Mary (2014).

His book Spycatcher, written with Paul Greengrass, became an international bestseller with sales of over two million copies. Spycatcher was part memoir, part expos√© of what Wright claimed were serious institutional failings in MI5 and his subsequent investigations into those. He is said to have been influenced in his counterespionage activity by James Jesus Angleton, the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) counterintelligence chief from 1954 to 1975. Education Wright was educated at Bishop's Stortford College, a boarding independent school for boys in the market town of Bishop's Stortford in Hertfordshire, followed by St Peter's College at the University of Oxford. Father's footsteps The Thing\\" a Soviet bugging device, on display at the NSA's National Cryptologic Museum. Peter Wright was born in 26 Cromwell Road, Chesterfield, Derbyshire, the son of (George) Maurice Wright, who was the Marconi Company's director of research, and one of the founders of signals intelligence during World War I. During the Second World War, Wright worked at the Admiralty's Research Laboratory. In 1946, he began work as a Principal Scientific Officer at the Services Electronics Research Laboratory. According to his own account, his work for the UK intelligence, initially part-time, started in the spring of 1949 when he was given a job of a Navy Scientist attached to the Marconi Company. According to Spycatcher, during his stint there, he was instrumental in resolving a difficult technical problem. The Central Intelligence Agency sought Marconi's assistance over a covert listening device (or \\"bug\\") that had been found in a replica of the Great Seal of the United States presented to the United States ambassador in Moscow in 1945 by the Young Pioneer organization of the Soviet Union. Wright determined that the bugging device, dubbed The Thing, was actually a tiny capacitive membrane (a condenser microphone) that became active only when 330 MHz microwaves were beamed to it from a remote transmitter. A remote receiver could then have been used to decode the modulated microwave signal and permit sounds picked up by the microphone to be heard. The device was eventually attributed to Soviet inventor, L√©on Theremin. Intelligence career highlights In 1954, Wright was recruited as principal scientific officer for MI5. According to his memoirs, he then was either responsible for, or intimately involved with, the development of some of the basic techniques of ELINT, for example: * Operation ENGULF (MI5): acoustic cryptanalysis‚Äîrecording the sound of the settings of Egyptian Hagelin cipher machines in 1956. * Operation RAFTER (MI5): remote detection of passive radio receivers used by Soviet illegals through detecting emanations from the local oscillator, in 1958 (a technique now more commonly used to enforce payment of television licences). The program eventually expanded into airborne operations, where receivers were detected from transport planes, thus giving the general area where mobile ground detection could be initiated. This was done by flooding the vicinity with vans that at best could pinpoint buildings or blocks. However, the method was less successful against mobile receivers. * Operation STOCKADE (MI5/GCHQ): analysis of compromising emanation from French cipher machine cables in 1960. They used broad band radio detection of the cables, and were actually able to read the original plain text along the low-grade cipher sequence. Surprisingly, murmurs of high-grade ciphers could sometimes be read from the same cable, which after comparison to the cable fed signal, gave a path to even that cipher's plain text leakage. From 1960 to 1963 the MI5 and GCHQ could read cipher traffic to and from the French Embassy in London. Wright worked as the first chairman of the new ROC‚ÄîRadio Operations Committee‚Äîformed in 1960. The technical staffs from the earlier separate and competitive British intelligence organizations finally began to combine their efforts, thus allowing the methods used in ENGULF and RAFTER to be expanded into domestic and foreign intelligence operations that would last into the late 1960s. According to Wright, MI5, MI6, and GCHQ had not functioned together or/and shared information as effectively since the war. In 1964 he became chairman of a joint MI5/MI6 committee, codenamed FLUENCY Working Party, appointed to find the traitor and investigate the whole history of Soviet penetration of Britain. Also from 1964, for the next six years he had regular interviews with Anthony Blunt, a member of the Cambridge Five, trying to glean more information from him about other Soviet spies.Peter Wright. Spycatcher: The Candid Autobiography of a Senior Intelligence Officer, 1987, p. 224. Claims about Roger Hollis, the Wilson Plot et al. While in MI5, Wright came to be aware that the USSR's espionage agencies had been infiltrating the UK's government, military and education establishments from the 1930s by using, among other things, close-knit left-wing homosexual circles at Oxbridge, especially the Cambridge Apostles.Peter Wright. Spycatcher: The Candid Autobiography of a Senior Intelligence Officer, 1987, p. 221. With like-minded MI5 officers, Wright became alert to the fact that some senior figures in the intelligence services, in politics, and in the trade unions were recruited Soviet agents. After the Soviet spy Kim Philby's defection in 1963 following what Wright refers to as a tip-off by \\"a fifth man, still inside\\",Peter Wright. Spycatcher: The Candid Autobiography of a Senior Intelligence Officer, 1987, p. 174, 194-195. he became convinced that the KGB had penetrated the higher reaches of MI5. As claimed in Spycatcher, Wright had come to believe that Roger Hollis was the highest traitor in MI5. Wright went so far as to begin to make, as he himself put it, \\"his own 'freelance' inquiries into Hollis' background\\" shortly before the latter's retirement.Peter Wright. Spycatcher: The Candid Autobiography of a Senior Intelligence Officer, 1987, p. 288. According to Wright, his initial, unspecified, suspicion was aroused by his analysis of how a Soviet 'illegal' Lonsdale's arrest in January 1961 was handled by the KGB which appeared to have had advance knowledge thereof; Wright deduced that Lonsdale could have been sacrificed to protect a more important Soviet spy in Britain.Obituary: Peter Wright The Independent, 28 April 1995. Wright's suspicions were further strengthened by Hollis' apparent obstruction of any attempt to investigate information from several defectors that there was a mole in MI5, but he then discovered that Hollis had concealed relationships with a number of suspicious persons, including: * a longstanding friendship with Claud Cockburn, a communist journalist who was at the time suspected of ties to Soviet intelligence; and, * an acquaintance with Agnes Smedley whilst Hollis was in Shanghai, at a time when Smedley was in a relationship with Richard Sorge, a proven Soviet spymaster. Later during his investigations, Wright looked into the debriefings of a Soviet defector Igor Gouzenko, and found to his surprise that the revelations of that debriefing were not reported or recorded. After a lengthy check, he discovered that it had been Hollis who was sent to Canada to interview Gouzenko. Gouzenko had provided Hollis with clear information about Alan Nunn May's meetings with his handlers. Gouzenko also noted that the man who met him seemed to be in disguise, not interested in his revelations and discouraged him from further disclosures. Gouzenko had not known about Klaus Fuchs, but he had named a low level suspected GRU agent, Israel Halperin, a mathematician, who was later completely cleared. When the Royal Canadian Mounted Police searched Halperin's lodgings, they found Fuchs' name in his address book. Fuchs immediately broke off contact with his handler, Harry Gold, and shortly afterward took a long vacation to Mexico. Wright alleges in Spycatcher that Gouzenko himself deduced later that his interviewer might have been a Soviet double agent and was probably afraid that he might recognise him from case photos that Gouzenko might have seen in KGB or GRU files, which would explain why Hollis was disguised. According to Wright, the FLUENCY Working Party, an interagency committee set up to examine all the hitherto unsolved allegations about penetration of the UK's security apparatus, unanimously concluded, among other things, that Hollis was the best fit for Gouzenko's \\"Elli\\" and Konstantin Volkov's \\"Acting Head\\" allegations.Peter Wright. Spycatcher: The Candid Autobiography of a Senior Intelligence Officer, 1987, p. 293. The committee chaired by Wright submitted its final findings shortly after Hollis retired in late 1965 as MI5 Director-General, but investigation of Hollis was not sanctioned by his successor Martin Furnival Jones, who nevertheless sanctioned the investigation of his deputy, Michael Hanley.Peter Wright. Spycatcher: The Candid Autobiography of a Senior Intelligence Officer, 1987, p. 297. A retired civil servant, Burke Trend, later Lord Trend, was brought in during the early 1970s to review the Hollis case. Trend studied the case for a year, and concluded that the evidence was inconclusive for either convicting or clearing Hollis; this was announced by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in March 1981. Peter Wright, on the basis of his interviews with Sir Dennis Proctor and his friends, also alleged in his book that Proctor, former Permanent Secretary at the UK Ministry of Power, was at the very least, by Proctor's own account, an unwitting source of secret information to the Soviets via his close friend and Soviet spy Guy Burgess, from whom he had kept no secrets which, in Proctor's opinion, obviated the necessity to recruit him.Peter Wright. Spycatcher: The Candid Autobiography of a Senior Intelligence Officer, 1987, p. 262-263. Wright's sights were also focused on Labour prime minister Harold Wilson, suspicions about whom were initially triggered amongst the MI5 management shortly after his appointment as prime minister in 1964 by James Jesus Angleton, Deputy Director of Operations for Counterintelligence at the CIA. The investigation into Wilson's background by MI5, however, failed to produce any conclusive evidence. When Wright retired in 1976, Harold Wilson was again prime minister. Dame Stella Rimington, MI5 Director General from 1992 to 1996, who was in MI5 while Peter Wright was still working there, wrote in 2001 that she believed that in a Panorama programme in 1988, Peter Wright had retracted his allegation made in his book about the MI5 group of thirty officers who plotted to overthrow Wilson's government.Stella Rimington. Spies like us The Guardian, 11 Sept 2001. She also criticised Wright who, according to her, by the time she knew him well was \\"a man with an obsession, and was regarded by many as quite mad and certainly dangerous\\"; she alleged that he was a disruptive and lazy officer, who as special advisor to the Director had a habit of taking case files that interested him from other officers, failing to return them to their proper place and failing to write up any interviews he conducted.

The subsequent appeals against the decision were definitively dismissed in 1988, the High Court of Australia concluding in its decision on the case: ‚Ä≥[...] The appellant's claim for protection (whether injunctive or by way of accounts or damages) ought to have been refused simply on the ground that the Court would not, in the absence of statutory direction, protect the intelligence secrets and confidential political information of the United Kingdom Government.‚Ä≥Attorney- General (UK) v Heinemann Publishers Australia Pty Ltd (\\"Spycatcher case\\") [1988 HCA 25; (1988) 165 CLR 30; (1988) 78 ALR 449; (1988) 62 ALJR 344; (1988) 10 IPR 385 (2 June 1988)] By then, the U.S. edition of the book was already an international best-seller.

A memorandum prepared by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet said among other things: ‚Ä≥The British are seeking to avoid discussion of any of Wright‚Äôs specific allegations, arguing that, for the purposes of the trial, they can all be assumed to be true and even then Wright‚Äôs breach of confidentiality would be a breach of contract and inequitable.‚Ä≥ In the opinion of the official historian of MI5, Christopher Andrew, Turnbull‚Äôs ‚Ä≥brilliant‚Ä≥ handling of the Spycatcher case humiliated British establishment and triggered much-needed intelligence service reform.

No definition of tornado alley has ever been officially designated by the National Weather Service (NWS). Thus, differences in location are the result of the different criteria used. According to the National Severe Storms Laboratory (NSSL) FAQ, \\"Tornado Alley\\" is a term used by the media as a reference to areas that have higher numbers of tornadoes. A study of 1921‚Äì1995 tornadoes concluded almost one-fourth of all significant tornadoes occur in this area. Although the official boundaries of Tornado Alley are not clearly defined, its core extends from northern Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska, Iowa along with South Dakota. Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, and western Ohio are sometimes included in Tornado Alley. Some research suggests that tornadoes are becoming more frequent in the northern parts of Tornado Alley where it reaches the Canadian prairies. No state is entirely free of tornadoes; however, they occur more frequently in the Central United States, between the Rocky Mountains and Appalachian Mountains. Texas reports the most tornadoes of any state, but that is a function of its large size, and its location on the southern end of Tornado Alley. Kansas and Oklahoma ranked first and second respectively in the number of tornadoes per area, per data collected through 2007, however in 2013 statistics from the National Climatic Data Center show Florida ranked first.[20] Although Florida reports a high number and density of tornado occurrences, tornadoes there rarely reach the strength of those that sometimes occur in the Southern Plains. Regionally, the frequency of tornadoes in the United States is closely tied with the progression of the warm season when warm and cold air masses often clash. Another criterion for the location of Tornado Alley (or Tornado Alleys) can be where the strongest tornadoes occur more frequently. Tornado Alley can also be defined as an area reaching from central Texas to the Canadian prairies and from eastern Colorado to western Pennsylvania. It has also been asserted that there are numerous Tornado Alleys. In addition to the Texas/Oklahoma/Kansas core, such areas include the Upper Midwest, the lower Ohio Valley, the Tennessee Valley and the lower Mississippi valley. Some studies suggest that there are also smaller tornado alleys located across the United States. The tornado alleys in the southeastern U.S., notably the lower Mississippi Valley and the upper Tennessee Valley, are sometimes called by the nickname \\"Dixie Alley\\", coined in 1971 by Allen Pearson, former director of the National Severe Storms Forecasting Center (NSSFC).Gagan et al. (2010), page 147. A 2018 study found in the U.S., over the study period 1979-2017, an overall eastward shift of tornado frequency and impacts - toward Dixie Alley.https://www.usatoday.com/story/weather/2018/10/17/tornado-alley- shifting-east/1660803002/ The study found, since 1979, relatively-lower tornado frequency and impacts in parts of the traditional Tornado Alley, especially areas from north-central Texas toward the Houston, TX area, and relatively-higher tornado frequency and impacts in parts of the Mid-South, especially eastern Arkansas, the greater Memphis, TN area and northern Mississippi - all areas near the heart of Dixie Alley - see especially Figure 4. In Tornado Alley, warm, humid air from the equator meets cool to cold, dry air from Canada and the Rocky Mountains. This creates an ideal environment for tornadoes to form within developed thunderstorms and super cells.  Origin of the term  The term \\"tornado alley\\" was first used in 1952 by U.S. Air Force meteorologists Major Ernest J. Fawbush (1915‚Äì1982) and Captain Robert C. Miller (1920‚Äì1998) as the title of a research project to study severe weather in parts of Texas and Oklahoma.See: # Jeremy Singer-Vine (May 23, 2011) \\"How did \\"Tornado Alley\\" get its name?,\\" Slate (on-line magazine). # John P. Gagan, Alan Gerard, and John Gordon (December 2010) \\"A historical and statistical comparison of \\"Tornado Alley\\" to \\"Dixie Alley\\", \\" National Weather Digest, vol. 34, no. 2, pages 146-155; see especially page 146. # \\"Weather officers commended,\\" Take-Off (newspaper of Tinker Air Force Base; Midwest City, Oklahoma), January 16, 1953. # Results of search of Google Books for \\"tornado alley\\".  Impact  Despite the elevated frequency of destructive tornadoes, building codes, such as requiring strengthened roofs and more secure connections between the building and its foundation, are not necessarily stricter compared to other areas of the United States and are markedly weaker than some hurricane prone areas such as south Florida. One particular tornado- afflicted town, Moore, Oklahoma, managed to increase its building requirements in 2014. Other common precautionary measures include the construction of storm cellars, and the installation of tornado sirens. Tornado awareness, preparedness, and media weather coverage are also high. The southeastern United States is particularly prone to violent, long track tornadoes. Much of the housing in this region is less robust compared to other areas in the United States, and many people live in mobile homes. As a result, tornado- related casualties in the southern United States are higher. Significant tornadoes occur less frequently than in the traditionally recognized tornado alley, however, very severe and expansive outbreaks occur every few years.  Frequency of tornadoes  These figures, reported by the National Climatic Data Center for the period between 1991 and 2010, show the seventeen U.S. states with the highest average number of tornadoes per per year. # Florida: 12.2 # Kansas: 11.7 # Maryland: 9.9 # Illinois: 9.7 # Mississippi: 9.2 # Iowa: 9.1 # Oklahoma: 9 # South Carolina: 9 # Alabama: 8.6 # Louisiana: 8.5 # Arkansas: 7.5 # Nebraska: 7.4 # Missouri: 6.5 # North Carolina: 6.4 # Tennessee: 6.2 # Indiana: 6.1 # Texas: 5.9  Tornadoes in Canada  Canada gets the second most tornadoes in the world, after the United States. The average number of tornadoes per equal area of land is highest in the southern parts of Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and Ontario. Roughly half of all Canadian tornadoes strike the Canadian prairies and Northern Ontario as far east as Lake Superior. Together, these regions make up the northernmost border of the U.S. Tornado Alley. Tornadoes up to EF5 in strength have been documented in this region.http://ec.gc.ca/meteo- weather/default.asp?lang=En&n;=6C5D4990-1#tornadoes Another third of Canadian tornadoes strike Southern Ontario, especially in the region between the Great Lakes to the nation's capital city, Ottawa. Tornadoes in this region are triggered or augmented by lake breeze fronts from Lake Huron, Lake Erie, Lake Ontario, and Georgian Bay. Tornadoes do not often hit lake shadow regions, although they are not unknown, and some, such as the 2011 Goderich tornado, and the 2018 Ottawa tornados have been violent. However, most Ontario tornadoes are concentrated in a narrow corridor from Windsor and Ottawa.http://mobile.theweathernetwork.com/news/storm_watch_stories3&stormfile;=Should__Tornado_Alley__be_expanded__11_04_2012?ref=ccbox_news_topstories Tornadoes up to EF4 in strength have been documented in this region. Southwestern Ontario weather is strongly influenced by its peninsular position between the Great Lakes. As a result, increases in temperature in this region are likely to increase the amount of precipitation in storms due to lake evaporation. Increased temperature contrasts may also increase the violence and possibly the number of tornadoes. Northern Ontario between the Manitoba border and Lake Superior is also prone to severe tornadoes, but tornadoes in this area are believed to be underestimated due to the extremely low population in this region.

Page 737 as a double feature with the British science fiction film The Strange World of Planet X (a.k.a. Cosmic Monsters in the United States). The Trollenberg Terrors storyline concerns United Nations troubleshooter Alan Brooks, later joined by journalist Philip Truscott, investigating unusual accidents occurring in the area of a resort hotel on (the fictional) Mount Trollenberg in Switzerland. Brooks suspects these deaths are related to a series of similar incidents that occurred three years earlier in the Andes Mountains, which involved an unexplained radioactive mist and an odd cloud formation believed by locals to be inhabited. Plot On the Swiss mountain Trollenberg, one of three student climbers is suddenly killed, his head ripped from his body. Two sisters, Anne (Munro) and Sarah Pilgrim (Jayne), a London mind-reading act, are travelling by train to Geneva when Anne faints as the train passes the mountain. Upon waking, Anne insists that they must get off at the next stop. UN troubleshooter Alan Brooks (Tucker), in the same train compartment as the sisters, goes to Trollenberg's observatory, where Professor Crevett (Warren Mitchell) explains that, despite many climbing accidents, no bodies are ever found; an always-stationary radioactive cloud is regularly observed on the mountain's south face. Brooks learns that similar incidents took place in the Andes three years earlier, before a similar radioactive cloud vanished without a trace. Local rumours circulated that something was living in the mist. Anne is giving a mind-reading demonstration at the hotel when she \\"sees\\" two men in a base camp hut on the mountain: Dewhurst (Stuart Saunders) is asleep when the other man, Brett (Andrew Faulds), under some kind of mental compulsion, walks outside. Meanwhile, the cloud has enveloped the hut. Anne suddenly faints again, and Brooks phones the hut but no one answers. A rescue party ventures to the hut looking for both men. Anne, in a trance- like state, urges the rescuers to stay away. Inside the hut, the group discovers that everything is frozen solid, despite the hut being locked from the inside. Dewhurst's body is found under the bed, its head missing. A spotter plane arrives and circles overhead, and a man is seen off in the distance. At his location, the first rescuer there finds a rucksack with a severed head inside. He is suddenly set upon and killed by Brett, who quickly dispatches the second rescuer. At the hotel, Brett wanders in, claiming he has was lost. Thereafter, he launches a knife attack on Anne, but the men manage to subdue him. During the struggle, Brett sustains a severe head gash, but no blood flows from the wound. Brett is heavily sedated and locked away. Brooks recalls a similar incident in the Andes that followed a similar pattern: a man murdered an elderly woman who allegedly possessed psychic abilities just like those displayed by Anne. The killer's body was discovered to have been dead for at least 24 hours prior to his murder of the old women. Brett escapes his improvised cell and resumes his hunt for Anne, this time armed with a hand axe. Before he can reach her, Brooks quickly dispatches Brett with a pistol. Upon inspection, Brett's flesh appears to be frozen, and rapidly melts into nothing in the heat. The cloud has begun to move down the mountainside towards the hotel, so the group retreats to the heavily fortified observatory. As they enter the cable car, a mother realises that her young daughter is missing. In a thickening mist, a giant, multi-tentacled creature with a single huge eye appears at the hotel, smashing down the front door. Brooks manages to rescue the child from the lobby, both of them narrowly escaping its tentacles. They return to the cable car, but the delay has given the thickening mist a chance to reach the car platform. The transport motor begins to freeze, starting and stopping, the cable slipping, but the cable car arrives safely. The sole cloud has now split and become five while converging on the observatory. Hans (Colin Douglas), who left the hotel, suddenly turns up at the observatory. Once inside, he begins exhibiting the same obsession with Anne. Hans tries to strangle her, but Brooks stops him by stabbing him. As the large tentacled monsters near the observatory, everyone makes Molotov cocktails to combat them. By radio, Alan orders an aerial firebombing raid against the observatory, which has a reinforced concrete roof and walls that can withstand the assault. Journalist Philip Truscott (Payne) strikes one of the huge one- eyed creatures with a Molotov cocktail, setting it ablaze. He is caught by a tentacle from another monster now atop the observatory's roof. With another Molotov cocktail, Brooks sets that one ablaze, forcing it to drop Truscott. Later, Truscott does the same to another creature that has managed to breach a thick wall in order to get at Anne. The aerial firebombing assault begins and is successful at torching all the remaining monsters.

Reception In the January 1, 1959 issue of The New York Times, film critic Richard W. Nason reviewed the double feature starring Forrest Tucker and opined that \\"...\\"The Crawling Eye\\" and \\"The Cosmic Monster\\" do nothing to enhance or advance the copious genre of science fiction\\".

Since ancient times, the Skeena has been an important transportation artery, particularly for the Tsimshian and the Gitxsan‚Äîwhose names mean \\"inside the Skeena River\\" and \\"people of the Skeena River,\\" respectively. The river and its basin sustain a wide variety of fish, wildlife, and vegetation; and communities native to the area depend on the health of the river. The Tsimshian migrated to the Lower Skeena River, and the Gitxsan occupy territory of the Upper Skeena. During the Omineca Gold Rush, steamboat services ran from the sea to Hazelton, which was the jumping-off point for the trails to the goldfields. The Hudson's Bay Company established a major trading post on the Skeena at what became called Port Simpson, British Columbia (Lax Kw'alaams), where nine tribes of the Tsimshian nation settled about 1834. Other tribes live elsewhere in BC, and descendants of one group in Metlatkala, Alaska.  Geography  The Skeena originates south of the Spatsizi Plateau Wilderness Provincial Park in north western British Columbia, forming a divide with the Klappan River, a tributary of the Stikine River. It flows for Map of Skeena River before it empties into Chatham Sound, Telegraph Passage and Ogden Channel, east of the Dixon Entrance, all part of the Pacific Ocean. The Skeena drains of land with a mean annual discharge of . =Course= Skeena River at Telegraph Point, east of the city of Prince Rupert, British Columbia The Skeena River originates at the southern end of Spatsizi Plateau, in a valley between Mount Gunanoot and Mount Thule, south of the Stikine River watershed. The abandoned track of BC Rail's Dease Lake Extension runs along the river in its upper course. It flows south-east, between the shallow peaks of the Skeena Mountains, through the McEvoy and Jackson flats. It continues in this direction until it passes the Slamgeesh Range, then flows westwards to Fourth Cabin, when it turns south through a shallow canyon below Poison Mountain. After Kuldo it takes an eastward turn, then flows south again below Cutoff Mountain and Mount Pope. It continues through rolling hills to the community of Kispiox and then Hazelton, where it receives the waters of Morice-Bulkley River, and turns south-west. The Yellowhead Highway and a Canadian National Railway track follow the course of the Skeena on this section. At Kitwanga, the river is crossed by Highway 37, and then turns south around the Seven Sisters Peaks and Bulkley Ranges, through the Skeena Provincial Forest, then between the Nass Ranges and Borden Glacier, past the ferry crossing at Usk, through the Kitselas Canyon, and then through the Kleanza Creek Provincial Park. It then flows south-west through the city of Terrace, where the river widens. It continues westwards, followed by the Highway 16 and Canadian National Railway line, passes near the Exchamsiks River Provincial Park, then flows into the Dixon Entrance at Eleanor Passage, between Port Edward and Port Essington, facing De Horsey Island.

Skeena River - Four Seasons of Skeena Fishing, http://www.bcadventure.com, URL accessed 6 November 2006The Skeena River , Z-Boat Lodge River Guides, URL accessed 6 November 2006 The Skeena is also very important to the commercial fishing industry. For example, numbering 5 million spawning salmon a year, the Skeena is second only to the Fraser River in Canada in its capacity to produce sockeye salmon.Salmon - Sockeye - Skeena River: Fishery Outlook / Management, Fisheries and Oceans Canada, URL accessed 11 November 2006 However, in the last 40 years there has been a decrease in some of the fish species, leading to strict fishing regulations for the commercial fishery. The following types of Pacific salmon can be found in the Skeena: *Chinook salmon, sometimes known as king, Tyee, spring, Quinnat, tule, or blackmouth salmon. *Chum salmon, sometimes known as dog or calico salmon. *Coho salmon, sometimes known as silver salmon. *Pink salmon, sometimes known as humpback salmon. *Sockeye salmon, sometimes known as red salmon or blueback salmon. Other anadromous species: *Steelhead, anadromous form of rainbow trout = Bears = The rare Kermode bear lives in and near the Skeena Valley from Prince Rupert to Hazelton.

Bennett, 1997, = Riverboats = While canoes played a crucial role on the Skeena for centuries, the age of the steamboat heralded a new era of boating on the Skeena. The first steam-powered vessel to enter the Skeena was the Union in 1864. In 1866 the Mumford attempted to ascend the river but was only able to reach the Kitsumkalum River. It was not until 1891 that the Hudson's Bay Company sternwheeler the Caledonia successfully negotiated through the Kitselas Canyon and reached Hazelton. A number of other steamers were built around the turn of the century, in part due to the growing fish industry and the gold rush. =See also= *List of British Columbia rivers *Steamboats of the Skeena River *List of ships in British Columbia References Category:Rivers of the North Coast of British Columbia Category:Skeena Country ","title":"Skeena River"},{"id":"896822","text":"Value-level programming refers to one of the two contrasting programming paradigms identified by John Backus in his work on programs as mathematical objects, the other being function-level programming. Backus originally used the term object-level programming but that term is now prone to confusion with object-oriented programming. Value-level programs are those that describe how to combine various values (i.e., numbers, symbols, strings, etc.) to form other values until the final result values are obtained. New values are constructed from existing ones by the application of various value-to-value functions, such as addition, concatenation, matrix inversion, and so on. Conventional, von Neumann programs are value-level: expressions on the right side of assignment statements are exclusively concerned with building a value that is then to be stored. Connection with Data Types The value-level approach to programming invites the study of the space of values under the value-forming operations, and of the algebraic properties of those operations. This is what is called the study of data types, and it has advanced from focusing on the values themselves and their structure, to a primary concern with the value-forming operations and their structure, as given by certain axioms and algebraic laws, that is, to the algebraic study of data types. Connection with Lambda Calculus languages Lambda calculus-based languages (such as Lisp, ISWIM, and Scheme) are in actual practice value-level languages, although they are not thus restricted by design. To see why typical lambda style programs are primarily value-level, consider the usual definition of a value-to-value function, say f = Œªx.E here, x must be a value variable (since the argument of f is a value by definition) and E must denote a value too (since f's result is a value by definition). Typically, E is an expression involving the application of value-forming functions to value variables and constants; nevertheless, a few value-forming functions having both function and value arguments do exist and are used for limited purposes. If the term values is defined to include the value variables themselves, then the value- level view of programming is one of building values by the application of existing programs (value-forming operations/functions) to other values. Lambda-style programming builds a new program from the result-value by lambda- abstracting the value variables.

After her final refit, she was a guided missile destroyer. She was the sixth ship of her class and the first Canadian war ship to bear the name Terra Nova. The ship's badge honours the Terra Nova River in Newfoundland as well as an earlier civilian ship, , which gained fame during a scientific exploration voyage to Antarctica. They are represented as a river and the Antarctic (symbolized by a penguin) on the ship's badge. Design and description Based on the preceding design, the Restigouche-class ships had the same hull and propulsion, but different weaponry.Gardiner and Chumbley, p. 45 Initially the St. Laurent-class had been planned to be 14 ships. However the order was halved, and the following seven were redesigned to take into improvements made on the St. Laurent-class ships. As time passed, their design diverged further from that of the St. Laurent- class ships Milner, p. 248 The ships had a displacement of , at deep load. They were designed to be long with a beam of and a draught of . The Restigouches had a complement of 214.Macpherson and Barrie (2002), p. 251 The Restigouche-class ships were by powered by two English Electric geared steam turbines, each driving a propellor shaft, using steam provided by two Babcock & Wilcox boilers. They generated giving the vessels a maximum speed of . The Restigouche-class ships were equipped with SPS-10, SPS-12, Sperry Mk 2 and SPG-48 radar along with SQS-501 and SQS-503 sonar.Gardiner and Chumbly, p. 46 =Armament= The Restigouche-class ships diverged from the St. Laurent-class ships in their weaponry. The Restigouche-class ships were equipped with two twin mounts of Vickers /70 calibre Mk 6 dual-purpose guns forward and maintained a single twin mount of 3-inch/50 calibre Mk 22 guns aft used in the preceding class.Calibre denotes the length of the barrel. In this case, 50 calibre means that the gun barrel is 50 times as long as it is in diameter A Mk 69 fire control director was added to control the new guns.Boutiller, p. 323 They were also armed with two Limbo Mk 10 mortars and two single Bofors 40 mm guns. However the 40 mm guns were dropped in the final design. The 3 in/70 mounting was placed in the 'A' position and the 3 in/50 mounting was placed in the 'Y' position. The destroyers were also equipped beginning in 1958 with Mk 43 homing torpedoes in an effort to increase the distance between the ships and their targets. The Mk 43 torpedo had a range of at . They were pitched over the side by a modified depth charge thrower.Milner, p. 225 =Improved Restigouche Escorts (IRE)= As part of the 1964 naval program, the Royal Canadian Navy planned to improve the attack capabilities of the Restigouche- class. Unable to convert the vessels to helicopter-carrying versions like the St. Laurents due to budget constraints, instead Restigouche-class ships were to receive variable depth sonar (VDS) to improve their sonar range, placed on the stern, and the RUR-5 anti-submarine rocket (ASROC). The destroyers also received a stepped latticed mast. Called the Improved Restigouche Escorts (IRE), Terra Nova was the first to undergo conversion, beginning in May 1965. The conversion took ten months to complete, followed by sea trials. The sea trials delayed the conversion of the next ship for four years.Milner, p. 259 By 1969, the budget for naval programs had been cut and only four out of the seven (Terra Nova, Restigouche, Gatineau and Kootenay) would get upgraded to IRE standards and the remaining three (Chaudi√®re, Columbia, and St. Croix) were placed in reserve.Milner, p. 265 The ASROC launcher replaced the 3 in/50 cal twin mount and one Mk 10 Limbo mortars aft. The ASROC was rocket-propelled acoustically-guided Mk 44 torpedo that had a minimum range of and a maximum range of . =Destroyer Life Extension (DELEX)= The Destroyer Life Extension (DELEX) refit for the four surviving Restigouche-class ships was announced in 1978. An effort by Maritime Command to update their existing stock of naval escorts, the DELEX program affected 16 ships in total and came in several different formats depending on the class of ship it was being applied to.Milner, p. 277 On average, the DELEX refit cost $24 million per ship.German, p. 317 For the Restigouches this meant updating their sensor, weapon and communications systems. The class received the new ADLIPS tactical data system, new radar and fire control systems and satellite navigation. They were also fitted with a triple torpedo tube mounting to use the new Mk 46 torpedo.Milner, p. 278 The ships began undergoing their DELEX refits in the early 1980s.Macpherson and Barrie (2002), pp. 251‚Äì255 However, by the time the ships emerged from their refits, they were already obsolete as the Falklands War had changed the way surface battles were fought. =Gulf War refit= With the advent of the Gulf War in August 1990, Maritime Command was asked to have a fleet of ships available to send to the Persian Gulf, preferably three ships. The and the replenishment ship would be made part of the task force; however, all the other Iroquois-class vessels were in refit. Maritime Command chose from among the remaining fleet the vessel with the best electronic countermeasures suite, Terra Nova, to deploy with the task force.Milner, p. 296 Terra Nova was quickly altered to make her ready for an active war zone. The ship's ASROC system was landed and instead two quad Harpoon surface-to- surface missile systems were installed. A Mk 15 Phalanx close-in weapon system was placed on the quarterdeck in place of the landed Limbo ASW mortar, and two 40 mm/60 calibre Boffin guns were installed in single mounts where the ship's boats were. The ship was also fitted with new chaff, electronic and communications systems.Macpherson and Barrie (2002), p. 255 Restigouche received a similar refit before deploying as Terra Novas intended replacement in the Persian Gulf in 1991.Milner, p. 300Macpherson and Barrie (2002), p. 254 Construction and career Terra Nova, named for river in Newfoundland and Labrador, was laid down on 14 November 1952 by Victoria Machinery Depot Co. Ltd at Victoria, British Columbia. The ship was launched on 21 June 1955 and commissioned at Victoria on 6 June 1959 with the classification DDE 259. Following her commissioning, Terra Nova joined the ceremonies for the opening of the Saint Lawrence Seaway in July 1959.Barrie and Macpherson (1996), pp. 49‚Äì51 The following year, in August, with sister ships , and , she took part in the 500th anniversary of Prince Henry the Navigator's death off Lisbon. After work ups, the ship was assigned to the Fifth Canadian Escort Squadron. In March 1961, the destroyer escort was among the ships that took part in a combined naval exercise with the United States Navy off Nova Scotia. In March 1965, Terra Nova and Gatineau participated in the search for a Royal Canadian Air Force Canadair CP-107 Argus that had disappeared north of San Juan, Puerto Rico. In May, the ship began her IRE refit. As the first to undergo the conversion, Terra Nova tested the new SQS-505 sonar for several months before the refit was considered completed. In all the conversion took ten months to complete. However Terra Novas sea trials delayed the conversion program by four years. During this period, the ship first transferred from to the Third Canadian Escort Squadron in January 1966, before being transferred to the west coast as part of the re-ordering of naval forces following the Unification of the Canadian Armed Forces in 1968. She was one of four Restigouche-class vessels that were transferred to the west coast, to replace the s in the Second Canadian Escort Squadron.Zimmerman, p. 162 The ship returned to duty on 4 May 1971 at Esquimalt, British Columbia. From 29 January to 26 June 1973, Kootenay and Terra Nova were deployed off the coast of Vietnam as part of the Canadian contribution to the International Commission of Control and Supervision following the end of the Vietnam War. In November 1981, cracks were found in the superheater headers of . Inspections were ordered for the Restigouche-class vessels, of which Terra Nova was found to have similar issues. The ship was repaired and back in service within six months.Barrie and Macpherson (1996), p. 13 In May 1983, the ship made a four-day visit to China on behalf of the Department of External Affairs. Terra Nova was taken in hand on 21 November 1983 for her DELEX refit, performed at Esquimalt. She returned to service on 9 November 1984. Norfolk, Virginia in 1995 alongside the US aircraft carrier . On 12 December 1989, Terra Nova transferred to the east coast in exchange for as part of the reorganization of the fleet.Gimblett, p. 179 Due to a shortage of Iroquois-class destroyers, Terra Nova was selected for deployment as part of Canada's contribution to Operation Desert Shield. She received a Gulf War refit before deploying and sailed for the Persian Gulf with the destroyer Athabaskan and the replenishment ship Preserver on 24 August 1990. They arrived in theatre on 27 September and Terra Nova performed her first patrol on 1 October.Milner, p. 297 Terra Nova returned to Halifax on 7 April 1991. The Task Group was assigned to the international coalition maritime interdiction force in the central Persian Gulf which consisted of a variety of coalition naval forces on station through the fall of 1990. After Operation Desert Storm began in January, the Canadian Naval Task Group undertook escort duties for hospital ships and other coalition naval vessels. In October 1992, Terra Nova began a refit at Port Weller Dry Dock in St. Catharines, Ontario, reentering service in 1993. On 22 February 1994, Terra Nova boarded the private vessel , seizing of cocaine. That same year, Terra Nova was part of the blockade enforcing United Nations resolutions on Haiti from 28 April to 18 July, rescuing two boatloads of refugees during this tour. She returned to blockade duty from 7 September to 19 October. On 11 July 1997, the ship was taken out of active service and on 1 July 1998, paid off on 1 July 1998. The ship was sold in October 2009, along with Gatineau for $4,258,529 to Aecon Fabco for scrapping. The ships were towed to Pictou, Nova Scotia in mid-November 2009 for breaking up. During the scrapping process, Terra Nova sank at her moorings. The hulk was later raised by crane.

She was born in Kasauli, India, and educated in Berkshire, studying Russian and French. After school, she worked in London before joining the Allied Control Commission and moving to West Germany. There she met her future husband, Ruari Chisholm, and began working for British Intelligence. Her husband was a spy who headed the MI6 station in Moscow but worked under the guise of a visa officer. When Oleg Penkovsky offered Soviet military secrets to MI6, she became the go-between. To all outward appearances, Janet was an ordinary mother of three children. She would meet Penkovsky in a local park and he would offer what appeared to be sweets, but were actually disguised documents containing military secrets about the Soviet nuclear weapons arsenal. Their cover was eventually blown by another British agent, George Blake, who had defected to the Soviet side. Penkovsky was quickly arrested and executed and the Chisholms were deported. Controversy surrounds Penkovsky's death, with many believing that MI6 put him in danger after Blake confessed all to the Soviet officials. For their part, MI6 have always maintained that he insisted on continuing to feed the British information even after his life was threatened. The Chisholms went on to work in Singapore and South Africa until Ruari's retirement. He had planned to write a memoir but died of malaria before he could begin. Janet continued to travel around the world until well into her 70s. She refused to talk about her experiences in Russia and took all of the secrets she learned to the grave. Portrayal in popular culture Chisholm was portrayed by Lucy Liemann in the 2007 BBC Television docudrama Nuclear Secrets. The programme included covert KGB photographs showing Janet Chisholm meeting Oleg Penkovsky.

This is sometimes contrasted with a so-called \\"objective test\\" / \\"self-report test\\", which adopt a \\"structured\\" approach as responses are analyzed according to a presumed universal standard (for example, a multiple choice exam), and are limited to the content of the test. The responses to projective tests are content analyzed for meaning rather than being based on presuppositions about meaning, as is the case with objective tests. Projective tests have their origins in psychoanalysis, which argues that humans have conscious and unconscious attitudes and motivations that are beyond or hidden from conscious awareness. Theory The general theoretical position behind projective tests is that whenever a specific question is asked, the response will be consciously- formulated and socially determined. These responses do not reflect the respondent's unconscious or implicit attitudes or motivations. The respondent's deep-seated motivations may not be consciously recognized by the respondent or the respondent may not be able to verbally express them in the form and structure demanded by the questioner. Advocates of projective tests stress that the ambiguity of the stimuli presented within the tests allow subjects to express thoughts that originate on a deeper level than tapped by explicit questions, and provide content that may not be captured by responsive tools that lacks appropriate items. After some decrease in interest in the 1980s and 1990s, newer research suggesting that implicit motivation is best captured in this way has increased the research and use of these tools. Projective hypothesis This holds that an individual puts structure on an ambiguous situation in a way that is consistent with their own conscious and unconscious needs. It is an indirect method- testee is talking about something that comes spontaneously from the self without conscious awareness or editing. *Reduces temptation to fake *Does not depend as much on verbal abilities *Taps both conscious and unconscious traits *Focus is clinical perspective - not normative - but has developed norms over the years Projective Methods for Personality Assessment. (n.d.). Retrieved November 21, 2012, from http://www.neiu.edu/~mecondon/proj-lec.htm. Common variants =Rorschach= The best known and most frequently used projective test is the Rorschach inkblot test. This test was originally developed in 1921 to diagnose schizophrenia. Subjects are shown a series of ten irregular but symmetrical inkblots, and asked to explain what they see . The subject's responses are then analyzed in various ways, noting not only what was said, but the time taken to respond, which aspect of the drawing was focused on, and how single responses compared to other responses for the same drawing. It is important that the Rorschach test and other projective tests be conducted by experienced professionals to ensure validity and consistency of results. The Rorschach was commonly scored using the Comprehensive System (CS), until the development of the newer scoring system, the Rorschach Performance Assessment System (R-PAS) in 2011. The new scoring system has stronger psychometric properties than the CS, and, like the CS, allows for a standardized administration of the test which is something that is lacking in a majority of projective measures. Additional psychometric strengths present with the R-PAS include updated normative data. The norms from the CS were updated to also include protocols from 15 other countries, resulting in updated international norms. The CS international norm data set was based on fewer countries, most of which were European only. The new international norms provide a better representation of the Western hemisphere and westernized countries. Concerning differences in administration of the task across both scoring systems, a critical issue with CS administration was addressed in the development of the R-PAS. Following CS administration procedure, it was common to obtain too few or too many responses per card which could result in an invalidated protocol (due to too few responses) or in error. The new administration procedure introduced in the R-PAS requires the clinician to initially tell the examinee that they should provide two or three responses per card, and allows the clinician to prompt for additional responses if too few are given, or to pull cards away if too many are given. Therefore, the new administration procedure addresses the critical issue of number of responses that was prevalent with use of the CS administration procedure. The CS administration procedure prevented clinicians from prompting for more responses or pulling cards when too many responses were provided. An additional psychometric improvement concerns the presentation of obtained scores. With the R-PAS system, it is now possible to change scores to percentiles and convert percentiles to standard scores which can be presented visually and allow for easy comparison to the normative data. With the CS, this was not possible and it was more difficult to compare results to normative comparison groups. Lastly, the R-PAS scores have been shown to possess similar and sometimes stronger inter-rater reliability than was seen in scores from the CS. This means that when different clinicians score the same protocol, they are quite likely to derive the same interpretations and scores. =Holtzman Inkblot Test= This is a variation of the Rorschach test, but uses a much larger pool of different images. Its main differences lie in its objective scoring criteria as well as limiting subjects to one response per inkblot (to avoid variable response productivity). Different variables such as reaction time are scored for an individual's response upon seeing an inkblot.Gamble, K. R. (1972). The holtzman inkblot technique. Psychological Bulletin, 77(3), 172-194. =Thematic apperception test= Another popular projective test is the Thematic Apperception Test (TAT) in which an individual views ambiguous scenes of people, and is asked to describe various aspects of the scene; for example, the subject may be asked to describe what led up to this scene, the emotions of the characters, and what might happen afterwards. A clinician will evaluate these descriptions, attempting to discover the conflicts, motivations and attitudes of the respondent. A researcher may use a specific scoring system that establishes consistent criteria of expressed thoughts and described behaviors associated with a specific trait, e.g., the need for Achievement, which has a validated and reliable scoring system. In the answers, the respondent \\"projects\\" their unconscious attitudes and motivations into the picture, which is why these are referred to as \\"projective tests.\\" =Draw-A-Person test= The Draw-A-Person test requires the subject to draw a person. The results are based on a psychodynamic interpretation of the details of the drawing, such as the size, shape and complexity of the facial features, clothing and background of the figure. As with other projective tests, the approach has very little demonstrated validity and there is evidence that therapists may attribute pathology to individuals who are merely poor artists. A similar class of techniques is kinetic family drawing. =Animal Metaphor Test= The Animal Metaphor test consists of a series of creative and analytical prompts in which the person filling out the test is asked to create a story and then interpret its personal significance. Unlike conventional projective tests, the Animal Metaphor Test works as both a diagnostic and therapeutic battery. Unlike the Rorschach test and TAT, the Animal Metaphor is premised on self-analysis via self-report questions. The test combines facets of art therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, and insight therapy, while also providing a theoretical platform of behavioral analysis. The test has been used widely as a clinical tool, as an educational assessment, and in human resource selection. The test is accompanied by an inventory, The Relational Modality Evaluation Scale, a self-report measure that targets individuals' particular ways of resolving conflict and ways of dealing with relational stress. These tests were developed by Dr. Albert J Levis at the Center for the Study of Normative Behavior in Hamden, CT, a clinical training and research center. =Sentence completion test= Sentence completion tests require the subject complete sentence \\"stems\\" with their own words. The subject's response is considered to be a projection of their conscious and/or unconscious attitudes, personality characteristics, motivations, and beliefs. =Picture Arrangement Test= Created by Silvan Tomkins, this psychological test consists of 25 sets of 3 pictures which the subject must arrange into a sequence that they \\"feel makes the best sense\\". The reliability of this test has been disputed, however. For example, patients suffering from schizophrenia have been found to score as more \\"normal\\" than patients with no such mental disorders.Piotrowski, Z. (1958-01-01). The Tomkins-Horn Picture Arrangement Test. The journal of nervous and mental disease, 126(1), 106. Other picture tests: * Thompson version * CAT (animals) and CAT-H (humans) * Senior AT * Blacky pictures test - dogs * Picture Story Test - adolescents * Education Apperception Test -attitudes towards learning * Michigan Picture Test - children 8-14 * TEMAS - Hispanic children * Make-A-Picture-Story (MAPS) - make own pictures from figures, 6 years and older =Word Association Test= Word association testing is a technique developed by Carl Jung to explore complexes in the personal unconscious. Jung came to recognize the existence of groups of thoughts, feelings, memories, and perceptions, organized around a central theme, that he termed psychological complexes. This discovery was related to his research into word association, a technique whereby words presented to patients elicit other word responses that reflect related concepts in the patients‚Äô psyche, thus providing clues to their unique psychological make-up Merriam-Webster.

Graphology has been controversial for more than a century. Although supporters point to the anecdotal evidence of positive testimonials as a reason to use it for personality evaluation, most empirical studies fail to show the validity claimed by its supporters. Statistical debate From the perspective of statistical validity, psychometrics and positivism, criticisms of projective tests, and depth psychology tests, usually include the well-known discrepancy between statistical validity and clinical validity.Leopold Szondi (1960) Das zweite Buch: Lehrbuch der Experimentellen Triebdiagnostik. Huber, Bern und Stuttgart, 2nd edition. Ch.27, From the Spanish translation, B)II Las condiciones estadisticas, p.396. Quotation: In the case of clinical use, they rely heavily on clinical judgment, lack statistical reliability and statistical validity and many have no standardized criteria to which results may be compared, however this is not always the case. These tests are used frequently, though the scientific evidence is sometimes debated. There have been many empirical studies based on projective tests (including the use of standardized norms and samples), particularly more established tests. The criticism of lack of scientific evidence to support them and their continued popularity has been referred to as the \\"projective paradox\\". Responding to the statistical criticism of his projective test, Leopold Szondi said that his test actually discovers \\"fate and existential possibilities hidden in the inherited familial unconscious and the personal unconscious, even those hidden because never lived through or because have been rejected. Is any statistical method able to span, understand and integrate mathematically all these possibilities? I deny this categorically.\\"Szondi (1960) Das zweite Buch: Lehrbuch der Experimentellen Triebdiagnostik. Huber, Bern und Stuttgart, 2nd edition. Ch.27, From the Spanish translation, B)II Las condiciones estadisticas, p.396 Other research, however, has established that projective tests measure things that responsive tests do not, though it is theoretically possible to combine the two, e.g., Spangler, 1992 Psychological Bulletin, Vol. 172, No.1, 140-154. Decades of works by advocates, e.g., David C. McClelland, David Winter, Abigail Stewart, and, more recently, Oliver Schultheiss, have shown clear validity for these tools for certain personality traits, most especially implicit motivation (as contrasted with self-attributed or \\"explicit\\" motivation, which are conscious states) (McClelland, Koestner, & Weinberger 1989), and that criticisms of projective tools based on techniques used for responsive tools is simply an inappropriate method of measurement.

The more descriptive \\"rating scale or self-report measures\\" and \\"free response measures\\" are suggested, rather than the terms \\"objective tests\\" and \\"projective tests,\\" respectively.Meyer, Gregory J. and Kurtz, John E.(2006) 'Advancing Personality Assessment Terminology: Time to Retire \\"Objective\\" and \\"Projective\\" As Personality Test Descriptors', Journal of Personality Assessment, 87: 3, 223 ‚Äî 225 Additionally, there are inherent biases implied in the terminology itself. For example, when individuals use the term \\"objective\\" to describe a test, it is assumed that the test possess accuracy and precision. Conversely, when the term \\"projective\\" is used to describe a test, it is assumed that these measures are less accurate. Neither of these assumptions are fully accurate, and have led researchers to develop alternative terminology to describe various projective measures. For example, it has been proposed that the Rorschach be labeled as a \\"behavioral task\\" due to its ability to provide an in vivo or real life sample of human behavior. It is easy to forget that both objective and projective tests are capable of producing objective data, and both require some form of subjective interpretation from the examiner. Objective testing, such as self-report measures, like the MMPI-2, require objective responses from the examinee and subjective interpretations from the examiner. Projective testing, such as the Rorschach, requires subjective responses from the examinee, and can in theory involve objective (actuarial) interpretation. Uses in marketing Projective techniques, including TATs, are used in qualitative marketing research, for example to help identify potential associations between brand images and the emotions they may provoke. In advertising, projective tests are used to evaluate responses to advertisements. The tests have also been used in management to assess achievement motivation and other drives, in sociology to assess the adoption of innovations, and in anthropology to study cultural meaning. The application of responses is different in these disciplines than in psychology, because the responses of multiple respondents are grouped together for analysis by the organisation commissioning the research, rather than interpreting the meaning of the responses given by a single subject. Uses in business Projective techniques are used extensively in people assessment; besides variants of the TAT, which are used to identify implicit motive patterns, the Behavioral Event Interview pioneered by American psychologist David McClelland and many of its related approaches (such as the Critical Incident Interview, the Behavioral Interview, and so on) is fundamentally a projective tool in that it invites someone to tell a specific story about recent actions they took, but does not ask leading questions or questions with yes or no answers.

He entered politics to support the arts in Britain and helped achieve free access to public art and museums. He was a Member of Parliament (MP) for Ipswich, 1842‚Äì1847. That year he was appointed as governor of the Falkland Islands, off the coast of Argentina. Early life and education George Rennie was born to George Rennie, agriculturist, and his wife in Phantassie, East Lothian, Scotland. He was a nephew of John Rennie, the civil engineer. Interested in art from an early age, Rennie studied sculpture at Rome as a young man. Art career After his return to Britain, Rennie worked as a sculptor. He exhibited statues and busts at the Royal Academy from 1828 to 1837. He also exhibited three times at the Suffolk Street Gallery during the same period. His most important works at the academy were: A Gleaner and Grecian Archer, 1828; Cupid and Hymen (depicting Cupid blowing on the torch of Hymen to rekindle its flame) and busts of Bertel Thorvaldsen and his uncle John Rennie, 1831. Also considered of merit are The Archer (which he afterwards presented to the Athenaeum Club) and a bust of the artist David Wilkie in 1833. He exhibited The Minstrel in 1834; and a group of four figures in marble, 1837. Cupid and Hymen is in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London. In 2005 it was temporarily removed from display during reorganisation of the museum's sculpture galleries. It was returned to display in the sculpture court adjoining the central courtyard. Politics With a view to improving the state of the arts in Britain, Rennie turned his attention to politics. In 1836 he suggested to Sir William Ewart the formation of the parliamentary committee which led to the establishment of the schools of design at Somerset House. He assisted the efforts of Joseph Hume to obtain for the public freedom of access to all monuments and works of art in public buildings and museums. From 1841 to 1847 he was Liberal Member of Parliament (MP) for Ipswich, retiring before the 1847 general election in favour of Hugh Adair. In 1842 he proposed the \\"New Edinburgh\\" scheme for establishing a Scottish settlement in New Zealand. Such a site was developed and the city is now called Dunedin. On 15 December 1847, he was appointed to the governorship of the Falkland Islands. Retirement and Death He returned to England in 1855. He died in London on 22 March 1860.

Early history The Belarusian Popular Front was established in 1988 as both a political party and a cultural movement, following the examples of the Popular Front of Estonia, Popular Front of Latvia and the Lithuanian pro-democracy movement SƒÖj≈´dis. Membership was declared open to all Belarusian citizens as well as any democratic organization. Its alleged goals are democracy and independence through national rebirth and rebuilding after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. The main idea of the Front was the revival of the national idea, including a revival of the Belarusian language. Initially, its orientation was pro-Western with a great deal of scepticism towards Russia. At one point they propagated the idea of a union from the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea that would involve Ukraine, Poland, Belarus and Lithuania, similar to J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski's \\"Miƒôdzymorze\\". The party was in favor of removing Russian as an official language in Belarus. Russian became an official language following a controversial national referendum in 1995, at the beginning of the Lukashenko era, when a proposal for making Russian a state language received 83.3% support from the turnout. A meeting at Kurapaty in 1989 organized by the Belarusian Popular Front Among the significant achievements of the Front was the uncovering of the burial site of Kurapaty near Minsk. The Front claims that the NKVD performed extrajudicial killings there. Initially, the Front had significant visibility because of its numerous public actions that almost always ended in clashes with police and KGB. It was BPF parliamentarians who convinced the Supreme Soviet (the interim Belarusian parliament) to restore the historical Belarusian symbols: the white-red-white flag and the Pahonia coat of arms. During Soviet-times people faced arrest in the streets for displaying white-red-white symbols in Belarus. In 1994 the BPF formed a so- called \\"shadow\\" cabinet consisting of 100 BPF intellectuals. Its first Prime Minister was . It originally contained 18 commissions that published ideas and proposed laws and plans for restructuring the government and economy. Its last economic reform proposal was published in 1999. In opposition to Alexander Lukashenko's government, the party supports Belarus' entry into NATO and the European Union. 1999 split Pahonia, the historical Coat of Arms of Belarus In the late 1990s the Popular Front split in two parties, both of which claim to be the legitimate continuation of the original BPF. The party's conservative wing under Zianon Pazniak became the Conservative Christian Party BPF (Kanservaty≈≠na-Chry≈õcijanskaja Partyja BNF) while the moderate majority became today's BPF Party. Modern history, participation in elections At the 2004 legislative election the party was part of the People's Coalition 5 Plus (Narodnaja Kaalicyja Piaciorka Plus), that did not secure any seats. These elections fell (according to the OSCE/ODIHR Election Observation Mission ) significantly short of OSCE commitments. Universal principles and constitutionally guaranteed rights of expression, association and assembly were seriously violated, calling into question the Belarusian authorities‚Äô willingness to respect the concept of political competition on a basis of equal treatment. According to this mission, the principles of an inclusive democratic process, whereby citizens have the right to seek political office without discrimination, candidates to present their views without obstruction, and voters to learn about them and discuss them freely, were largely ignored. In October 2005 Alaksandar Milinkieviƒç, a candidate proposed by the BPF and Zialonyja (Belarusian Green Party) was elected the common democratic candidate for the 2006 Presidential election. During the 2010 presidential election the BPF Party nominated its own candidate for the presidency, , who was then the Deputy Chairman of the BPF Party. According to the official results, he gained 1.97% of the votes. In 2011, following an internal conflict, more than 90 further members left BPF Party, including several prominent veterans of the original Belarusian Popular Front, such as Lyavon Barshchewski, Jury Chadyka, Vincuk Viaƒçorka. This was sometimes described as a \\"second split\\" of the Belarusian Popular Front. On the Congress in September 2017, the new party leader Ryhor Kastusiou has been elected. The Congress decided also to nominate Alaksej Janukevich and Belarusian-American attorney Youras Ziankovich to the presidential office in next elections. The final decision about the only candidate has to be made in the future. International relations The party became an associate member of the International Democrat Union in 2007. It was an observer member of the European People's Party until 2017. Since 7 April 2017 the party is a member of the Alliance of Conservatives and Reformists in Europe.Welcome to our new member parties Its youth wing, BPF Youth, is a member of the European Young Conservatives.

Bronze Tiger appeared as a recurring character on The CW show Arrow, played by actor Michael Jai White. In season seven he became an ally to Oliver Queen and renounced his criminal ways. Publication history Bronze Tiger first appeared in Dragon's Fists, a novel by Dennis O'Neil and Jim Berry which starred Richard Dragon. Bronze Tiger's first DC Comics appearance was in Richard Dragon, Kung Fu Fighter #1 (April/May 1975). Fictional character biography =Early years= Ben Turner comes from an upper middle class black neighborhood in Central City. When he was only 10 years old, he saw a burglar attacking his parents, and he proceeded to kill the man with a kitchen knife. In an effort to control the rage inside him, Turner turns to martial arts (and eventually, crime). After some time, Turner decides to travel to the far East in order to finally come to terms with his demons.As all revealed in Suicide Squad (vol. 1) #38 (1990), written by John Ostrander (plot) and RGreenberger (script). There, he meets the O-Sensei, and studies under him, together with later recruit Richard Dragon. The meeting between Turner and Dragon serves as the start of the series Richard Dragon, Kung Fu Fighter. Some time after they are approached by Barney Ling, from the organization known as G.O.O.D. (Global Organization of Organized Defense), and their (reluctant) working for Ling served as the basis for the Kung Fu Fighter series. A flashback in DC Comics Presents #39 (1981) shows Richard Dragon discovering that Turner has been brainwashed into becoming the Bronze Tiger by Professor Ojo, then used by Barney Ling (who turns out to be a traitor). Dragon and Turner prove to be equals in the fight, which only ends when Ling is accidentally knocked out a window. =League of Assassins= Later, in Suicide Squad #38, Turner's further career is shown, wherein he and Dragon are hired by King Faraday to work for the C.B.I. (Central Bureau of Intelligence). Assigned to take down the League of Assassins, Dragon and Turner are discovered by the League, who kill Turner's fiance√©, Myoshi, and proceeded to brainwash Turner. Turner was rid of his demons by channeling them into the identity of the Bronze Tiger, a masked assassin working for the League. During this time, he also trains the assassin David Cain's daughter, Cassandra, together with other members of the League. As the Bronze Tiger, Turner developed a fearsome reputation in the world, his identity remaining a secret to everyone but the League. As the Bronze Tiger, Ben was feared around the world, and the Sensei was smart enough to ensure that Ben hardly ever took off the mask, sending him on a new mission as soon as he finished another. For a time, his identity was secret and he became one of the most wanted criminals, the Bronze Tiger being a professional assassin, killing on three continents. Learning of Bronze Tiger's true identity, King Faraday set up a rescue squad of Rick Flag and Nightshade. They retrieved the Tiger, and he was deprogrammed by Amanda Waller, who would later run the Suicide Squad. =Suicide Squad= Cover to Suicide Squad #65, illustrated by Geof Isherwood, Robert Campanella and Tom McCraw. Waller later recruits Turner for the Suicide Squad, setting him up to become the team's leader, but he ends up the team's second-in- command under Rick Flag. On the team's first mission the Tiger faces Ravan, whom he cripples but refuses to kill. Turner develops a relationship with Vixen, while a member of the Squad's support crew, Flo Crawley, nurses a crush on him. Meeting Ravan again later, Turner convinces him to join the Squad, and the two become an effective fighting duo. The Suicide Squad was mostly populated by villains, but the Tiger is one of the Squad's 'good' members, meant to balance out the cast of characters. He often enforces Waller's rules, such as forcing various Squad members to wear devices designed to force good behavior. A Bronze Tiger solo story appeared as a Bonus Book in Suicide Squad #21 (December 1988).Suicide Squad #21 at the Grand Comics Database The nigh- corrupting nature of the Squad eventually leads to Rick Flag's departure and seeming death in a nuclear explosion. Turner becomes the leader of the team, a role in which he excels, often disobeying direct orders to save the lives of his team (even if they were \\"expendable\\"). The Squad member Duchess, in reality the Apokoliptian soldier Lashina, betrays the team and takes many, including Flo, to Apokolips. Flo does not survive the kidnapping. Turner is eventually confronted by his superiors about his actions, and in the ensuing meeting Turner's mind snaps.Suicide Squad vol. 1 #38 (February 1990) He flees, traveling back to the East (leaving Vixen in the process), where he spends some time as a janissary. Eventually Amanda Waller reforms the Squad and again recruits Turner. In the interim Turner has become a deeply troubled man, one who distances himself from Vixen and was constantly egging on Ravan to confront him. In a mission shortly after the team had reformed Vixen is hurt, which unlocks Turner's feelings for her once more. He mostly returns to his old state of mind. Vixen laters leaves the team, and she and Turner part on good terms. In the team's last mission, the Squad struggles to free a small island nation from the tyranny of its seemingly immortal ruler. The team must pass through a forest known for causing hallucinations. While the others experience their own mind-trips, Bronze Tiger faces himself. Defeating himself, and thereby exorcising his demons, Turner once again becomes a complete person. The tyrant is later defeated by Waller.Suicide Squad (vol. 1) #65 (1992), written by John Ostrander and Kim Yale Shortly after leaving the Squad, Turner is part of Bruce Wayne's search for Jack Drake (father of Tim Drake) and Shondra Kinsolving, who had been kidnapped.Knightquest: The Search story arc in the Batman books He teams up with Green Arrow and Gypsy, a member of the short lived Justice League Task Force. Gypsy becomes romantically involved with Tiger. He later becomes her mentor in the martial arts. In a story arc of the Batgirl title in 2005 Cassandra Cain begins a search for her birth mother, who she believes is Lady Shiva. She tracks down Turner in Detroit where he has opened the \\"Tiger Dojo\\". Both are able to come to terms with Turner's involvement in Cassandra's training and he expresses his pride at her becoming a hero. Bronze Tiger meets with Batman shortly afterwards. He has to stop a group of villains and avenge his master. =World War III and beyond= In the World War III event, Bronze Tiger is shown to have retired, but is coaxed back into action by Amanda Waller. In Checkmate (vol. 2) Bronze Tiger rescues Rick Flag from a secret Quraci prison, where Flag had been imprisoned for four years. Notably he is seen wearing a variant on the costume he wore while with the League of Assassins, complete with a tiger head mask (according to writer Nunzio DeFilippis he wears the mask to prove it no longer has any power over him\\"Not a mistake. We decided he'd be in the mask for a reason. Ben wears it to show that, to paraphrase from The Man In The Iron Mask, he wears the mask - it doesn't wear him (at least, not anymore).\\" \\\\- Nunzio DeFilippis Comic Book Resources Forums, October 24 2006). Afterwards, Amanda Waller appears at the Tiger Dojo, revealing to Ben that she leaked the information about Flag's whereabouts. She then enlists their aid in tracking down a supposedly rogue Suicide Squad team, a team which in reality was being run by Flag and Turner at Waller's behest. In Countdown #39, Bronze Tiger is among the Suicide Squad members trying to bring in Pied Piper and The Trickster. In a recent appearance in the mini-series Gotham Underground, Bronze Tiger is among the members of the Suicide Squad arresting Two-Face, Mad Hatter, Hugo Strange, and Scarecrow. While frisking Scarecrow, he is gassed by the escaping villain, revealing a previously undiscovered fear of insects. Bronze Tiger appears in a Blackest Night-related one-shot entitled Blackest Night: Suicide Squad #67 (part of a series of one-shots operating as extra issues to long-since canceled ongoing series). He works with fellow Suicide Squad members Count Vertigo and Rick Flag to bring down a Mexican drug lord. When the Secret Six attempt to break into Belle Reve prison, Bronze Tiger squares off with Catman to see who is the superior feline-themed martial artist. =The New 52= In The New 52 (a 2011 reboot of the DC Comics universe), Bronze Tiger appears as a member of the League of Assassins.Red Hood and the Outlaws #21 Powers and abilities The Bronze Tiger possesses no metahuman powers, but is a master martial artist with lightning-fast reflexes. He has mastered several fighting styles such as Boxing, Hapkido, Jeet Kune Do, Jujutsu, Judo, Karate, Kung Fu, Muay Thai, Savate, Silat, Vale Tudo and Taekwondo. He has bested notable martial artists such as BatmanDetective Comics #485 (1979) and fought Richard Dragon to a standstill. He is on the fighting level of Lady Shiva. He is also an adept acrobat and has extraordinary stamina. Bronze Tiger's fighting prowess has given him the reputation of being a lethal weapon. Other versions =Amalgam Comics= Bronze Tiger is the ruler of Wakanda and is named B'Nchalla; an amalgamation of the Bronze Tiger (DC) and the Black Panther (Marvel). =Injustice: Gods Among Us= Bronze Tiger appeared in Year Five of the comic based on the video game of the same name. He is seen with Tweedledum and Tweedledee, Black Mask, Scarecrow, Man-Bat, and Mad Hatter who gang up on Damian Wayne and uses his skills to knock him out. Deadman then possesses Bronze Tiger to knock out the rest of the criminals as well as himself.

Michael Jai White as Bronze Tiger in the CW's Arrow * Michael Jai White portrays Ben Turner/Bronze Tiger in the live-action series Arrow.http://www.newsarama.com/18439-sdcc-13-marvel- studios-thor-cap-more-live.html In addition to his martial artist abilities, he has two sets of gauntlets with three claws (Tekk≈ç-kagi) that make him very formidable, capable of deflecting arrows fired at close range. In \\"Identity\\", Bronze Tiger forms an alliance with China White and the Chinese Triad. Together with China White, he conducted a series of raids on transports with medical supplies for the Starling City hospitals. In return for helping the Triad he would get a chance to fight and kill the Arrow. During a raid on a medical transport truck, the Arrow manages to incapacitate Bronze Tiger through the use of an electrified-trick arrow. He later appears in \\"Tremors\\" where he escaped out of prison with the help of a weapons dealer who then hired him to steal a prototype of the earthquake device out of the Merlyn Mansion. He retrieves the device but is soon after defeated by the Arrow and Roy Harper. Upon his return to prison, he is approached by Amanda Waller with a proposal to work off part of his sentence by being recruited into a Squad. Ben reappears in the episode \\"Suicide Squad\\" as a member of the team. In this episode, Ben is released from his imprisonment by A.R.G.U.S. to participate in a mission with the Suicide Squad.

In present day, he is recruited by Amanda Waller's Task Force X program and sent for a mission to find Steel Maxum and retrieve a mystical \\"Get Out of Hell Free\\" card by any means. He is also shown to be the most moralized of the Squad members as he has the vow to never take away any innocent life. He also has an ill relationship with Deadshot, as he has a high grudge with assassins like the one who murdered his fianc√©e. After a fight with Deadshot for walking away for a failed attempt to see his own daughter Zoe, Bronze Tiger is entrusted by Waller to be the team leader. Right after Professor Zoom's henchmen kidnap and recruit Killer Frost, Bronze Tiger assists the Squad on tracking the teammate but only to fall into Zoom's trap of Killer Frost's removed nano-bomb and Waller's anger to set off the bomb. Bronze Tiger is caught by the explosion and heavily injured, resulting in Deadshot resuming the role as team leader.

He later appears again in the final showdown stopping Captain Boomerang from getting away with the card and distracting Zoom enough for Deadshot to catch up even though Zoom manages to reopen his wounds using a small dagger. With his last strength, Bronze Tiger manages to cut off Zoom's fingers using the same small dagger to strip the card off his hands, allowing Deadshot to kill Zoom.

Biography Woods was born in Springfield, Massachusetts. He studied music with Lennie Tristano, who influenced him greatly, at the Manhattan School of Music and at the Juilliard School. His friend, Joe Lopes, coached him on clarinet as there was no saxophone major at Juilliard at the time. Although he did not copy Charlie \\"Bird\\" Parker, he was known as the New Bird, a nickname also given to other alto saxophone players such as Sonny Stitt and Cannonball Adderley. In the 1950s, Woods began to lead his own bands. Quincy Jones invited him to accompany Dizzy Gillespie on a world tour sponsored by the U.S. State Department. A few years later he toured Europe with Jones, and in 1962 he toured Russia with Benny Goodman. After moving to France in 1968, Woods led the European Rhythm Machine, a group which tended toward avant-garde jazz. He returned to the United States in 1972 and, after an unsuccessful attempt to establish an electronic group, he formed a quintet which was still performing, with some changes of personnel, in 2004. As his theme, Woods used a piece titled \\"How's Your Mama?\\" Woods earned the top alto sax player award almost 30 times in Downbeat magazine's annual readers' poll. His quintet was awarded the top small combo title several times. In 1979, Woods recorded the album More Live at Armadillo World Headquarters in Austin, Texas. Perhaps his best known recorded work as a sideman is a pop piece, his alto sax solo on Billy Joel's 1977 \\"Just the Way You Are\\". He also played the alto sax solo on Steely Dan's \\"Doctor Wu\\" from their 1975 album Katy Lied, as well as Paul Simon's \\"Have a Good Time\\" from the 1975 album Still Crazy After All These Years. Woods in 1983 Although Woods was primarily a saxophonist, he was also a clarinet player and solos can be found scattered through his recordings. One particular example is his clarinet solo on \\"Misirlou\\" on the album Into the Woods. Woods, along with Rick Chamberlain and Ed Joubert, founded the organization Celebration of the Arts (COTA) in 1978 late one night in the bar at the Deer Head Inn in Delaware Water Gap. The organization would eventually become the Delaware Water Gap Celebration of the Arts. Their initial goal was to help foster an appreciation of jazz and its relationship to other artistic disciplines. Each year, the organization hosts the Celebration of the Arts Festival in the town of Delaware Water Gap in September. In 2005, Jazzed Media released the documentary Phil Woods: A Life in E Flat ‚Äì Portrait of a Jazz Legend, directed by Rich Lerner and produced by Graham Carter. Woods was married to Chan Parker, the common-law wife of Charlie Parker, for seventeen years and was the stepfather to Chan's daughter, Kim. On September 4, 2015, he performed a tribute to Charlie Parker with Strings at the Manchester Craftsmen's Guild and announced at the end of the show that he would be retiring. He died of emphysema on September 29, 2015, at the age of 83. On June 25, 2019, The New York Times Magazine listed Phil Woods among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire.

He was killed by Israel Defense Forces (IDF) gunfire while filming a documentary in the Gaza Strip. Miller worked regularly with Saira Shah for several years, and they formed a business partnership to operate an independent production company called Frostbite Productions in 2001. The Israeli Military Police investigation into Miller's death closed on 9 March 2005 with an announcement that the soldier suspected of firing the shot would not be indicted as they could not establish that his shot was responsible, though he would be disciplined for violating the rules of engagement and for changing his account of the incident. On 6 April 2006, the inquest jury at St Pancras Coroner's Court in London returned a verdict of unlawful killing, finding that Miller had been \\"murdered.\\" Forensic experts from London Metropolitan Police concluded that the bullets were consistent with those used by the IDF. After meetings with the Miller family, the Attorney General, Lord Goldsmith, sent a formal request to his Israeli counterpart in June 2007 for prosecution proceedings to be enacted within six weeks against the soldier responsible for firing the shot. The requests were ignored by the Israeli government and prosecution proceedings have never been held.  Early life and family  James Miller was born in Haverfordwest, Pembrokeshire, Wales the younger son of Geoffrey Miller, an army officer who later rose to the rank of colonel, and his wife, Eileen, a headmistress. He grew up in the West Country, but from ages six to eight lived in the Outer Hebrides, where his father was posted. Raised as a Roman Catholic, he maintained that faith for the whole of his life. He was educated at Downside and later at the London College of Printing, where within a few weeks his tutors promoted him to the postgraduate course in photo-journalism. He worked as a photographer before moving to television. In 1997, he married Sophy Warren-Knott, with whom he had a son, Alexander, and a daughter, Charlotte. Career Miller started his working life as a freelance cameraman, and in 1995 joined the Frontline News collective as cameraman, producer, and director. He reported from the civil war in Algeria and from most of the world's major trouble spots from 1995 onwards, working for CNN, and for all the leading news broadcasters in Britain. In 1999 he made his first film for Hardcash Productions, Prime Suspects, about a massacre in Kosovo for Channel 4's Dispatches programme. This film won the Royal Television Society (RTS) award for International Current Affairs in 1999. Almost every film he made for Hardcash won major awards. Prime Suspects was followed by Dying for the President about the Second Chechen War and Children of the Secret State about Korea, both also for Dispatches. Miller then formed a professional association with television reporter Saira Shah, to make Beneath the Veil, about the life of women in Taliban-run Afghanistan. This film, shown on Dispatches and CNN, repeated the success of Prime Suspects by again winning the RTS International Current Affairs award. It also won an Emmy Award, a BAFTA, and the RTS \\"Programme of the Year\\" award. In addition, Miller won the RTS craft award for his outstanding photography. Miller and Shah's second film, Unholy War, shot at the height of the Afghanistan war in 2001, won Miller his first Emmy as director and (together with Beneath the Veil) also the prestigious Peabody award. Miller and Shah almost died of sub-zero temperatures while crossing the Hindu Kush during the making of this film. Frostbite Films was the name of the independent film production company set up by Miller and Shah in 2001 after this experience. Miller and Shah were working on a documentary for the American cable network HBO at the time of his death. The resulting film, Death in Gaza, was released in 2004, and won three Emmys and one BAFTA TV award in 2005. Miller received posthumously the Rory Peck Award for Features in 2004 for Death in Gaza, having been a finalist on three previous occasions. After Miller's death, his friend Fergal Keane wrote: \\"James Miller was one of the finest journalistic talents I have ever known. Had he lived he would undoubtedly have come to be recognised as one of the greatest documentary makers of his generation. As it is he leaves a journalistic legacy of immense worth.\\" Death The documentary which Miller was making on the day of his death (Death in Gaza, released by HBO in 2004) depicts Miller and his colleagues leaving the home of a Palestinian family in the Rafah refugee camp after dark, carrying a white flag, towards two IDF armored personnel carriers manned by nine soldiers of the Desert Reconnaissance Battalion, a unit of Bedouin Arab-Israeli soldiers. They had walked about 20 metres from the veranda when the first shot rang out. For 13 seconds, there was silence broken only by Shah's cry: \\"We are British journalists.\\" Then came the second shot, which killed Miller. He was shot in the front of his neck. The soldier who shot him was identified as First Lieutenant Hib al-Heib. According to a forensic expert, the fatal shot was fired from less than 200 metres away. Immediately after the shooting, the IDF said that Miller had been shot in the back during crossfire. It later retracted the assertion that he had been shot in the back. According to witnesses there was no crossfire and none can be heard on the APTN tape. An IDF spokesperson made the following statement after Miller's death: \\"The IDF expresses sorrow at the death of the cameraman who entered a combat zone. Cameramen who knowingly enter a combat zone endanger themselves as well as the troops, and clearly run the risk of being caught in the crossfire.\\" An IDF spokesperson described the circumstances of his death as occurring during \\"an operation taking place at night, in which the [Israeli] force was under fire and in which the force returned fire with light weapons.\\" IDF spokesman, Captain Jacob Dallal said, \\"Our forces found a tunnel at the house in question, when an anti-tank missile was fired on them. They shot back at the source of the attack ... James Miller was apparently hit during that exchange. The Israeli military expresses sorrow at a civilian death, but it must be stressed that a cameraman who knowingly enters a combat zone, especially at night, endangers himself.\\" Aftermath On 9 March 2005, the IDF closed the Miller case, announcing that the soldier believed responsible for the shooting would not be indicted. Military Advocate General Avichai Mandelblit ruled that there was insufficient evidence to prosecute. The army said Military Police had carefully investigated the incident but had been unable to establish the soldier's guilt. \\"The findings of the military police show that an Israel Defense Forces lieutenant, the commanding officer of the IDF force at the site, allegedly fired his weapon in breach of IDF Rules of engagement,\\" a statement said. \\"However, it is not legally possible to link this shooting to the gunshot sustained by Mr. Miller.\\" The army did say that the soldier would be disciplined for violating the rules of engagement and for changing his account of the incident. It did not elaborate. Heib was subjected to a disciplinary hearing before Brigadier General Guy Tzur, head of the IDF Southern Command. Despite advice from the Israeli Military Advocate General that he be disciplined for breaching the rules of engagement, illegal use of weapons, and misconduct during the investigation, he was cleared of wrongdoing. Military prosecutors appealed the acquittal, but he was cleared in a second hearing as well.https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3252608,00.html Heib was subsequently promoted from First Lieutenant to Captain. Miller's family expressed disappointment at the decision. His widow Sophy said, \\"Nothing can express our outrage that, waiting for two years and putting our faith in a system which has now failed to deliver, we still have prosecutors who suspect and continue to suspect a commanding officer and who will only bring disciplinary measures because of an initial flawed investigative process. The truth will come out and we hope the Israeli judicial system will mete out justice. This investigation does not serve the IDF, decent Israeli citizens, us, his family, and, above all, James.\\" British Foreign Office Minister Baroness Symons said she was \\"dismayed\\" by the decision. \\"I deeply sympathize with James' family, who have worked so hard to secure justice for James. The British government will continue to raise James's case with the government of Israel.\\" The Metropolitan Police opened an investigation into Miller's death which was led by Detective Rob Anderson of the Specialist Crime Directorate. Anderson later told the inquest that the investigation was hampered by Israel's unwillingness to cooperate. The Metropolitan Police was refused permission to send officers to Israel and the Gaza Strip in order to visit the site of the shooting and interview soldiers and witnesses to the incident and the Israeli government did not release vital documents to the Coroner. Based on the evidence available to the investigation, Anderson concluded that Miller could only have been killed by gunfire from Israeli soldiers.https://www.theguardian.com/media/2006/apr/06/television.middleeastthemedia = Legal action against Israeli government = On 2 May 2005, the second anniversary of Miller's death, his family initiated a lawsuit against the Israeli government. The family charge that the Israeli army did not act with reasonable caution when troops opened fire on Miller, who was holding a white flag. Miller's widow Sophy said the family was determined to find justice and put an end to the \\"culture of impunity\\" within the Israeli army. \\"It is our hope that as well as accountability for James' death a successful civil case will go some way towards changing this and in doing so may make Israeli soldiers think twice about shooting innocent civilians,\\" she told The Guardian. More than two years later, on 5 August 2007, the family's lawyer, Michael Sfard, said, \\"The family demands justice, both criminal and civil. They deserve that the man who shot their loved one for no reason whatsoever should be indicted and get what he deserves. As he left a widow and two children, they deserve to be compensated by the State of Israel. This is something the political and military echelons have promised time and again, but they have not fulfilled their promise so far.\\" On 1 February 2009 it was reported that James Miller's family have accepted a ¬£1.5 million payout from Israel. In a statement, the family did not confirm the amount paid but did say that it was \\"probably the closest we'll get to an admission of guilt on the part of the Israelis\\". Coroner's inquest The inquest into Miller's death opened at the St Pancras Coroner's Court in London on 3 April 2006. Giving evidence at the inquest, Miller's wife Sophy named the Israeli soldier who shot her husband as First Lieutenant Heib from the Bedouin Desert Reconnaissance Battalion, who was commanding a unit at the time of the killing on 2 May 2003. She said that the IDF had given out misleading information from the moment her husband was shot, and that Lt. Heib had given six testimonies, all of which were conflicting. Footage of Miller's death was shown to an unnamed Israeli soldier who was quoted as saying that members of the IDF should not fire unless they felt they were under threat. He was quoted as saying: \\"There is no chance that it was an accident ‚Äì the soldier could clearly see him, it was a perfect shot. I do not know what to say, it looks like murder, it looks like he wants to kill him.\\" The court heard that an autopsy proved that Miller died from a \\"classic sniper's shot\\", and that the bullet was consistent with that used by the IDF. Independent investigator Chris Cobb-Smith, who had previously served in the British Army and as an Iraq weapons inspector, found there was no way the soldier fired by accident. He told the court, \\"This was calculated and cold-blooded murder, without a shadow of a doubt.\\" He added, \\"These shots were not fired by a soldier who was frightened, not fired by a soldier facing incoming fire ‚Äì these were slow, deliberate, calculated and aimed shots ... It is a soldier aiming and firing deliberately. He should not have been firing anywhere near a lit building, anywhere near where he knew there were women, children or foreign journalists.\\" Daniel Edge, Miller's assistant producer, (who narrowly escaped being shot himself during the same incident) said Israeli soldiers put pressure on him to say that the shot came from Palestinians. He told the inquest: \\"They personally tried to get me to say the sentence 'James could have been shot by a Palestinian', which I refused to say.\\" On 6 April 2006, the jury returned a verdict of unlawful killing, finding that he had been \\"murdered\\". Miller's family asked that the British government ensure his killer is prosecuted, accusing the Israeli authorities of \\"an abject failure to uphold the fundamental and unequivocal standards of international humanitarian and human rights law.\\" Request for prosecution In June 2007, Lord Goldsmith, the then outgoing Attorney General for England and Wales, sent a request to his Israeli counterpart, Attorney General Menachem Mazuz, for legal proceedings to be enacted within six weeks to prosecute the soldier responsible for the killing, which included new analysis of audio evidence which confirmed that the shot that killed Miller was fired from an Israeli armored personnel carrier. The request stipulated that if Israel failed to respond within six weeks, British authorities would consider prosecuting Captain al-Heib in the UK.https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3433808,00.html Miller's sister, Anne Waddington, was interviewed by the BBC on the morning of 7 August 2007, the day the six-week deadline was due to expire. She said, \\"Unfortunately, we have had four and a half extremely painful years of experiencing the Israeli tactics, and they are the masters of delay ‚Äì they have always played for time, and they have always failed to deliver.\\" She added, \\"The Israelis put out a lot of false and misleading statements immediately after my brother was murdered, and they did try to suggest he was killed by a Palestinian in the back and as a result of crossfire, but they put out many, many lies and false stories, which of course have been shown not only on the APTN video footage of the actual murder, but also through eyewitness testimony and the additional evidence which was very, very clear at the time.\\" Asked whether she used the word \\"murder\\" very deliberately, she replied, \\"Yes I do, and of course the jury in the inquest last year found, very unusually, that it wasn't just unlawful killing, it was actually murder.\\" On 7 August 2007, Mazuz requested more information on the new analysis. After being informed of his response, Miller's family issued a statement: > We are very pleased that General Mazuz has replied within the time limit set > out in Lord Goldsmith's letter. This information has for the most part been > in the possession of the Israeli investigators for more than four years. We > will look on with interest to see whether Israel will seek to undermine the > expertise of the Metropolitan Police's acoustic examination, or perhaps this > will be the first significant step towards Israel pursuing justice. At the request of Miller's family, Lord Goldsmith agreed to ask the UK Crown Prosecution Service to advise \\"on whether there is enough evidence for a prosecution in the UK under the Geneva Conventions Act in which case the UK government could request extradition.\\" Eventually, the Israeli government agreed to pay the Miller family ‚Ç§1.75 million, if the British government agreed to close the case, and not demand the extradition of the Israeli soldiers involved in his killing.

It is noted for the particularly large geyserite sinter deposits, which form its cone. These deposits have been likened in appearance to a castle. When the geyser was given this name in 1870, the top edges of the structure resembled the typical profile associated with the modern concept of a castle, having the appearance of a large keep, multiple turrets, and especially because of the crenellation along the top edges of what resembled its towers. As the drawing below shows the cone had distinctive appearance at the time. Over time the cone's shape changes because of the layers of mineral deposited in successive eruptions. History Sketch of Castle Geyser by the Washburn Expedition. On September 18, 1870, the Washburn-Langford-Doane Expedition entered the Upper Geyser Basin. Eventually, members of the expedition named seven geysers they observed in the basin. The appearance of this geyser led Lieutenant Gustavus Cheyney Doane to name it Castle Geyser. Nathaniel P. Langford gave this account in his 1871 Scribner's article: > \\"The Castle,\\" situated on the summit of an incrusted mound, has a turreted > crater through which a large volume of water is expelled at intervals of two > or three hours to the height of , from a discharging orifice about in > diameter. The architectural features of the silicious sinter surrounding it, > which is very massive and compact, indicating that at some former period the > flow of water must have been much greater than at present, suggested its > name. A vent near it is constantly discharging a large stream of boiling > water, and when the geyser is in action the water in this vent boils and > bubbles with great fierceness. Eruption The Castle Geyser has a 10- to 12-hour eruption cycle. The geyser erupts hot water for about 20 minutes in a vertical column that reaches a height of before changing to a noisy steam phase that issues for 30 to 40 minutes. The sinter cone for Castle Geyser has been dated to around 1022 using carbon-14 dating. This date is much younger than the originally-presumed age of 5,000 to 15,000 years. A 3-D laser scan made of the cone reveals evidence that this geyser has evolved through four to five distinct stages to reach its current configuration. In November 2002, the Denali earthquake in Denali National Park and Preserve, Alaska caused Castle Geyser, as well as other geysers in Yellowstone, to decrease in eruption frequency. The affected geysers have returned to their previous pattern since that time, however.  Gallery  {  File:Castle geyser 20190714 072044 VID.webmCastle Geyser erupting, 2019.

Incumbent Miguel Trovoada was constitutionally barred from participating in the election having served the maximum of two five year terms. The two top contenders for the position were Fradique de Menezes, a wealthy businessman, and Manuel Pinto da Costa, former President and founder of the former single-party, the MLSTP/PSD. The elections, deemed free and fair by international observers, were won in the first round by Menezes. He was sworn in as the third president of S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe on 3 September 2001. Voter turnout was 70.7%.

The concept of the Inner, Ethereal, Prime Material, Astral, and Outer Planes was introduced in the earliest versions of Dungeons & Dragons; at the time there were only four Inner Planes and no set number of Outer Planes. This later evolved into what became known as the Great Wheel cosmology. The fourth edition of the game used a different, very simplified cosmology with just six main planes called the World Axis Cosmology. The fifth edition has brought back a new version of the Great Wheel cosmology. In addition, some Dungeons & Dragons settings have cosmologies that are very different from the \\"standard\\" ones discussed here. For example, the Eberron setting has only seventeen planes in total, most of which are unique to Eberron.  Great Wheel cosmology  The 'Great Wheel' model of the planes, as described in the 5th edition Player's Handbook This standardized layout of the planes was presented for the first time in Volume 1, Number 8 of The Dragon, released July 1977. The known planes of existence were presented again in an appendix in the original (1st edition) AD&D; Players Handbook, published in June 1978. The planes were expanded upon in the original Manual of the Planes, released in 1987. It was the core cosmology in both editions of AD&D; and the 3rd and 3.5 editions of D&D.; The 5th edition reintroduced a modified version of the Great Wheel. Many Outer Planes were renamed in Advanced Dungeons & Dragons Second Edition in the Planescape campaign setting, released in 1994. In the Third Edition Manual of the Planes, published in 2001, the old and new names were combined together, the Demiplane of Shadow was promoted to the Plane of Shadow, the Prime Material Plane was shortened to the Material Plane, and it was stated that each Material Plane is connected to its own unique Ethereal Plane. The cosmology is usually presented as a series of concentric circles, with alternating spatial and transitive planes; from the center outwards, they are ordered as follows: Inner, Ethereal, Material, Astral, Outer Planes, and the Far Realm. The Shadow Plane and the Dimension of Time, if they are included, are separate from the others, and usually represented as being connected to the Material Plane. Demiplanes, although most commonly connected to the Ethereal Plane, can be found attached to any plane. All planes, save the demiplanes, are infinite in extent. = Inner Planes = The Inner Planes are made up of elemental matter and forces. They consist of the Elemental Planes and the Energy Planes. In his review of the Planescape Campaign Setting boxed set, Gene Alloway mentioned that the set gives players a solid sense of \\"the sheer force of nature that drives all the Inner Planes. The Inner Planes don't have anything against you‚Äîthey're hard on everyone.\\" =Material Planes= The Material Planes are worlds that balance between the philosophical forces of the Outer Planes and the physical forces of the Inner Planes‚Äîthese are the standard worlds of fantasy RPG campaigns. The Prime Material Plane is where the more 'normal' worlds exist, many of which resemble Earth. The 2nd edition Dungeon Master's Guide states there are several Prime Material Planes, but several other 2nd edition products say there is only one Prime Material Plane rather than several. Introduced in the Spelljammer setting, the Phlogiston is a part of the Material plane. It is a highly flammable gaseous medium in which crystal spheres holding various Prime Material solar systems float, traversable by Spelljammer ships. = Outer Planes = Alignment-based planes. The home of gods, dead souls, and raw philosophy and belief. = Transitive planes = The transitive planes connect the other planes and generally contain little, if any, solid matter or native life.  Astral Plane  The Astral Plane is the plane of thought, memory, and psychic energy; it is where gods go when they die or are forgotten (or, most likely, both). It is a barren place with only rare bits of solid matter. The Astral Plane is unique in that it is infinitesimal instead of infinite; there is no space or time here, though both catch up with beings when they leave. The souls of the newly dead from the Prime Material Plane pass through here on their way to the afterlife or Outer Planes. The most common feature of the Astral Plane is the silver cords of travelers using an astral projection spell. These cords are the lifelines that keep travelers of the plane from becoming lost, stretching all the way back to the traveler's point of origin. A god-isle is the immense petrified remains of a dead god that float on the Astral Plane, where githyanki and others often mine them for minerals and build communities on their stony surfaces. Tu'narath, the capital city of the githyanki, is built on the petrified corpse of a dead god known only as \\"The One in the Void\\". God-isles often have unusual effects on those nearby, including causing strange dreams of things that happened to the god when it was alive. God-isles are also the only locations on the Astral Plane that are known to possess gravity or normal time flows. Part of Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn takes place on the Astral Plane. Trenton Webb for Arcane magazine comments that A Guide to the Astral Plane \\"breathes life into what had hitherto been little more than a planar motorway. Essentially infinite and filled with few 'solid locations' or indigenous species, the Astral Plane should by rights be a dull place. Yet with some deft imaginative touches and sleight of logic, the guide transforms this dead zone into a wonderfully different 'world'.\\" He adds that \\"By expanding the accepted 'physics' of the Astral plane and applying classic Planescape thinking, the Silver Void is made solid and comprehensible.\\"  Ethereal Plane  The Ethereal is often likened to an ocean, but rather than water it is a sea of boundless possibility. It consists of two parts: the Border Ethereal which connects to the Inner and Prime Material planes, and the Deep Ethereal plane which acts as the incubator to many potential demiplanes and other proto-magical realms. From a Border Ethereal plane a traveler can see a misty greyscale version of the plane from which they are traveling; however, each plane is only connected to its own Border Ethereal, which means inter-planar travel necessitates entering the Deep Ethereal and then exiting into the destination plane's own Border Ethereal plane. Many demiplanes, such as that which houses the Ravenloft setting, can be found in the Deep Ethereal plane; most demiplanes are born here, and many fade back into nothingness here. Unlike the Astral Plane, in which solid objects can exist (though are extremely rare) anything and everything that goes to the Ethereal Plane becomes Ethereal. There is also something here called the Ether Cyclone that connects the Ethereal plane to the Astral Plane. In the 3rd Edition, each Material Plane is attached to its own unique Ethereal Plane; use of the Deep Ethereal connecting these Ethereal Planes together is an optional rule.  Plane of Shadow  A fictional plane of existence in Dungeons & Dragons, under the standard planar cosmology. A dimly lit dimension that is both conterminous to and coexistent with the Material Plane. It overlaps the Material Plane much as the Ethereal Plane does, so a planar traveler can use the Plane of Shadow to cover great distances quickly. The Plane of Shadow is also conterminous to other planes. With the right spell, a character can use the Plane of Shadow to visit other realities. It is magically morphic, and parts continually flow onto other planes. As a result, creating a precise map of the plane is next to impossible, despite the presence of landmarks. = Publication history = In first edition AD&D;, the Plane of Shadow was the largest Demi-Plane of the Ethereal Plane.Jeff Grubb, Manual of the Planes (TSR, 1987). = Inhabitants = * The ephemera, including the dusk beast, the ecalypse, and the umbral banyan, appeared in the third edition in the Manual of the Planes (2001).Grubb, Jeff, David Noonan, and Bruce Cordell. Manual of the Planes (Wizards of the Coast, 2001) ** Dusk Beast: A human-sized, two-headed lizard composed of dark shadow. ** Ecalypse: Equine creatures that gallop across the Plane of Shadow in great herds. ** Umbral Banyan: Dark trees at the heart of many a dangerous forest.  Mirror planes Mirror planes were introduced in the Third Edition Manual of the Planes as an optional group of transitive planes. They are small planes that each connect to a group of mirrors that can be located in any other planes throughout the multiverse. A mirror plane takes the form of a long, winding corridor with the mirrors it attaches to hanging like windows along the walls. Mirror planes allow quick travel between the various mirrors that are linked to each, but each plane contains a mirror version of any traveler that enters it. This mirror version has an opposite alignment and will seek to slay their real self to take their place. All mirrors connect to a mirror plane, though each mirror plane usually has only five to twenty mirrors connecting to it.  Temporal Plane  The Plane of Time was known as the Temporal Prime in the 1995 book Chronomancer. It is a plane where physical travel can result in time travel. In 3rd edition products, some of the detail of Temporal Prime became incorporated into the \\"Temporal Energy Plane\\" mentioned in the 3rd edition Manual of the Planes. Dragon Magazine #353 associates it also with the \\"Demiplane of Time\\" that has appeared in various forms since 1st edition. =Demiplanes= Demiplanes are minor planes, most of which are artificial. They are commonly created by demigods and extremely powerful wizards and psions. Naturally-occurring demiplanes are rare; most such demiplanes are actually fragments of other planes that have somehow split off from their parent plane. Demiplanes are often constructed to resemble the Material Plane, though a few--mostly those created by non-humans--are quite alien. Genesis, a 9th level arcane spell or psionic power, and the 9th-level arcane spell Demiplane Seed are among the few printed methods for a player character to create a demiplane. Among the most notable of demiplanes is the Demiplane of Dread, the setting of Ravenloft. Neth, the Demiplane That Lives, was first presented in A Guide to the Ethereal Plane, a sourcebook for the Planescape setting of AD&D; Second Edition. Neth Neth, the Plane That Lives, is a living, sentient plane of finite size that has an immense curiosity. The only access Neth has to the rest of the multiverse is through a single metallic, peach-colored pool on the Astral Plane. Those who look into the pool from the Astral Plane might notice a huge eye flash into focus on its surface, which quickly fades. Sometimes, Neth will choose to encapsulate its visitors. Two folds of membrane will come together and ensnare and seal off the victims. Neth will then flood the compartment with either preservative or absorptive fluid. The preservative fluid will put the victim in temporal stasis, and the victim can be revived if the fluid is drained away. If the compartment is flooded with absorptive fluid, the victim will dissolve and be absorbed into Neth itself, including the victim's memories. =Characteristics= Neth is a living membrane the size of a continent. It is folded upon itself and resembles an enormous paper ball with a radius of about twenty-five miles. The spaces between the membrane's folds can be a hand's span across or larger than a city. The spaces are filled with air-saturated fluid, but visitors can still breathe in them. If the plane were spread flat, it would be about five hundred miles in diameter, and the average thickness would be approximately thirty feet. Air- and water-breathing visitors to Neth can breathe and speak in Neth's fluid normally. If they swim around unnoticed, they might see organ buds larger than city blocks, beings behind membranous capsules, and the humanoid antibodies of Neth mindlessly going about their business. Every part of the living demiplane has a soft, pink glow. Neth can also flush the fluid wherever it wants, carrying visitors along with it, usually to the Visage Wall to be questioned. Gravity on Neth is the same strength as that on the material world; however, Neth chooses the direction of gravity's pull and may change it at will. Time is normal on Neth. Neth can move its interior membrane at will, creating or destroying fluid- filled spaces. =Inhabitants= The only thing native to Neth is the plane itself. Neth creates humanoid subunits of itself called Neth's Children, sometimes for specific short-term purposes before reabsorbing them. Neth's Children are usually identical to flesh golems and resemble a vaguely humanoid mass of flesh. Though they are free-moving, Neth's Children react to stimuli according to the preprogrammed will of Neth. Sometimes, Neth creates his children to serve as antibodies, but they are more often sent to other planes, instructed by Neth to explore and return for reabsorption, thus giving Neth more knowledge. =Locations= On Neth, the portal to the Astral Plane appears as a twenty-foot-wide, mouth-like cavity, which Neth can open and close at will. At Neth's center is a thick knot of membrane at least a mile across where all the folds come together. This serves as Neth's brain. Other parts of the membrane also serve specific functions, which include areas where the membrane can be easily deformed for communication, encapsulation, and budding Neth's Children. The Visage Wall is an area of Neth's membrane where Neth communicates with visitors. It contains thousands of head-shaped bumps that resemble the likenesses of those previously absorbed by Neth. Neth speaks to its visitors from about five or six of the heads simultaneously, questioning them in order to learn more of the outside universe. = Other planes = Far Realm The Far Realm is an alien dimension of cosmic horror. It is the home plane for many aberrations and strange monsters. The Far Realm's mix of horror, madness, and strange geometries was largely inspired by the work of American writer H. P. Lovecraft. It is particularly inspired by Lovecraft stories like \\"Through the Gates of the Silver Key\\". It was created by Bruce Cordell, and introduced in the Second Edition Advanced Dungeons & Dragons adventure module The Gates of Firestorm Peak (1996).Cordell, Bruce R. \\"Enter the Far Realm\\", Dragon #330 (Wizards of the Coast, April 2005) James Jacobs later called Cordell's work an \\"adventure with a distinctly Lovecraftian feel\\", noting that \\"Deep inside Firestorm Peak lies a portal to an insidious region beyond sanity and light known only as the Far Realm, and the unknowable but hostile entities of this hideous region prepare to pass through into the world.\\"Jacobs, James. \\"The Shadow Over D&D;\\", Dragon #324 (Wizards of the Coast, October 2004). The adventure featured a magical portal that produced creatures and energies from the Far Realm.Cordell, Bruce. The Gates of Firestorm Peak (TSR, 1996). In Third Edition, the Far Realm was incorporated into the Realm of Xoriat in the Eberron campaign setting. In Fourth Edition, the Far Realms were included in the new cosmology design of Dungeons & Dragons. In this edition, members of the Warlock class can forge a pact (called the Starpact) with the entities from or near the Far Realm in order to gain power.Heinsoo, Rob, Collins, Andy and Wyatt, James. Player's Handbook (Wizards of the Coast, 2008), . The Far Realm's association with the new setting has been detailed in various supplements. The Far Realm contains an infinite number of layers, these layers range from inches thick to miles, and it is often possible to perceive multiple layers simultaneously. These layers can grow, spawn further layers, breathe and possibly die. The Far Realm is home to many powerful and unspeakable beings ripped from the nightmares of the darkest minds of the waking world, beings so unfathomable that their very existence is a perversion of reality itself. These beings are governed by lords of unimaginable power and knowledge completely alien. The Far Realm is a plane far outside the others and often not included in the standard cosmology. It is sometimes referred to simply as \\"Outside\\", because in many cosmologies it is literally outside reality as mortals understand it. In the Fourth Edition, an anomalous plane, the Far Realm is bizarre and maddening. Creatures native to or connected with the Far Realm have the aberrant origin. Distant stars have been driven mad by proximity to the Far Realm, resulting in the abominations known as starspawn. The Far Realm also breaks into reality at various points in the Underdark, leading to the rise of the aboleth and mind flayer empires. Natural humanoids tainted by the Far Realm are known as foulspawn. The Far Realm was originally sealed off from reality by a construction known as the Living Gate, which lay at the top of the Astral Sea. The Living Gate awoke and opened during the Dawn War between the gods and primordials, and was destroyed in the same war, thus allowing the Far Realm to break into the D&D; universe. Psionics are believed to have developed as a means to fight the Far Realm, in the same way that a body develops antibodies to fight an infection. Many of the Far Realm's inhabitants are too vast and inchoate to even notice visitors to their domain. Others take an interest in mortals, communicating with them through the veil between realms and sponsoring magic-users called alienists. Gibberlings, gibbering mouthers, illithids (mind flayers), kaortis, uvuudaums, grell, wystes, foulspawn, and other aberrant creatures have their origins in the Far Realm. Plane of Dreams The Plane of Dreams is a plane far outside the others and often not included in the standard cosmology. As its name suggests, all true dreams take place on the Plane of Dreams. Portals, conduits and gates Portals, conduits and gates are all openings leading from one location to another; some lead to locations in the same plane, others to different planes entirely. Although the three terms are often used interchangeably, there are notable distinctions. Portals are bounded by pre-existing openings (usually doors and arches); the portal is destroyed when the opening is. Portals also require portal keys to open; a key is usually a physical object, but it can also be an action or a state of being. Naturally occurring portals will often appear at random (a common occurrence in the city of Sigil, \\"City of Doors\\", in the Planescape campaign setting); some portals only exist for a brief period of time, or shift from one location to another. Conduits are also naturally occurring, but they are natural phenomena, the planar equivalent of whirlpools and tornadoes. Conduits are only known to occur in the Astral and Ethereal Planes. A type of conduit known as a color pool is a common gateway from the Astral Plane to the Outer Planes. A vortex is a link from a Prime Material world to the Inner Planes, which begin in areas of intense concentration of some element (e.g., the heart of a volcano might be a vortex to the Plane of Fire). There also used to be living vortices which the sorcerer-monarchs of Athas have managed to maintain, like syphoning water through a hose, and use to empower their \\"priests,\\" the Templars. Gates are portals that are not bounded by physical apertures; gates are rare, and usually appear as a result of magical spells and rare planar phenomena. Lastly, planar bleeding occurs when regions of two planes coexist; such phenomena are usually short-lived, and disastrous for their environments. Planar pathways are special landscape features appearing in multiple planes or layers of a plane. Travel along a planar pathway results in travel along the planes. Pathways are crucial tactically, because they are very stable compared to portals or gates, and do not require magic spells or portal keys. One notable planar pathway in the Planescape campaign setting is the River Styx, which flows across the Lower Planes and parts of the Astral Plane. Another is the River Oceanus, which flows through the Upper Planes. =Mount Olympus= =River Oceanus= The first edition Manual of the Planes by Jeff Grubb describes the River Oceanus as one of the features of the Outer Planes, which \\"links the planes of Elysium, Happy Hunting Grounds, and Olympus in much the same way that the Styx links the lower planes\\". The river disappears and reappears a number of times in different layers of the planes, but it seems to follow a course that begins in Thalasia, the third layer of Elysium, flows through the second and first layers of that plane, then across the topmost layer of the Happy Hunting Grounds, then into the topmost layer of Olympus to its final rest in the second later of that plane, Ossa. The Oceanus is a more natural river than the Styx, and no harm comes to those who drink of it. The Oceanus does still pose all the normal dangers of a large river, and does not have the supernatural boatmen of the Styx.Grubb, Jeff. Manual of the Planes (TSR, 1987) The book goes on to describe how Oceanus appears on specific Outer Planes. The first four layers of the plane of Elysium \\"are dominated by the River Oceanus, which beings in the fourth (outermost) layer of this plane and flows down to the innermost layer (the layer nearest the Astral). From there Oceanus meanders into the Happy Hunting Grounds and then into the innermost layer of Olympus.\\" These three good planes are linked by the Oceanus in the same manner as the lower planes are linked by the River Styx. By contrast, the Oceanus is a slow, peaceful flow, navigable by mere mortals (though its peaceful flow is often broken by rapids, cascades, waterfalls, and occasional fallen trees). The river separates and recombines many times in its passage, so travelers often find themselves journeying down side channels that soon rejoin the main stream. There are creatures that live in the Oceanus, including nymphs. The lands of Elysium are fertile along the banks of the Oceanus, filled with pines and sweet-smelling flowering trees. Most of the realms of Elysium are found along the banks of the Oceanus. A traveler on the Oceanus can usually reach another layer by traveling downstream (or upstream, for the flow doubles back several times). Portals to the other planes on Amoria, the first layer of Elysium, appear as dark caverns, with no clues as to what plane they lead to; those caverns that swallow the flow of the Oceanus always lead to the Happy Hunting Grounds after an underground passage, though there is no guarantee that the passage is navigable by boat. The second layer, Eronia, is a mountainous region where the Oceanus is often broken by falls and cascades; the banks of the Oceanus here are sheer and of grey rock, though the life around the banks is as profuse as in Amoria. On the third layer, Bellerin, many of the large islands in the Oceanus contain huge nations of extraplanar beings. Thalasia, the fourth layer, is the great sea from which the Oceanus flows and eventually returns to after it reaches its destination in the realm of Poseidon in Olympus. The Egyptian goddess Isis holds sway over a large realm of the layer of Amoria, including several paths of the Oceanus. The god Seker and his moveable realm Ro Stau spend most of their times adjacent to Isis's realm on the Oceanus. The Sumerian moon god Nanna-Sin travels the Oceanus in a great barque that is shaped like a crescent moon; in passing he provides a moon-like radiance to all on the banks of the river. Krigala is the first layer of the plane of the Happy Hunting Grounds, closest to the Astral, and through it the Oceanus flows in a relatively straight course (compared to its winding through Elysium) into Olympus. Ossa, the second layer of the plane of Olympus, is the outflow of the river Oceanus. There are often reports of huge, funnel-like maelstroms that lead directly back to Thalasia in an unending circle. =River Styx= =Yggdrasil= The first edition Manual of the Planes by Jeff Grubb describes Yggdrasil as an astral landmark, noting that it is normally encountered by travelers from worlds that worship the Norse mythoi, but travelers from other Prime Material worlds can encounter the tree. It is a long-standing conduit from the Outer Planes to alternate prime worlds that was created by a group of deities and worshippers in the Prime Material plane. Yggdrasil is the \\"World Ash\\" that links several outer planes to the Prime Material plane, in the Norse mythos. It runs from Gladsheim, home of most of the Norse mythos, to Nifflheim, the center layer of the three Glooms of Hades and the dwelling place of the goddess of the same name. Roots and branches of Yggdrasil wind through most of the Prime worlds where these deities are recognized. The tree is a solid and permanent conduit that weathers the waxing and waning of faiths in the Prime Material and the fortunes of gods in the outer planes. The traveler is confronted with a huge tree rising from the mist of the Astral and disappearing far into the distance. The traveler can then climb the tree to the appropriate outer plane, descend to the reachable lower planes, or explore the alternate Prime worlds that the conduits touch upon. At the true terminus, the tree ends in a color pool similar to that of a fixed portal. The traveler can then pass into the outer plane as if moving into an alternate Prime Material or the Astral plane. Yggdrasil and Mount Olympus are the best-known of the permanent conduits that link the outer planes with the Prime and with other nonlinear outer planes. Magical interplanar portals generally only appear in the top layer of the outer planes, although some free-standing portals that pass through the Astral, like the Yggdrasil, pierce the lower reaches of some planes. The Norse gods are bound together, both by the permanent portal of Yggdrasil and by the highly dangerous nature of the plane of Gladsheim itself. The realm of Asgard is a conglomeration of many smaller realms and domains of the various gods near the permanent multiplanar portal that is Yggdrasil, the World Ash. The plane of Gladsheim is the topmost point of Yggdrasil. The roots of this mighty tree lie in the second layer of the plane of Hades, and its branches touch every alternate Prime Material world where the Norse pantheon has been or is being worshipped. The World Ash is the home of many giant stags who browse upon its leaves, and it also contains numerous nests of giant eagles. A giant squirrel named Ratatosk scales the tree continuously, conveying threats to the eagle and others from the dragons of Niflheim. The apertures that the Yggdrasil causes in the Prime worlds are fixed and limited to those places where the Norse gods are known. Yggdrasil reaches the lower layers of the plane of Hades. Niflheim is the second layer of Hades, the layer reached by the Yggdrasil in its course from Gladsheim. The main barrier between the layer of Oinos and Niflheim leads to the roots of the Yggdrasil, in full view of Hel's feast hall. The Yggdrasil (and the main barrier region from Oinos) decamps at the base of a low hill. At the base of the Yggdrasil is Nidhogg, a huge, very ancient red dragon, and that dragon's innumerable brood. Nidhogg's task is to gnaw at the roots of the World Ash and eventually cut the link from Niflheim to Asgard, but the ash sets down new roots even as Nidhogg consumes them. The Norns are said to have their well of souls at the very edge of the center of the plane of Concordant Opposition. They identify this area as an unattainable part of the Yggdrasil, though the behavior of this area is unlike that of any other part of the World Ash conduit.  Alternative interpretations  In the context of the game, there are many theories of the organisation of the planes. For instance, in some lands it is believed that there are multiple Prime Material planes, rather than one containing all the worlds or planets. In these lands the Ethereal planes are believed to surround each Prime Material plane.  Coterminous versus coexistent  Planes may border (be coterminous) or may be coexistent. In particular, the Ethereal and Shadow planes are coexistent with the Material Plane. In effect, the \\"boundary\\" between the two extends through all of space. Thus a ghost in Dungeons & Dragons, which is an ethereal creature, has a location on the Material Plane when it is near the border of the Material and Ethereal planes. It can \\"manifest\\" itself into the Material, and force attacks launched from the Material can hit it. Basic Dungeons & Dragons The \\"Basic\\" edition of D&D; had a separate, though similar, cosmology from that of its contemporary AD&D; game, which is more open and less regulated than that of its counterpart. The D&D; multiverse was expanded with the D&D; Immortals Rules set. The Astral Plane permeates and connects the rest of the Multiverse. Plane sizes can vary from the Attoplane (one-third of an inch across), through the Standard Plane (.085 light-years across), to the Terraplane (851 billion light years across), with stars and planets varying in size accordingly.  The World Axis cosmology  4th edition uses a simplified default cosmology with only six major planes, each of which has a corresponding creature origin. The Astral Sea, Elemental Chaos, Feywild and Shadowfell are covered extensively in the Manual of the Planes, while the Far Realm is covered briefly. Supplemental sourcebooks relating to the Elemental Chaos (The Plane Below) and the Astral Sea (The Plane Above) were released in 2009 and 2010, respectively. The Ethereal Plane has been removed entirely. = Fundamental Planes = The fundamental planes are two vast expanses from which the other planes were formed. It was the conflict between the inhabitants of each fundamental plane that constituted the Dawn War. The two Fundamental Planes are theoretically infinite; it is implied that if one departs the world of one campaign setting and sets out through either the Astral Sea or the Elemental Chaos, they will eventually reach the worlds of other campaign settings.  The Astral Sea  The Astral Sea corresponds to the Astral Plane of earlier editions. The Astral Dominions, counterparts to the Outer Planes of earlier editions, are planes which float within the Astral Sea. The majority of the gods dwell in Astral Dominions. The Astral Sea itself is spacially infinite, but the Astral Dominions are all finite. Creatures native to or connected with the Astral Sea (such as angels and devils) generally have the immortal origin. The plane is described in The Plane Above: Secrets of the Astral Sea, released in 2010. In the Forgotten Realms setting, the Astral Sea was formed from the collapse of the Outer Planes into the Astral Plane after Mystra's murder, while in Eberron, the Astral Sea is equated with Siberys, the Dragon Above. ;Astral Dominions in the Points of Light setting *Arvandor, the Verdant Isles: A realm of nature, beauty and magic similar to the Feywild. Home to Corellon and (sometimes) Sehanine. *Baator, the Nine Hells: A place of sin and tyranny, a world of continent-sized caverns. Home to Asmodeus. *Celestia, the Radiant Throne: A great mountain that drifts in a world of silver mists. Home to Bahamut, Moradin and, sometimes, Kord. *Chernoggar, the Iron Fortress: The rust-pitted iron castle, where mighty warriors fight and die endlessly. Home to Bane and Gruumsh. *Hestavar, the Bright City: a luminous metropolis which floats above sandy beaches and crystal-clear lagoons, the center of astral civilization. Home to Erathis, Ioun and Pelor. *Kalandurren, the Darkened Pillars: A dominion that plays host to demons. It belonged to the god Amoth before he was killed by the demon lords Orcus and Demogorgon. *Pandemonium: The former dominion of Tharizdun. The tower of the lich god Vecna is said to be hidden within it. *Shom, the White Desert: The former dominion of the mysterious God of the Word. Astral giants loyal to the goddess Erathis fight for control of it. *Tytherion, the Endless Night: A dark, arid wilderness where serpents and dragons lurk. Home to Zehir and Tiamat.  The Elemental Chaos  The Elemental Chaos corresponds to the Inner Planes of earlier editions (excluding the Positive and Negative Energy Planes), also containing some aspects of Limbo. The Elemental Chaos contains Elemental Realms, which are themselves planes; the Abyss is one such realm. The only god who dwells in the Elemental Chaos is Lolth, who resides on the 66th layer of the Abyss. The Elemental Chaos is spacially infinite, the Elemental Realms are not. Creatures native to or connected with the Elemental Chaos (including demons) generally have the elemental origin. The plane is described in The Plane Below: Secrets of the Elemental Chaos, released in 2010. In the Forgotten Realms setting, the Elemental Chaos was formed from the collapse of the Inner Planes after Mystra's murder, while in Eberron, the Elemental Chaos is equated with Khyber, the Dragon Below. ;Locations within the Elemental Chaos *The Abyss: A place of utter evil and corruption, the result of a mad god's attempt to control the whole cosmos. Lolth's home, the Demonweb Pits, can also be found here. *The City of Brass: The Efreeti capital and a major trade hub planar trade and travel. *The Keening Delve *The Ninth Bastion *Zerthadlun = Parallel Planes =  The World  The equivalent to the Prime Material Plane or Material Plane of earlier editions. This plane lacks a formal name and is most often referred to as the World, although titles such as the Middle World and the First Work were also presented in Manual of the Planes. Creatures native to the world generally have the natural origin. The gods Avandra, Melora and Torog have their homes in the World. The god Vecna wanders the whole cosmos (Sehanine is prone to doing this as well). In the Forgotten Realms setting, the world is named Toril (there is another, inaccessible world called Abeir), while in Eberron, the world is equated with Eberron, the Dragon Between.  The Feywild  One of the two parallel planes, the Feywild is a more extreme and magical reflection of the world with some thematic links to the Positive Energy Plane and the Plane of Faerie of earlier editions and settings. Creatures native to or connected with the Feywild (such as elves and gnomes) generally have the fey origin. According to the 4th edition Manual of the Planes, this plane has some sort of unspecified connection to Arvandor, and is suspected that the Dominion of Corellon can be reached by here. Important locales within the Feywild are known as Fey Demesnes.Manual of the Planes (2008) In the Forgotten Realms setting, the Feywild is also known as the Plane of Faerie and has come into alignment with Toril after countless millennia of drifting away, while in Eberron, the Feywild is equated with Thelanis, formerly known as the Faerie Court. ;Locations within the Feywild *Astrazalian, the City of Starlight *Brokenstone Vale *Cendriane *The Feydark (Underdark of the Feywild) *Harrowhame *The Isle of Dread *Mag Tureah *Maze of Fathaghn *Mithrendain, the Autumn City *The Murkendraw *Nachtur, the Goblin Kingdom *Senaliesse *Shinaelestra, the Fading City *Vor Thomil  The Shadowfell  The Shadowfell is a type of underworld, and the thematic successor to the Negative Energy Plane and Plane of Shadow from earlier editions. The Raven Queen makes her home here rather than the Astral Sea. It also incorporates the Domains of Dread, areas created by the shadows cast by great tragedies in the world. Creatures native to or connected with the Shadowfell (such as undead) generally have the shadow origin. The plane is described in the boxed set The Shadowfell: Gloomwrought and Beyond, released in 2011. In the Forgotten Realms setting, the Shadowfell was formed from what was left of the Plane of Shadow after Mystra's murder, while in Eberron, the Shadowfell is equated with Dolurrh, the realm of the dead. *Gloomwrought, the City of Midnight *Letherna, Realm of the Raven Queen *The House of Black Lanterns *Moil, the City That Waits *Nightwyrm Fortress *The Plain of Sighing Stones *The Shadowdark (Underdark of the Shadowfell) = Demiplanes = Demiplanes are relatively small planes which are not part of larger planes. The most prominent demiplane is Sigil, the City of Doors, which is largely unchanged from earlier editions. = Anomalous planes = Anomalous planes are planes which do not fit into other categories. The most prominent of these planes are the Realm of Dreams, which can be reached via the Astral Sea, and the Far Realm, which breaks through into the remote parts of the Astral and the world.  The Far Realm  An anomalous plane, the Far Realm is a bizarre, maddening plane said to be composed of thin layers filled with strange liquids ‚Äì at least, that is what the most coherent descriptions say, for though some escape the Far Realm with their lives, most do not do so with their sanity. Visitors to the Far Realm can only exist in one layer at a time, but large Far Realm natives can exist in multiple layers at once. Creatures native to or connected with the Far Realm generally have the aberrant origin. A crystalline structure connected to the Far Realm, known as the Living Gate, once stood in the Astral Sea, but has since shattered, enabling freer transit between the planes than should be allowed. Classic creatures such as aboleths, beholders, and mind flayers originate in the Far Realm. The Far Realm is occasionally referred to as \\"Outside\\", because it seems to exist outside of reality as defined by the world, the fundamental planes and the parallel planes. In Eberron, the Far Realm is equated with Xoriat, the Realm of Madness.

The first series, written by Marv Wolfman and illustrated by Gene Colan, debuted in a special insert in The New Teen Titans #21 (July 1982). The second series began in 1996 was one of four books that made up DC's Weirdoverse group of titles. The third series began in 2012 as a seven issue miniseries. It was again written by Marv Wolfman, this time with artist Tom Mandrake. The main character of all three series is Baron Winters, a sorcerer who would assemble a team of chosen individuals to fight supernatural threats. The Baron himself did not participate in the missions and would manipulate, sometimes unethically, others to do so for him. This was because, for reasons not revealed, he could not leave Wintersgate Manor, the labyrinthine mansion in Washington, D.C. where he lived. The mansion was located in a special juncture of time and space, allowing him to send his team to different places and times. Publication history The first Night Force series was launched in August 1982 in the midst of a collapse in the horror comics market, with most titles in the genre being either cancelled or on the verge of cancellation. Despite this, writer Marv Wolfman felt (and publisher DC Comics agreed) that Night Force could be a success: Night Force was the first collaboration between Wolfman and Tomb of Dracula penciler Gene Colan since Wolfman convinced him to join the staff at DC. Both Wolfman and Colan did extensive creative design work for Night Force before working on the actual issues, with Wolfman charting out the characters' astrology and Colan doing multiple drafts of each character's visual design. After only 14 issues, Night Force was cancelled due to an underestimating of the series's sales. Wolfman explained, \\"... DC wanted to have Night Force be one of the first direct-sales books, where I believed it should be newsstand only. I felt the comic shops appealed primarily to the superhero fans while Night Force would appeal more to the casual mainstream reader, who might not have bought comics otherwise. We got the comic-book shops' sales early and it was canceled based on those, but when the newsstand sales finally dribbled in we actually sold pretty well\\". Thirteen years later, Night Force was revived as part of the Weirdoverse line. The creative team included Wolfman but not Colan, and did not carry over the plot threads from the original series. Characters The team had a rotating membership, but notable members included: *Vanessa Van Helsing ‚Äì Granddaughter of Abraham Van Helsing and a powerful psychic. *Jack Gold ‚Äì Vanessa's husband, a reporter. *Donovan Caine ‚Äì A professor of parapsychology who lost an arm and a leg on one of the missions. *Zadok Grimm ‚Äì Apparently, an ancient warrior in the time of King David. He has an unexplained connection to Baron Winters. Other versions In issue three of the Tangent: Superman's Reign series, a version of Night Force is featured. This group is a mystically-powered branch of the Nightwing organization, and its members are Hex, Black Orchid, and Wildcat. In other media * The character of Jasper Winters, mentioned in several episodes of Constantine, was loosely based on Baron Winters, although the look is modernized.

The game was one of the first mass- produced three-dimensional board games. Over the course of the game, players at first cooperate to build a working Rube Goldberg-like mouse trap. Once the mouse trap has been built, players turn against each other, attempting to trap opponents' mouse-shaped game pieces.  Gameplay  = Original version = The basic premise of Mouse Trap has been consistent over time, but the turn- based gameplay has changed. Its concept was first invented by Marvin Glass and his company, Marvin Glass and Associates, who were later granted a US patent in 1967. The original published version of the game in 1963 was then designed by Hank Kramer of Ideal Toy Company, filling in the details Glass had left open, and allows the players almost no decision-making, in keeping with other games for very young children such as Candyland or Chutes and Ladders (Snakes and Ladders). Players take turns rolling a die to advance their mouse piece along a path around the game board, from the start space to a continuous loop at the end. The Rube Goldberg-like mouse trap is assembled in the center of the board, with players adding one or more of its pieces when they land on specified \\"build\\" spaces. The trap is always assembled in a specified order, and is attached to the board by inserting tabs into holes and locking them into place. Along the ending loop are additional \\"build\\" spaces (in case the trap is still not completed), a \\"cheese\\" space positioned directly underneath the trap's cage, and a \\"turn crank\\" space. If a player lands on the \\"turn crank\\" space when an opponent is on the \\"cheese\\" space, the crank can be turned on the machine to launch it and trap that opponent. The winner is then the last one remaining after all the other players are captured. = Revised versions = In 1975, the board game surrounding the trap was redesigned by Sid Sackson, adding the cheese pieces and allowing the player to maneuver opponents onto the trap space. Players collect cheese-shaped tokens during the game, and if the trap space is vacant when they land on the \\"turn crank\\" space, the tokens can be redeemed for a die roll to move an opponent. A modified version was released in the United Kingdom in 2004, featuring three mousetraps (with a specialized trigger working at random) and a completely different board and plastic components. Among the changed trap components in this version is the inclusion of a model toilet instead of a model bathtub. A version of the game featuring characters from the Elefun and Friends universe was introduced in 2014. Among the changes in this version, the trap is built before the start of the game, a spin wheel is used instead of dice, and the cheese pieces and their relevant rules are not included. Also in the 2010s, Hasbro introduced Classic Mousetrap with several major changes from the previous versions. The object in this game is to collect six cheese pieces. Instead of being eliminated from the game when caught by the trap, a player only forfeits a cheese piece to the opponent. The trap machine was also modified; most notably the crank gears were eliminated, and instead the trap is launched by directly pulling the lever with the plastic stop sign. Similar games Game designer Marvin Glass (and his company, Marvin Glass and Associates) acknowledged that Mouse Trap had obviously been greatly influenced by Rube Goldberg's illustrations, though they refused to pay licensing or royalty fees. Glass later developed two lesser-known games based on Goldberg designs, Crazy Clock Game (Crazy Clock) (1964) and Fish Bait Game (Fish Bait) (1965), neither of which credit Goldberg's influence. Elderly and near retirement, Goldberg declined to take legal action against Glass, primarily because inspiration and ideas are not intellectual property that can be protected with a copyright, trademark, or patent. He instead chose to sell licensing rights for his drawings to another toy company, Model Products, to help secure the rights to specific intellectual property that he could own and receive royalties from.Timeless Toys: Classic Toys and the Playmakers Who Created Them from Google Books In Crazy Clock Game, players race to build a Rube Goldberg machine. The game comes with a pack of cards, each illustrating how one piece of the machine fits in. The deck is dealt out to the players. The player starts with the first card, card 1; players then play as many cards (install as many machine components) as they can, then pass to the next player. After fully assembling, they take turns trying to operate the machine, starting with the player who installed the last component; the winner is the one who first succeeds. Fish Bait Game is simpler than Mouse Trap. Players play as fishermen and build a contraption to catch a man eating fish. Each time a player lands on an empty white space, the player must build a part of the contraption. Other spaces can either give the player an extra turn, take a turn, or go back a space. The game keeps going until the contraption is fully built and a player lands on the \\"FISH BAIT\\" space, when the player must take their piece on the plastic dock and hook the rubber band inside of the fish's mouth around the legs. Players keep moving until someone lands on the \\"CATCH FISH\\" space and starts the contraption to catch the other player's piece. Once caught, the player is out of the game (although if the trap fails, the one getting caught and the one catching the fish have to switch places until there is a successful catch) and the game continues; the winner is the last one standing. Legacy In the 1990s, Mouse Trap was adapted into a game show within the British children's television show Motormouth. Child contestants take the place of the mice in a life-size board game. Mouse Trap has been lampooned by Mark Perez of San Francisco in the form of a giant traveling spectacle called Life Size Mouse Trap. KRON4 described it at Maker Faire of 2014 as \\"a fantastically hand crafted, 16 piece, 50,000-lb. interactive kinetic sculpture set atop a 6,500-square-foot game board ... complete with a Vaudevillian style show, original musical score by the one woman band Esmerelda Strange, Sexy Mice can-can dancers, clown workers, acrobatic hijinks, and other spectacular scenes dedicated to the pursuit of spectacle- laden fun!\\" It is hauled to fairs and events by 25 tons of cranes and equipment in a semi truck, it has a bowling ball instead of a ball bearing, and it ends in the destruction of a real automobile. The Mercury News said in 2016 \\"instead of trapping a rodent ‚Äî they drop a huge old bank safe on a car. Sweet. ... It's all very awesome, a masterpiece of engineering. But kind of a bummer you can't actually play on it ‚Äî as the ball.\\" Smithsonian Magazine reported the exhibit's merit in teaching physics and simple machines.

The film says this bias belies the channel's motto of being \\"Fair and Balanced\\". The documentary had a limited theatrical release, was distributed in DVD format by the political action committee MoveOn.org, and was sold online through Internet retailers such as Amazon.com. MoveOn.org had helped promote the DVD release by taking out a full-page advertisement in The New York Times. Following the release of Outfoxed, Greenwald and Brave New Films produced a related series of anti-Fox viral videos, collectively entitled Fox Attacks. In an interview, Greenwald stated his goal in making the film: \\"What we set out to do was to show that, in fact, the entire Fox News was not a news organization. The goal was not just to change that narrative but to change the impact that Fox News often had on legitimate journalists.\\" Synopsis The film examines the global growth of Murdoch's media enterprise in the context of concentration of media ownership considerations, and evaluates the effect of having one person in control of a large media conglomerate on freedom of the press. Some of Outfoxeds coverage includes: * Review of Fox News's coverage during the lead- up to, and the aftermath of, the 2003 invasion of Iraq. * Interviews with former Fox News journalists, discussing incidents where Fox News allegedly pressured journalists to slant their reports towards support for the Republican Party. * Instances where Fox News commentators such as Bill O'Reilly intimidate guests with whom they disagree, such as author and activist Jeremy Glick. * Studies which claim more airtime and coverage is consistently given to Republican politicians, particularly those in the George W. Bush administration, than to Democrats. * Examination of whether Fox News' premature result-calling of the 2000 presidential election contributed to George W. Bush officially being elected. * Scrutiny of Fox News management, including Murdoch and president Roger Ailes, both conservatives, in allegedly controlling the network's content, and editorial control from Murdoch on down allegedly ensuring which stories and issues are covered and the strongly conservative perspective of such coverage. Former Fox News journalists appear in the film critiquing the methods and perceived integrity of their former employer. Jon Du Pre, a former reporter for Fox News's West Coast bureau, said that he had been suspended by Fox News management because his live shots from the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library on Ronald Reagan's birthday ‚Äî which Du Pre described was like a \\"holy day\\" to Fox News's hierarchy ‚Äî were not \\"celebratory enough.\\" A former Fox News military contributor, Larry C. Johnson, said that he was in high demand to give on-air analysis on the \\"War on Terrorism\\", until he called into question on Hannity & Colmes whether or not the United States could fight two wars (in Afghanistan and Iraq) simultaneously, an incident after which Johnson says he was ignored as a potential Fox News contributor. Participants * Alterman, Eric * Brock, David * Cheek, Douglas * Clarke, Richard A. * Cohen, Jeff * Cronkite, Walter * Du Pre, Jon * Franken, Al * Glick, Jeremy * Nichols, John * Sanders, Bernie * Westin, Av Reception Outfoxed received positive reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes the film has a score of 85% based on reviews from 60 critics. Variety.com reviewer David Rooney wrote that the film \\"provides stimulating evidence of how thoroughly news can be skewed, political agendas served and a climate of fear created by a news net selling itself as an objective information service.\\" He compares it favorably to Michael Moore's documentary Fahrenheit 9/11, adding that without the \\"media spotlight\\" that surrounded Moore's film, Outfoxed \\"appears unlikely to reach beyond a liberal audience with an already vehement aversion to Fox News' partisan coverage.\\" Howard Kurtz of The Washington Post praised Greenwald's uncovering of \\"...a handful of memos from a top Fox executive\\", which he argued suggested network bias over the war in Iraq and the investigation of the September 11 attacks. Kurtz was critical of how Greenwald's allegations relied on \\"orders, or attitudes, of an unnamed 'they'...\\", and was critical of the filmmaker for making \\"...no effort at fairness or balance himself.\\" Fox News' and Rupert Murdoch's response Megan Lehmann wrote in the New York Post, a newspaper owned by Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, that the movie was a \\"narrowly focused, unapologetically partisan documentary,\\" and that it \\"is so one-sided, it undermines its own integrity.\\" Fox News called the film \\"illegal copyright infringement\\" for its use of clips from Fox News Channel programs. Fox also said the film misrepresented the employment of four people identified as former Fox News employees. Fox News said Alexander Kippen and Frank O'Donnell had actually been employees of WTTG, the Fox owned-and-operated station in Washington, D.C., and not employees of Fox News Channel. It said that Jon Du Pre, identified as a former anchor in the film, had actually been a reporter, and that his contract had not been renewed because he was \\"a weak field correspondent and could not do live shots.\\" It said that Clara Frenk, identified as a former producer in the film, had actually been a \\"pool booker\\" who \\"expressed no concern about the editorial process\\" while employed there. Fox also pointed out that Frenk had been a volunteer for Bill Clinton's 1992 Presidential campaign. Fox News challenged any news organization that thought this was a major story to \\"put out 100 percent of their editorial directions and internal memos [and] Fox News Channel will publish 100 percent of our editorial directions and internal memos, and let the public decide who is fair.\\" See also * Alternative media (U.S. political right) * Fox News controversies * List of documentaries * Media bias in the United States * The medium is the message * Politico-media complex * Propaganda model References External links * * Category:2004 films Category:2004 documentary films Category:American documentary films Category:American films Category:American independent films Category:Documentary films about American politics Category:Documentary films about television Category:Documentary films about journalism Category:Documentary films about mass media owners Category:Fox News criticisms and controversies Category:Mass media-related controversies in the United States Category:Films directed by Robert Greenwald Category:Works about Fox News ","title":"Outfoxed"},{"id":"896929","text":"James Quinn, c. 1907. Oil on canvas on board, 35.5 x 31 cm., in the collection of the National Library of Australia Harold Parker (27 August 1873 ‚Äì 23 April 1962) was a British-born sculptor, raised in Queensland, Australia, and subsequently worked in the United Kingdom.  Early life  Harold Parker was born in 1873 in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, England. His family moved to Brisbane, Australia in 1876.  Artistic career  He studied at the Brisbane Technical College under John A Clarke and Godfrey Rivers, then in 1896 left for London where he studied under William Silver Frith, then worked as assistant to Thomas Brock, Hamo Thornycroft and Goscombe John. He rented a studio near that of fellow sculptor John Tweed, and from 1903 to 1929 regularly exhibited at the Royal Academy of Arts, London, and occasionally at the Old Salon, Paris. He was commissioned to portray Queensland expatriates and became a rival of Bertram Mackennal. In 1906 he was elected a member of the Royal Society of British Sculptors. The triumph of his career came in 1908 when for ¬£1000 the Chantrey Bequest purchased his 'Ariadne' for the Tate Gallery. In 1910 his 'Prometheus Bound' received a 'mention' at the Salon. In March 1911 at St James' Church Sussex Gardens in Paddington, London, he was married to Janet Robinson, the daughter of Major Sir Thomas B. Robinson, then the Agent-General for Queensland in London. The First Breath of Spring, circa 1913, held by the Queensland Art Gallery The Prosperity of Australia, Australia House, London, by Parker (1915‚Äì1918) In 1911 the newly married Harold Parker visited Brisbane and was received enthusiastically, but apart from his First Breath of Spring to the Queensland National Art Gallery, sold none of his work. Back in London he received a major commission, two groups of figures outside Australia House: The Prosperity of Australia and The Awakening of Australia. In 1929 his work was being shown at Paris Salon, the Royal Academy, and the Royal Scottish Academy. In 1930 he and his wife settled in Brisbane where, overlooked for major commissions, he withdrew from public life, virtually abandoning sculpture for painting. He did, however, submit a number of designs for the reverses of the proposed coinage of Edward VIII in 1936. His image of a wren was selected for the farthing, where it remained for the rest of the coin's existence, becoming a firm and recognised favourite in Britain.Dyer, G. P. (1973) The Proposed Coinage of King Edward VIII, HMSO, p. 19 He was a founding member of the Australian Academy of Art in 1937. In 1993 a retrospective of his work entitled Harold Parker, Sculptor, was held at the Queensland Art Gallery, Brisbane. Artworks by Harold Parker are held at the Queensland Art Gallery.  Later life  Parker died in Brisbane on 23 April 1962. He was buried in South Brisbane Cemetery.Parker, Harold -- Brisbane City Council Grave Location Search  Legacy  A circa 1907 portrait of Parker by James Peter Quinn hangs in the National Library of Australia.

It was also used in the Willys 473 and 475 pickups, wagons, and sedan deliveries. It replaced the Willys Go Devil engine that was used in the MB Jeep and other early Jeep-based models like the Jeepster. This engine was also built by Mitsubishi for their license-built Jeep, as well as other applications.  Design  The Hurricane was based on the earlier Go-Devil flathead engine. To get more power from the engine, the induction system was changed from the Go-Devil's side-valve configuration to an inlet-over-exhaust configuration, or \\"F-head\\". This allowed the valves to be larger and the combustion chamber to be smaller, improving flow and increasing the compression ratio. The compression ratio rose from 6.5:1 in the Go-Devil engine to 7.5:1 in the Hurricane engine, although a version of the Hurricane engine was made with a 6.9:1 compression ratio. F134 The L134 Go Devil was updated with the F-head to become the F134 in 1950.Brown, p. 74.

After working odd jobs in the first months of the Great Depression, Hanna joined the Harman and Ising animation studio in 1930. During the 1930s, Hanna steadily gained skill and prominence while working on cartoons such as Captain and the Kids. In 1937, while working at Metro- Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), Hanna met Joseph Barbera. The two men began a collaboration that was at first best known for producing Tom and Jerry. In 1957, they co-founded Hanna-Barbera, which became the most successful television animation studio in the business, creating and/or producing programs such as The Flintstones, The Huckleberry Hound Show, The Jetsons, Scooby-Doo, The Smurfs, and Yogi Bear. In 1967, Hanna-Barbera was sold to Taft Broadcasting for $12 million, but Hanna and Barbera remained heads of the company until 1991. At that time, the studio was sold to Turner Broadcasting System, which in turn was merged with Time Warner in 1996; Hanna and Barbera stayed on as advisors. Tom and Jerry won seven Academy Awards, while Hanna and Barbera were nominated for two others and won eight Emmy Awards. Their cartoons have become cultural icons, and their cartoon characters have appeared in other media such as films, books, and toys. Hanna-Barbera's shows had a worldwide audience of over 300 million people in their 1960s heyday, and have been translated into more than 28 languages.  Early and personal life William Hanna was born to William John (1873-1949) and Avice Joyce (Denby) Hanna (1882-1956) on July 14, 1910, in Melrose, New Mexico Territory. He was the third of seven children. Hanna described his family as \\"a red-blooded, Irish-American family\\". His father was a construction superintendent for railroads as well as water and sewer systems throughout the western regions of America, requiring the family to move frequently. When Hanna was three years old, the family moved to Baker City, Oregon, where his father worked on the Balm Creek Dam. It was there that Hanna would develop his love of the outdoors. The family moved to Logan, Utah, before moving to San Pedro, California, in 1917. During the next two years they moved several times before eventually settling in Watts, California, in 1919. In 1922, while living in Watts, he joined Scouting. He attended Compton High School from 1925 through 1928, where he played the saxophone in a dance band. His passion for music carried over into his career; he helped write songs for his cartoons, including the theme for The Flintstones. There are also reports that Hanna attended UCLA but this is unconfirmed. Hanna became an Eagle Scout as a youth and remained active in Scouting throughout his life. As an adult, he served as a Scoutmaster and was recognized by the Boy Scouts of America with their Distinguished Eagle Scout Award in 1985. Despite his numerous career-related awards, Hanna was most proud of this Distinguished Eagle Scout Award. His interests also included sailing and singing in a barbershop quartet. Hanna studied both journalism and structural engineering at Compton City College, but had to drop out of college with the onset of the Great Depression. On August 7, 1936, Hanna married Violet Blanch Wogatzke (July 23, 1913 ‚Äì July 10, 2014), and they had a marriage lasting over 64 years, until his death. The marriage produced two children, David William and Bonnie Jean, and seven grandchildren. In 1996, Hanna, with assistance from Los Angeles writer Tom Ito, published his autobiography‚ÄîJoe Barbera had published his own two years earlier.  Early career  After dropping out of college, Hanna worked briefly as a construction engineer and helped build the Pantages Theatre in Hollywood. He lost that job during the Great Depression and found another at a car wash. His sister's boyfriend encouraged him to apply for a job at Pacific Title and Art, which produced title cards for motion pictures. While working there, Hanna's talent for drawing became evident, and in 1930 he joined the Harman and Ising animation studio, which had created the Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies series. Despite a lack of formal training, Hanna soon became head of their ink and paint department. Besides inking and painting, Hanna also wrote songs and lyrics. For the first several years of Hanna's employment, the studio partnered with Pacific Title and Art's Leon Schlesinger, who released the Harman-Ising output through Warner Bros. When Hugh Harman and Rudolph Ising chose to break with Schlesinger and begin producing cartoons independently for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) in 1933, Hanna was one of the employees who followed them. Hanna was given the opportunity to direct his first cartoon in 1936; the result was To Spring, part of the Harman-Ising Happy Harmonies series. The following year, MGM decided to terminate their partnership with Harman-Ising and bring production in-house. Hanna was among the first people MGM hired away from Harman-Ising to their new cartoon studio. During 1938‚Äì1939, he served as a senior director on MGM's Captain and the Kids series, based upon the comic strip of the same name (an alternate version of the Katzenjammer Kids that had resulted from a 1914 lawsuit). The series did not do well; consequently, Hanna was demoted to a story man and the series was canceled. Hanna's desk at MGM was opposite that of Joseph Barbera, who had previously worked at Terrytoons. The two quickly realized they would make a good team. By 1939 they had solidified a partnership that would last over 60 years. Hanna and Barbera worked alongside animation director Tex Avery, who had created Daffy Duck and Bugs Bunny for Warner Bros. and directed Droopy cartoons at MGM.  Tom and Jerry  In 1940, Hanna and Barbera jointly directed Puss Gets the Boot, which was nominated for an Academy Award for Best (Cartoon) Short Subject. The studio wanted a diversified cartoon portfolio, so despite the success of Puss Gets the Boot, Hanna and Barbera's supervisor, Fred Quimby, did not want to produce more cat and mouse cartoons. Surprised by the success of Puss Gets the Boot, Hanna and Barbera ignored Quimby's resistance and continued developing the cat-and-mouse theme. By this time, however, Hanna wanted to return to working for Ising, to whom he felt very loyal. Hanna and Barbera met with Quimby, who discovered that although Ising had taken sole credit for producing Puss Gets the Boot, he never actually worked on it. Quimby, who had wanted to start a new animation unit independent of Ising, then gave Hanna and Barbera permission to pursue their cat-and-mouse idea. The result was their most famous creation, Tom and Jerry. Modeled after the Puss Gets the Boot characters with slight differences, the series followed Jerry, the rodent who continually outwitted his feline foe, Tom. Hanna said they settled on the cat and mouse theme for this cartoon because: \\"We knew we needed two characters. We thought we needed conflict, and chase and action. And a cat after a mouse seemed like a good, basic thought.\\" The revamped characters first appeared in 1941's The Midnight Snack. Over the next 17 years Hanna and Barbera worked almost exclusively on Tom and Jerry, directing more than 114 highly popular cartoon shorts. During World War II they also made animated training films. Tom and Jerry relied mostly on motion instead of dialog. Despite its popularity, Tom and Jerry has often been criticized as excessively violent. Nonetheless, the series won its first Academy Award for the 11th short, The Yankee Doodle Mouse (1943)‚Äîa war- time adventure. Tom and Jerry was ultimately nominated for 14 Academy Awards, winning 7. No other character-based theatrical animated series has won more awards, nor has any other series featuring the same characters. Tom and Jerry also made guest appearances in several of MGM's live-action films, including Anchors Aweigh (1945) and Invitation to the Dance (1956) with Gene Kelly, and Dangerous When Wet (1953) with Esther Williams. Quimby accepted each Academy Award for Tom and Jerry without inviting Hanna and Barbera onstage. The cartoons were also released with Quimby listed as the sole producer, following the same practice for which he had condemned Ising. When Quimby retired in late 1955, Hanna and Barbera were placed in charge of MGM's animation division. As the studio began to lose more revenue due to television, MGM soon realized that re-releasing old cartoons was far more profitable than producing new ones. In 1957, MGM ordered Hanna and Barbera's business manager to close the cartoon division and lay off everyone by a phone call. Hanna and Barbera found the no-notice closure puzzling because Tom and Jerry had been so successful.  Television  During his last year at MGM, Hanna branched out into television, forming the short-lived company Shield Productions with fellow animator Jay Ward, who had created the series Crusader Rabbit. Their partnership soon ended, and in 1957 Hanna reteamed with Joseph Barbera to produce cartoons for television and theatrical release. The two brought different skills to the company; Barbera was a skilled gag writer and sketch artist, while Hanna had a gift for timing, story construction, and recruiting top artists. Major business decisions would be made together, though each year the title of president alternated between them. A coin toss determined that Hanna would have precedence in the naming of the new company, first called H-B Enterprises but soon changed to Hanna-Barbera Productions. Barbera and Hanna's MGM colleague George Sidney, the director of Anchors Aweigh, became the third partner and business manager in the company, and arranged a deal for distribution and working capital with Screen Gems, the television division of Columbia Pictures, who took part ownership of the new studio. The first offering from the new company was The Ruff & Reddy Show, a series which detailed the friendship between a dog and cat. Despite a lukewarm response for their first theatrical venture, Loopy De Loop, Hanna-Barbera soon established themselves with two successful television series: The Huckleberry Hound Show and The Yogi Bear Show. A 1960 survey showed that half of the viewers of Huckleberry Hound were adults. This prompted the company to create a new animated series, The Flintstones. A parody of The Honeymooners, the new show followed a typical Stone Age family with home appliances, talking animals, and celebrity guests. With an audience of both children and adults, The Flintstones became the first animated prime-time show to be a hit. Fred Flintstone's signature exclamation \\"yabba dabba doo\\" soon entered everyday usage, and the show boosted the studio to the top of the TV cartoon field. The company later produced a space-age version of The Flintstones, known as The Jetsons. Although both shows reappeared in the 1970s and 1980s, The Flintstones was far more popular. By the late 1960s, Hanna-Barbera Productions was the most successful television animation studio in the business. The Hanna-Barbera studio produced over 3,000 animated half-hour television shows. Among the more than 100 cartoon series and specials they produced were: Atom Ant, Augie Doggie and Doggie Daddy (an imitation of the earlier Spike and Tyke MGM cartoons), Jonny Quest, Josie and the Pussycats, Magilla Gorilla, Pixie and Dixie and Mr. Jinks, Quick Draw McGraw, and Top Cat. Top Cat was based on Phil Silvers's character Sgt. Bilko, though it has been erroneously reported that Sgt. Bilko was the basis for Yogi Bear. The Hanna-Barbera studio also produced Scooby-Doo (1969‚Äì91) and The Smurfs (1981‚Äì89). The company also produced animated specials based on Alice in Wonderland, Jack and the Beanstalk, Cyrano de Bergerac, as well as the feature-length film Charlotte's Web (1973). As popular as their cartoons were with 1960s audiences, they were disliked by artists. Television programs had lower budgets than theatrical animation, and this economic reality caused many animation studios to go out of business in the 1950s and 1960s, putting many people in the industry out of work. Hanna-Barbera was key in the development of limited animation, which allowed television animation to be more cost-effective, but also reduced quality. Hanna and Barbera had first experimented with these techniques in the early days of Tom and Jerry. To reduce the cost of each episode, shows often focused more on character dialogue than detailed animation. The number of drawings for a seven-minute cartoon decreased from 14,000 to nearly 2,000, and the company implemented innovative techniques such as rapid background changes to improve viewing. Reviewers criticized the change from vivid, detailed animation to repetitive movements by two-dimensional characters. Barbera once said that their choice was to adapt to the television budgets or change careers. The new style did not limit the success of their animated shows, enabling Hanna‚ÄìBarbera to stay in business, providing employment to many who would otherwise have been out of work. Limited animation became the standard for television animation, and continues to be used today in television programs such as The Simpsons and South Park. In 1966, Hanna-Barbera Productions was sold to Taft Broadcasting (renamed Great American Communications in 1987) for $12 million. Hanna and Barbera remained at the head of the company until 1991. At that point, the company was sold to the Turner Broadcasting System for an estimated , which itself merged with Time Warner, owners of Warner Bros., in 1996. This began a close association with the Cartoon Network. Hanna and Barbera continued to advise their former company and periodically worked on new Hanna-Barbera shows, including The Cartoon Cartoon Show series and hit silver screen versions of The Flintstones (1994) and Scooby-Doo (2002). Death Hanna died of esophageal cancer at his home in North Hollywood, Los Angeles, California on March 22, 2001, at the age of 90. After his death, Cartoon Network aired a 20-second segment with black dots tracing Hanna's portrait with the words \\"We'll miss you ‚Äì Cartoon Network\\" fading in on the right-hand side. This same type of tribute happened for Chuck Jones in 2002 and Hanna's partner, Joseph Barbera in 2006, when each of them died. However, Barbera, unlike the other two, had an audio clip of his voice playing in his Cartoon Network promotional tribute. Hanna is buried at Ascension Cemetery in Lake Forest, California. Legacy Most of the cartoons Hanna and Barbera created revolved around close friendship or partnership; this theme is evident with Tom and Jerry, Yogi Bear and Boo Boo, Fred Flintstone and Barney Rubble, Ruff and Ready, The Jetsons family, and the friends in Scooby-Doo. These may have been a reflection of the close business friendship and partnership that Hanna and Barbera shared for almost 60 years. Professionally, they balanced each other's strengths and weaknesses very well, but Hanna and Barbera traveled in completely different social circles. Hanna's personal friends primarily included other animators; Barbera tended to socialize with Hollywood celebrities. Their division of work roles complemented each other but they rarely talked outside of work since Hanna was interested in the outdoors and Barbera liked beaches, good food and drink. Nevertheless, in their long partnership, in which they worked with over 2,000 animated characters, Hanna and Barbera rarely exchanged a cross word. Barbera said: \\"We understood each other perfectly, and each of us had deep respect for the other's work.\\" Hanna is considered one of the all-time great animators and on a par with Tex Avery. Hanna and Barbera were among the most successful animators on the cinema screen and successfully adapted to the change television brought to the industry. Leonard Maltin says the Hanna‚ÄìBarbera team \\"[may] hold a record for producing consistently superior cartoons using the same characters year after year‚Äîwithout a break or change in routine. Their characters are not only animated superstars, but also a very beloved part of American pop culture\\". They are often considered as Walt Disney's only rivals as cartoonists. Hanna and Barbera had a lasting impact on television animation. Cartoons they created often make greatest lists. Many of their characters have appeared in film, books, toys, and other media. During the 1960s their TV shows had a worldwide audience of over 300 million people and have since been translated into more than 20 languages. The works of Hanna and Barbera also have been recognized for their music, such as The Cat Concerto (1946) and Johann Mouse (1952), called \\"masterpieces of animation\\" in part due to their use of classical music. In all, the Hanna‚ÄìBarbera team won seven Academy Awards and eight Emmy Awards, including the 1960 award for The Huckleberry Hound Show, which was the first Emmy awarded to an animated series. They also won these awards: Golden Globe for Television Achievement (1960), Golden IKE Award‚ÄîPacific Pioneers in Broadcasting (1983), Pioneer Award‚ÄîBroadcast Music Incorporated (1987), Iris Award‚ÄîNATPE Men of the Year (1988), Licensing Industry Merchandisers' Association Award for Lifetime Achievement (1988), Governors Award of the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences (1988), Jackie Coogan Award for Outstanding Contribution to Youth through Entertainment Youth in Film (1988), Frederic W. Ziv Award for Outstanding Achievement in Telecommunications‚ÄîBroadcasting Division College‚ÄîConservatory of Music University of Cincinnati (1989), stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame (1976), several Annie Awards, several environmental awards, and were recipients of numerous other accolades prior to their induction into the Television Hall of Fame in 1994. In March 2005 the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences and Warner Bros. Animation dedicated a wall sculpture at the Television Academy's Hall of Fame Plaza in North Hollywood to Hanna and Barbera. Hanna's audio of Tom Cat's screams were reused in the 2014 Tom and Jerry Show.

It is headquartered in Irving, Texas and operates an office in Washington, D.C. As of 2020, ACEP has more than 38,000 members. History ACEP was founded in 1968 by a group of physicians who shared a commitment to improving the quality of emergency care. The organization set out to educate and train physicians in emergency medicine to provide quality emergency care in the nation's hospitals. In 1979, emergency medicine was officially recognized as a medical specialty, a milestone for ACEP and its members. Board certification granting organizations soon folldowed, and, in 1980, the first certification exam was given. In 2000, ACEP changed its governing documents to make active or full-voting membership available only to residency-trained and board-certified emergency physicians. Today, the organization counts approximately 38,000 of the country's approximately 63,000 practicing emergency physicians, emergency medicine residents and medical students as members. Membership Active membership in ACEP is available to physicians who have: # completed an ACGME-approved emergency medicine residency # completed an AOA-approved emergency medicine residency. # been certified by any other emergency medicine certifying body recognized by ACEP # been practicing as emergency physicians since before 2000 (a/k/a \\"Legacy\\" physicians) Fellows use the designation FACEP (\\"Fellow of the American College of Emergency Physicians\\"). In order to earn this designation, an ACEP member must demonstrate at least three years of active involvement in emergency medicine as the physician's chief professional activity, exclusive of training, as well as multiple additional accomplishments in the areas of organizational leadership, education, research, and administration. ACEP is not a board certification granting organization. Board certification in emergency medicine is administered in the United States by organizations such as the American Board of Emergency Medicine and the American Osteopathic Board of Emergency Medicine.

He was one of the founders of the Irish Labour Party, the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union (ITGWU), the Workers' Union of Ireland (the two unions later merged to become SIPTU, Ireland's largest trade union) and the Irish Citizen Army (ICA; a paramilitary group which was integral to both the Dublin Lockout and the Easter Rising). Larkin was born to Irish parents in Liverpool, England. He and his family later moved to a small cottage in Burren, southern County Down. Growing up in poverty, he received little formal education and began working in a variety of jobs while still a child. He became a full-time trade union organiser in 1905. Larkin moved to Belfast in 1907, but is perhaps best known for his role in the 1913 Dublin Lockout. Not long after the lockout, Larkin assumed direct command of the ICA,Charles Townshend, \\"Easter 1916: The Irish Rebellion\\", p.93. and later travelled to America to raise funds for the ITGWU. During his time in America, Larkin became involved in the socialist movement there, becoming a member of the Socialist Party of America. After being jailed in 1920 in the US for 'criminal anarchy', he was pardoned in 1923 and later deported, and returned to Ireland where he again became involved in Irish socialism and politics, both in the Labour Party and the Irish Worker League. Larkin served as a Teachta D√°la on three occasions, and died in 1947. The ICA escorted his funeral procession through Dublin in its last public appearance. Larkin was respected by several commentators during and after his lifetime, with George Bernard Shaw describing him as the \\"greatest Irishman since Parnell\\", and his friend and colleague in the labour movement James Connolly describing him as a \\"man of genius, of splendid vitality, great in his conceptions, magnificent in his courage\\". Other commentators have noted that Larkin was \\"vilified as a wrecker by former comrades\\", with anthologist Donal Nevin noting that some of Larkin's actions, including his attacks on others in the labour movement, meant Larkin had \\"alienated practically all the leaders of the movement [and] the mass of trade union members\\" by the mid-1920s. \\"Big Jim\\" Larkin continues to occupy a position in Dublin's collective memory and streetscape, with a statue of him unveiled on O'Connell Street in 1979. Early years Larkin was born on 21 January 1876 the second eldest son of Irish emigrants, James Larkin and Mary Ann McNulty, both from County Armagh. The impoverished Larkin family lived in the slums of Liverpool during the early years of his life. From the age of seven, he attended school in the mornings and worked in the afternoons to supplement the family income, a common arrangement in working-class families at the time. At the age of fourteen, after the death of his father, he was apprenticed to the firm his father had worked for, but was dismissed after two years. He was unemployed for a time and then worked as a sailor and docker. By 1903, he was a dock foreman, and on 8 September of that year, he married Elizabeth Brown. From 1893, Larkin developed an interest in socialism and became a member of the Independent Labour Party. In 1905, he was one of the few foremen to take part in a strike on the Liverpool docks. He was elected to the strike committee, and although he lost his foreman's job as a result, his performance so impressed the National Union of Dock Labourers (NUDL) that he was appointed a temporary organiser. He later gained a permanent position with the union, which, in 1906, sent him to Scotland, where he successfully organised workers in Preston and Glasgow. Larkin campaigned against Chinese immigration, presenting it as a threat that would undercut workers, leading processions in 1906 in Liverpool with fifty dockers dressed as 'Chinamen', wearing faux-'pigtails' and wearing powder to provide a 'yellow countenance'.East Wind: China and the British Left, 1925-1976 (Oxford, 2012), p.18 Organising Irish labour movement (1907‚Äì14) In January 1907, Larkin undertook his first task on behalf of the trade union movement in Ireland, when he arrived in Belfast to organise the city's dock workers for the NUDL. He succeeded in unionising the workforce, and as employers refused to meet the wage demands, he called the dockers out on strike in June. Carters and coal men soon joined in, the latter settling their dispute after a month. Larkin succeeded in uniting Protestant and Catholic workers and even persuaded the local Royal Irish Constabulary to strike at one point, but the strike ended by November without having achieved significant success. Tensions regarding leadership arose between Larkin and NUDL general secretary James Sexton. The latter's handling of negotiations and agreement to a disastrous settlement for the last of the strikers resulted in a lasting rift between Sexton and Larkin. In 1908, Larkin moved south and organised workers in Dublin, Cork and Waterford, with considerable success. His involvement, against union instructions, in a dispute in Dublin resulted in his expulsion from the NUDL. The union later prosecuted him for diverting union funds to give strike pay to Cork workers engaged in an unofficial dispute. After trial and conviction for embezzlement in 1910, he was sentenced to prison for a year.UCC web essay accessed Nov 2009 This was widely regarded as unjust, and the Lord- Lieutenant, Lord Aberdeen, pardoned him after he had served three months in prison. Also in 1908, Arthur Griffith during the Dublin carter's strike described Larkin as an \\"Englishman importing foreign political disruption into this country and putting native industry at risk\\". After his expulsion from the NUDL, Larkin founded the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union (ITGWU) at the end of December 1908. The organisation exists today as the Services Industrial Professional & Technical Union (SIPTU). It quickly gained the affiliation of the NUDL branches in Dublin, Cork, Dundalk, Waterford and Sligo. The Derry and Drogheda NUDL branches stayed with the British union, and Belfast split along sectarian lines. Early in the new year, 1909, Larkin moved to Dublin, which became the main base of the ITGWU and the focus of all his future union activity in Ireland. In June 1911, Larkin established a newspaper, The Irish Worker and People's Advocate, as a pro-labour alternative to the capitalist-owned press. This organ was characterised by a campaigning approach and the denunciation of unfair employers and of Larkin's political enemies. Its columns also included pieces by intellectuals. The paper was produced until its suppression by the authorities in 1915. Afterwards, the Worker metamorphosed into the new Ireland Echo. In partnership with James Connolly, Larkin helped form the Irish Labour Party in 1912. Later that year, he was elected to Dublin Corporation. He did not hold his seat long, as a month later he was removed because he had a criminal record from his conviction in 1910. Dublin Lockout, 1913 In early 1913, Larkin achieved some successes in industrial disputes in Dublin and, notably, in the Sligo Dock strike; these involved frequent recourse to sympathetic strikes and blacking (boycotting) of goods. Two major employers, Guinness and the Dublin United Tramway Company, were the main targets of Larkin's organising ambitions. Both had craft unions for skilled workers, but Larkin's main aim was to unionise the unskilled workers as well. He coined the slogan \\"A fair day's work for a fair day's pay\\". Guinness staff were relatively well-paid and enjoyed generous benefits from a paternalistic management that refused to join a lockout of unionised staff by virtually all the major Dublin employers.Guinness 1886‚Äì1939, SR Dennison & Oliver McDonagh; Cork Univ. Press 1998 . See: Chapter 8, \\"The employees; work and welfare 1886‚Äì1914\\" This was far from the case on the tramways. The chairman of the Dublin United Tramway Company, industrialist and newspaper proprietor William Martin Murphy, was determined not to allow the ITGWU to unionise his workforce. On 15 August, he dismissed 40 workers he suspected of ITGWU membership, followed by another 300 over the next week. On 26 August 1913, the tramway workers officially went on strike. Led by Murphy, over 400 of the city's employers retaliated by requiring their workers to sign a pledge not to be a member of the ITGWU and not to engage in sympathetic strikes. The resulting industrial dispute was the most severe in Ireland's history. Employers in Dublin engaged in a sympathetic lockout of their workers when the latter refused to sign the pledge, employing blackleg labour from Britain and from elsewhere in Ireland. Guinness, the largest employer in Dublin, refused the employers' call to lock out its workers but it sacked 15 workers who struck in sympathy. Dublin's workers, amongst the poorest in the whole of what was then the Great Britain and Ireland, were forced to survive on generous but inadequate donations from the British Trades Union Congress (TUC) and sources in Ireland, distributed by the ITGWU. For seven months the lockout affected tens of thousands of Dublin workers and employers, with Larkin portrayed as the villain by Murphy's three main newspapers, the Irish Independent, the Sunday Independent and the Evening Herald, and by other bourgeois publications in Ireland. Other leaders in the ITGWU at the time were James Connolly and William X. O'Brien; influential figures such as Patrick Pearse, Constance Markievicz and William Butler Yeats supported the workers in the generally anti-Larkin Irish press. The Irish Worker published the names and addresses of strike-breakers, the Irish Independent published the names and addresses of men and women who attempted to send their children out of the city to be cared for in foster homes in Belfast and Britain. However, Larkin never resorted to violence. He knew it would play into the hands of the anti-union companies, and that he could not build a mass trade union by wrecking the firms where his members worked. A group including Tom Kettle and Thomas MacDonagh formed the Industrial Peace Committee to attempt to negotiate between employers and workers; the employers refused to meet them. When a meeting called by Larkin for Sunday 31 August 1913 was proscribed, Constance Markievicz and her husband Casimir disguised Larkin in Casimir's frock coat and trousers and stage makeup and beard, and Nellie Gifford, who was unknown to the police, led him into William Martin Murphy's Imperial Hotel, pretending to be her stooped, deaf old clergyman uncle (to disguise his instantly recognisable Liverpool accent). Larkin tore off his beard inside the hotel and raced to a balcony, where he shouted his speech to the crowd below. The police ‚Äì some 300 Royal Irish Constabulary reinforcing Dublin Metropolitan Police ‚Äì savagely baton-charged the crowd, injuring between 400 and 600 people. MP Handel Booth, who was present, said that the police \\"behaved like men possessed. They drove the crowd into the side streets to meet other batches of the government's minions, wildly striking with their truncheons at everyone within reach ... The few roughs got away first, most respectable people left their hats and crawled away with bleeding heads. Kicking victims when prostrate was a settled part of the police programme.\\" Larkin went into hiding, charged with incitement to breach the peace. James Connolly was arrested and told the authorities \\"I do not recognise the English government in Ireland at all. I do not even recognise the King except when I am compelled to do so\\".http://www.theirishstory.com/2013/08/31/today-in-irish-history- august-31-1913-labours-bloody-sunday/#.Vv1CPWPDFSU The violence at union rallies during the strike prompted Larkin to call for a workers' militia to be formed to protect themselves against the police, thus Larkin, James Connolly, and Jack White created the Irish Citizen Army. The Citizen Army for the duration of the lock-out was armed with hurleys (sticks used in hurling, a traditional Irish sport) and bats to protect workers' demonstrations from the police. Jack White, a former Captain in the British Army, volunteered to train this army and offered ¬£50 towards the cost of shoes to workers so that they could train. In addition to its role as a self-defence organisation, the Army, which was drilled in Croydon Park in Fairview by White, provided a diversion for workers unemployed and idle during the dispute. The lock-out eventually concluded in early 1914 when calls by Connolly and Larkin for a sympathetic strike in Britain were rejected by the British TUC. Larkin's attacks on the TUC leadership for this stance also led to the cessation of financial aid to the ITGWU, which in any case was not affiliated to the TUC. Although the actions of the ITGWU and the smaller UBLU were unsuccessful in achieving substantially better pay and conditions for the workers, they marked a watershed in Irish labour history. The principle of union action and workers' solidarity had been firmly established. Perhaps even more importantly, Larkin's rhetoric condemning poverty and injustice and calling for the oppressed to stand up for themselves made a lasting impression. In the US (1914‚Äì23) Jim Larkin at his 8 November 1919 booking for \\"criminal anarchism\\" in the state of New York. Some months after the lockout ended, Larkin left for the United States. He intended to recuperate from the strain of the lockout and raise funds for the union. His decision to leave dismayed many union activists. Once there he became a member of the Socialist Party of America and was involved in the Industrial Workers of the World union (the Wobblies). Within days of arriving in the country, he addressed a crowd of 15,000 people gathered at Madison Square Garden to celebrate the election of Socialist candidate Meyer London to the United States House of Representatives. He became an enthusiastic supporter of the Soviet Union and was expelled from the Socialist Party of America in 1919 along with numerous other sympathisers of the Bolsheviks during the Red Scare of that year. Larkin was reported as having helped to disrupt Allied munitions shipments in New York City during World War I. In 1937, he voluntarily assisted US lawyers investigating the Black Tom explosion by providing an affidavit from his home in Dublin. According to British Army Intelligence officer, Henry Landau: > Larkin testified that he himself never took part in the actual sabotage > campaign but, rather, confined himself to the organising of strikes to > secure both higher pay and shorter hours for workmen and to prevent the > shipment of munitions to the Allies. Larkin's speeches in support of the Soviet Union, his association with founding members of the American Communist Party, and his radical publications made him a target of the \\"First Red Scare\\" that was sweeping the US; he was arrested on 7 November 1919 for 'criminal anarchy', and sentenced to five to ten years in Sing Sing prison. In 1923, he was pardoned and later deported by Al Smith, Governor of New York. =Return to Ireland and communist activism= Upon his return to Ireland in April 1923, Larkin received a hero's welcome and immediately set about touring the country meeting trade union members and appealing for an end to the Irish Civil War. However, he soon found himself at variance with William X. O'Brien, who in his absence had become the leading figure in the ITGWU and the Irish Labour Party and Trades Union Congress. Larkin was still officially general secretary of the ITGWU. The ITGWU leaders (Thomas Foran, William O'Brien, Thomas Kennedy: all colleagues of Larkin during the Lockout) sued him. Their counsel told the court that Larkin had justified the occupation by false and malicious attacks on their characters to oust them and to gain sole control of the union. The Master of the Rolls, presiding, declared: \\"It is surprising that a man of Mr Larkin's intelligence should launch so desperate an invective against these people for irregularities, in the misapplication of funds and the falsification of documents, when I have before me a document which bears the name of James Larkin, which has been proved to be a misstatement.\\" Larkin's \\"misstatement\\" asserted that the Transport Union had ¬£1,746.69 in the Hibernian Bank in December 1913, but the union account was completely empty. Moreover, since all relevant union account books had mysteriously been destroyed, no explanation for the missing money was possible. The court duly found against Larkin, ordering him to pay the costs of both sides. The bitterness of the court case between the former organisers of the 1913 Lockout would last over 20 years. In September 1923, Larkin formed the Irish Worker League (IWL), which was soon afterwards recognised by the Comintern as the Irish section of the world communist movement. In 1924 Larkin attended the Comintern congress in Moscow and was elected to its executive committee. On his return, Larkin announced that he had addressed some 20 million Russians, having been elected as one of \\"the 25 men to govern the world\\" and boasted that he had been appointed a Chief of Battalion of the Red Army, whose 2.5 million men had \\"pledged to come to the assistance of Irish workers\\". However, the League was not organised as a political party, never held a general congress and never succeeded in being politically effective. Its most prominent activity in its first year was to raise funds for imprisoned members of the Anti-Treaty IRA. During Larkin's absence at the 1924 Comintern Congress (and apparently against his instructions), his brother Peter took his supporters out of the ITGWU, forming the Workers' Union of Ireland (WUI). The new union quickly grew, gaining the allegiance of about two-thirds of the Dublin membership of the ITGWU and of a smaller number of rural members. It affiliated to the pro-Soviet Red International of Labour Unions. Larkin launched a vicious attack on the Labour leader, Tom Johnson, who like Larkin, was Liverpool-born. But whereas Johnson had spent most of his life in Ireland, Larkin had been as long in the US as he had in Ireland. Larkin said that it was \\"time that Labour dealt with this English traitor. If they don't get rid of this scoundrel, they'll get the bullet and the bayonet in reward. There's nothing for it, but a dose of the lead which Johnson promises to those who look for work\\". This implied incitement to murder Johnson in a still-violent post-Civil War country resulted in the court awarding Johnson ¬£1000 in libel damages against Larkin. In his 2006 biographical anthology, Donal Nevin noted that his attacks on colleagues in the labour movement, including those the subject of this libel action, meant that Larkin \\"alienated practically all the leaders of the movement [and] the mass of trade union members\\". In January 1925, the Comintern sent Communist Party of Great Britain activist Bob Stewart to Ireland to establish a communist party in co-operation with Larkin. A formal founding conference of the Irish Worker League, which was to take up this role, was set for May 1925. A fiasco ensued when the organisers discovered at the last minute that Larkin did not intend to attend. Feeling that the proposed party could not succeed without him, they called the conference off as it was due to start in a packed room in the Mansion House, Dublin. At the September 1927 general election, Larkin ran (a huge surprise for all) in Dublin North and was elected. However, as a result of a libel award against him won by William O'Brien, which he had refused to pay, he was an undischarged bankrupt and could not take up his seat. Larkin was unsuccessful in his attempts in the following years to gain a position as a commercial agent in Ireland for the Soviet Union, which may have contributed to his disenchantment with Stalinism. The Soviets, for their part, were increasingly impatient with what they saw as his ineffective leadership. From the early 1930s, Larkin drew away from the Soviet Union. While in the 1932 general election, he stood, without success, as a communist and in 1933 and subsequently, he ran as \\"Independent Labour\\". In 1934, he gave important evidence on the 1916 Black Tom explosion to John J. McCloy, allowing a case for damages against Germany to be reopened; presumably because of Germany's new Nazi government.New York Observer, July 2006 During this period he also engaged in a rapprochement with the Catholic Church. In 1936, he regained his seat on Dublin Corporation. He then regained his D√°il seat at the 1937 general election but lost it again the following year. In that period, the Workers' Union of Ireland also entered the mainstream of the trade union movement, being admitted to the Dublin Trades Council in 1936, but the Irish Trades Union Congress would not accept its membership application until 1945. Return to Labour Party Larkin's gravestone in Glasnevin Cemetery In 1941, a new trade union bill was published by the Government. Inspired by an internal trade union restructuring proposal by William O'Brien, it was viewed as a threat by the smaller general unions and the Irish branches of British unions (known as the 'amalgamated unions'). Larkin and the WUI played a leading role in the unsuccessful campaign against the bill. After its passage into law, he and his supporters successfully applied for admission to the Labour Party, where they were now regarded with more sympathy by many members. O'Brien in response disaffiliated the ITGWU from the party, forming the rival National Labour Party and denouncing what he claimed was communist influence in Labour. Larkin later served as a Labour Party deputy in D√°il √âireann from 1943 to 1944.  Allegations of Anti-Semitism  Larkin is said to have ran anti-Semitic verses in the Irish Worker paper. One told of a ‚ÄúJewess‚Äù who was demanding back the price of her pushy son‚Äôs theatre ticket when, rushing to get the best seat in the house, he fell to his death from a balcony. He soon republished the same caricature. Larkin ran a cartoon aimed at a particular group of Jewish immigrants. Described as ‚Äúforeigners masquerading under Irish names‚Äù, his cartoon used stereotypical physical characteristics, as well as mock-immigrant pronunciation and ‚Äúikey‚Äù, said to be regarded as a derogatory nickname for Jews. Larkin's The Jew's Shilling has been provided as another example. Death James Larkin died in his sleep, on 30 January 1947 in the Meath Hospital. Fr Aloysius Travers, OFM (who had administered last rites to James Connolly in 1916) also administered extreme unction to Larkin. His funeral mass was celebrated by the Catholic Archbishop of Dublin, John Charles McQuaid, who had visited him in hospital before he died, and thousands lined the streets of the city as the hearse passed through on the way to Glasnevin Cemetery. Religion & Personal life Larkin is said to have been a Christian Socialist. Larkin remained a Catholic throughout his life, and asserted there was no inherent conflict between his religious views and his politics: He would go on to marry Elizabeth Brown. Commemoration =Literature= Larkin has been the subject of poems by Brendan Behan, Patrick Kavanagh, Frank O'Connor, Donagh MacDonagh and Lola Ridge; his character has been central in plays by Daniel Corkery, George Russell (√Ü), and Se√°n O'Casey; and he is a heroic figure in the background of James Plunkett's novel Strumpet City and Lyn Andrews' Where the Mersey Flows. =Songs= James Larkin was memorialised by the New York Irish rock band Black 47, in their song The Day They Set Jim Larkin Free, and Donagh MacDonagh's The Ballad of James Larkin was recorded by Christy Moore and also the Dubliners. Paddy Reilly sings a song simply entitled Jim Larkin that describes the lot of the worker and their appreciation of the changes made by Larkin and Connolly. The song The Lockout by Joe O' Sullivan describes Larkin's organisation of workers which led to the Dublin Lockout of 1913. =Monument= Statue of James Larkin on O'Connell Street, Dublin (Ois√≠n Kelly 1977) Statue of James Larkin with the GPO on left. Easter 2016 Today a statue of \\"Big Jim\\" stands on O'Connell Street in Dublin. Completed by Ois√≠n Kelly, and unveiled in 1979, the inscription on the front of the monument is an extract in French, Irish and English from one of his famous speeches: > Les grands ne sont grands que parce que nous sommes √† genoux: Levons-nous. > N√≠ uasal aon uasal ach sinne bheith √≠seal: √âir√≠mis. > The great appear great because we are on our knees: Let us rise. The slogan, first used on the 18th century French radical paper R√©volutions de Paris, also appeared on the masthead of the Workers' Republic, founded by James Connolly in Dublin in August 1898. Originally the organ of the Irish Socialist Republican Party, this periodical later became the official organ of the Communist Party of Ireland, which was founded in 1921. The original slogan is usually attributed to Camille Desmoulins (1760‚Äì1794), the French revolutionary; but it appears, only slightly modified, in an essay written by √âtienne de La Bo√©tie (1530‚Äì1563) and first published in 1576. On the west side of the base of the Larkin monument is a quotation from the poem Jim Larkin by Patrick Kavanagh: On the east side of the monument there is a quotation from Drums under the Windows by Se√°n O'Casey: > ... He talked to the workers, spoke as only Jim Larkin could speak, not for > an assignation with peace, dark obedience, or placid resignation, but > trumpet-tongued of resistance to wrong, discontent with leering poverty, and > defiance of any power strutting out to stand in the way of their march > onward. A road in Raheny, north Dublin, is named after him. =James Larkin Way= A road in L4 1YQ, Kirkdale, in his home city of Liverpool, just off Scotland Road, is called James Larkin Way. =Liverpool Irish Festival 2008= To celebrate Liverpool's year as European Capital of Culture, the Liverpool Irish Festival held a James Larkin Evening at the 'Casa' bar-the dockers' pub in central Liverpool. This was attended by Francis Devine who wrote the general history of the trade union movement in Dublin and the formation of SIPTU. It was introduced by Liverpool Irishman Marcus Maher, who travelled from Dublin to present a specially commissioned painting by Finbar Coyle to James Larkin's last remaining Liverpool nephew, Tom Larkin. The painting reflects on one side Dublin and on the other side the Liver Bird and his home city of Liverpool. =People= The Transport and General Workers' Union activist Jack Jones, whose full name was James Larkin Jones, was named in honour of his fellow Liverpudlian.

On display at the National Museum of Cambodia. A Chicago courtroom, mid 1910s. A spittoon is seen on the floor at bottom right. Decorated Surinam porcelain spittoon. Note this type of spittoon has a spout hole on the side for emptying. A spittoon (or spitoon) is a receptacle made for spitting into, especially by users of chewing and dipping tobacco. It is also known as a cuspidor (which is the Portuguese word for \\"spitter\\" or \\"spittoon\\", from the verb \\"cuspir\\" meaning \\"to spit\\"), although that term is also used for a type of spitting sink used in dentistry.  United States in the 19th century toleware spittoon Janitors at the United States Capitol with stack of spittoons, 1914 In the late 19th century, spittoons became a common feature of pubs, brothels, saloons, hotels, stores, banks, railway carriages, and other places where people (especially adult men) gathered, notably in the United States, but allegedly also in Australia. Brass was the most common material for spitoons. Other materials used for mass production of spittoons ranged from basic functional iron to elaborately crafted cut glass and fine porcelain. At higher class places like expensive hotels, spittoons could be elaborately decorated. Spittoons are flat-bottomed, often weighted to minimize tipping over, and often with an interior \\"lip\\" to make spilling less likely if they tip. Some have lids, but this is rare. Some have holes, sometimes with a plug, to aid in draining and cleaning. Use of spittoons was considered an advance of public manners and health, intended to replace previously common spitting on floors, streets, and sidewalks. Many places passed laws against spitting in public other than into a spittoon. Boy Scout troops organized campaigns to paint \\"Do not Spit on the Sidewalk\\" notices on city sidewalks. In 1909 in Cincinnati, Ohio, scout troops together with members of the Anti-Tuberculosis League painted thousands of such messages in a single night.New York State Department of Health Bulletin, 1909, 294 A mass- produced sign seen in saloons read: Spittoons were also useful for people suffering from tuberculosis who would cough up phlegm. Public spittoons would sometimes contain a solution of an antiseptic such as carbolic acid with the aim of limiting transmission of disease. With the start of the 20th century medical doctors urged tuberculosis sufferers to use personal pocket spittoons instead of public ones; these were jars with tight lids which people could carry with them to spit into. Similar devices are still used by some with tuberculosis. After the 1918 flu epidemic, both hygiene and etiquette advocates began to disparage public use of the spittoon, and use began to decline. Chewing gum replaced tobacco as the favorite chew of the younger generation. Cigarettes were considered more hygienic than spit-inducing chewing tobacco. While it was still not unusual to see spittoons in some public places in parts of the US as late as the 1930s, vast numbers of old brass spittoons met their ends in the scrap drives of World War II. A large public collection of spittoons can be found at Duke Homestead State Historic Site, Durham, North Carolina. In 2008, the site's tobacco museum added 282 spittoons‚Äîclaimed to be the world's largest collection‚Äîto its holdings of over 100.Deborah Straszheim, \\"Griswold Man May Have World's Largest Spittoon Collection\\". Norwich (Connecticut) Bulletin. June 16, 2008. In Chinese society Spittoon, 14th Century. The Walters Art Museum. Spittoons have been used in China for a long time; the earliest porcelain spittoon was found in a tomb dating to Emperor Xianzong's reign during the Tang dynasty. During the Qing Dynasty and later in Japan, a golden spittoon would be among the numerous objects displayed in front of the Emperor at major ceremonies.Wan Yi, Wang Shuqing and Lu Yanzheng, Life in the Forbidden City, 2006 Commercial Press (H.K.) Ltd., page 30 After China became a Communist state in 1949, the spittoon became much more prevalent: spittoons were placed at every conceivable public place, and were commonplace in homes as well. The mass introduction of spittoons was no doubt a public hygiene initiative, motivated by a desire to curtail the still common Chinese practice of spitting onto the floor. The spittoons used in China were typically made of white porcelain, sometimes with traditional Chinese art painted onto the exterior. Spittoons were used even during official functions by the political leaders of China; especially when Deng Xiaoping had a frequent use of spittoon with other political leaders. This eventually became a source of ridicule by the mass media outside China. As a response, the spittoons have largely been withdrawn from public spaces in China since the late 1980s. In May 2015, the Spittoon Collective came into being, probably the largest English-language literary collectives in China. They publish the Spittoon literary magazine.  Latter- day models  Spitting into a spittoon at a wine tasting. While spittoons are still made, they are no longer commonly found in public places (except as decorations). There are a few companies that currently make spittoons for users of smokeless tobacco, such as MudJug, Spitbud, and Mud Bud by DC Crafts Nation. Professions in which spittoons are commonly used are coffee, tea and wine tasting. A taster will sip samples and then spit them into a spittoon in order to avoid intoxication. Makeshift spittoons, such as large mixing bowls, can be used by people with a cold who are frequently coughing up phlegm. Spittoons remained in use in the Southern United States in public buildings at least until the 1970s. For example, the Georgia Capitol Museum in the Georgia Capitol Building in Atlanta, Georgia, has on display a spittoon of the type that was used in legislative sessions into the 1970s. The United States Senate also has spittoons spread across the Senate Chamber as they are considered a Senate tradition. Similarly, each Justice on the United States Supreme Court has a spittoon next to his or her seat in the courtroom. However, the spittoons function merely as wastebaskets; the last time the spittoon was used for its customary purpose was in the early 20th century.

It is intended to reach from St. Louis to Arkansas. Over of the trail have been completed as of 2008, and the estimated length when finished will be at least . When joined to the Ozark Highlands Trail in Arkansas, the full hiking distance from end to end will be at least , not including a large loop through the St. Francois Mountains in Missouri.  Description  The trail is currently composed of thirteen sections, most of which are joined to other sections, though some gaps exist. The sections vary in length from . The longest continuous stretch available for hiking in is , from Onondaga Cave State Park to the Eleven Point River. The exact routes for incomplete sections have not been established, so the total length of the trail when completed remains undetermined. Some sections have restrictions on their use in order to be compatible with the goals and purposes of the various public and private landholders whose property the trail crosses. Horseback riding, mountain biking, or trail side camping may be restricted in certain environmentally sensitive areas.  Development  The Ozark Trail had its beginnings in the 1970s when a group of public land managers, land owners, and trail users met to discuss the concept of a long-distance hiking trail. A comprehensive state outdoor recreation plan prepared by the state of Missouri in 1975 showed a need for an addition of of hiking trails. It was determined that a trail spanning the Ozarks from suburban St. Louis southwest to Arkansas could be routed over mostly existing public lands with a minimum amount of right-of-way needing to be obtained from private landowners. A first meeting in 1976 at Meramec State Park lead to the first draft of the trails proposal in February 1977 and in 1981 the first sections of the trail were under construction. The trail passes through the Devil's Tollgate formation below Taum Sauk Mountain. The general route of the Ozark Trail is determined by the Ozark Trail Council, which was formed by seven governmental agencies including the National Forest Service, the Missouri State Parks Department, the Missouri Conservation Commission, et al., plus several environmental groups and a private landowner with significant holdings. The land manager for each parcel held by these constituents is responsible for the trail within its holdings. This unique decentralized arrangement is conducive to work progressing on many fronts at once and is partly responsible for the rapid initial progress in building the trail -- 170 (275 km) miles within the first decade and over by 1991. In 2008, the mileage stands at over . As the route over contiguous public lands is completed further progress will likely be slowed by the arduous process of acquiring private land and easements. Volunteers formed the Ozark Trail Association in 2002 to work with the Ozark Trail Council to develop and maintain the Ozark Trail. The Ozark Trail was designated a National Recreation Trail in 2008National Recreation Trails Database Ozark Trail . American Trails. 2008-12-18. Retrieved 2009-09-13.

Her first soap role was scheming Natalie Bannon (one of Tom Hughes' wives) on As the World Turns from 1975-1978. A four-month stint as the mysterious Charlotte Greer on Ryan's Hope in 1983 brought her critical acclaim. Her role had her character as part of a revenge plot against the Ryan family after lying to the press that she was Frank Ryan's ex-wife. She joined the cast of General Hospital the following year as the devious Ginny Blake who was the biological mother of Mike Webber, adopted by Rick and Lesley. After Lesley's \\"death\\", Rick and Ginny married in an attempt to share custody and fell in love after Ginny was found to be the killer of D.L. Brock. After that stint ended, she had a brief role on One Life to Live as Sandra Montaigne, a con-artist out to scam ex-boyfriend Jonathan Russell. She was the third former General Hospital actress to play the role of Anjelica Devereaux Curtis on Days of Our Lives, playing that part from 1989-1990 and briefly in 1991.

He is a long-time resident of New York City. Biography Ranx was born in London on 9 March 1965 and was raised in New York City. His mother is from Jamaica and his father is from Nigeria. He was discovered in 1990 when the lead singer and guitarist of The Toasters, Rob \\"Bucket\\" Hingley, heard Ranx's dancehall reggae EP. Joining the Toasters in the early 1990s, he toured and recorded two albums with the band, including Dub 56, which features two songs he wrote. After leaving the Toasters, Ranx co-founded a band called Pilfers. In Pilfers, he shared vocal duties with Vinny Nobile. Pilfers played a combination of third wave ska music, punk rock, and reggae that they called \\"raggacore\\". After self-releasing their first album, the band signed to Mojo Records, who released the band's second album, Chawalaleng. He made frequent guest appearances on the albums of other third wave ska bands, such as Spring Heeled Jack, Metro Stylee and Mojo labelmates Reel Big Fish. After a lineup change, which saw the replacement of the rhythm section, Pilfers disbanded in 2001. Ranx began a solo career, recording and playing shows around the world with Fear Nuttin' Band as his new backup band. In November 2005, he and the other four original members of Pilfers, reunited at the Knitting Factory in New York City for a sold-out performance. The Pilfers have since performed about a half a dozen shows since the 2005 reunion. Ranx provides the voice of Little Jacob in the 2008 video game Grand Theft Auto IV.

He was also involved in the establishment of the Green Party of the United States. Several times a week, Smith publishes an email news digest, Undernews. Biography Smith was born in Washington D.C. into an Episcopalian/Quaker family. He grew up in Philadelphia where he was educated in Quaker schools. Smith attended Harvard University, where he became news director of the college radio station and was a drummer on the college dance circuit. He graduated in 1959 and went to work in radio news in Washington. In 1961, Smith joined the United States Coast Guard. After three years service as an officer, he returned to Washington and started an alternative monthly, The Idler. At the time there were only a handful of such journals being published. In 1965, Smith, then working again in radio, was offered a job as assistant to James Reston, Washington correspondent of The New York Times and later a position at the Washington Post, but he turned them down, preferring to pursue alternative journalism. The following year, he took part in a day-long SNCC boycott of Washington DC transit buses, giving rides to boycotters with his car. After his article on the action appeared, Smith was visited by the local chair of SNCC who was seeking help with public relations. Thus began a long relationship with Marion Barry, who later became mayor of the city. That same year, 1966, Smith launched a community newspaper called the Capitol East Gazette to serve a largely poor, black neighborhood of Washington DC. Aided by a $2,000 grant from a local Lutheran church, the Gazette went on to cover such issues as plans to build a huge network of freeways in the city, the war on poverty, public education, neighborhood battles, and urban planning. Smith also became a vociferous advocate of statehood for the District of Columbia. In 1969, the paper was renamed the DC Gazette and became a citywide alternative newspaper. In subsequent years, contributors would include James Ridgeway, Jim Hightower, Eugene McCarthy, and Paul Krassner and the publication became an early and articulate voice opposing the Vietnam War. In 1974, Indiana University Press published Smith's first book, Captive Capital: Colonial Life in Modern Washington. In 1980, he became a guest commentator on the local NPR radio station and Washington correspondent for the Illustrated London News. In 1984, the Gazette was renamed Progressive Review and evolved into a bimonthly format. Smith's articles on the savings and loan scandal, the problems of urban America, the first Gulf War, the Bush family, and scandals surrounding the Clintons were widely cited. In 1993, Indiana University press published Smith's book on Bill Clinton's first year. Because of his opposition to Clinton and his work at reforming the liberal mainstay, Americans for Democratic Action, he was purged as a vice president of the organization. He then turned his energies to helping create a national Green Party and his home was an occasional gathering spot for Green organizers up until the founding of the party on November 17, 1996. In subsequent years, Smith found he was banned from the local NPR station as well as listed on de facto blacklists at C-SPAN and the Washington Post for what he believes was too aggressively pursuing the Clinton scandals. In 1994, Smith started sending out email updates. The following year, he launched a website, prorev.com, which subsequently grew to be one of the most popular websites for progressive politics on the Net. In 1997, Sam Smith's Great American Political Repair Manual was published. His fourth book, Why Bother? Getting a Life in Locked Down Land appeared in 2001. In 2003, Smith wrote a 2000-word history of the Iraq War for Harper's Magazine lifted entirely from verbatim statements by Bush administration officials. In 2004, Smith stopped publishing the Progressive Review in hard copy edition, continuing Undernews in email format with regular updates to his website. In its current form, Undernews consists of an entertaining and idiosyncratic selection of news excerpts from a wide variety of sources together with pithy commentaries by Smith himself.

For example, a deposit of US dollars held in a bank in London, would be considered eurocurrency, as the US dollar is deposited outside of its home market. The Euro- prefix does not refer exclusively to the \\"euro\\" currency or the \\"eurozone\\", as the term predates the creation of the euro. Instead, it can be applied to any combination of deposits in a foreign bank outside of its home market e.g. a deposit denominated in Japanese yen held in a Swiss bank is a Euroyen deposit. Eurocurrency is used for short-to-medium term financing by banks, multinational corporations, mutual funds, and hedge funds. Eurocurrency is generally seen as an attractive source of global funding due to its ease of convertibility between currencies as well as typically lower regulatory measures compared to sources of funding in domestic markets. Eurocurrency and Eurobond markets avoid domestic interest rate regulations, reserve requirements and other barriers to the free flow of capital. The relevance of eurocurrency deposits has been disputed over since its inception in the 1950s by notable economists including Ronald McKinnon , yet it remains a prevalent aspect of the global financial system.  History  = Background Information = The emergence of Eurocurrency is closely tied to the origins of the Eurodollar as it was the first type of Eurocurrency. Eurodollars began from large quantities of US dollar-denominated deposits being held in European , namely London, banks during the 1950s. Over several decades, economists have produced several explanations of how eurocurrency came about, why it occurred in London , and how London managed to maintain a competitive advantage in the market as eurocurrency expanded globally. Environmental and political factors commonly underpin most theories, influencing the decisions of nations during this period known as the Bretton Woods Era. The Bretton Woods Era spanned from 1944 to 1973 and saw national policymakers, notably those of Britain and the US, agree to a fixed or pegged exchange rate system. Under this system, national currencies were \\"pegged\\" against the US dollar which itself was now convertible into gold. This was done to promote freer world trade in response to a sharp decline in imports and exports after the 1930s financial crises and World War 2 (WW2). As a result, national governments had raised their barriers to trade in an attempt to boost their domestic performance, causing major declines in world trade. = Drivers of Eurocurrency in the 1950s = By mid-1955, US and foreign businesses and nations were regularly using Eurodollars to hold US-dollar balances or obtain US-dollar denominated loans outside of the US. The eurocurrency market was birthed organically from the rise of the Eurodollar. Ultimately, there was multiple causes for the rise of the Eurodollar which lead to the creation of Eurocurrency. Firstly, large holdings of US dollars entered Europe shortly after WW2. This was a result of the fixed exchange rate system that lead to more countries using US dollars for trade, as well as increased imports into the US itself from Europe. Moreover, the US provided economic aid to European nations after WW2 in the form of damage assistance under the US governments' Marshall Plan. Secondly, after WW2 communist governments including the Soviet Union and China transferred their holdings held in the US over to European banks. This is believed to have been done for two primary reasons; (1) over fears that US authorities will seize their assets, and (2) to accumulated goodwill with Eurobanks as a strategy to nurture a future source of loans and funding. Thirdly, the 1957 sterling crises forced the UK's strongest movement toward alignment with the Bretton Woods plan. Here, the Bank of England banned sterling-financed trade for non- sterling countries as a result of a sharp increase in the bank rate to 7%, compelling London-based banks to join the rest of the world and use dollars for trade. This alongside the demand for other types of eurocurrencies outside of their home markets lead to the innovation of the eurocurrency market. = Competitive Advantage of London = The inception of eurocurrency occurred in London with the introduction of the Eurodollar in 1955. Even after eurocurrency had expanded globally however, London maintained its position as the centre of the Eurodollar market which is still true of today. Economists provide disputed explanations for why London was able to gain and maintain this competitive advantage. Ronald McKinnon theorised that it was attributed to London's pre-existing foreign financing expertise retained from Britain's dominant trade history in the 19th Century and servings as the centre of the sterling when it was a major international currency. However, criticisms of this theory deemed it \\"rather static and deterministic\\" and lacking any archival evidence. McKinnon also emphasised the regulatory freedom provided to commercial banks in London by the Bank of England, aligning with recounts of the Treasury questioning whether financial institutions in London had excessive influence on decisions made by the Bank of England. Nonetheless, both the Treasury and Bank of England agreed that London should remain an important financial centre even after the sterling was no longer a major international currency. Therefore, imposing restrictive regulations would have been counterintuitive, leading to London's permissive environment. In reality, eurocurrency market centres in general enjoyed freedom from supply side restrictions such as reserve requirements and interest rate ceilings which allowed them, in particular London, to gain a competitive advantage by providing high and low rates of interest according to the class of the borrower and lender. Additionally, London's competitive advantage was enhanced by tight restrictions throughout the rest of Europe due to possible risks of \\"hot money\\", increased bank liquidity, and potential reliance on reserves in the case of bank runs. Currencies The four main Eurocurrencies are the US dollar, the Euro, the British pound and the Japanese yen; the currencies of the major economies of the world. = Eurocurrency Markets = A eurocurrency market is the money market for any currency deposited outside of its home market. The key participants in these markets includes banks, multinational corporations, mutual funds, and hedge funds. Eurocurrency markets are generally chosen as a source of finance over domestic banks for their ability to offer lower interest rates of borrowers and higher interest rates for lenders situationally. This because eurocurrency market have less regulatory requirements, tax laws, and typically no interest caps. Nonetheless, there are higher risks, particularly when banks experience periods of poor solvency which can lead to a run on the banks. There are several eurocurrency markets, with the two most widely used being the Eurodollar market and the Euroyen market. There are also various smaller eurocurrency markets including the Euroeuro market and the Europound market.  Eurodollar Market  The Eurodollar market involves holdings of US dollars outside of the jurisdiction of the US Central Bank. These holdings may arise via two primary ways. Firstly, from purchases of goods and services made in US dollars to suppliers who maintain European bank accounts - these suppliers may be European or non-European. Secondly, Eurodollar deposits arise from investments of US dollars in European banks, generally for more favourable returns on interest. Today, the Eurodollar market is the largest source of global funding for businesses and nations, estimated to be financing over 90% of international trade deals. It is the most widely used eurocurrency. Accounting for approximately 75% of all eurocurrency accounts held worldwide. This prevalence is often attributed to economic and political factors. Firstly, the economic power of the US, particularly its influential position in the world economy and steady deterioration of the other currencies during the inception of Eurocurrency in the 1950s. Secondly, the lack of interest caps and limited regulation in the Eurodollar market enables favourable rates of interest for both lenders and borrowers.  Euroyen Market  The Euroyen market involves deposits of yen in banks outside the jurisdiction of the Japanese Central Bank. The market emerged in 1984, at the beginning of the Japanese asset price bubble that saw Japan pursue financial liberalisation and internalisation. During the 1990s, interest rates in Japan experienced substantial declines, making the relatively high rates of interest paid by Euroyen accounts attractive investments. Today Euruyen deposits are used by non-Japanese companies to efficiently obtain investments from Japanese investors. Euroyen bonds allow foreign companies to avoid the regulations enforced by the Bank of Japan (BoJ) and in bond registration with the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE).  Euroeuro Market  The Euroeuro market involves deposits of euros outside of the jurisdiction of the European Central Bank.  Europound Market  The Europound market involves deposits of British pounds outside of the jurisdiction of the Bank of England.  Eurocurrency Network  The concept of eurocurrency can have two implications. Firstly, it can be the accumulation of the all the currencies and banking facilities worldwide that are participating of the offshore banking network. This is not limited to the four eurocurrencies (US dollar, Euro, Yen, British Pound) or the home markets of those eurocurrencies. For example, a bank in Denmark that chooses to keep holdings of Swiss franc in London would also be considered a part of the eurocurrency network. Secondly, it can refer to the sum of all the technologies i.e. data processing and communication lines, used to enable stakeholders around the world to interact and participate in the eurocurrency market. Eurocurrency marks function within the global financial system with market centres spread across the global. Therefore, powerful financial technologies and information systems are required to connect market centres to enable communications and transactions to occur. For example, technologies such as high-speed communication lines link market centres enabling fast eurobanking transactions, and also giving rise to the overnight market.  Regulations and Domestic Policy  = Regulatory History = In the 1970s, regulating the eurocurrency market became a key priority for policymakers globally. This was because the growth of Eurodollars forced domestic banks to participate in offshore banking in order to stay competitive against rapidly growing foreign banks. Offshore banking allowed domestic banks to avoid the rising costs and restrictions resulting from national banking regulations. National governments struggled to monitor money supply and accurately predict economic outcomes in the global financial system due to unregulated and regulated financial markets existing in parallel. Since this realisation, governments have attempted various regulatory measures such as imposing reserve requirements, ceilings on interest rates and extending supervisory authority into the unregulated eurocurrency market. Overall, critics today maintain that regulation in offshore banking as a whole remains largely insufficient.  Usage of Reserve Requirements  Reserve requirements refer to a particular predetermined amount of cash which banks must have on- hand for the purpose of meeting liabilities in the case of sudden withdrawals. In the case of eurocurrency, this is a crucial regulatory measure with the high risk of bank runs. Typically, the central banks of individual nations enforce reserve requirements for its commercial banks. For example, the US central bank - The Federal Reserve, requires commercial banks to retain money in reserves against their commitments to depositors under the Monetary Control Act 1980. However, little progress has been made in imposing reserve requirements on eurocurrency deposits as nations continually fail to reach consensus over eurocurrency reserve amounts. Thus, it is the extension of national reserve requirements to the eurocurrency markets that has some level of mitigation between eurocurrency deposits and domestic bank balances. = Eurocurrency and Interest Rates = A key attraction for eurocurrency deposits are favourable interest rates for both lenders and borrowers relative to domestic interest rates. However, studies including the Granger causality test show that the ‚Äústickiness‚Äù of eurocurrency interest rates only exists with respect to the Eurodollar market. Interest rates for other eurocurrencies often move in parallel with corresponding domestic interest rates, seen as a control used by national governments to limit international capital flows. Eurobanks A eurobank is a financial institution anywhere in the world which accepts deposits or makes loans in any foreign currency.Definition of 'Eurobank' Eurocredits Eurocredit is a loan whose denominated currency is not the lending bank's national currency. A eurocredit loan would be made by a U.S. bank to a lender requiring a denominated currency which differs from the bank's local currency (USD) for specific reasons, most likely some sort of business operations or trade requirements. Despite the inclusion of the word \\"euro,\\" a eurocredit is not immediately derived from the euro. Definition of 'Eurocredit' Eurocredits are short-to-medium-term loans of Eurocurrency extended by Eurobanks to corporations, sovereign governments, nonprime banks, or international organizations. The loans are denominated in currencies other than the home currency of the Eurobank. Because these loans are frequently too large for a single bank to handle, Eurobanks will band together to form a bank lending syndicate to share the risk. The credit risk on these loans is greater than on loans to other banks in the interbank market. Thus, the interest rate on Eurocredits must compensate the bank, or banking syndicate, for the added credit risk. On Eurocredits originating in London the base lending rate is LIBOR. The lending rate on these credits is stated as LIBOR +X percent, where X is the lending margin charged depending upon the creditworthiness of the borrower. Additionally, rollover pricing was created on Eurocredits so that Eurobanks do not end up paying more on Eurocurrency time deposits than they earn from the loans. Thus, a Eurocredit may be viewed as a series of short-term loans, where at the end of each time period (generally three or six months), the loan is rolled over and the base lending rate is repriced to current LIBOR over the next time interval of the loan.

The current (as of 2013) devices are referred to as \\"combination type.\\" An arc-fault circuit interrupter (AFCI) also known as an arc-fault detection device (AFDD) is a circuit breaker that breaks the circuit when it detects an electric arc in the circuit it protects to prevent electrical fires. An AFCI selectively distinguishes between a harmless arc (incidental to normal operation of switches, plugs, and brushed motors), and a potentially dangerous arc (that can occur, for example, in a lamp cord which has a broken conductor). AFCI breakers have been required for circuits feeding electrical outlets in residential bedrooms by the electrical codes of Canada and the United States since the beginning of the 21st century; the U.S. National Electrical Code has required them to protect most residential outlets since 2014,2014 NEC(210.12) and the Canadian Electrical Code has since 2015. In parts of the world using 230 V, where the higher voltage implies lower currents, specifically Western Europe and the UK, adoption is slower, and their use is optional, except in high risk cases. In the US, arc faults are one of the leading causes for residential electrical fires. Each year in the United States, over 40,000 fires are attributed to home electrical wiring. These fires result in over 350 deaths and over 1,400 injuries each year.Ault, Singh, and Smith, \\"1996 Residential Fire Loss Estimates\\", October 1998, U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, Directorate for Epidemiology and Health Sciences. Conventional circuit breakers only respond to overloads and short circuits, so they do not protect against arcing conditions that produce erratic, and often reduced current. AFCIs are devices designed to protect against fires caused by arcing faults in the home electrical wiring. The AFCI circuitry continuously monitors the current and discriminates between normal and unwanted arcing conditions. Once detected, the AFCI opens its internal contacts, thus de-energizing the circuit and reducing the potential for a fire to occur.Source:\\"Arc Fault Circuit Interrupter (AFCI)FACT SHEET\\" accessed from http://www.cpsc.gov/CPSCPUB/PUBS/afcifac8.PDF , July 22, 2010 Operating principle The electronics inside an AFCI breaker detect electrical current alternating at characteristic frequencies, usually around 100 kHz, known to be associated with wire arcing, which are sustained for more than a few milliseconds. A combination AFCI breaker provides protection against parallel arcing (line to neutral), series arcing (a loose, broken, or otherwise high resistance segment in a single line), ground arcing (from line, or neutral, to ground), overload protection and short circuit protection. The AFCI will open the circuit if dangerous arcing is detected. When installed as the first outlet on a branch circuit, AFCI receptacles provide series arc protection for the entire branch circuit. They also provide parallel arc protection for the branch circuit starting at the AFCI receptacle. Unlike AFCI breakers, AFCI receptacles may be used on any wiring system regardless of the panel. Electrical code requirements =US and Canada= Starting with the 1999 version of the National Electrical Code in the United States, and the 2002 version of the Canadian Electrical Code in Canada, the national codes require AFCIs in all circuits that feed outlets in bedrooms of dwelling units. As of the 2014 NEC, AFCI protection is required on all branch circuits supplying outlets or devices installed in dwelling unit kitchens, along with the 2008 NEC additions of family rooms, dining rooms, living rooms, parlors, libraries, dens, bedrooms, sunrooms, recreation rooms, closets, hallways, laundry areas, and similar rooms and areas. They are also required in dormitory units. This requirement may be accomplished by using a \\"combination type\\" breaker‚Äîa specific kind of circuit-breaker defined by UL 1699‚Äîin the breaker panel that provides combined arc-fault and overcurrent protection or by using an AFCI receptacle for modifications/extensions, as replacement receptacles or in new construction, at the first outlet on the branch. Not all U.S. jurisdictions have adopted the NEC's AFCI requirements so it is important to check local code requirements. The AFCI is intended to prevent fire from arcs. AFCI circuit breakers are designed to meet one of two standards as specified by UL 1699: \\"branch\\" type or \\"combination\\" type (note: the Canadian Electrical Code uses different terminology but similar technical requirements). A branch type AFCI trips on 75 amperes of arcing current from the line wire to either the neutral or ground wire. A combination type adds series arcing detection to branch type performance. Combination type AFCIs trip on 5 amperes of series arcing. AFCI receptacles are an alternative solution to AFCI breakers. These receptacles are designed to address the dangers associated with both types of potentially hazardous arcing: parallel and series. AFCI receptacles offer the benefit of localized test and reset with such buttons located on the face of the device. This can save a journey to the breaker panel but can also encourage simply resetting by a user without investigating the underlying fault, as would presumably happen if someone with access to the electrical panel was notified. In 2002, the NEC removed the word \\"receptacle\\", leaving \\"outlets\\", with the effect that lights and other wired-in devices such as ceiling fans within bedrooms were added to the requirement. The 2005 code made it clearer that all outlets must be protected despite discussion in the code- making panel about excluding bedroom smoke detectors from the requirement. \\"Outlets\\" as defined in the NEC includes receptacles, light fixtures and smoke alarms, among other things. Basically, any point where AC electricity is used to power something is an outlet. As of January 2008, only \\"combination type\\" AFCIs meet the NEC requirement. The 2008 NEC requires the installation of combination-type AFCIs in all 15 and 20 ampere residential circuits with the exception of laundries, kitchens, bathrooms, garages, and unfinished basements, though many of these require GFCI protection. The 2014 NEC adds kitchens and laundry rooms to the list of rooms requiring AFCI circuitry, as well as any devices (such as lighting) requiring protection. =United Kingdom= In the UK, the Wiring Regulations 18th edition (BS 7671:2018) is the first edition to make any mention of arc fault devices, and indicate they may be installed if the design has an unusually high risk of fire from arc faults. The annexes relating to testing indicate than when AFDDs are installed, their correct operation must be verified before completion, but the method of testing is not described. This is in contrast to RCDs where a number of trip times at different fault current levels must be verified. =Germany= The German Wiring rules VDE 100, recommend AFDDs for high risk situations, and lists elderly care homes, community centres and kindergartens as examples. Limitations AFCIs are designed to protect against fires caused by electrical arc faults. While the sensitivity of the AFCIs helps in the detection of arc faults, these breakers can also indicate false positives by identifying normal circuit behaviors as arc faults. For instance, lightning strikes provide voltage and current profiles that resemble arc faults, and vacuum cleaners and some laser printers trip AFCIs. This nuisance tripping reduces the overall effectiveness of AFCIs. Research into advancements in this area is being pursued.Stephenson, James, Ph.D. \\"Eliminating False Positives in the Detection and Location of sub 3ms Faults on AC/DC Lines \\" presented at the 2011 Aircraft Airworthiness & Sustainment Conference on April 19, 2011. AFCIs are also known to be sensitive (false tripping) to the presence of radio frequency energy, especially within the so-called high frequency spectrum (3-30 MHz) which include legitimate Citizens Band and Amateur Radio operations. Sensitivities and mitigation have been known since 2013. AFCI circuit breakers include a standard inverse-time circuit breaker but provide no specific protection against glowing connections also known as a high resistance connection, high line voltages or low line voltages. An AFCI does not detect high line voltage due to an open neutral in a multiwire branch circuit. A multiwire branch circuit has both energized wires of a 120-240 V split phase service. If the neutral is broken, devices connected from a 120 V leg to the neutral may experience excess voltage, up to twice normal. AFCIs do not detect low line voltage. Low line voltage can cause electromechanical relays to repeatedly turn off and on. If current is flowing through the load contacts it causes arcing across the contacts as they open. The arcing can oxidize, pit and melt the contacts. This process can increase the contact resistance, superheat the relay and lead to fires. Power fault circuit interrupters are designed to prevent fires from low voltage across loads. Interference with power line networking AFCIs may interfere with the operation of some power line communication technologies.

The other novels in the Johnny Maxwell Trilogy are Only You Can Save Mankind (1992) and Johnny and the Bomb (1996). In this story, Johnny sees and speaks with the spirits (they object to the term \\"ghost\\") of those interred in his local cemetery and tries to help them when their home is threatened. Johnny and the Dead is a feature of some schools' English curriculum. Plot summary The story starts with Johnny Maxwell, a twelve-year-old boy, taking a shortcut through the local Blackbury cemetery to reach his home. In the cemetery, Johnny meets the spirit of Alderman Thomas Bowler and realizes that he can interact with the spirits of the dead. Later, Johnny meets all the deceased occupants of the cemetery and discusses with them the council's sale of Blackbury's neglected cemetery to a faceless conglomerate, who plan to build offices on it. Various dead citizens, led by a former town councillor, ask Johnny to help stop it. While Johnny (helped by his semi-believing friends) tries to find evidence of famous internees and speaks out at community meetings, the dead begin to take an interest in modern-day life and realise they are not, as they once believed, trapped in the cemetery. Finally the council is forced to back down, but the dead are no longer interested; they have decided that instead of waiting for the Day of Judgement, they will make the decision themselves. Most of them depart the cemetery to continue their journey into the afterlife but, thanks to the campaigning of the Blackbury Volunteers, the town's living residents have rediscovered the cemetery as a link to their past. As one of the dead puts it before leaving: \\"The living must remember, and the dead must forget.\\" Ideas and themes The book is loosely based on real events in Westminster in the 1980s, when the council sold three cemeteries as building land for 15p (Pratchett was working as a journalist at this time). Part of the story deals with the last surviving member of the Blackbury pals, a Pals battalion with obvious parallel to the Accrington Pals. This gentleman is called Tommy Atkins, the name given to the generic British soldier of the day. A running joke in the book is that most of the Dead are \\"nearly famous\\", often being recognisable as very similar to a famous Briton. It is possible that Pratchett intends Blackbury Cemetery to be \\"nearly Highgate\\", especially as one of the most prominent ghosts (William Stickers) is described as \\"The man who would have invented communism if Karl Marx hadn't.\\" Adaptations * The book was made into a TV serial for Children's ITV on ITV in 1995. It starred Andrew Falvey as Johnny, and featured Brian Blessed as William Stickers and George Baker as Alderman Bowler. * It was also adapted as a play by Stephen Briggs.

For instance, the vertices of the graph may represent tasks to be performed, and the edges may represent constraints that one task must be performed before another; in this application, a topological ordering is just a valid sequence for the tasks. A topological ordering is possible if and only if the graph has no directed cycles, that is, if it is a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Any DAG has at least one topological ordering, and algorithms are known for constructing a topological ordering of any DAG in linear time. Topological sorting has many applications especially in ranking problems such as feedback arc set.  Examples  The canonical application of topological sorting is in scheduling a sequence of jobs or tasks based on their dependencies. The jobs are represented by vertices, and there is an edge from x to y if job x must be completed before job y can be started (for example, when washing clothes, the washing machine must finish before we put the clothes in the dryer). Then, a topological sort gives an order in which to perform the jobs. A closely related application of topological sorting algorithms was first studied in the early 1960s in the context of the PERT technique for scheduling in project management. In this application, the vertices of a graph represent the milestones of a project, and the edges represent tasks that must be performed between one milestone and another. Topological sorting forms the basis of linear-time algorithms for finding the critical path of the project, a sequence of milestones and tasks that controls the length of the overall project schedule. In computer science, applications of this type arise in instruction scheduling, ordering of formula cell evaluation when recomputing formula values in spreadsheets, logic synthesis, determining the order of compilation tasks to perform in makefiles, data serialization, and resolving symbol dependencies in linkers. It is also used to decide in which order to load tables with foreign keys in databases. { left  The graph shown to the left has many valid topological sorts, including: * 5, 7, 3, 11, 8, 2, 9, 10 (visual top-to-bottom, left-to-right) * 3, 5, 7, 8, 11, 2, 9, 10 (smallest- numbered available vertex first) * 5, 7, 3, 8, 11, 10, 9, 2 (fewest edges first) * 7, 5, 11, 3, 10, 8, 9, 2 (largest-numbered available vertex first) * 5, 7, 11, 2, 3, 8, 9, 10 (attempting top-to-bottom, left-to-right) * 3, 7, 8, 5, 11, 10, 2, 9 (arbitrary) }  Algorithms  The usual algorithms for topological sorting have running time linear in the number of nodes plus the number of edges, asymptotically, O(\\\\left{V}\\\\right + \\\\left{E}\\\\right). =Kahn's algorithm= One of these algorithms, first described by , works by choosing vertices in the same order as the eventual topological sort. First, find a list of \\"start nodes\\" which have no incoming edges and insert them into a set S; at least one such node must exist in a non-empty acyclic graph. Then: L ‚Üê Empty list that will contain the sorted elements S ‚Üê Set of all nodes with no incoming edge while S is not empty do remove a node n from S add n to L for each node m with an edge e from n to m do remove edge e from the graph if m has no other incoming edges then insert m into S if graph has edges then return error (graph has at least one cycle) else return L (a topologically sorted order) If the graph is a DAG, a solution will be contained in the list L (the solution is not necessarily unique). Otherwise, the graph must have at least one cycle and therefore a topological sort is impossible. Reflecting the non-uniqueness of the resulting sort, the structure S can be simply a set or a queue or a stack. Depending on the order that nodes n are removed from set S, a different solution is created. A variation of Kahn's algorithm that breaks ties lexicographically forms a key component of the Coffman‚ÄìGraham algorithm for parallel scheduling and layered graph drawing. =Depth-first search= An alternative algorithm for topological sorting is based on depth-first search. The algorithm loops through each node of the graph, in an arbitrary order, initiating a depth-first search that terminates when it hits any node that has already been visited since the beginning of the topological sort or the node has no outgoing edges (i.e. a leaf node): L ‚Üê Empty list that will contain the sorted nodes while exists nodes without a permanent mark do select an unmarked node n visit(n) function visit(node n) if n has a permanent mark then return if n has a temporary mark then stop (not a DAG) mark n with a temporary mark for each node m with an edge from n to m do visit(m) remove temporary mark from n mark n with a permanent mark add n to head of L Each node n gets prepended to the output list L only after considering all other nodes which depend on n (all descendants of n in the graph). Specifically, when the algorithm adds node n, we are guaranteed that all nodes which depend on n are already in the output list L: they were added to L either by the recursive call to visit() which ended before the call to visit n, or by a call to visit() which started even before the call to visit n. Since each edge and node is visited once, the algorithm runs in linear time. This depth-first- search-based algorithm is the one described by ; it seems to have been first described in print by . =Parallel algorithms= On a parallel random-access machine, a topological ordering can be constructed in O(log2 n) time using a polynomial number of processors, putting the problem into the complexity class NC2 . One method for doing this is to repeatedly square the adjacency matrix of the given graph, logarithmically many times, using min-plus matrix multiplication with maximization in place of minimization. The resulting matrix describes the longest path distances in the graph. Sorting the vertices by the lengths of their longest incoming paths produces a topological ordering . An algorithm for parallel topological sorting on distributed memory machines parallelizes the algorithm of Kahn for a DAG G = (V, E). On a high level, the algorithm of Kahn repeatedly removes the vertices of indegree 0 and adds them to the topological sorting in the order in which they were removed. Since the outgoing edges of the removed vertices are also removed, there will be a new set of vertices of indegree 0, where the procedure is repeated until no vertices are left. This algorithm performs D+1 iterations, where is the longest path in . Each iteration can be parallelized, which is the idea of the following algorithm. In the following it is assumed that the graph partition is stored on processing elements (PE) which are labeled 0, \\\\dots, p-1. Each PE initializes a set of local vertices Q_i^1 with indegree 0, where the upper index represents the current iteration. Since all vertices in the local sets Q_0^1, \\\\dots, Q_{p-1}^1 have indegree 0, i.e. they are not adjacent, they can be given in an arbitrary order for a valid topological sorting. To assign a global index to each vertex, a prefix sum is calculated over the sizes of Q_0^1, \\\\dots, Q_{p-1}^1. So each step, there are \\\\sum_{i=0}^{p-1} Q_i vertices added to the topological sorting. Execution of the parallel topological sorting algorithm on a DAG with two processing elements. In the first step, PE assigns the indices \\\\sum_{i=0}^{j-1} Q_i^1, \\\\dots, \\\\left(\\\\sum_{i=0}^{j} Q_i^1\\\\right) - 1 to the local vertices in Q_j^1. These vertices in Q_j^1 are removed, together with their corresponding outgoing edges. For each outgoing edge (u, v) with endpoint in another PE l, j eq l, the message (u, v) is posted to PE . After all vertices in Q_j^1 are removed, the posted messages are sent to their corresponding PE. Each message (u, v) received updates the indegree of the local vertex . If the indegree drops to zero, is added to Q_j^2. Then the next iteration starts. In step , PE assigns the indices a_{k-1} + \\\\sum_{i=0}^{j-1} Q_i^k, \\\\dots, a_{k-1} + \\\\left(\\\\sum_{i=0}^{j} Q_i^k\\\\right) - 1, where a_{k-1}is the total amount of processed vertices after step . This procedure repeats until there are no vertices left to process, hence \\\\sum_{i=0}^{p-1} Q_i^{D+1} = 0. Below is a high level, single program, multiple data pseudo code overview of this algorithm. Note that the prefix sum for the local offsets a_{k-1} + \\\\sum_{i=0}^{j-1} Q_i^k, \\\\dots, a_{k-1} + \\\\left(\\\\sum_{i=0}^{j} Q_i^k\\\\right) - 1 can be efficiently calculated in parallel. p processing elements with IDs from 0 to p-1 Input: DAG, distributed to PEs, PE index j \\\\in \\\\\\\\{0, \\\\dots, p-1\\\\\\\\} Output: topological sorting of G function traverseDAGDistributed Œ¥ incoming degree of local vertices V Q = {v ‚àà V  Œ¥[v] = 0} _// All vertices with indegree 0_ nrOfVerticesProcessed = 0 do global build prefix sum over size of Q _// get offsets and total amount of vertices in this step_ offset = nrOfVerticesProcessed + \\\\sum_{i=0}^{j - 1} Q_i _// j is the processor index_ foreach localOrder[u] = index++; foreach do post message (u, v) to PE owning vertex v deliver all messages to neighbors of vertices in Q receive messages for local vertices V remove all vertices in Q foreach message (u, v) received: if --Œ¥[v] = 0 add v to Q while global size of Q > 0 return localOrder The communication cost depends heavily on the given graph partition. As for runtime, on a CRCW-PRAM model that allows fetch-and-decrement in constant time, this algorithm runs in \\\\mathcal{O} \\\\left(\\\\frac{m + n}{p} + D (\\\\Delta + \\\\log n)\\\\right), where is again the longest path in and the maximum degree. Application to shortest path finding The topological ordering can also be used to quickly compute shortest paths through a weighted directed acyclic graph. Let be the list of vertices in such a graph, in topological order. Then the following algorithm computes the shortest path from some source vertex to all other vertices: * Let be an array of the same length as ; this will hold the shortest-path distances from . Set , all other . * Let be an array of the same length as , with all elements initialized to . Each will hold the predecessor of in the shortest path from to . * Loop over the vertices as ordered in , starting from : ** For each vertex directly following (i.e., there exists an edge from to ): *** Let be the weight of the edge from to . *** Relax the edge: if , set **** , **** . On a graph of vertices and edges, this algorithm takes , i.e., linear, time. Uniqueness If a topological sort has the property that all pairs of consecutive vertices in the sorted order are connected by edges, then these edges form a directed Hamiltonian path in the DAG. If a Hamiltonian path exists, the topological sort order is unique; no other order respects the edges of the path. Conversely, if a topological sort does not form a Hamiltonian path, the DAG will have two or more valid topological orderings, for in this case it is always possible to form a second valid ordering by swapping two consecutive vertices that are not connected by an edge to each other. Therefore, it is possible to test in linear time whether a unique ordering exists, and whether a Hamiltonian path exists, despite the NP- hardness of the Hamiltonian path problem for more general directed graphs. Relation to partial orders Topological orderings are also closely related to the concept of a linear extension of a partial order in mathematics. In high-level terms, there is an adjunction between directed graphs and partial orders. A partially ordered set is just a set of objects together with a definition of the \\"‚â§\\" inequality relation, satisfying the axioms of reflexivity (x ‚â§ x), antisymmetry (if x ‚â§ y and y ‚â§ x then x = y) and transitivity (if x ‚â§ y and y ‚â§ z, then x ‚â§ z). A total order is a partial order in which, for every two objects x and y in the set, either x ‚â§ y or y ‚â§ x. Total orders are familiar in computer science as the comparison operators needed to perform comparison sorting algorithms. For finite sets, total orders may be identified with linear sequences of objects, where the \\"‚â§\\" relation is true whenever the first object precedes the second object in the order; a comparison sorting algorithm may be used to convert a total order into a sequence in this way. A linear extension of a partial order is a total order that is compatible with it, in the sense that, if x ‚â§ y in the partial order, then x ‚â§ y in the total order as well. One can define a partial ordering from any DAG by letting the set of objects be the vertices of the DAG, and defining x ‚â§ y to be true, for any two vertices x and y, whenever there exists a directed path from x to y; that is, whenever y is reachable from x. With these definitions, a topological ordering of the DAG is the same thing as a linear extension of this partial order. Conversely, any partial ordering on a finite set may be defined as the reachability relation in a DAG. One way of doing this is to define a DAG that has a vertex for every object in the partially ordered set, and an edge xy for every pair of objects for which x ‚â§ y. An alternative way of doing this is to use the transitive reduction of the partial ordering; in general, this produces DAGs with fewer edges, but the reachability relation in these DAGs is still the same partial order. By using these constructions, one can use topological ordering algorithms to find linear extensions of partial orders.

Brigadier Pedro de Rivera, who visited the northern presidios from 1724 to 1728, suggested to the viceroy Juan de Acu√±a, Marquis of Casafuerte, the political and administrative reorganization of the northwest provinces. The viceroy supported the idea, and it was approved by Philip V of Spain in 1732, and executed the following year with the appointment of the first governor, Manuel Bernal de Huidobro, at that time mayor of Sinaloa. In the branches of government, finance and war, the governor was directly subject to the viceroy, while the field of justice was under the jurisdiction of the Royal Audience of Guadalajara (Real Audiencia of Guadalajara) of the Viceroyalty of New Spain. By 1806, the province was generally recognized as Sonora or Nueva Navarra, with the capital in Arispe, and including the area comprising Sinaloa (de Iriarte, 1806). After Independence Sonora y Sinaloa became one of the constituent states of the Mexican Republic. The Sonoran Desert ecoregion covers much of the state. In the early years of European migration to Nueva Navarra, the Basques became a significant proportion of the population. The Basque immigrants reached 6% of total migrants in the first 15 years of colonization, the same percentage as those from the Castile or Extremadura, most populated regions. More specific data shows ratios between 8% and 16% of Basques in the nuclei urban settlements of those first decades, indicating a trend which would persist in the future: the Basque-Navarre preference for urban settlement (Boyde-Bowman, 1964).

Their music is typically cinematic, epic, symphonic, progressive and darker than typical power metal with symphonic influences. They have released five full-length albums. Biography Guitarist Simone Campione and Thy Majestie live at Fear Dark Festival, 2008. The band was started by Giuseppe Bond√¨ and Claudio Diprima with the desire to create their own music after playing in a cover band. Maurizio Malta, Giovanni Santini, Dario D'Alessandro and Dario Grillo joined them to form Thy Majestie. After releasing Sword, Crown and Shields, a 3-track demo, Thy Majestie composed new material which was recorded in March 1999 titled Perpetual Glory. It was highly praised by Italian metal magazines and they were able to sign a contract with Scarlet Records. In March 2000 they began working on their debut album The Lasting Power which was finished in April 2000. On September 2001 LIMB Music (who produced Rhapsody of Fire) took notice of Thy Majestie but could not sign a deal with them because they were already signed to Scarlet Music to record two albums. In January 2002 Thy Majestie was contacted by Thomas Youngblood to support him on his European tour with his band Kamelot but they could not afford travel expenses and had to record another album 2 months later. In 2002, they released the album Hastings 1066 which is based on the Battle of Hastings. In November 2003, vocalist Dario Grillo left the band to pursue a solo career (as leader of the band Platens). In December 2003, Gabriele Grilli (who has also played in Doomsword) joined as his replacement. But in October 2004 he left as well \\"due to personal reasons\\", one of them being the distance between Grilli's hometown, Varese, and Palermo, where the other members of the band live. One song was released with Gabriele on vocals, namely a demo version of The Siege of Paris, later to appear on the Jeanne d'Arc album. Shortly thereafter, Giulio Di Gregorio (also in Irencros) was announced as the new singer. 2005 saw the release of the third Thy Majestie album, Jeanne d'Arc, which is a concept album about the French heroine Jeanne d'Arc. The album was released through Scarlet Records. Its style has been compared to that of the Italian band Labyrinth. The 3 of May 2005, Giulio Di Gregorio was expelled from the band due to his poor knowledge of the English language and his numerous health problems which kept him from performing live with the band. After a short period when USA-based singer Matt Aub (from Timelord) had been singing for the band, it was announced that Thy Majestie's first vocalist, Dario Grillo would be returning to the band. His return, however, caused the same problems experienced four years earlier and lead to a definitive separation. Dario Grillo was replaced by Fingerbang singer Dario Cascio. At the same time guitarist Giovanni Santini decided to leave the band and was replaced by Simone Campione. During the end of year 2007, the other founding member, Giuseppe Bondi, left Thy Majestie due to personal reasons. A new keyboarder, Valerio Castorino, was taken in and the band signed with a new record label, Dark Balance Records. Thy Majestie performed at the Immortal Metal Fest in Finland on 19 April 2008 as well as at Fear Dark in Zwolle, the Netherlands on 24 May 2008 and in Stuttgart, Germany on 1 June 2008. The group released the album Dawn on 1 September 2008, which has been compared to the Swedish metal scene, namely Axenstar and Dragonland. Valerio Castorino, who toured with Thy Majestie during their last gigs in Europe, and Dario Cascio left the band because of private matters. Giuseppe Carrubba, who also plays with Inner Quest, an Italian Progressive metal band, and Alessio Taormina replaced him.

A related observation is that the window of opportunity for doing this may be limited due to the decreasing amount of surplus resources that will be available over time as a result of an ever- growing population. (UK title: Our Final Century) The earliest appearance of a connection between space exploration and human survival appears in Louis J. Halle, Jr.'s 1980 article in Foreign Affairs, in which he stated colonization of space will keep humanity safe should global nuclear warfare occur. This idea has received more attention in recent years as advancing technology in the form of reusable launch vehicles and combination launch systems make affordable space travel more feasible. Risk to humanity With space and human survival comes risk to the human species. A severe event in the future is one that could cause human extinction which is also known as an existential risk. Humanity's long track record of surviving natural hazards suggests that, measured on a timescale of a couple of centuries, the existential risk posed by such hazards is rather small. Nevertheless, researchers have experienced an obstacle in studying human extinction as humanity has actually never been diminished during all of recorded history. Although this does not mean that it will not be in the future with natural existential scenarios such as: Meteor impact and large-scale volcanism; and anthropogenic events like global warming and catastrophic climate change, or even global nuclear warfare. Many of the same existential risks to humanity would destroy parts or all of Earth's biosphere as well. And although many have speculated about life and intelligence existing in other parts of space, Earth is the only place in the universe known to harbor life. Eventually the Earth will be uninhabitable, at the latest when the Sun becomes a red giant in about 5 billion years. Mankind, or its intelligent descendants, if they still exist at that point, then has to leave the Solar System long before that to ensure survival of the human species. Space settlement Human extinction can be prevented by improving the physical barrier or increasing the mean distance between people and the potential extinction event. For example, pandemics are controlled by placing exposed people in quarantine and evacuating healthy people away. The human lineage of genus Homo has reduced from several species co-existing on Earth to just one ‚Äî all others became extinct before the end of the last Ice age. This illustrates that Homo sapiens is not immune to planetary disaster and that human survival may be better assured through the colonization of space. Although space colonies do not yet exist, humans have had a continuous space presence since 2000 due to the International Space Station. Life support systems that enable people to live in space may also allow them to survive hazardous events. =Multiple locations= Expanding the living area of the human species increases the mean distance between humans and any known hazardous event. People closest to the event are most likely to be killed or injured; people farthest from the event are most likely to survive. Increasing the number of places where humans live also helps to prevent extinction. For example, if a massive impact event occurred on Earth without warning, the human species could possibly become extinct; its art, culture and technology would be lost. However, if humans had previously colonized locations outside Earth, the opportunities for the survival and recovery of the species would be greater. =Objections= Many problems can occur when travelling in outer space. One of the biggest issues that may affect the human body is interstellar radiation. While the Earth's magnetic field and atmosphere protects all living forms on the planet, this cannot be said for outer space. According to researchers from the University of Rochester Medical Center, a radiation equivalent to a mission to Mars can cause serious brain damage such as cognition problems and Alzheimer's disease. Space science The observation and study of space protects Earth, as space hazards can be seen in advance and, if discovered early enough, acted against. =Near-Earth objects= Near-Earth objects (NEOs) are asteroids, comets and large meteoroids that come close to or collide with Earth. Spaceguard is the collective name for some of the efforts to discover and study NEOs, though these efforts are not sufficiently funded. Critique Some more contemporary reasons for space as a solution to survival have been identified as imperialist reasoning for space exploration, only relocating collective shortcomings and not solving them.

Also known as the Kingston Clan, Kingston Group, or The Order, it evolved from the Davis County Cooperative Society, though not all members of the latter became members of the church.Utah Attorney General's Office and Arizona Attorney General's Office. The Primer, Helping Victims of Domestic Violence and Child Abuse in Polygamous Communities . Updated June 2006. Page 23. There are approximately 3,500 members of this group. It is notable for being one of the few Mormon denominations that still practices polygamy. Establishment According to his autobiography, Charles W. Kingston became disenchanted with The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) in 1926 because of its abandonment of plural marriage. Kingston began preaching polygamy amongst fellow members of the LDS Church as well as distributing pamphlets and the book, Laman Manasseh Victorious: A Message of Salvation and Redemption to His People Israel, First to Ephraim and Manasseh, which he had co-written. This eventually resulted in his excommunication from the LDS Church in 1929. By 1935, his followers began moving to Bountiful, Utah, with the intention to live under a United Order communalist program as defined by Joseph Smith in the Doctrine and Covenants. On February 7, 1941, the community founded by Elden Kingston officially declared themselves the Davis County Cooperative Society Inc. The corporation produces goods and services that are used by members, and sold or traded to other cooperatives and to the public.Articles of Incorporation of the Davis County Cooperative Society, 7 February 1941. As found in: In 1977, Elden's brother Ortell Kingston began to file for legal recognition of the church later organized as The Latter Day Church of Christ.Utah business entity number 561222-0140. The Latter Day Church of Christ is based in Salt Lake City, Utah, with a presence in Bountiful, Utah. Finances Over the decades, the Cooperative has maintained extreme secrecy while developing an extensive cooperative system with assets at an unconfirmed value of over $150 million. His information source was an interview with \\"Jane Doe Kingston,\\" a member of the clan. Their secrecy comes from a fear of arrest for living in plural marriages, which originated in 1959‚Äì1960 when being investigated by the Davis County Grand Jury, which they claim was organized by LDS Apostles Mark E. Peterson and Spencer W. Kimball. Financial holdings include: a dairy farm in Davis County; a farm in Tetonia, Idaho; a coal mine in Emery County; in Terreton, Idaho; a cattle ranch and a discount store; Desert Tech Firearms; Washakie Renewable Energy; a grocery store; and a restaurant supply in many western cities including Tucson, Phoenix, Denver, Las Vegas, Boise, and Portland. J. Ortell Kingston aggressively pursued a financially expansive agenda for the Davis County Cooperative Society Inc. Beliefs The Davis County Cooperative Society claims to maintain the original beliefs and teachings of Joseph Smith. It began the practice of plural marriage shortly before the establishment of the cooperative. Members of the Latter Day Church of Christ are also members of the Davis County Cooperative Society (a separate legal entity) which practices the law of consecration and United Order. During the first years of the Davis County Cooperative Society, Kingston and his followers wore unique outer garments that led to people referring to them as \\"blue-coats.\\" Men and boys wore blue coverall-type suits tied with strings; women and girls wore plain blue dresses. As a symbol of their renunciation of worldly goods, the outer clothing contained no pockets in which possessions could be carried, although later an inside pocket was provided for the sanitary measure of carrying a handkerchief. All went bareheaded and barefoot. The community practices plural marriage. One long time leader, Ortell Kingston, encouraged marriage of close relatives in an effort to improve the genetic profile of the group. Some of these marriages were considered incestuous, according to the laws of the state of Utah. Following the teaching of Brigham Young who on January 27, 1860, said \\"I am a God to this people and so is any man who is appointed to lead Israel or the kingdom of God\\", Charles W. Kingston taught that \\"Every individual ... no matter what authority, standing, or station he is in, is responsible to the one above him in exactly the same way as if that individual was the Savior himself .... We must look at the one above us in the same light as we look at the Savior.\\", spelling and punctuation standardized. This doctrine is known as the Law of One-above-another. (See the Book of Abraham Chapter 3, from the Pearl of Great Price as produced by Joseph Smith, as well as ) According to a 2011 document prepared by the Attorneys General of the states of Utah and Arizona, the church describes itself as emphasizing family values, education, and self-sufficiency, and that every child is a priceless blessing. Children are allowed to attend public school and many go on to college. Controversies =Intra-family marriages= The church's theories on genetics, that could be used to \\"purify\\" the Kingston-family pedigree, were reportedly developed at the Kingston Dairy, owned by the co-op in Woods Cross, Davis County, Utah, and that use of these theories encouraged incestuous marriages of close relatives in order to \\"perfect\\" the Kingston bloodline. Those marriages, if proven, could be considered illegal under Utah's consanguinity laws. Connie Rugg, formerly one of Ortell's plural wives, stated: \\"Ortell Kingston experimented [with] inbreeding with his cattle, and then he turned to his children.\\" Some examples include: * LDCC member Jason Ortell Kingston married his half-sister Andrea Johnson, who became pregnant in 1992. She suffered from preeclampsia before being brought in for medical treatment. A C-section was performed to save the baby, but Andrea died. Utah state officials believe that obstetrical care was withheld because of the possibility that the incestuous relationship would be discovered. * Jeremy Ortell Kingston was sentenced to a year in prison in 2004 for having taken LuAnn Kingston, his cousin and aunt, as his fourth wife in 1994. At the time of marriage, Jeremy was 24, and LuAnn was 15. * LDCC member David Ortell Kingston married his 15-year-old niece Mary Ann Kingston, who attempted to run away but was apprehended and savagely beaten by her father, John Daniel Kingston. Mary counted 28 lashes before passing out. As found in: He was arrested and pleaded ‚Äúno contest‚Äù to the charge of child abuse and served seven months in jail. David O. Kingston was convicted of incest and unlawful sexual conduct and sentenced to a 10-year prison term, of which he only served four years. Mary Ann later filed a $110-million lawsuit against members of the Kingston Clan, alleging intentional sexual abuse of a child and intentional infliction of emotional distress, but the lawsuit did not hold up in court. =Child marriage= It is believed that the Latter Day Church of Christ briefly practiced child marriage of girls just attaining puberty, non-members and ex-members claiming that Kingston Clan leaders who claim a \\"pure bloodline\\" are given priority over almost any other members when choosing plural wives. It is believed by some that girls as young as 13 were coerced into marriage as new plural wives. However, Charles W. Kingston in his autobiography denied all of these claims stating: \\"...inferred in news paper clippings and in public utterances that the Davis County Cooperative Society was [g]uilty of 1 - Living off of Relief 2 - Marrying teen age girls, two of the worst practices that people as a whole condemned the most. The first charge...The Davis Co Cooperative Society records will show that more than fifty one % who joined, were taken off relief rolls and put in a position to make their own living; thus saving the Government and the State more than two hundred thousand dollars in relief money in the last 25 years. The second charge is just as absurd and unreasonable as the first.\\" =Financial fraud= Despite the wealth of the Kingston Clan leaders, plural wives have been found living in deplorable conditions. Often, wives' homes consisted of only small rundown clapboard houses with peeling paint and broken windows. Connie Rugg stated: \\"The men in the Kingston group do little or nothing to support their many wives and children\\". Sometimes wives will \\"go gardening,\\" scrounging through garbage cans to provide food for their children and themselves. The Latter Day Church of Christ has also been accused of engaging in welfare fraud and tax evasion.Salt Lake City Tribune, August 16 and 23, 1998, and January 1999. The members have larger families, which is typical of the older Mormon teachings. John Ortell Kingston was accused of tax evasion and fraudulently obtaining welfare by having his wives claim to be single mothers. Ortell's holdings were estimated at $70 million. In 1983, Utah sued Ortell Kingston for repayment of welfare subsidies his plural wives had received. While admitting no wrongdoing, Ortell paid the state $250,000 and the case was dropped. In 2016, the State of Utah with federal law enforcement raided various properties in connection with the Kingston family or Davis County Cooperative Society with the intention of finding welfare fraud. The State of Utah stated: \\"It was a specific investigation that we were approached by [federal law enforcement] to participate in.\\" However, after two years of investigating, they did not find any welfare fraud. \\"State investigators found no wrongdoing among members of the Davis County Cooperative Society, also known as the Kingston Group.\\" In July 2019, Jacob Kingston, Isaiah Kingston, and two others pled guilty to fraud related to $512 million of federal renewable-fuel tax credits taken since 2010 through a company named Washakie Renewable Energy LLC. One of the guilty pleas states they ‚Äúcycled‚Äù fraud proceeds through Order-related businesses and then back to Washakie‚Äôs bank accounts, falsely calling them loans or profits.

It was developed to meet a NATO specification, but Italy was initially the only NATO member to adopt the type. The United States purchased a small number of G.222s, designating them the C-27A Spartan.Donald (2000). p. 426.Frawley (2002). p. 44. A modernised variant, the Alenia C-27J Spartan, has been developed. While it retains many aspects of the original aircraft, the C-27J adopts the same engines and many of the systems used on the larger Lockheed Martin C-130J Super Hercules. Development =Origins= In 1962, NATO issued a specification for a V/STOL transport aircraft (NATO Basic Military Requirement 4), capable of supporting dispersed V/STOL fighters. Fiat's design team, led by Giuseppe Gabrielli, produced a design to meet this requirement, designated G.222; it was to be powered by two Rolls-Royce Dart turboprop engines and with six to eight Rolls-Royce RB162 lift engines to give VTOL capability.Air International April 1977, pp. 163‚Äì164. According to Aeritalia, the G.222 designation is derived from the first letter of the aircraft's chief designer; the first '2' referring to the twin-engine arrangement, and the final '22' referring to the revised NATO Basic Military Requirement 22 to which it had been submitted. None of the submissions resulted in a production contract; however the Italian Air Force (AMI), who was at the time seeking a replacement for the Fairchild C-119 Flying Boxcar, felt that the Fiat Aviazione proposal had merit, and placed an order for two prototypes and a ground-test airframe in 1968. The G.222 was substantially redeveloped from the NATO submission, the V/STOL lift engines having been omitted completely and the conventional Dart engines replaced by a pair of General Electric T64s;Air International April 1977, pp. 164, 166. the twin-boom tail featured on the V/STOL concept was also eliminated and replaced by a more conventional single tail configuration; subsequently the new aircraft had no V/STOL capability but retained considerable short take-off/landing (STOL) performance.Evangelisti, Spinoni and Jones 1999, p. A11-2. Fiat G.222TCM development aircraft exhibited at the 1977 Paris Air Show. On 18 July 1970, the first prototype performed the aircraft's maiden flight with test pilot Vittorio Sanseverino at the controls. By late April 1971, the prototype had reportedly conducted a total of 22 flights and accumulated 50 hours of flight time, during which its performance was claimed to have been highly close to predictions.Gilson 1971, p. 577. In December 1971, the Italian Air Force, who had placed a provisional order for the developing type, formally began evaluating the G.222 and the performance of the two prototypes then in service. Following a successful testing period, the AMI contract for 44 aircraft was issued to Aeritalia (of which Fiat Aviazione had since become a part).Air International April 1977, pp. 167‚Äì168. In December 1975, the first production aircraft conducted its first flight. In April 1978, this same aircraft formally entered service with the AMI. Following on from its introduction by the AMI, the G.222 was procured as a tactical transport aircraft by various international customers, including Argentina, Nigeria, Somalia, Venezuela and Thailand.Evangelisti, Spinoni and Jones 1999, p. A11-3. In December 1978, Aeritalia elected to transfer final assembly of the G.222 from Turin to Naples, at which point a total of 44 firm orders had been obtained for the type and one aircraft per month was being manufactured.\\"G.222.\\" Flight International, p. 2108. Manufacturing of the G.222 was broken down into various companies; construction of the fuselage was performed at Naples, the center-section of the wing was produced by Piaggio, the wing panels were made by Macchi, the tail surfaces were built by SIAI- Marchetti, the engine nacelles by IAM, and the T64 engines were license- manufactured by Alfa Romeo and Fiat. =Further development= A C-27A taxiing at McChord AFB, Washington, 1998 In 1977, Libya sought the purchase of 20 G.222s; this was vetoed by the U.S. Government, who had imposed an embargo on military arms and equipment to Libya, which included the G.222's T64 engines. To get around this restriction, Aeritalia developed a version of the G.222 powered by the Rolls-Royce Tyne engine and other US supplied equipment was replaced by European equivalents; the more powerful Tyne engine also reportedly gave this variant superior \\"hot and high\\" performance.Air International April 1979, pp. 170‚Äì173. The provision of alternative powerplants was viewed by Aeritalia as a measure to widen the overall appeal of the G.222; the Tyne engine also reportedly possessed greater growth potential than the T64 engine. In May 1980, the first G.222 equipped with the Tyne engine performed its maiden flight. Libya placed an order for 20 Tyne- powered aircraft instead, with deliveries commencing from 1980. In order to extend the effective operational lifespan of the type, some operators have carried out extensive upgrade programs of the G.222. In the aftermath of Italian humanitarian missions in Bosnia and Somalia, in 1996 the AMI began undertaking a major update program on their G.222 fleet; modifications include cockpit lighting changes for compatibility with Night Vision Goggles to enable night operations, increasing the aircraft's self-defense capabilities, new communications and navigation systems, and the removal of obsolete equipment. In July 2005, the Nigerian Air Force signed a $74.5 million contract with Alenia Aeronautica for the refurbishment of a total of five G.222s, as well as the purchase of a retired AMI G.222.Nkala, Oscar. \\"Nigerian Air Force takes delivery of 10 locally refurbished aircraft.\\" defenceweb.co.za, 13 September 2013. In 1990, the United States Air Force selected the G.222 as the basis of a \\"Rapid-Response Intra-Theater Airlifter\\" (RRITA). Operated under the designation C-27A Spartan, ten G.222s were purchased and underwent avionics upgrades by Chrysler Aerospace. These aircraft were stationed at Howard AFB, Panama.Donald and Lake 1996, p. 29. The USAF would later dispose of their C-27A fleet, partly due to shifting priorities between the Army and the Air Force and partly because of the impending introduction of a newer variant, the Alenia C-27J Spartan.McGowen 2012, p. 485. Design Italian Air Force Alenia G.222RM radio and radar calibration aircraft, 2005 The G.222 is a twin turboprop-engine tactical military transport aircraft, and is designed to be capable of transporting equipment or troops in combat zones and operating with minimal ground support. Early production aircraft were exclusively fitted with the General Electric T64-GE-P4D turboprop engine, the licence-built Rolls- Royce Tyne was made available as an alternative powerplant for the type from 1980 onwards, while the Allison T56 was another proposed powerplant for the type. Due to features such as double-slotted flaps, stacked brakes, and reversible propellers,Norton 2002, p. 6. the G.222 has excellent short landing capabilities and is able to land in as little as 1,800 feet.Schading 2011, p. 279. It was designed to be integrated with the larger, commonplace Lockheed C-130 Hercules. The G.222's cargo deck can carry up to 9,000 kg (19,840 lb) of cargo, or alternatively up to 53 troops, or 32 paratroopers, or a maximum of 36 stretchers with six attending medics in a medevac capacity. The cargo deck has a large rear ramp, allowing the loading of palletised goods and vehicles, as well as sliding doors on either side of the fuselage, which are capable of being used to deploy paratroopers.Evangelisti, Spinoni and Jones 1999, pp. A11-2. Various pallet-based special mission equipment could be readily installed to enhance the aircraft's capabilities for diverse roles such as VIP transport, maritime patrol, aerial firefighting, and calibration functions; this equipment could also be removed quickly in order for aircraft to be returned to conventional transport missions.\\"G.222.\\" Flight International, 9 December 1978. p. 2113. To easily facilitate the loading of a wide range of cargos, the height of the landing gear can be manually controlled.Girolami and Quadro 2006, p. 1‚Äì3. In part due to the austere maintenance requirements of the G.222 and its capability of operating from short unprepared airstrips in remote regions, it has seen heavy use for performing various humanitarian missions across Africa, East Asia, Europe and Central America. The cockpit provides excellent external visibility for pilots, most of the key controls are centrally placed between the two pilots, enabling the aircraft to be flown by a single pilot under certain circumstances. The standard G.222 is equipped with various avionics, such as a nose-mounted Doppler radar, navigational computers, radio systems, and a Rockwell Collins-built autopilot. Electronic receiver equipment and up to ten control consoles were installed upon a number of G.222s for performing electronic reconnaissance missions. Some aircraft were fitted with aerial refuelling probes and associated equipment. Some Italian G.222s have been equipped with a self-protection suite, which uses multiple forms of sensors to warn against identified threats, this suite also includes several countermeasures such as chaff and flare dispensers. Operational history Afghan Air Force C-27A, 2010 In 1978, the 98th Group of the 46th Transport Air Wing became the first squadron of the Italian Air Force to receive the G.222. The type was promptly placed into a support capacity, not only to the Italian Air force but also for humanitarian and civil protection. The G.222 has seen considerable service in air relief and military supply operations. From 1979 onwards, Italy, along with other Western nations, provided considerable military aid to Somalia, part of the Italian contribution was four G.222s.Humphrey 2007, p. 66. In 1982, three Ej√©rcito Argentino G.222s were operational during the Falklands War, and may have participated in a logistical capacity.Braybrook 1982, p. 8. In 1983, a single Italian Air Force G.222 was outfitted for fire suppression duties, alongside an existing C-130 in the same role.Tran Van Nao 1982, p. 121. On 3 September 1992, an Italian Air Force (Aeronautica Militare Italiana) G.222 was shot down when approaching Sarajevo airfield while conducting a United Nations relief mission. It crashed from the airfield; a NATO rescue mission was aborted when 2 USMC CH-53 helicopters came under small arms fire. The cause of the crash was determined to be a surface-to-air missile, but it was not clear who shot it. Everyone on board - four Italian crew members and four French passengers - died in the crash. Alenia G.222 at Pisa International Airport, 1981 In November 1999, the Italian Air Force placed an initial order for twelve new- build aircraft of an upgraded G.222 derivative, designated as the C-27J, as a replacement for their existing G.222s.\\"The Italian Air Force is to buy 12 C-27J Spartan medium tactical transport aircraft to replace its fleet of G.222 transports, becoming the first customer for the Lockheed Martin/Alenia Aerospazio C-27J\\".

Switchgrass is one of the dominant species of the central North American tallgrass prairie and can be found in remnant prairies, in native grass pastures, and naturalized along roadsides. It is used primarily for soil conservation, forage production, game cover, as an ornamental grass, in phytoremediation projects, fiber, electricity, heat production, for biosequestration of atmospheric carbon dioxide, and more recently as a biomass crop for ethanol and butanol. Other common names for switchgrass include tall panic grass, Wobsqua grass, blackbent, tall prairiegrass, wild redtop, thatchgrass, and Virginia switchgrass. Description Root system of switchgrass grown at the Land Institute Switchgrass is a hardy, deep-rooted, perennial rhizomatous grass that begins growth in late spring. It can grow up to high, but is typically shorter than big bluestem grass or indiangrass. The leaves are long, with a prominent midrib. Switchgrass uses C4 carbon fixation, giving it an advantage in conditions of drought and high temperature. Its flowers have a well-developed panicle, often up to 60 cm long, and it bears a good crop of seeds. The seeds are 3‚Äì6 mm long and up to 1.5 mm wide, and are developed from a single-flowered spikelet. Both glumes are present and well developed. When ripe, the seeds sometimes take on a pink or dull-purple tinge, and turn golden brown with the foliage of the plant in the fall. Switchgrass is both a perennial and self-seeding crop, which means farmers do not have to plant and reseed after annual harvesting. Once established, a switchgrass stand can survive for ten years or longer. Unlike corn, switchgrass can grow on marginal lands and requires relatively modest levels of chemical fertilizers. Overall, it is considered a resource-efficient, low-input crop for producing bioenergy from farmland. Habitat Much of North America, especially the prairies of the Midwestern United States, was once prime habitat to vast swaths of native grasses, including switchgrass, indiangrass (Sorghastrum nutans), eastern gamagrass (Tripsacum dactyloides), big bluestem (Andropogon gerardi), little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium) and others. As European settlers began spreading west across the continent, the native grasses were plowed under and the land converted to crops such as corn, wheat, and oats. Introduced grasses such as fescue, bluegrass, and orchardgrass also replaced the native grasses for use as hay and pasture for cattle.  Distribution  Switchgrass is a versatile and adaptable plant. It can grow and even thrive in many weather conditions, lengths of growing seasons, soil types, and land conditions. Its distribution spans south of latitude 55¬∞N from Saskatchewan to Nova Scotia, south over most of the United States east of the Rocky Mountains, and further south into Mexico. As a warm-season perennial grass, most of its growth occurs from late spring through early fall; it becomes dormant and unproductive during colder months. Thus, the productive season in its northern habitat can be as short as three months, but in the southern reaches of its habitat the growing season may be as long as eight months, around the Gulf Coast area. Switchgrass is a diverse species, with striking differences between plants. This diversity, which presumably reflects evolution and adaptation to new environments as the species spread across the continent, provides a range of valuable traits for breeding programs. Switchgrass has two distinct forms, or \\"cytotypes\\": the lowland cultivars, which tend to produce more biomass, and the upland cultivars, which are generally of more northern origin, more cold- tolerant, and therefore usually preferred in northern areas. Upland switchgrass types are generally shorter (‚â§ 2.4 m, tall) and less coarse than lowland types. Lowland cultivars may grow to ‚â• 2.7 m, in favorable environments. Both upland and lowland cultivars are deeply rooted (> 1.8 m, in favorable soils) and have short rhizomes. The upland types tend to have more vigorous rhizomes, so the lowland cultivars may appear to have a bunchgrass habit, while the upland types tend to be more sod-forming. Lowland cultivars appear more plastic in their morphology, produce larger plants if stands become thin or when planted in wide rows, and they seem to be more sensitive to moisture stress than upland cultivars.Establishing and Managing Switchgrass as an Energy Crop, Forage and Grazinglands, 2008. In native prairies, switchgrass is historically found in association with several other important native tallgrass prairie plants, such as big bluestem, indiangrass, little bluestem, sideoats grama, eastern gamagrass, and various forbs (sunflowers, gayfeather, prairie clover, and prairie coneflower). These widely adapted tallgrass species once occupied millions of hectares.Switchgrass as a Bioenergy Crop, ATTRA - National Sustainable Agricultural Information Service, 2006. Switchgrass‚Äô suitability for cultivation in the Gran Chaco is being studied by Argentina's Instituto Nacional de Tecnolog√≠a Agropecuaria (INTA). Establishment and management Switchgrass can be grown on land considered unsuitable for row crop production, including land that is too erodible for corn production, as well as sandy and gravelly soils in humid regions that typically produce low yields of other farm crops. No single method of establishing switchgrass can be suggested for all situations. The crop can be established both by no-till and conventional tillage. When seeded as part of a diverse mixture, planting guidelines for warm-season grass mixtures for conservation plantings should be followed. Regional guidelines for growing and managing switchgrass for bioenergy or conservation plantings are available. Several key factors can increase the likelihood of success for establishing switchgrass. These include: David J. Parrish, John H. Fike, David I. Bransby, Roger Samson. Establishing and Managing Switchgrass as an Energy Crop. Forage and Grazinglands. 2008 * Planting switchgrass after the soil is well warmed during the spring. * Using seeds that are highly germinable and planting 0.6 - 1.2 cm deep, or up to 2 cm deep in sandy soils. * Packing or firming the soil both before and after seeding. * Providing no fertilization at planting to minimize competition. * Controlling weeds with chemical and/or cultural control methods. Mowing and properly labeled herbicides are recommended for weed control. Chemical weed control can be used in the fall prior to establishment, or before or after planting. Weeds should be mowed just above the height of the growing switchgrass. Hormone herbicides, such as 2,4-D, should be avoided as they are known to reduce development of switchgrass when applied early in the establishing year. Plantings that appear to have failed due to weed infestations are often wrongly assessed, as the failure is often more apparent than real. Switchgrass stands that are initially weedy commonly become well established with appropriate management in subsequent years. Once established, switchgrass can take up to three years to reach its full production potential. Depending on the region, it can typically produce 1/4 to 1/3 of its yield potential in its first year and 2/3 of its potential in the year after seeding. After establishment, switchgrass management will depend on the goal of the seeding. Historically, most switchgrass seedings have been managed for the Conservation Reserve Program in the US. Disturbance such as periodic mowing, burning, or disking is required to optimize the stand's utility for encouraging biodiversity. Increased attention is being placed on switchgrass management as an energy crop. Generally, the crop requires modest application of nitrogen fertilizer, as it is not a heavy feeder. Typical nitrogen (N) content of senescent material in the fall is 0.5% N. Fertilizer nitrogen applications of about 5 kg N/hectare (ha) applied for each tonne of biomass removed is a general guideline. More specific recommendations for fertilization are available regionally in North America. Herbicides are not often used on switchgrass after the seeding year, as the crop is generally quite competitive with weeds. Most bioenergy conversion processes for switchgrass, including those for cellulosic ethanol and pellet fuel production, can generally accept some alternative species in the harvested biomass. Stands of switchgrass should be harvested no more than twice per year, and one cutting often provides as much biomass as two. Switchgrass can be harvested with the same field equipment used for hay production, and it is well-suited to baling or bulk field harvesting. If its biology is properly taken into consideration, switchgrass can offer great potential as an energy crop. Samson, R., Bailey-Stamler, S., & Ho Lem, C. Optimization of Switchgrass Management for Commercial Fuel Pellet Production (Final report prepared by REAP-Canada for the Ontario Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Rural Affairs (OMAFRA) under the Alternative Renewable Fuels Fund). 2008  Uses  Switchgrass can be used as a feedstock for biomass energy production, as ground cover for soil conservation, and to control erosion, for forages and grazing, as game cover, and as feedstock for biodegradable plastics. It can be used by cattle farmers for hay and pasture and as a substitute for wheat straw in many applications, including livestock bedding, straw bale housing, and as a substrate for growing mushrooms. Panicum virgatum 'Heavy Metal', an ornamental switchgrass, in early summer Additionally, switchgrass is grown as a drought-resistant ornamental grass in average to wet soils and in full sun to part shade. =Moth host plant= It is the preferred larval host plant of Dargida rubripennis.http://www.mass.gov/eea/docs/dfg/nhesp/species-and- conservation/nhfacts/dargida-rubripennis.pdf It is also a larval host for the Delaware skipper and the Hobomok skipper.The Xerces Society (2016), Gardening for Butterflies: How You Can Attract and Protect Beautiful, Beneficial Insects, Timber Press. =Bioenergy= Switchgrass has been researched as a renewable bioenergy crop since the mid-1980s, because it is a native perennial warm season grass with the ability to produce moderate to high yields on marginal farmlands. It is now being considered for use in several bioenergy conversion processes, including cellulosic ethanol production, biogas, and direct combustion for thermal energy applications. The main agronomic advantages of switchgrass as a bioenergy crop are its stand longevity, drought and flooding tolerance, relatively low herbicide and fertilizer input requirements, ease of management, hardiness in poor soil and climate conditions, and widespread adaptability in temperate climates. In some warm humid southern zones, such as Alabama, it has the ability to produce up to 25 oven-dry tonnes per hectare (ODT/ha). A summary of switchgrass yields across 13 research trial sites in the United States found the top two cultivars in each trial to yield 9.4 to 22.9 t/ha, with an average yield of 14.6 ODT/ha. However, these yields were recorded on small plot trials, and commercial field sites could be expected to be at least 20% lower than these results. In the United States, switchgrass yields appear to be highest in warm humid regions with long growing seasons such as the US Southeast and lowest in the dry short season areas of the Northern Great Plains. The energy inputs required to grow switchgrass are favorable when compared with annual seed bearing crops such as corn, soybean, or canola, which can require relatively high energy inputs for field operations, crop drying, and fertilization. Whole plant herbaceous perennial C4 grass feedstocks are desirable biomass energy feedstocks, as they require fewer fossil energy inputs to grow and effectively capture solar energy because of their C4 photosynthetic system and perennial nature. One study cites it takes from 0.97 to 1.34 GJ to produce 1 tonne of switchgrass, compared with 1.99 to 2.66 GJ to produce 1 tonne of corn. Another study found that switchgrass uses 0.8 GJ/ODT of fossil energy compared to grain corn's 2.9 GJ/ODT. Given that switchgrass contains approximately 18.8 GJ/ODT of biomass, the energy output-to-input ratio for the crop can be up to 20:1.Samson, R. et al. Developing Energy Crops for Thermal Applications: Optimizing Fuel Quality, Energy Security and GHG Mitigation. In Biofuels, Solar and Wind as Renewable Energy Systems: Benefits and Risks. D. Pimental. (Ed.) Springer Science, Berlin, Germany. 2008. 395-423. This highly favorable ratio is attributable to its relatively high energy output per hectare and low energy inputs for production. Considerable effort is being expended in developing switchgrass as a cellulosic ethanol crop in the USA. In George W. Bush's 2006 State of the Union Address, he proposed using switchgrass for ethanol; since then, over US$100 million has been invested into researching switchgrass as a potential biofuel source.\\"Since that mention in the 2006, investment in switch grass has exploded, thanks in large part, experts say, to the President's speech. Venture capitalists have poured over $100 million into private companies that are exploring the technology necessary to convert switchgrass into fuel, and large publicly owned companies are also directing their research dollars into biofuels.\\" Switchgrass has the potential to produce up to 380 liters of ethanol per tonne harvested. However, current technology for herbaceous biomass conversion to ethanol is about 340 liters per tonne.Iogen Corporation Iogen Corporation, 2009. In contrast, corn ethanol yields about 400 liters per tonne.Farrell, A.E. Ethanol Can Contribute to Energy and Environmental Goals. Science. Volume 311\\\\. 2006. 506-508. The main advantage of using switchgrass over corn as an ethanol feedstock is its cost of production is generally about 1/2 that of grain corn, and more biomass energy per hectare can be captured in the field. Thus, switchgrass cellulosic ethanol should give a higher yield of ethanol per hectare at lower cost. However, this will depend on whether the cost of constructing and operating cellulosic ethanol plants can be reduced considerably. The switchgrass ethanol industry energy balance is also considered to be substantially better than that of corn ethanol. During the bioconversion process, the lignin fraction of switchgrass can be burned to provide sufficient steam and electricity to operate the biorefinery. Studies have found that for every unit of energy input needed to create a biofuel from switchgrass, four units of energy are yielded. In contrast, corn ethanol yields about 1.28 units of energy per unit of energy input.Wang, M., Wu, M., & Huo, H. Life-cycle energy and greenhouse gas emission impacts of different corn ethanol plant types. Environmental Research Letters. Volume 2. 2007. 1-13. A recent study from the Great Plains indicated that for ethanol production from switchgrass, this figure is 6.4, or alternatively, that 540% more energy was contained in the ethanol produced than was used in growing the switchgrass and converting it to liquid fuel. However, there remain commercialization barriers to the development of cellulosic ethanol technology. Projections in the early 1990s for commercialization of cellulosic ethanol by the year 2000 have not been met. The commercialization of cellulosic ethanol is thus proving to be a significant challenge, despite noteworthy research efforts.right Thermal energy applications for switchgrass appear to be closer to near-term scale-up than cellulosic ethanol for industrial or small-scale applications. For example, switchgrass can be pressed into fuel pellets that are subsequently burned in pellet stoves used to heat homes (which typically burn corn or wood pellets). Switchgrass has been widely tested as a substitute for coal in power generation. The most widely studied project to date has been the Chariton Valley Project in Iowa.http://www.iowaswitchgrass.com/ The Show-Me-Energy Cooperative (SMEC) in MissouriShow Me Energy Cooperative is using switchgrass and other warm-season grasses, along with wood residues, as feedstocks for pellets used for the firing of a coal-fired power plant. In Eastern Canada, switchgrass is being used on a pilot scale as a feedstock for commercial heating applications. Combustion studies have been undertaken and it appears to be well-suited as a commercial boiler fuel. Research is also being undertaken to develop switchgrass as a pellet fuel because of lack of surplus wood residues in eastern Canada,Bailey Stamler, S., R. Samson and C. Ho Lem. Biomass resources options: Creating a BIOHEAT supply for the Canadian greenhouse industry. Final report to Natural Resources Canada, Ottawa. 2006. 38 pages as a slowdown in the forest products industry in 2009 is now resulting in wood pellet shortages throughout Eastern North America. Generally speaking, the direct firing of switchgrass for thermal applications can provide the highest net energy gain and energy output-to-input ratio of all switchgrass bioconversion processes.

Economic Growth and Innovation. 2009. 25 pages Research has found switchgrass, when pelletized and used as a solid biofuel, is a good candidate for displacing fossil fuels. Switchgrass pellets were identified to have a 14.6:1 energy output-to-input ratio, which is substantially better than that for liquid biofuel options from farmland. As a greenhouse gas mitigation strategy, switchgrass pellets were found to be an effective means to use farmland to mitigate greenhouse gases on the order of 7.6-13 tonnes of CO2 per hectare. In contrast, switchgrass cellulosic ethanol and corn ethanol were found to mitigate 5.2 and 1.5 tonnes of CO2 per hectare, respectively. Historically, the major constraint to the development of grasses for thermal energy applications has been the difficulty associated with burning grasses in conventional boilers, as biomass quality problems can be of particular concern in combustion applications. These technical problems now appear to have been largely resolved through crop management practices such as fall mowing and spring harvesting that allow for leaching to occur, which leads to fewer aerosol-forming compounds (such as K and Cl) and N in the grass. This reduces clinker formation and corrosion, and enables switchgrass to be a clean combustion fuel source for use in smaller combustion appliances. Fall harvested grasses likely have more application for larger commercial and industrial boilers.\\"Samson et al. 2007\\": http://www.reap- canada.com/online_library/feedstock_biomass/The%20Emerging%20Agro- Pellet%20Industry%20in%20Canada%20(Samson%20et%20al.,%202007).pdf R.

(2010) conducted a study to analyze the environmental sustainability of using switchgrass plant material as a feedstock for ethanol production.Bai, Y., Luo, L, & van der Voe, E. (2010). Life cycle assessment of switchgrass-derived ethanol as transport fuel. Int J Life Cycle Assess. 15 (15), 468-477. This can be found on-line at: https://doi.org/10.1007%2Fs11367-010-0177-2. Life cycle analysis was used to make this assessment. They compared efficiency of E10, E85, and ethanol with gasoline. They took into account air and water emissions associated with growing, managing, processing and storing the switchgrass crop. They also factored in the transportation of the stored switchgrass to the ethanol plant where they assumed the distance was 20 km. The reductions in global warming potential by using E10 and E85 were 5 and 65%, respectively. Their models also suggested that the ‚Äúhuman toxicity potential‚Äù and ‚Äúeco-toxicity potential‚Äù were substantially greater for the high ethanol fuels (i.e., E85 and ethanol) than for gasoline and E10. In 2014, a genetically altered form of the bacterium Caldicellulosiruptor bescii was created which can cheaply and efficiently turn switchgrass into ethanol. = Biodegradable plastics production = In a novel application, US scientists have genetically modified switchgrass to enable it to produce polyhydroxybutyrate, which accumulates in beadlike granules within the plant's cells.Biomass Combo, Chemical & Engineering News, 86, 33, 18 Aug. 2008, p. 13 In preliminary tests, the dry weight of a plants leaves were shown to comprise up to 3.7% of the polymer.Plant Biotechnology Journal, 2008, 6, 663 Such low accumulation rates do not, as of 2009, allow for commercial use of switchgrass as a biosource. = Soil conservation = Switchgrass is useful for soil conservation and amendment, particularly in the United States and Canada, where switchgrass is endemic. Switchgrass has a deep fibrous root system ‚Äì nearly as deep as the plant is tall. Since it, along with other native grasses and forbs, once covered the plains of the United States that are now the Corn Belt, the effects of the past switchgrass habitat have been beneficial, lending to the fertile farmland that exists today. The deep fibrous root systems of switchgrass left a deep rich layer of organic matter in the soils of the Midwest, making those mollisol soils some of the most productive in the world. By returning switchgrass and other perennial prairie grasses as an agricultural crop, many marginal soils may benefit from increased levels of organic material, permeability, and fertility, due to the grass's deep root system. Soil erosion, both from wind and water, is of great concern in regions where switchgrass grows. Due to its height, switchgrass can form an effective wind erosion barrier. Its root system, also, is excellent for holding soil in place, which helps prevent erosion from flooding and runoff. Some highway departments (for example, KDOT) have used switchgrass in their seed mixes when re-establishing growth along roadways. It can also be used on strip mine sites, dikes, and pond dams. Conservation districts in many parts of the United States use it to control erosion in grass waterways because of its ability to anchor soils while providing habitat for wildlife. =Forages and grazing= Switchgrass is an excellent forage for cattle; however, it has shown toxicity in horses, sheep, and goats through chemical compounds known as saponins, which cause photosensitivity and liver damage in these animals. Researchers are continuing to learn more about the specific conditions under which switchgrass causes harm to these species, but until more is discovered, it is recommended switchgrass not be fed to them. For cattle, however, it can be fed as hay, or grazed. Grazing switchgrass calls for watchful management practices to ensure survival of the stand. It is recommended that grazing begin when the plants are about 50 cm tall, and that grazing be discontinued when the plants have been eaten down to about 25 cm, and to rest the pasture 30 ‚Äì 45 days between grazing periods. Switchgrass becomes stemmy and unpalatable as it matures, but during the target grazing period, it is a favorable forage with a relative feed value (RFV) of 90-104. The grass's upright growth pattern places its growing point off the soil surface onto its stem, so leaving 25 cm of stubble is important for regrowth. When harvesting switchgrass for hay, the first cutting occurs at the late boot stage ‚Äì around mid-June. This should allow for a second cutting in mid-August, leaving enough regrowth to survive the winter. = Game cover = Switchgrass is well known among wildlife conservationists as good forage and habitat for upland game bird species, such as pheasant, quail, grouse, and wild turkey, and song birds, with its plentiful small seeds and tall cover. A study published in 2015 has shown that switchgrass, when grown in a traditional monoculture, has an adverse impact on some wildlife. Depending on how thickly switchgrass is planted, and what it is partnered with, it also offers excellent forage and cover for other wildlife across the country. For those producers who have switchgrass stands on their farm, it is considered an environmental and aesthetic benefit due to the abundance of wildlife attracted by the switchgrass stands. Some members of Prairie Lands Bio-Products, Inc. in Iowa have even turned this benefit into a profitable business by leasing their switchgrass land for hunting during the proper seasons. The benefits to wildlife can be extended even in large-scale agriculture through the process of strip harvesting, as recommended by The Wildlife Society, which suggests that rather than harvesting an entire field at once, strip harvesting could be practiced so that the entire habitat is not removed, thereby protecting the wildlife inhabiting the switchgrass.

The show ran for 13 episodes from September 12 to November 28, 1992. History Of the 13 episodes, only the first one (entitled \\"The Return of Batduck\\" in homage to the movie Batman Returns) was original to the series. All remaining episodes of the show were compilations of shorts produced for Tiny Toons, though some of the shorts were aired on The Plucky Duck Show first. The theme song for the show is a rendition of the Tiny Toons theme, set to the same music, but with Plucky himself as the subject of the song. Some of the lyrics were reused in the Tiny Toons episode \\"It's a Wonderful Tiny Toons Christmas Special\\". After the show was canceled, the Batduck episode was edited and added in as an episode of Tiny Toons. The show's formula was attempted again several years later when the supporting characters from Animaniacs (Steven Spielberg's next collaboration with Warner Bros.

In this condition the distal ureter balloons at its opening into the bladder, forming a sac-like pouch. It is most often associated with a duplicated collection system, where two ureters drain their respective kidney instead of one. Simple ureterocele, where the condition involves only a single ureter, represents only twenty percent of cases. Ureterocele affects one in 4,000 individuals, at least four-fifths of whom are female. Patients are frequently Caucasian. Since the advent of the ultrasound, most ureteroceles are diagnosed prenatally. The pediatric and adult conditions are often found incidentally, i.e. through diagnostic imaging performed for unrelated reasons. Classification ; Intravesical : Confined within the bladder ; Ectopic : Some part extends to the bladder neck or urethra ; Stenotic : Intravesical ureterocele with a narrow opening ; Sphincteric : Ectopic ureterocele with an orifice distal to the bladder neck ; Sphincterostenotic : Orifice is both stenotic and distal to the bladder neck ; Cecoureterocele : Ectopic ureterocele that extends into the urethra, but the orifice is in the bladder Signs and symptoms CT scan showing a ureterocele associated with a duplicated collection system of the left kidney. The signs and symptoms of ureterocele in the latter two forms can easily be confused with other medical conditions. Symptoms can include: * Frequent urinary tract infections * Pyelonephritis * Obstructive voiding symptoms * Urinary retention * Failure to thrive * Hematuria * Cyclic abdominal pain * Urolithiasis * Cobra head sign is seen in radiography *In females: salpingitis, hydrosalpinx with sepsis or torsion. T.O. mass. =Complications= Many other complications arise from ureteroceles. Redundant collection systems are usually smaller in diameter than single, and predispose the patient to impassable kidney stones. The effective \\"bladder within a bladder\\" compounds this problem by increasing the collision of uric acid particles, the process by which uric acid stones are formed. Ureterocele is also associated with poor kidney function. It can cause frequent blockage of the ureter leading to serious kidney damage. In other cases, a small, upper portion of the kidney is congenitally non-functional. Though often benign, this problem can necessitate the removal of non-functioning parts. Causes Definitive causes of ureterocele have not been found. While the abnormal growth occurs within the uterus, it has not been substantiated that genetics are to blame. Congenital abnormalities of the mesonephric duct in males can lead to the formation of a ureterocele, which often coincide with ipsilateral agenesis of the kidney (atrophic kidney) and seminal vesicle cysts, this is known as Zinner Syndrome. Diagnosis IVU-shows Adder head appearance or Cobra head appearance. Cystoscopy-shows translucent cyst which is thin walled surrounding ureteric orifice Treatment * Single-system ureterocele: initial management is usually endoscopic incision of the ureterocele, which can be followed by surgical ureteric re-implantation to preserve renal function and prevent reflux. * Duplex-system ureterocele: treatment options vary with the individual and include: endoscopic incision of the corresponding ureteric orifice in case of ureteric meatal stricture; upper pole nephrectomy for a poorly functioning unit with ureterectomy or, where there is useful renal function, ureteropyelostomy.

It conducts large-scale comparative studies of educational achievement and other aspects of education, with the aim of gaining in-depth understanding of the effects of policies and practices within and across systems of education. Since its founding in 1958, IEA has conducted more than 30 research studies of cross-national achievement. IEA studies focus on subjects relating to mathematics, science, reading, civic and citizenship education, computer and information literacy, and teacher education, among others. History Even though the IEA became a legal entity in 1967, its origins date back to 1958 when a group of scholars, educational psychologists, sociologists, and psychometricians met at the UNESCO Institute for Education in Hamburg, Germany, to discuss problems of school and student evaluation. They believed that effective evaluation requires examination of both educational inputs as well as its outcomes (such as knowledge, attitudes, and participation). The founders assumed that if research could obtain evidence from across a wide range of systems, the variability would be sufficient to reveal important relationships within different school systems. They strongly rejected data-free assertions about the relative merits of various education systems, and aimed to identify factors that would have meaningful and consistent influences on educational outcomes. Mission The IEA, together with the association's membership, carries out comparative research studies in education and aims to: # Provide international benchmarks that may assist policymakers in identifying the relative strengths and weaknesses of their educational systems # Provide high-quality data that will increase policymakers' understanding of key school- and non-school-based factors that influence teaching and learning # Provide high-quality data which will serve as a resource for identifying areas of concern and action, and for preparing and evaluating educational reforms # Develop and improve educational systems' capacity of education systems to engage in national strategies for educational monitoring and improvement # Contribute to development of the worldwide community of researchers in educational evaluation Location IEA Amsterdam The IEA headquarters is located in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. IEA Amsterdam carries out a wide range of duties related to IEA memberships, studies, finance, publications, and communication. These responsibilities include: * maintaining relationships with member institutions, partners, and external funding and research agencies * overseeing IEA projects and managing translation verification of the survey instruments and quality control of the data collection * financial planning and reporting * organizing international conferences and General Assembly meetings * managing IEA's publications and communications. Staff in Amsterdam also disseminate study reports and information about the work of the association to the IEA members and the general public. IEA Hamburg The IEA's data processing and research department is located in Hamburg, Germany. IEA Hamburg is responsible for activities in several major areas, including: * data management for IEA studies and for other international and national studies * study preparation, organization, implementation, and coordination * providing data analysis and reporting support services for IEA member states * delivering training workshops and seminars on analysis methods and use of educational research data * additional services commissioned by both national and international scientific institution IEA Hamburg also provides scanner-assisted data collection, electronic scoring, and data interpretation services. Studies Since its founding in 1958, IEA has conducted more than 30 research studies of cross- national achievement. IEA studies focus on subjects of particular interest to IEA members. These include mathematics and science studies, reading studies, civic and citizenship education, computer and information literacy, and teacher education, among others. A regular cycle of studies in basic school subjects includes: * the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS 1995, TIMSS 1999, TIMSS 2003, TIMSS 2007, TIMSS 2011, TIMSS 2015, TIMSS 2019, eTIMSS 2019) * the Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS 2001, PIRLS 2006, PIRLS 2011, PIRLS 2016, ePIRLS 2016, PIRLS 2021). * the International Civic and Citizenship Education Study (CIVED, ICCS 2009, ICCS 2016), * the Computer and Information Technology in Education Studies (COMPED, SITES-M1, SITES-M2, SITES 2006), * the Early Childhood Education Study (PPP, ECES). * the International Computer and Information Literacy Study (ICILS 2013, ICILS 2018). In 2005, IEA also initiated its first study in tertiary education: * Teachers Education and Development Study in Mathematics (TEDS-M). IEA repeats assessments in specific subjects on regular (e.g., PIRLS and TIMSS) and irregular (e.g., ICCS, ICILS) intervals. The cycle of studies enables countries to monitor changes in education and educational achievement over time. IEA studies consider the processes and effects of education, using the notion of 'opportunity to learn' in order to understand the linkages between: *Intended curriculum (what policy requires) *Implemented curriculum (what is taught in schools) *Achieved curriculum (what students learn). To investigate these relations, IEA collects student achievement data, as well as background information from school principals, teachers, students (in some studies, also from parents), and policymakers about the contexts of teaching and learning. The IEA also designed the Literacy and Numeracy Assessment (LaNA) to provide educators with valuable experience in standardized assessment, implementation of the assessment procedures, and capacity building in planning and administering assessments, and reporting outcomes. A short basic assessment at the end of primary school, LaNA is intended for developing education systems where the IEA‚Äôs Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study and Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (TIMSS and PIRLS) may be too difficult to implement. =Members= The IEA currently has more than 65 institutional members around the world, most which represent one national system of education, although a few countries have representation for more than one education system.

FeLV can be transmitted from infected cats when the transfer of saliva or nasal secretions is involved. If not defeated by the animal's immune system, the virus weakens the cat's immune system which can lead to diseases which can be lethal. Because FeLV is cat-to-cat contagious, FeLV+ cats should only live with other FeLV+ cats. FeLV is categorized into four subgroups, A, B, C and T. An infected cat has a combination of FeLV-A and one or more of the other subgroups. Symptoms, prognosis and treatment are all affected by subgroup. FeLV+ cats often have a shorter lifespan, but can still live \\"normal\\", healthy lives. FeLV is not cancer. Signs and symptoms The signs and symptoms of infection with feline leukemia virus are quite varied and include loss of appetite, poor coat condition, anisocoria (uneven pupils), infections of the skin, bladder, and respiratory tract, oral disease, seizures, lymphadenopathy (swollen lymph nodes), skin lesions, fatigue, fever, weight loss, stomatitis, gingivitis, litter box avoidance, pancytopenia, recurring bacterial and viral illnesses, anemia, diarrhea and jaundice. Asymptomatic carriers will show no signs of disease, often for many years. =Progression= The disease has a wide range of effects. The cat can fight off the infection and become totally immune, can become a healthy carrier that never gets sick itself but can infect other cats, or a mid-level case in which the cat has a compromised immune system. Nevertheless, the development of lymphomas is considered the final stage of the disease. Although it is thought that virus protein has to be present to induce lymphomas in cats, newer evidence shows that a high percentage of FeLV-Antigen negative lymphomas contain FeLV-DNA, indicating a \\"hit-and-run\\" mechanism of virus-induced tumor development. Once the virus has entered the cat, there are six stages to a FeLV infection: * Stage One: The virus enters the cat, usually through the pharynx where it infects the epithelial cells and infects the tonsilar B-lymphocytes and macrophages. These white blood cells then filter down to the lymph nodes and begin to replicate. * Stage Two: The virus enters the blood stream and begins to distribute throughout the body. * Stage Three: The lymphoid system (which produces antibodies to attack infected and cancerous cells) becomes infected, with further distribution throughout the body. * Stage Four: The main point in the infection- where the virus can take over the body's immune system and cause viremia. During this stage the hemolymphatic system and intestines become infected. If the cat's immune system does not fight off the virus, then it progresses to: * Stage Five: The bone marrow becomes infected. At this point, the virus will stay with the cat for the rest of its life. In this phase, the virus replicates and is released four to seven days later in infected neutrophils, and sometimes lymphocytes, monocytes, and eosinophils (all white blood cells formed in the bone marrow). * Stage Six: The cat's body is overwhelmed by infection and mucosal and glandular epithelial cells (tissue that forms a thin protective layer on exposed bodily surfaces and forms the lining of internal cavities, ducts, and organs) become infected. The virus replicates in epithelial tissues including salivary glands, oropharynx, stomach, esophagus, intestines, trachea, nasopharynx, renal tubules, bladder, pancreas, alveolar ducts, and sebaceous ducts from the muzzle. Transmission Cats infected with FeLV can serve as sources of infection of FeLV-A. Cats can pass the virus between themselves through saliva and close contact, by biting another cat, and (rarely) through a litter box or food dish used by an infected cat. Once a cat has been infected with FeLV-A, additional mutated forms of the original FeLV-A virus may arise, as may FeLV subgroups B, C and T. In addition to domestic cats, some other members of Felidae are now threatened by FeLV (e.g. lynx and Florida panther). Overwhelming epidemiologic evidence suggests FeLV is not transmissible to either humans or dogs. Approximately 0.5% of pet cats are persistently infected with FeLV, but many more pet cats (>35%) have specific IgG antibodies which indicate prior exposure and subsequent development of immunity instead of infection. FeLV is highly infectious. Kittens can be born with it, having contracted it from their mother while in utero. Infection is far higher in city cats, stray or owned, than in rural cats: this is entirely due to the amount of contact the cats have with each other. Diagnosis and prognosis Testing for FeLV is possible with ELISA tests that look for viral antigens, free particles found in the bloodstream. These ELISA tests use blood samples most often, but can also use saliva or eye secretions. The sample is added to a container or dish that contains the viral antigen. If antibodies to the antigen are present in the sample, they will bind together and an indicator on the test will change color. These give a definitive diagnosis, but it cannot differentiate between acute or persistent infections. Therefore, it is recommended that the cat be retested in three to four months after the positive result to determine if the virus has been cleared from the body. Diagnosis can also be made by reference lab testing, using an immunofluorescence (IFA) test. The IFA test uses a blood sample and will detect the virus once it is in the bone marrow by detecting the virus's presence in white blood cells. IFA testing will not give positive results for transient, primary infections - the infection must be persistent to get a positive result on this test. Other than ELISA and IFA testing, routine laboratory blood work may show changes that indicate infection but cannot be used as a definitive diagnosis. There may be blood cell count changes like leukopenia, decreased Packed Cell Volume (PCV) and Total Protein (TP) levels due to anemia, hemoconcentration and hypoglycemia due to vomiting and diarrhea, electrolyte imbalance caused by dehydration and anorexia, and recurrent urinary tract infections.Johnson, A. (2014). Small Animal Pathology for Veterinarian Technicians. Hoboken: Wiley Blackwell. Cats diagnosed as persistently infected by ELISA testing may die within a few months or may remain asymptomatic for longer; median survival time after diagnosis is 2.5 years. FeLV is categorized into four subgroups. * FeLV-A is responsible for the immunosuppression characteristic of the disease. The vast majority of cats with FeLV has FeLV-A. An exception was reported in 2013. * FeLV-B causes an additional increase in the incidence of tumors and other abnormal tissue growths. About half of FeLV infected cats have FeLV-B. It forms by recombination of FeLV-A and cat endogenous FeLV (enFeLV). * FeLV-C causes severe anemia. Approximately 1% of FeLV infected cats have FeLV-C. It forms by mutation of FeLV-A. * FeLV-T leads to lymphoid depletion and immunodeficiency. It forms by mutation of FeLV-A. The fatal diseases are leukemias, lymphomas, and non-regenerative anemias. Although there is no known cure for the virus infection, in 2006 the United States Department of Agriculture approved Lymphocyte T-Cell Immunomodulator as a treatment aid for FeLV (see Treatment). Prevention Two types of vaccines for FeLV are available: an adjuvanted killed virus noninfectious vaccine and a nonadjuvanted canarypox virus- vectored recombinant infectious vaccine ( ATCvet code QI066AA01 and various combination vaccines), though no currently available vaccine offers 100% protection from the virus. Vaccination is recommended for high-risk cats: those that have access to the outdoors, feral cats, cats that do not have the virus but live with an infected cat, multicat households, and cats with an unknown status, such as cats in catteries and shelters. Serious side effects have also been reported as a result of FeLV vaccination; in particular, a small percentage of cats who received the adjuvanted killed virus vaccine developed vaccine-associated sarcomas, an aggressive tumour, at the injection site. The development of sarcomas with the use of the old FeLV and other vaccines may be due to the inflammation caused by aluminium adjuvants in the vaccines. Merial produces a recombinant vaccine consisting of canarypox virus carrying FeLV gag and env genes (sold as PUREVAX FeLV in the US and Eurifel FeLV in Europe). This is thought to be safer than the old vaccine as it does not require an adjuvant to be effective. Although this is a live virus, it originates from a bird host and so does not replicate in mammals. Viral structure Feline leukemia virus (FeLV) is an RNA virus in the subfamily Oncovirinae belonging to the Retroviridae family. The virus comprises 5' and 3' LTRs and three genes: Gag (structural), Pol (enzymes) and Env (envelope and transmembrane); the total genome is about 9,600 base pairs. See the entry on retroviruses for more details on the life cycle of FeLV. Treatment =Approved US treatment= In 2006, the United States Department of Agriculture issued a conditional license for a new treatment aid termed Lymphocyte T-Cell Immunomodulator (LTCI). Lymphocyte T-Cell Immunomodulator is manufactured and distributed exclusively by T-Cyte Therapeutics, Inc. Lymphocyte T-Cell Immunomodulator is intended as an aid in the treatment of cats infected with feline leukemia virus (FeLV) and/or feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), and the associated symptoms of lymphocytopenia, opportunistic infection, anemia, granulocytopenia, or thrombocytopenia. The absence of any observed adverse events in several animal species suggests that the product has a very low toxicity profile. Lymphocyte T-Cell Immunomodulator is a potent regulator of CD-4 lymphocyte production and function.Beardsley, et al. \\"Induction of T-Cell Maturation by a Cloned Line of Thymic Epithelium (TEPI) Immunology 80: pp. 6005-6009, (Oct. 1983).

Method to enhance hematopoiesis - Google Patents at www.google.com Lymphocyte T-Cell Immunomodulator is a single chain polypeptide. It is a strongly cationic glycoprotein, and is purified with cation exchange resin. Purification of protein from bovine-derived stromal cell supernatants produces a substantially homogeneous factor, free of extraneous materials. The bovine protein is homologous with other mammalian species and is a homogeneous 50 kDa glycoprotein with an isoelectric point of 6.5. The protein is prepared in a lyophilized 1 microgram dose. Reconstitution in sterile diluent produces a solution for subcutaneous injection. =Approved European treatment= Interferon-œâ (omega) is sold in Europe at least under the name Virbagen Omega and manufactured by Virbac. When used in treatment of cats infected with FeLV in non-terminal clinical stages (over the age of 9 weeks) there have been substantial improvements in mortality rates; in non-anemic cats, mortality rate of 50% was reduced by approximately 20% following treatment. History FeLV was first described in cats in 1964. The disease was originally associated with leukemia; however, it was later realized that the initial signs are generally anemia and immunosuppression. The first diagnostic test became available in 1973, which led to a \\"test and elimination\\" regime, dramatically reducing the number of infected cats in the general population. The first vaccine became available in 1986. Comparison with feline immunodeficiency virus FeLV and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) are sometimes mistaken for one another, though the viruses differ in many ways. Although they are both in the same retroviral subfamily (Orthoretrovirinae), they are classified in different genera (FeLV is a gamma-retrovirus and FIV is a lentivirus like HIV-1). Their shapes are quite different: FeLV is more circular while FIV is elongated. The two viruses are also quite different genetically, and their protein coats differ in size and composition. Although many of the diseases caused by FeLV and FIV are similar, the specific ways in which they are caused also differ. Also, while the feline leukemia virus may cause symptomatic illness in an infected cat, an FIV infected cat can remain completely asymptomatic its entire lifetime.

Cheating generally describes various actions designed to subvert rules in order to obtain unfair advantages. This includes acts of bribery, cronyism and nepotism in any situation where individuals are given preference using inappropriate criteria. The rules infringed may be explicit, or they may be from an unwritten code of conduct based on morality, ethics or custom, making the identification of cheating conduct a potentially subjective process. Cheating can refer specifically to infidelity. Someone who is known for cheating is referred to as a cheat in British English, and a cheater in American English. A person described as a \\"cheat\\" doesn't necessarily cheat all the time, but rather, relies on deceitful tactics to the point of acquiring a reputation for it. Academic A small cheat sheet can be used to cheat during an academic examination. Academic cheating is a significantly common occurrence in high schools and colleges in the United States. Statistically, 64% of public high school students admit to serious test cheating. 58% say they have plagiarized. 95% of students admit to some form of cheating. This includes tests, copying homework, and papers. Only 50% of private school students, however, admit to this. The report was made in June 2005 by Rutgers University professor Donald McCabe for The Center for Academic Integrity. The findings were corroborated in part by a Gallup survey. In McCabe's 2001 of 4500 high school students, \\"74% said they cheated on a test, 72% cheated on a written work, and 97% reported to at least had copied someone's homework or peeked at someone's test. 1/3 reported to have repeatedly cheated.\\"The Case of the Purloined Paper by Brigid Schulte The new revolution in high-tech digital info contributes enormously to the new wave in cheating: online term-paper mills sell formatted reports on practically any topic; services exist to prepare any kind of homework or take online tests for students, despite the fact that this phenomenon, and these websites, are well known to educators; MP3 players can hold digitalized notes; graphing calculators store formulas to solve math problems.Reader's Digest, pp. 123-7, March 2006; Cheating: \\"but everybody is doing it\\". The Chinese civil service examinations, the main route to career success for literate men in imperial China, was bedeviled for centuries by rampant cheating and examiner-bribery, as detailed in books like the Ming-dynasty Book of Swindles.\\"Type 20: Corruption in Education,\\" in Zhang Yingyu, The Book of Swindles: Selections from a Late Ming Collection, translated by Christopher Rea and Bruce Rusk (New York, NY: Columbia University Press, 2017), pp. 142-163.  Sport, games and gambling  = Sports = Cheating in sports is the intentional breaking of rules in order to obtain an advantage over the other teams or players. Sports are governed by both customs and explicit rules regarding acts which are permitted and forbidden at the event and away from it. Forbidden acts frequently include performance-enhancing drug taking (known as \\"doping\\"), using equipment that does not conform to the rules or altering the condition of equipment during play, and deliberate harassment or injury to competitors. A 2012 investigation by the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) found that Lance Armstrong had used banned performance-enhancing drugs over the course of his cycling career High-profile examples of alleged doping cheating include Lance Armstrong's use of steroids in professional cycling - particularly controversial as it is widely suspected that a high percentage of professional cyclists are using prohibited substances - Ben Johnson's disqualification following the 100 metres final at the 1988 Summer Olympics, and admissions of steroid use by former professional baseball players after they have retired, such as Jos√© Canseco and Ken Caminiti. A famous sporting scandal involving cheating via harassment and injury occurred in 1994 in figure skating when Tonya Harding's ex-husband, Jeff Gillooly, and her bodyguard Shawn Eckhardt, hired Shane Stant to break Nancy Kerrigan's leg to remove her from the year's competitions and prevent her from competing with Harding. One of the most famous instances of cheating involving a prohibited player action occurred during the 1986 FIFA World Cup quarter-final, when Diego Maradona used his hand to punch the ball into the goal of England goalkeeper Peter Shilton. Using the hand or arm by anyone other than a goalkeeper is illegal according to the rules of association football. Illegally altering the condition of playing equipment is frequently seen in bat sports such as baseball and cricket, which are heavily dependent on equipment condition. For example, in baseball, a pitcher using a doctored baseball (e.g. putting graphite or Vaseline on the baseball), or a batter using a corked bat are some examples of this. Tennis and golf are also no strangers to equipment cheating, with players being accused of using rackets of illegal string tension, or golf clubs of illegal weight, size, or make. Equipment cheating can also occur via the use of external aids in situations where equipment is prohibited - such as in American football via the use of stickum on the hands of receivers, making the ball easier to catch. An example of this is Hall of Famer Jerry Rice, who admitted to regularly & illegally using \\"stickum\\" throughout his career, calling into question the integrity of his receiving records.http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/eye-on- football/25061154/jerry-rice-admitted-to-cheating-just-days-before-calling- pats-cheaters Athletic cheating is a widespread problem. For example, in professional bodybuilding, cheating is now estimated to be so universal that it is now considered impossible to engage in professional competition without cheating and the use of supposedly banned substances; bodybuilders who refuse to take banned substances now compete in natural bodybuilding leagues. Cheating may also be seen in coaching. One of the most common forms of this is the use of bribery and kickbacks in the player recruitment process. Such practices are widespread all across athletics, and are particularly visible in college sports recruitment. Another common form of cheating in coaching is profiteering in association with gamblers and match fixing (see also the section below on cheating in the gambling industry). The most famous coach of the University of Nevada, Las Vegas Runnin' Rebels basketball team, Jerry Tarkanian, was accused of both recruitment fraud and gambling fraud over the course of his career and was the subject of intense NCAA scrutiny. Another form of this involves a team coach or other manager undertaking corporate espionage or another form of prohibited spying in order to obtain details about other teams' strategies and tactics. The 2007 New England Patriots videotaping controversy, in which the New England Patriots were found to have videotaped an opposing team from an unapproved location while trying to obtain defensive signals. As was the Pittsburgh Steelers use of, at the time legal, performance enhancers. However, there was cheating proven by the Denver Broncos during their back to back titles in the late 1990s to circumvent the league's salary cap and obtain and retain players that they would otherwise not have been able to. Circumvention of rules governing conduct and procedures of a sport can also be considered cheating. a form of collusion. An example of cheating via judging collusion occurred in the 2002 Winter Olympics figure skating scandal when the Russian team was awarded a gold medal over the Canadian team in an alleged vote-swapping judging deal; the Canadian team's silver medals were eventually upgraded to gold at a second awards ceremony and the French judge was suspended for misconduct. The head of the French skating federation was later also suspended, and both were banned from the 2006 Olympic Games. The International Skating Union modified its judging system as a result of this case. Cheating is also used to refer to movements in strength training that transfer weight from an isolated or fatigued muscle group to a different or fresh muscle group. This allows the cheater to move an initial greater weight (if the cheating continues through an entire training set) or to continue exercising past the point of muscular exhaustion (if the cheating begins part way through the set). As strength training is not a sport, cheating has no rule-based consequences, but can result in injury or a failure to meet training goals. This is because each exercise is designed to target specific muscle groups and if the proper form is not used the weight can be transferred away from the targeted group. = Video games = The Action Replay card allows Amiga computer owners to cheat in videogames In video games, cheating can take the form of secret access codes in single-player games (such as the Konami code) which unlock a bonus for the player when entered, hacks and exploits which give players an unfair advantage in online multiplayer games and single-player modes, or unfair collusion between players in online games (such as a player who spectates a match, removing limitations such as \\"fog of war\\", and reports on enemy positions to game partners). Attitudes towards cheating vary. Using exploits in single-player modes is usually considered to be simply another form of exploring the game's content unless the player's accomplishments are to be submitted competitively, and is common in single-player games with a high difficulty level; however, cheating in multiplayer modes is considered immoral and harshly condemned by fair players and developers alike. On one hand, cheating allows casual players to complete games at much-accelerated speed, which can be helpful in some cinematic or one-player games, which can take a subjectively long time to finish, as is typical of the Role-Playing Game (RPG) genre. While this may be seen as a hasty advantage causing no damage to anyone, in a multi-player game such as MMORPGs the repercussions of cheating are much more damaging, breaking the risk/reward curve of the game and causing fair players to lose online matches and/or character development. Cheating in those types of games is generally prohibited - though often widespread anyway. In many circles, the purchasing of items or currency from sources outside the game is also considered to be cheating. The Terms of Service from many games where this is possible, directly prohibits this activity. One area where there is little consensus involves modern Free-to-play business models which support and are supported by the exchange of real-world money for in-game services, items, and advantages. Games that grant excessive advantages only available to paying customers may be criticized as being 'Pay to win' \\\\- sometimes considered a form of \\"cheating\\" that is actually legitimatized by the system - whilst games that limit real-money purchases to cosmetic changes are generally accepted as fair. Another form of video game cheating is when a player does things to interact with game objects that are unforeseen by the programmers and break the intended function or reward system of the object. This can involve the way enemies are encountered, objectives met, items used, or any other game object that contains a software bug. One common example is the exploitation of errors in an enemy's pathfinding; if a player can cause an enemy to become \\"stuck\\" in a given terrain feature, that player can then usually dispatch the enemy from a distance without risk, even if much stronger, and achieve greater rewards than the player is intended to be able to at that level of progression. Another example was common in early first-person shooter games and involved skipping a weapon's reload timer by quickly switching weapons back and forth without actually reloading the weapons; resulting in what was effectively instant reloading. It also can be accomplished through means of altered game files are substituted for the normal files, or image graphics changed to permit greater visibility of the targets, etc. - for example, replacing the colors on a dark-colored enemy intended to blend in with the background with a bright color permitting instant visibility and targeting. Generally speaking, there is often some concern that this is not truly cheating, as it is the fault of the programmers that such an exploit exists in the first place. However, technically, as with live sports, it is cheating if the player is not playing the game in a formally approved manner, breaking unwritten rules. In some cases, this behavior is directly prohibited by the Terms of Service of the game. = Gambling = Ace of Diamonds, by Georges de La Tour The wagering of money on an event extends the motivation for cheating beyond directly participating competitors. As in sport and games, cheating in gambling is generally related to directly breaking rules or laws, or misrepresenting the event being wagered on, or interfering in the outcome. A boxer who takes a dive, a casino which plays with secretly loaded dice, a rigged roulette wheel or slot machine, or a doctored deck of cards, are generally regarded as cheating, because it has misrepresented the likelihood of the game's outcomes beyond what is reasonable to expect a bettor to protect himself against. However, for a bookmaker to flatter a horse in order to sell bets on it at shorter odds may be regarded as salesmanship rather than cheating, since bettors can counter this by informing themselves and by exercising skepticism. Doping a horse is a clear example of cheating by interfering with the instruments of the event under wager. Again, not all interference is cheating; spending money to support the health and well-being of a horse one has wagered on is not in itself generally regarded as cheating, nor is improving the morale of a sportsman one has backed by cheering for them. Generally, interference is more likely to be regarded as cheating if it diminishes the standard of a sporting competition, damages a participant, or modifies the apparatus of the event or game. In the world of gambling, knowing a secret which is not priced into the odds gives a significant advantage, which may give rise to a perception of cheating. However, legal systems do not regard secretly making use of knowledge in this way as criminal deception in itself. This is in contrast to the financial world, where people with certain categories of relationship to a company are restricted from transacting, which would constitute the crime of insider trading. This may be because of a stronger presumption of equality between investors, or it may be because a company employee who also trades in the company's stock has a conflict of interest, and has thus misrepresented himself the company. An advantage player typically uses mental, observational or technical skills to choose when and how much to bet, and neither interferes with the instruments of the game nor breaks any of its rules. Representatives of the casino industry have claimed that all advantage play is cheating, but this point of view is reflected neither among societies in general nor in legislation. As of 2010, the only example anywhere of a type of advantage play being unlawful is for an advantage player to use an auxiliary device in the U.S. State of Nevada, whose legislation is uniquely influenced by large casino corporations. Nonetheless it remains a widely held principle that the law should not impose any restraint over the method by which a player arrives at a playing or betting decision from information held by him lawfully and which he is not debarred from under the rules of the game. In \\"hole carding\\", a casino player tries to catch sight of the front of cards which are dealt face-down according to the rules. One way of cheating and profiting through gambling is to bet against yourself and then intentionally lose. This is known as throwing a game or taking a dive. Illegal gamblers will at times pay sports players to lose so that they may profit from the otherwise unexpected loss. An especially notorious case is the Black Sox Scandal, when eight players of the 1919 Chicago White Sox took payment from gamblers and intentionally played poorly. Another happened in boxing when Jake LaMotta famously took a dive against Billy Fox in order to obtain his entry to a championship match against Marcel Cerdan, a deal offered by the mobsters who controlled professional boxing.  Business  Various regulations exist to prevent unfair competitive advantages in business and finance, for example competition law, or the prohibition of insider trading. The most extreme forms of cheating (e.g. attempting to gain money through outright deceit rather than providing a service) are referred to as fraud.

It is generally applied to systems supporting human life in situations where the outside environment is hostile, like in space or underwater, or medical situations where the health of the person is compromised to the extent that the risk of death would be high without the function of the equipment. In human spaceflight, a life-support system is a group of devices that allow a human being to survive in space. US government space agency NASA,NASA, 2008 and private spaceflight companies use the term environmental control and life- support system or the acronym ECLSS when describing these systems. The life- support system may supply air, water and food. It must also maintain the correct body temperature, an acceptable pressure on the body and deal with the body's waste products. Shielding against harmful external influences such as radiation and micro-meteorites may also be necessary. Components of the life- support system are life-critical, and are designed and constructed using safety engineering techniques. In underwater diving, the breathing apparatus is considered to be life support equipment, and a saturation diving system is considered a life-support system ‚Äì the personnel who are responsible for operating it are called life support technicians. The concept can also be extended to submarines, crewed submersibles and atmospheric diving suits, where the breathing gas requires treatment to remain respirable, and the occupants are isolated from the outside ambient pressure and temperature. Medical life-support systems include heart-lung machines, medical ventilators and dialysis equipment.  Human physiological and metabolic needs  A crewmember of typical size requires approximately of food, water, and oxygen per day to perform standard activities on a space mission, and outputs a similar amount in the form of waste solids, waste liquids, and carbon dioxide. The mass breakdown of these metabolic parameters is as follows: of oxygen, of food, and of water consumed, converted through the body's physiological processes to of solid wastes, of liquid wastes, and of carbon dioxide produced. These levels can vary due to activity level of a specific mission assignment, but must obey the principle of mass balance. Actual water use during space missions is typically double the given value, mainly due to non- biological use (e.g. showering). Additionally, the volume and variety of waste products varies with mission duration to include hair, finger nails, skin flaking, and other biological wastes in missions exceeding one week in length. Other environmental considerations such as radiation, gravity, noise, vibration, and lighting also factor into human physiological response in space, though not with the more immediate effect that the metabolic parameters have.  Atmosphere  Space life-support systems maintain atmospheres composed, at a minimum, of oxygen, water vapor and carbon dioxide. The partial pressure of each component gas adds to the overall barometric pressure. However, the elimination of diluent gases substantially increases fire risks, especially in ground operations when for structural reasons the total cabin pressure must exceed the external atmospheric pressure; see Apollo 1. Furthermore, oxygen toxicity becomes a factor at high oxygen concentrations. For this reason, most modern crewed spacecraft use conventional air (nitrogen/oxygen) atmospheres and use pure oxygen only in pressure suits during extravehicular activity where acceptable suit flexibility mandates the lowest inflation pressure possible.  Water  Water is consumed by crew members for drinking, cleaning activities, EVA thermal control, and emergency uses. It must be stored, used, and reclaimed (from waste water) efficiently since no on-site sources currently exist for the environments reached in the course of human space exploration. Future lunar missions may utilise water sourced from polar ices; Mars missions may utilise water from the atmosphere or ice deposits.  Food  All space missions to date have used supplied food. Life-support systems could include a plant cultivation system which allows food to be grown within buildings or vessels. This would also regenerate water and oxygen. However, no such system has flown in space as yet. Such a system could be designed so that it reuses most (otherwise lost) nutrients. This is done, for example, by composting toilets which reintegrate waste material (excrement) back into the system, allowing the nutrients to be taken up by the food crops. The food coming from the crops is then consumed again by the system's users and the cycle continues. The logistics and area requirements involved however have been prohibitive in implementing such a system to date.  Space vehicle systems  = Gemini, Mercury, and Apollo = American Mercury, Gemini and Apollo spacecraft contained 100% oxygen atmospheres, suitable for short duration missions, to minimize weight and complexity. = Space Shuttle = The Space Shuttle was the first American spacecraft to have an Earth-like atmospheric mixture, comprising 22% oxygen and 78% nitrogen. For the Space Shuttle, NASA includes in the ECLSS category systems that provide both life support for the crew and environmental control for payloads. The Shuttle Reference Manual contains ECLSS sections on: Crew Compartment Cabin Pressurization, Cabin Air Revitalization, Water Coolant Loop System, Active Thermal Control System, Supply and Waste Water, Waste Collection System, Waste Water Tank, Airlock Support, Extravehicular Mobility Units, Crew Altitude Protection System, and Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator Cooling and Gaseous Nitrogen Purge for Payloads.NASA-HSF = Soyuz = The life-support system on the Soyuz spacecraft is called the Kompleks Sredstv Obespecheniya Zhiznideyatelnosti (KSOZh). Vostok, Voshkod and Soyuz contained air-like mixtures at approx 101kPa (14.7 psi). = Plug and play = The Paragon Space Development Corporation is developing a plug and play ECLSS called commercial crew transport-air revitalization system (CCT-ARS)Paragon Projects for future spacecraft partially paid for using NASA's Commercial Crew Development (CCDev) money.NASA 2010 The CCT-ARS provides seven primary spacecraft life support functions in a highly integrated and reliable system: Air temperature control, Humidity removal, Carbon dioxide removal, Trace contaminant removal, Post-fire atmospheric recovery, Air filtration, and Cabin air circulation.Paragon Press Release  Space station systems  Space station systems include technology that enables humans to live in space for a prolonged period of time. Such technology includes filtration systems for human waste disposal and air production. = Skylab = Skylab used 72% oxygen and 28% nitrogen at a total pressure of 5 psi. = Salyut and Mir = The Salyut and Mir space stations contained an air-like Oxygen and Nitrogen mixture at approximately sea-level pressures of 93.1 kPa (13.5psi) to 129 kPa (18.8 psi) with an Oxygen content of 21% to 40%. = Bigelow commercial space station = The life-support system for the Bigelow Commercial Space Station is being designed by Bigelow Aerospace in Las Vegas, Nevada. The space station will be constructed of habitable Sundancer and BA 330 expandable spacecraft modules. \\"human-in-the-loop testing of the environmental control and life- support system (ECLSS)\\" for Sundancer has begun.Bigelow Volunteers  Natural systems  Natural LSS like the Biosphere 2 in Arizona have been tested for future space travel or colonization. These systems are also known as closed ecological systems. They have the advantage of using solar energy as primary energy only and being independent from logistical support with fuel. Natural systems have the highest degree of efficiency due to integration of multiple functions. They also provide the proper ambience for humans which is necessary for a longer stay in space.  Underwater and saturation diving habitats  Underwater habitats and surface saturation accommodation facilities provide life-support for their occupants over periods of days to weeks. The occupants are constrained from immediate return to surface atmospheric pressure by decompression obligations of up to several weeks. The life support system of a surface saturation accommodation facility provides breathing gas and other services to support life for the personnel under pressure. It includes the following components: Underwater habitats differ in that the ambient external pressure is the same as internal pressure, so some engineering problems are simplified. *Gas compression, mixing and storage facilities *Chamber climate control system - control of temperature and humidity, and filtration of gas *Instrumentation, control, monitoring and communications equipment *Fire suppression systems *Sanitation systems Underwater habitats balance internal pressure with the ambient external pressure, allowing the occupants free access to the ambient environment within a specific depth range, while saturation divers accommodated in surface systems are transferred under pressure to the working depth in a closed diving bell The life support system for the bell provides and monitors the main supply of breathing gas, and the control station monitors the deployment and communications with the divers. Primary gas supply, power and communications to the bell are through a bell umbilical, made up from a number of hoses and electrical cables twisted together and deployed as a unit. This is extended to the divers through the diver umbilicals. The accommodation life support system maintains the chamber environment within the acceptable range for health and comfort of the occupants. Temperature, humidity, breathing gas quality sanitation systems and equipment function are monitored and controlled.  Experimental life-support systems  = MELiSSA = Micro-Ecological Life Support System Alternative (MELiSSA) is a European Space Agency led initiative, conceived as a micro- organisms and higher plants based ecosystem intended as a tool to gain understanding of the behaviour of artificial ecosystems, and for the development of the technology for a future regenerative life-support system for long term manned space missions. = CyBLiSS = CyBLiSS (\\"Cyanobacterium- Based Life Support Systems\\") is a concept developed by researchers from several space agencies (NASA, the German Aerospace Center and the Italian Space Agency) which would use cyanobacteria to process resources available on Mars directly into useful products, and into substrates for other key organisms of Bioregenerative life support system (BLSS). The goal is to make future manned outposts on Mars as independent of Earth as possible (explorers living \\"off the land\\"), to reduce mission costs and increase safety. Even though developed independently, CyBLiSS would be complementary to other BLSS projects (such as MELiSSA) as it can connect them to materials found on Mars, thereby making them sustainable and expandable there. Instead of relying on a closed loop, new elements found on site can be brought into the system.  See also     *  Footnotes   References     *  Further reading  * Eckart, Peter.

It has been played since ancient times, and has traditionally been favoured by scholars and literati as an instrument of great subtlety and refinement, as highlighted by the quote \\"a gentleman does not part with his qin or se without good reason,\\"Li Ji: Quli, second half Á¶ÆË®ò‚ÄßÊõ≤Á¶Æ‰∏ã. as well as being associated with the ancient Chinese philosopher Confucius. It is sometimes referred to by the Chinese as \\"the father of Chinese music\\" or \\"the instrument of the sages\\". The guqin is not to be confused with the guzheng, another Chinese long stringed instrument also without frets, but with moveable bridges under each string. Traditionally, the instrument was simply referred to as the \\"qin\\" (Áê¥)Zhang Yushu et al. Kangxi Zidian „ÄêÂ∫∑ÁÜôÂ≠óÂÖ∏„Äë. Folio 28. but by the twentieth century the term had come to be applied to many other musical instruments as well: the yangqin hammered dulcimer, the huqin family of bowed string instruments, and the Western piano are examples of this usage. The prefix \\"gu-\\" (Âè§; meaning \\"ancient\\") was later added for clarification. Thus, the instrument is called \\"guqin\\" today. It can also be called qixian-qin (‰∏ÉÁµÉÁê¥; lit. \\"seven-stringed qin\\"). Because Robert Hans van Gulik's book about the qin is called The Lore of the Chinese Lute, the guqin is sometimes inaccurately called a lute.John Thompson on the Guqin Silk String Zither (2005) Qin: Lute or Zither? (http://www.silkqin.com/11misc/lute.htm , 29 July 2006) Other incorrect classifications, mainly from music compact discs, include \\"harp\\" or \\"table- harp\\". The guqin is a very quiet instrument, with a range of about four octaves, and its open strings are tuned in the bass register. Its lowest pitch is about two octaves below middle C, or the lowest note on the cello. Sounds are produced by plucking open strings, stopped strings, and harmonics. The use of glissando‚Äîsliding tones‚Äîgives it a sound reminiscent of a pizzicato cello, fretless double bass or a slide guitar. The qin is also capable of many harmonics, of which 91 are most commonly used and indicated by the dotted positions. By tradition, the qin originally had five strings, but ancient qin- like instruments with 10 or more strings have been found. The modern form has been standardized for about two millennia. There are more than 3,360 known surviving pieces of Guqin music from ancient and imperial periods. On 7 November 2003, UNESCO announced that the Chinese Guqin was selected as an Intangible World Cultural Heritage. In 2006, Guqin was listed in the List of National Non-material Cultural Heritage in China. History A famous Tang Dynasty (618‚Äì907) qin, the \\"Jiu Xiao Huan Pei\\" Legend has it that the qin, the most revered of all Chinese musical instruments, has a history of about 5,000 years, and that the legendary figures of China's pre-history ‚Äî Fuxi, Shennong and Huang Di, the \\"Yellow Emperor\\" ‚Äî were involved in its creation. Nearly all qin books and tablature collections published prior to the twentieth century state this as the actual origins of the qin,Yin, Wei. Zhongguo Qinshi Yanyi „Äê‰∏≠ÂõΩÁê¥Âè≤Êºî‰πâ„Äë. Pages 1-10. although this is now viewed as mythology. It is mentioned in Chinese writings dating back nearly 3,000 years, and examples have been found in tombs from about 2,500 years ago. The exact origins of the qin is still a very much continuing subject of debate over the past few decades. In 1977, a recording of \\"Flowing Water\\" (Liu Shui, as performed by Guan Pinghu, one of the best qin players of the 20th century) was chosen to be included in the Voyager Golden Record, a gold-plated LP recording containing music from around the world, which was sent into outer space by NASA on the Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 spacecraft. It is the longest excerpt included on the disc. The reason to select a work played on this specific instrument is because the tonal structure of the instrument, its musical scale, is derived from fundamental physical laws related to vibration and overtones, representing the intellectual capacity of human beings on this subject. In 2003, guqin music was proclaimed as one of the Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity by UNESCO.United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (2004) The Art of Guqin Music (http://www.unesco.org/culture/intangible-heritage/masterpiece.php?id=65‚â∂=en, 29 July 2006) =Guqin literature= There are a number of ancient sources that discuss qin lore, qin theory and general qin literature. Some of these books are available inserted into certain qinpu (qin tablature collections). The basic contents of qin literature are mainly essays discussing and describing the nature of qin music, the theory behind the notes and tones, the method of correct play, the history of qin music, lists of mentions in literature, etc. The detail can be very concise to extremely detailed and thorough. Some are mostly philosophical or artistic musings, others are scientific and technical. Schools, societies and players Song emperor Huizong (1082‚Äì1135) As with any other musical tradition, there are differences in ideals and interaction between different people. Therefore, there exist different schools and societies which transmit these different ideas and artistic traditions. =Historical schools= Many qin schools known as qin pai developed over the centuries. Such schools generally formed around areas where qin activity was greatest. Some schools have come and gone, and some have offshoots (such as the Mei'an school, a Zhucheng school offshoot). Often, the school is originated from a single person, such as the Wu school which is named after the late Wu Zhaoji. The style can vary considerably between schools; some are very similar, yet others are very distinct. The differences are often in the interpretation of the music. Northern schools tend to be more vigorous in technique than Southern schools. But in modern terms, the distinction between schools and styles is often blurred because a single player may learn from many different players from different schools and absorb each of their styles. This is especially so for conservatory trained players. People from the same school trained under the same master may have different individual styles (such as Zhang Ziqian and Liu Shaochun of the Guangling school). =Guqin societies= There is a difference between qin schools and qin societies. The former concerns itself with transmission of a style, the latter concerns itself with performance. The qin society will encourage meetings with fellow qin players in order to play music and maybe discuss the nature of the qin. A gathering like this is called a yaji (ÈõÖÈõÜ, literally \\"elegant gathering\\"), and takes place once every month or two. Sometimes, societies may go on excursions to places of natural beauty to play qin, or attend conferences. They may also participate in competitions or research. Of course, societies do not have to have a strict structure to adhere to; it could mostly be on a leisurely basis. The main purpose of qin societies is to promote and play qin music. It is often a good opportunity to network and learn to play the instrument, to ask questions and to receive answers. =Players= Many artists down through the ages have played the instrument, and the instrument was a favourite of scholars. Certain melodies are also associated with famous figures, such as Confucius and Qu Yuan. Some emperors of China also had a liking to the qin, including the Song dynasty emperor, Huizong, as clearly seen in his own painting of himself playing the qin in \\"Ting Qin Tu\\".ËÅΩÁê¥Âúñ, Listening to the QinYang, Xin et al.

Wuzhi Zhai Qinpu „Äê‰∫îÁü•ÈΩãÁê¥Ë≠ú„Äë. Volume 1, folio 1, leaf 18-28. Contemporary Contemporary qin players extend from the early twentieth century to the present. More so than in the past, such players tend to have many different pursuits and occupations other than qin playing. There are only a few players who are paid to exclusively play and research the guqin professionally and nothing else. Qin players can also be well-versed in other cultural pursuits, such as the arts. Or they can do independent research on music subjects. Often, players may play other instruments (not necessary Chinese) and give recitals or talks. Performance The note range of a qin During the performance of qin, musicians may use a variety of techniques to reach the full expressing potential of the instrument. There are many special tablatures that had developed over the centuries specifically dedicated to qin for their reference and a repertoire of popular and ancient tunes for their choice. =Playing technique= The tones of qin can be categorized as three characteristic \\"sounds\\". The first type is san yin (Êï£Èü≥), which literally means \\"scattered sound\\". It's the fundamental frequency produced by plucking a free string with the fingers of the right hand. (). The second type, made by plucking a string with the right hand and gently tapping specific note positions on the string with the left hand, will create a crisp sound () named fan yin (Ê≥õÈü≥), or overtone harmonics. Important scale notes, called hui and marked by 13 glossy white dots made of mica or seashell inset in the front surface of the qin, occur at integer divisions of the string length. The \\"crystal concordant\\" (perfectly harmonic) overtones can only be evoked by tapping the strings precisely at these hui. The third type is an yin (ÊåâÈü≥ / Ê°àÈü≥ / ÂØ¶Èü≥ / Ëµ∞Èü≥), or \\"changing sounds\\". These comprise the major cadences of most qin pieces. To play an yin, the musician stops a string at a specific pitch on the board surface with the left thumb, middle or ring finger, strikes the string with the right hand, then slides the left hand up and down to vary the note. This technique is similar to playing a slide guitar across the player's lap. However, the manipulation of qin is much more multifarious than that of a guitar, which has only around 3 or 4 main techniques. (). According to the book Cunjian Guqin Zhifa Puzi Jilan, there are around 1,070 different finger techniques used for the qin. Thus the qin is possibly the instrument with the most playing techniques in both the Chinese and Western instrument families.Guo, Ping. Guqin Congtan „ÄêÂè§Áê¥‰∏õË∞à„Äë. Page 112. Most of the qin's techniques are obsolete, but around 50 of them still appear in modern performance.

Written qin music did not directly tell what notes were played; instead, it was written in a tablature detailing tuning, finger positions, and stroke technique, thus comprising a step by step method and description of how to play a piece. Some tablatures do indicate notes using the gongche system, or indicate rhythm using dots. The earliest example of the modern shorthand tablature survives from around the twelfth century CE. An earlier form of music notation from the Tang era survives in just one manuscript, dated to the seventh century CE, called Jieshi Diao Youlan„ÄäÁ¢£Áü≥Ë™øÂπΩËò≠„Äã (Solitary Orchid in Stone Tablet Mode). It is written in a longhand form called wenzi pu (ÊñáÂ≠óË≠ú) (literally \\"written notation\\"), said to have been created by Yong MenzhouÈõçÈñÄÂë® during the Warring States period, which gives all the details using ordinary written Chinese characters. Later in the Tang dynasty, Cao RouÊõπÊüî and others simplified the notation, using only the important elements of the characters (like string number, plucking technique, hui number and which finger to stop the string) and combined them into one character notation. This meant that instead of having two lines of written text to describe a few notes, a single character could represent one note, or sometimes as many as nine. This notation form was called jianzi pu (Ê∏õÂ≠óË≠ú) (literally \\"reduced notation\\") and it was a major advance in qin notation. It was so successful that from the Ming dynasty onwards, a great many qinpu (Áê¥Ë≠ú) (qin tablature collections) appeared, the most famous and useful being \\"Shenqi Mipu\\" (The Mysterious and Marvellous Tablature) compiled by Zhu Quan, the 17th son of the founder of the Ming dynasty.Zhu, Quan. Shenqi Mipu „ÄêÁ•ûÁ´íÁßòË≠ú„Äë. In the 1960s, Zha Fuxi discovered more than 130 qinpu that contain well over 3360 pieces of written music. Sadly, many qinpu compiled before the Ming dynasty are now lost, and many pieces have remained unplayed for hundreds of years.Zha, Fuxi. Cunjian Guqin Qupu Jilan „ÄêÂ≠òË¶ãÂè§Áê¥Êõ≤Ë≠úËºØË¶Ω„Äë. Pages 3-44. =Repertoire= The Qinxue Rumen „ÄêÁê¥Â≠∏ÂÖ•ÈñÄ„Äë (1864) tablature has dots and gongche notation next to the qin tablature to indicate beats and notes. Qin pieces are usually around three to eight minutes in length, with the longest being \\"Guangling San\\",„ÄäÂª£ÈôµÊï£„Äã which is 22 minutes long. Other famous pieces include \\"Liu Shui\\" (Flowing Water), \\"Yangguan San Die\\"„ÄäÈôΩÈóú‰∏âÁñä/Èò≥ÂÖ≥‰∏âÂè†„Äã (Three Refrains on the Yang Pass Theme), \\"Meihua San Nong\\"„ÄäÊ¢ÖËä±‰∏âÂºÑ„Äã (Three Variations on the Plum Blossom Theme), \\"Xiao Xiang Shui Yun\\"„ÄäÁÄüÊπòÊ∞¥Èõ≤„Äã (Mist and Clouds over the Xiao and Xiang Rivers), and \\"Pingsha Luo Yan\\"„ÄäÂπ≥Ê≤ôËêΩÈõÅ„Äã (Wild Geese Descending on the Sandbank). The average player will generally have a repertoire of around ten pieces which they will aim to play very well, learning new pieces as and when they feel like it or if the opportunity arises. Players mainly learn popular well-transcribed versions, often using a recording as a reference. In addition to learning to play established or ancient pieces very well, highly skilled qin players may also compose or improvise, although the player must be very good and extremely familiar with the instrument to do this successfully. A number of qin melodies are program music depicting the natural world. Transcription Dapu (ÊâìË≠ú) is the transcribing of old tablature into a playable form. Since qin tablature does not indicate note value, tempo or rhythm, the player must work it out for themselves. Normally, qin players will learn the rhythm of a piece through a teacher or master. They sit facing one another, with the student copying the master. The tablature will only be consulted if the teacher is not sure of how to play a certain part. Because of this, traditional qinpu do not indicate them (though near the end of the Qing dynasty, a handful of qinpu had started to employ various rhythm indicating devices, such as dots). If one did not have a teacher, then one had to work out the rhythm by themselves. But it would be a mistake to assume that qin music is devoid of rhythm and melody. By the 20th century, there had been attempts to try to replace the \\"jianzi pu\\" notation, but so far, it has been unsuccessful; since the 20th century, qin music is generally printed with staff notation above the qin tablature. Because qin tablature is so useful, logical, easy, and the fastest way (once the performer knows how to read the notation) of learning a piece, it is invaluable to the qin player and cannot totally be replaced (just as staff notation cannot be replaced for Western instruments, because they developed a notation system that suited the instruments well). The Qinxue Congshu „ÄêÁê¥Â≠∏Âè¢Êõ∏„Äë (1910) uses a more detailed system involving a grid next to main qin notation; right grid line indicates note, middle indicates the beat, left indicates how the qin tablature relates to the rhythm. There is a saying that goes \\"a short piece requires three months [of dapu to complete], and a long piece requires three years\\". In actual practice, it needn't be that long to dapu a piece, but suggests that the player will have not only memorised the piece off by heart, but also have their fingering, rhythm and timing corrected. And afterwards, the emotion must be put into the piece. Therefore, it could be said that it really does require three months or years to finish dapu of a piece in order for them to play it to a very high standard. Rhythm in qin music It has already been discussed that qin music has a rhythm and that it is only vaguely indicated in the tablature.A more detailed analysis can be found here Though there is an amount of guesswork involved, the tablature has clues to indicate rhythm, such as repeating motifs, an indication of phrases or how the notation is arranged. Throughout the history of the qinpu, we see many attempts to indicate this rhythm more explicitly, involving devices like dots to make beats. Probably, one of the major projects to regulate the rhythm to a large scale was the compilers of the Qinxue Congshu tablature collection of the 1910s to 1930s. The construction of the written tablature was divided into two columns. The first was further divided into about three lines of a grid, each line indicating a varied combination of lyrics, gongche tablature, se tablature, pitch, and/or beats depending on the score used. The second column was devoted to qin tablature. Western composers have noticed that the rhythm in a piece of qin music can change; once they seem to have got a beat, the beats change. This is due to the fact that qin players may use some free rhythm in their playing. Whatever beat they use will depend on the emotion or the feeling of the player, and how they interpret the piece. However, some melodies have sections of fixed rhythm which are played the same way generally. The main theme of Meihua Sannong, for example, uses this. Some sections of certain melodies require the player to play faster with force to express the emotion of the piece. Examples include the middle sections of Guangling San and Xiaoxiang Shuiyun. Other pieces, such as Jiu Kuang has a fixed rhythm throughout the entire piece. Organology A qin tablature collection \\"Qinxue Congshu\\" While acoustics dictated the general form and construction of the guqin, its external form could and did take on a huge amount of variation, whether it be from the embellishments or even the basic structure of the instrument. Qin tablatures from the Song era onwards have catalogued a plethora of qin forms. All, however, obey very basic rules of acoustics and symbolism of form. The qin uses strings of silk or metal-nylon and is tuned in accordance to traditional principles. Ancient guqins were made of little more than wood and strings of twisted silk. Ornaments included inlaid dots of mother-of-pearl or other similar materials. Traditionally, the sound board was made of Chinese parasol wood firmiana simplex, its rounded shape symbolising the heavens. The bottom was made of Chinese Catalpa, Catalpa ovata, its flat shape symbolising earth. Modern instruments are most frequently made of Cunninghamia or other similar timbers. The traditional finish is of raw lacquer mixed with powdered deer horn, and the finishing process could take months of curing to complete. The finish develops cracks over time, and these cracks are believed to improve the instrument's sound as the wood and lacquer release tension. An antique guqin's age can be determined by this snake like crack pattern called \\"duanwen\\" (Êñ∑Á¥ã). =Construction= According to tradition, the qin originally had five strings, representing the five elements of metal, wood, water, fire and earth. Later, in the Zhou dynasty, Zhou Wen Wang added a sixth string to mourn his son, Boyikao. His successor, Zhou Wu Wang, added a seventh string to motivate his troops into battle with the Shang. The thirteen hui„ÄéÂæΩ„Äè on the surface represent the 13 months of the year (the extra 13th is the 'leap month' in the lunar calendar). The surface board is round to represent Heaven and the bottom board flat to represent the earth. The entire length of the qin (in Chinese measurements) is 3 chi, 6 cun and 5 fen;ff„Äå‰∏âÂ∞∫ÂÖ≠ÂØ∏‰∫îÂàÜ„Äç representing the 365 days of the year (though this is just a standard since qins can be shorter or longer depending on the period's measurement standard or the maker's preference). Each part of the qin has meaning, some more obvious, like \\"dragon pool\\"„ÄéÈæçÊ±†/ÈæôÊ±†„Äè and \\"phoenix pond\\".„ÄéÈ≥≥Ê≤º/Âá§Ê≤º„Äè Names of (from left to right) the front, inside and back parts of the qin =Strings= ËÜ†), (‰∏äÈü≥ÁâåÁê¥Âº¶) Shangyin Shanghai Conservatorie Quality Qin Strings (metal-nylon), (Ëôé‰∏òÂè§Áê¥ÁµÉ) Huqiu Silk Strings Until recently, the guqin's strings were always made of various thicknesses of twisted silk, but since then most players use modern nylon-flatwound steel strings. This was partly due to the scarcity of high-quality silk strings and partly due to the newer strings' greater durability and louder tone. Silk strings are made by gathering a prescribed number of strands of silk thread, then twisting them tightly together. The twisted cord of strings is then wrapped around a frame and immersed in a vat of liquid composed of a special mixture of natural glue that binds the strands together. The strings are taken out and left to dry, before being cut into the appropriate length. The top thicker strings (i.e. strings one to four) are further wrapped in a thin silk thread, coiled around the core to make it smoother. According to ancient manuals, there are three distinctive gauges of thickness that one can make the strings. The first is taigu„ÄñÂ§™Âè§„Äó [Great Antiquity] which is the standard gauge, the zhongqing„Äñ‰∏≠Ê∏Ö„Äó [Middle Clarity] is thinner, whilst the jiazhong„ÄñÂä†Èáç„Äó [Added Thickness] is thicker. According to the Yugu Zhai Qinpu, zhongqing is the best. The currently used silk string gauge standard was defined by Suzhou silk string maker Pan Guohui (ÊΩòÂúãËºù). Although most contemporary players use nylon-wrapped metal strings, some argue that nylon-wrapped metal strings cannot replace silk strings for their refinement of tone. Additionally, nylon-wrapped metal strings can cause damage to the wood of old qins. Many traditionalists feel that the sound of the fingers of the left hand sliding on the strings to be a distinctive feature of qin music. The modern nylon-wrapped metal strings were very smooth in the past, but are now slightly modified in order to capture these sliding sounds. Around 2007, a new type of strings were produced made of mostly a nylon core coiled with nylon like the metal-nylon strings, possibly in imitation of Western catgut strings.John Thompson: Misuse of the words \\"silk strings\\" The sound is similar to the metal-nylon strings but without the metallic tone to them (one of the main reasons why traditionalists do not like the metal-nylon strings). The nylon strings can be tuned to standard pitch without breaking and can sustain their tuning whatever the climate, unlike silk. The strings have various names in China, but they are advertised as sounding like silk strings prior to the 1950s, when silk string production stopped. Traditionally, the strings were wrapped around the goose feet,„ÄéÈõÅË∂≥„ÄèGong, Yi. Guqin Yanzhoufa „ÄêÂè§Áê¥ÊºîÂ•èÊ≥ï„Äë. Page 11 and 13. but a device has been invented, which is a block of wood attached to the goose feet, with pins similar to those used to tune the guzheng protruding out at the sides, so one can string and tune the qin using a tuning wrench. This is good for those who lack the physical strength to pull and add tension to the strings when wrapping the ends around the goose feet. However, the tuning device looks rather unsightly and thus many qin players prefer the traditional manner of tuning; many also feel that the strings should be firmly wrapped around the goose feet in order that the sound may be \\"grounded\\" into the qin; and some feel that the device which covers the phoenix pond sound hole has a negative effect on the sound volume and quality. Tuning A painting by Chen Hongshou of a person with a qin. To string a qin, one traditionally had to tie a fly's head knot (yingtou jie„ÄéË†ÖÈ†≠Áµê/ËùáÂ§¥Áªì„Äè) at one end of the string, and slip the string through the twisted cord (rongkou„ÄéÁµ®ÂâÖ/ÁªíÊâ£„Äè) which goes into holes at the head of the qin and then out the bottom through the tuning pegs (zhen„ÄéËª´/ËΩ∏„Äè). The string is dragged over the bridge (yueshan „ÄéÂ≤≥Â±±„Äè), across the surface board, over the nut (longyin„ÄéÈæçÈΩ¶„Äè dragon gums) to the back of the qin, where the end is wrapped around one of two legs (fengzu„ÄéÈ≥≥Ë∂≥„Äè \\"phoenix feet\\" or yanzu„ÄéÈõÅË∂≥„Äè \\"geese feet\\"). Afterwards, the strings are fine-tuned using the tuning pegs (sometimes, rosin is used on the part of the tuning peg that touches the qin body to stop it from slipping, especially if the qin is tuned to higher pitches). The most common tuning, \\"zheng diao\\" „ÄàÊ≠£Ë™ø„Äâ, is pentatonic: 5 6 1 2 3 5 6 (which can be also played as 1 2 4 5 6 1 2) in the traditional Chinese number system or jianpu„ÄîÁ∞°Ë≠ú/ÁÆÄË∞±„Äï (i.e. 1=do, 2=re, etc.). Today this is generally interpreted to mean C D F G A c d, but this should be considered sol la do re mi sol la, since historically the qin was not tuned to absolute pitch. Other tunings are achieved by adjusting the tension of the strings using the tuning pegs at the head end. Thus manjiao diao„ÄàÊÖ¢ËßíË™ø„Äâ (\\"slackened third string\\") gives 1 2 3 5 6 1 2 and ruibin diao„ÄàËï§Ë≥îË™ø/Ëï§ÂÆæË∞É„Äâ (\\"raised fifth string\\") gives 1 2 4 5 7 1 2, which is transposed to 2 3 5 6 1 2 3. Playing context The guqin is nearly always used a solo instrument, as its quietness of tone means that it cannot compete with the sounds of most other instruments or an ensemble. It can, however, be played together with a xiao (end-blown bamboo flute), with other qin, or played while singing. In old times, the se (a long zither with movable bridges and 25 strings) was frequently used in duets with the qin. Sadly, the se has not survived, though duet tablature scores for the instruments are preserved in a few qinpu, and the master qin player Wu Jingl√ºe was one of only a few in the twentieth century who knew how to play it together with qin in duet. Lately there has been a trend to use other instruments to accompany the qin, such as the xun (ceramic ocarina), pipa (four-stringed pear-shaped lute), dizi (transverse bamboo flute), and others for more experimental purposes. In order for an instrument to accompany the qin, its sound must be mellow and not overwhelm the qin. Thus, the xiao generally used for this purpose is one pitched in the key of F, known as qin xiao „ÄåÁê¥Á∞´„Äç, which is narrower than an ordinary xiao. If one sings to qin songs (which is rare nowadays) then one should not sing in an operatic or folk style as is common in China, but rather in a very low pitched and deep way; and the range in which one should sing should not exceed one and a half octaves. The style of singing is similar to that used to recite Tang poetry. To enjoy qin songs, one must learn to become accustomed to the eccentric style some players may sing their songs to, like in the case of Zha Fuxi. Traditionally, the qin was played in a quiet studio or room by oneself, or with a few friends; or played outdoors in places of outstanding natural beauty. Nowadays, many qin players perform at concerts in large concert halls, almost always, out of necessity, using electronic pickups or microphones to amplify the sound. Many qin players attend yajis, at which a number of qin players, music lovers, or anyone with an interest in Chinese culture can come along to discuss and play the qin. In fact, the yaji originated as a multi-media gathering involving the four arts: qin, Go, calligraphy, and painting. =Ritual use of the qin= Being an instrument associated with scholars, the guqin was also played in a ritual context, especially in yayue in China, and aak in Korea. The National Center for Korean Traditional Performing Arts continues to perform Munmyo jeryeak (Confucian ritual music), using the last two surviving aak melodies from the importation of yayue from the Song Dynasty emperor Huizong in 1116, including in the ensemble the seul (se) and geum (Í∏à; qin). The Korean geum used in this context has evolved to be slightly different when compared to the normal qin in that there are 14 instead of 13 hui and that they are not placed correctly according to the harmonic positions besides other different construction features. The finger techniques are more closer to gayageum technique than it is to the complex ones of the qin. As the qin never gained a following in Korean society, the ritual geum became the fossilised form of it and to all intents and purposes unplayable for a qin player. The Korean scholars never adopted the qin but instead created their own instrument, the geomungo (ÁéÑÁê¥), which adopted much of the qin's lore and aesthetics and essentially taking the qin's place as the scholars' instrument. In China, the qin was still in use in ritual ceremonies of the imperial court, such can be seen in the court paintings of imperial sacrifices of the Qing court (e.g. The Yongzheng Emperor Offering Sacrifices at the Altar of the God of Agriculture,„ÄäÈõçÊ≠£Á•≠ÂÖàËæ≤Â£áÂúñ„Äã 1723‚Äì35).Rawski, E. Evelyn & Rawson, Jessica (ed.). CHINA: The Three Emperors 1662‚Äî1795. Pages 117, 126 and 127. The qin also have many variations with a different number of strings, such as during Song Taizong's reign, but these variations never survived the changes of dynasty and so today the normal qin is used. In Japan, the qin was never adopted into ritual music, but for a time in the late Edo period the qin was adopted by some scholars and Buddhist monks. The guqin was also used in the ritual music of Vietnam, where it was called c·∫ßm. =Qin aesthetics= When the qin is played, a number of aesthetic elements are involved. The first is musicality. In the second section of \\"Pingsha Luoyan\\", for example, the initial few bars contain a nao vibrato followed by a phase of sliding up and down the string, even when the sound has already become inaudible (). The average person trained in music may question whether this is really \\"music\\". Normally, some players would pluck the string very lightly to create a very quiet sound. For some players, this plucking isn't necessary. Instead of trying to force a sound out of the string one should allow the natural sounds emit from the strings. Some players say that the sliding on the string even when the sound has disappeared is a distinctive feature in qin music. It creates a \\"space\\" or \\"void\\" in a piece, playing without playing, sound without sound. In fact, when the viewer looks at the player sliding on the string without sounds, the viewer automatically \\"fills in the notes\\" with their minds. This creates a connection between player, instrument and listener. This, of course, cannot happen when listening to a recording, as one cannot see the performer. It can also be seen as impractical in recording, as the player would want to convey sound as much as possible towards a third audience. But in fact, there is sound, the sound coming from the fingers sliding on the string. With a really good qin, silk strings, and a perfectly quiet environment, all the tones can be sounded. Since the music is more player-oriented than listener oriented, and the player knows the music, he/she can hear it even if the sound is not there. With silk strings, the sliding sound might be called the qi or \\"life force\\" of the music. The really empty sounds are the pauses between notes. However, if one cannot create a sound that can be heard when sliding on a string, it is generally acceptable to lightly pluck the string to create a very quiet sound.London Youlan Qin Society (2004) Yaji 5 September 2004, 29 July 2006 In popular culture Xu Kuanghua playing an ancient qin in the film Hero. As a symbol of high culture, the qin has been used as a prop in much of Chinese popular culture to varying degrees of accuracy. References are made to the qin in a variety of media including TV episodes and films. Actors often possess limited knowledge on how to play the instrument and instead they mime it to a pre-recorded piece by a qin player. Sometimes the music is erroneously mimed to guzheng music, rather than qin music. A more faithful representation of the qin is in the Zhang Yimou film Hero, in which Xu Kuanghua plays an ancient version of the qin in the courtyard scenechina.org.cn (2003) Guqin Master Xu Kuanghua (http://www.china.org.cn/english/NM-e/55853.htm, 10 January 2009) while Nameless and Long Sky fight at a weiqi parlor. In fact, it is mimed to the music played by Liu Li, formerly a professor at the Central Conservatory of Music in Beijing.china.org.cn (2002) Composer Achieves Goal with 'Hero' Score (http://www.china.org.cn/english/NM-e/51029.htm, 29 July 2006) It is suggested that Xu made the qin himself.China Info Travel (2002) Guqin Master Xu Kuanghua (29 July 2006) The qin was also featured in the 2008 Summer Olympics Opening Ceremony in Beijing, played by Chen Leiji (Èô≥Èõ∑ÊøÄ). The qin is also used in many classical Chinese novels, such as Cao Xueqin's Dream of the Red Chamber and various others. The qin is also used in many contemporary Chinese novels, notably the 2016 novel Mo Dao Zu Shi. Electric guqin The electric guqin was first developed in the late 20th century by adding electric guitar‚Äìstyle magnetic pickups to a regular acoustic guqin, allowing the instrument to be amplified through an instrument amplifier or PA system. Related instruments The Japanese ichigenkin, a monochord zither, is believed to be derived from the qin. The qin handbook Lixing Yuanya (1618„ÄêÁêÜÊÄßÂÖÉÈõÖ„Äë) includes some melodies for a one-string qin, and the Wuzhi Zhai Qinpu contains a picture and description of such an instrument.Zhou, Zi'an. Wuzhi Zhai Qinpu „Äê‰∫îÁü•ÈΩãÁê¥Ë≠ú„Äë. Volume 1, folio 2, leaf 10. The modern ichigenkin apparently first appeared in Japan just after that time. However, the honkyoku„ÄîÊú¨Êõ≤„Äï (standard repertoire) of the ichigenkin today most closely resembles that of the shamisen. The Korean geomungo may also be related, albeit distantly. Korean literati wanted to play an instrument the way their Chinese counterparts played the qin. The repertoire was largely the geomungo parts for melodies played by the court orchestra.

The modern guzheng commonly has 21, 25 or 26 strings, is long, and is tuned in a major pentatonic scale. It has a large, resonant soundboard made from Paulownia wood. Other components are often made from other woods for structural or decorative reasons. Guzheng players often wear fingerpicks made from materials such as plastic, resin, tortoiseshell, or ivory on one or both hands. The guzheng is ancestral to several other Asian zithers such as the Japanese koto, the Korean gayageum and ajaeng, Mongolian yatga, the Vietnamese ƒë√†n tranh, the Sundanese kacapi and the Kazakhstan jetigen. The guzheng should not be confused with the guqin, a Chinese zither with 7 strings played without moveable bridges. The guzheng has gone through many changes during its long history. The oldest specimen yet discovered held 13 strings and was dated to around 500 BC, possibly during the Warring States period (475‚Äì221 BC). The guzheng became prominent during the Qin dynasty (221‚Äì206 BC). By the Tang Dynasty (618‚Äì907 AD) the guzheng may have been the most commonly played instrument in China. Origin The number of strings on the Guzheng has gradually increased over its 2,000 year history. There are varied accounts for how the guzheng came to be. An early guzheng-like instrument is said to have been invented by Meng Tian, a general of the Qin dynasty (221‚Äì206 BC), largely influenced by the se. Some believe the guzheng was originally developed as a bamboo-tube zither as recorded in the Shuowen Jiezi, which was later redesigned and made from larger curved wooden boards and movable bridges. A third legend says the guzheng came about when two people fought over a 25-string se. They broke it in half, one person receiving a 12-string part and another the 13-string part. Strings were once made of silk. During the Qing dynasty (1644‚Äì1912) the strings transitioned to bare wire such as brass. Modern strings are almost always steel coated in nylon. First introduced in the 1970s these multi-material strings increased the instrument's volume while maintaining an acceptable timbre. The guzheng is often decorated. Artists create unique cultural and artistic content on the instrument. Decorations include carved art, carved lacquer, straw, mother-of-pearl inlays, painting, poetry, calligraphy, shell carving (jade) and cloisonn√©. Schools and styles There are distinct northern and southern playing styles, each comprising schools specific to a region. The northern style includes the Henan, Shaanxi, Shandong, and Zhejiang regional schools. The southern style includes the Chaozhou, Hakka, and Fujian regional schools. Pieces in the northern style include High Mountain and Running River and Autumn Moon over the Han Palace, both from the Shandong school. Southern style pieces include Jackdaw Plays with Water () from the Chaozhou school, and Lotus Emerging from Water () from the Hakka school. Many pieces composed since the 1950s use new techniques and also mix elements from both northern and southern styles, ultimately creating a new modern school. Techniques Woman playing guzheng The guzheng is plucked by the fingers with or without plectra. Most modern players use plectra that are attached to up to four fingers on each hand. Ancient picks were made of mundane materials such as bamboo, bone, and animal teeth or by finer materials such as ivory, tortoiseshell, and jade. Traditional playing styles use the right hand to pluck notes and the left hand to add ornamentation such as pitch slides and vibrato by pressing the strings to the left of the movable bridges. Modern styles use both hands to play on the right side of the strings. There are many techniques used to strike notes. One iconic sound is a tremolo produced by the right thumb rotating rapidly around the same note. New techniques include playing harmony and counterpoint with the left hand. Pieces in the new style include Harvest Celebration (, Zhao Yuzhai, 1955), Fighting the Typhoon (, Wang Changyuan, 1965) and the guzheng concerto Fantasia of Miluo River (Li Huanzhi, 1984). A modern playing technique, influenced by Western music, uses the left hand to provide harmony and bass notes; this gives the guzheng a more flexible musical range, permitting harmonic progression. It has its limitations, preventing the subtle ornamentation provided by the left hand in traditional music. Guzheng students who take the Central Conservatory of Music examinations are required to learn traditional and modern pieces. Notable people Notable 20th-century players and teachers include Wang Xunzhi (, 1899‚Äì1972), who popularized the Wulin zheng school based in Hangzhou, Zhejiang; Lou Shuhua, who rearranged a traditional guzheng piece and named it Yu Zhou Chang Wan; Liang Tsai-Ping (1911‚Äì2000), who edited the first guzheng manual (Nizheng Pu) in 1938; Cao Dongfu (1898‚Äì1970), from Henan; Gao Zicheng (born 1918) and Zhao Yuzhai (born 1924), both from Shandong; Su Wenxian (1907‚Äì1971); Guo Ying (born 1914) and Lin Maogen (born 1929), both from Chaozhou; the Hakka Luo Jiuxiang (1902‚Äì1978) and Cao Guifen and Cao Zheng (, 1920‚Äì1998), both of whom trained in the Henan school. The Cao family of Henan are known as masters of the guzheng. Notable 21st-century Chinese guzheng players include Xiang Sihua, Wang Zhongshan, Yuan Sha, Chang Jing and Funa. Although most guzheng music is Chinese classical music, the American composer Lou Harrison (1917‚Äì2003) played and composed for the instrument. Contemporary guzheng works have also been written by the non-Chinese composers Halim El- Dabh, Kevin Austin, David Vayo, Simon Steen-Andersen, and Jon Foreman. Zhang Yan (Âº†Ááï, 1945‚Äì1996) played the guzheng, performing and recording with Asian American jazz bandleader Jon Jang. Other musicians playing in non-traditional styles include Wu Fei, Xu Fengxia, Randy Raine-Reusch, Mohamed Faizal b. Mohamed Salim, Mei Han, Bei Bei He, Zi Lan Liao, Levi Chen, Andreas Vollenweider, Jaron Lanier, Mike Hovancsek, Chih-Lin Chou, Liu Le and David Sait. Koto player Brett Larner developed innovative works for the guzheng and played the instrument in a duet with electronic musician Samm Bennett on his CD Itadakimasu. In popular culture Guzheng in a Chinese New Year celebration (2016) in Dublin, Ireland In the television drama series My Fair Princess, actress Ruby Lin's character Xia Ziwei plays the guzheng (although she mimes to the music). It is featured in the 1980 pop hit, \\"Everybody's Got to Learn Sometime\\", by the Korgis. More Chinese guzheng in a shop In the film Kung Fu Hustle, the assassins known as The Harpists play a long zither to generate bladed and percussive attacks. The instrument has raised bridges like a guzheng but its body is shaped like a guqin. The sound is that of a guzheng. The guzheng has been used in rock music by Chinese performer Wang Yong of Cui Jian, the English musician Jakko Jakszyk (on the 2011 Jakszyk, Fripp & Collins album A Scarcity of Miracles), J.B. Brubaker of August Burns Red on \\"Creative Captivity\\" from the 2013 album Rescue & Restore, and the virtual band Gorillaz on \\"Hong Kong\\" (from the 2005 Help! A Day in the Life compilation). Jerusalem- based multi-instrumentalist Bradley Fish used the guzheng with a rock- influenced style and electronic effects on his 1996 collaboration, \\"The Aquarium Conspiracy\\" (with Sugarcubes/Bj√∂rk drummer Sigtryggur Baldursson), and is the most widely recorded artist of loops for the instrument. Mandopop singer-songwriter and music producer Lay Zhang is known for using traditional Chinese instruments such as the guzheng.

She was the first ship named for Thomas Holdup Stevens. She was laid down at Quincy, Massachusetts, on 20 September 1917 by the Fore River Shipbuilding Corporation. The ship was launched on 13 January 1918, sponsored by Miss Marie Christie Stevens. The destroyer was commissioned at Boston on 24 May 1918, Commander Rufus F. Zogbaum, Jr., in command. Service history Stevens departed Boston on 3 June, and arrived in New York two days later. On 15 June, she sailed for Europe in the screen of a convoy and reached Brest, France, on 27 June. The following day, she headed for Queenstown in Ireland, arriving there on 6 July. Assigned to the United States Naval Forces, Europe, Stevens operated out of that port and protected convoys on the Queenstown-Liverpool circuit until mid-December. She put to sea on 16 December and, after stops at the Azores and Bermuda, entered Boston on 3 January 1919. Upon her return to the United States, the destroyer was assigned to Destroyer Division 7, Squadron 3, Atlantic Fleet. In the spring of 1919, she cruised to Key West, Florida, and visited New York, before getting underway from Boston on 3 May to participate in the support operations for the first successful transatlantic flight. She put into Halifax, Nova Scotia, on 4 May and stood out again five days later to guard for the Navy seaplanes' flight to Newfoundland. After returning to Halifax on 11 May, she put to sea and, by 19 May, reached Ponta Delgada, in the Azores. Along the way, she assisted in the search for one of the two downed planes, NC-3. She completed her mission at Boston on 8 June, and a month later, shifted to Newport, Rhode Island, for normal operations. She visited the southeastern coast of the United States during the fall and early winter of 1919 and was at Philadelphia from 17 December 1919 to 1 June 1920. Stevens operated off the New England coast until 3 November 1921, when she set course for Charleston, South Carolina. The destroyer returned to Philadelphia on 8 April 1922 for inactivation.

A pace bowler, his round-arm action \\"not unlike\\" that of former fast bowler Jeff Thomson. He was spotted in the nets by Brian Lara and was called up for his Test debut against Sri Lanka after just one match for Barbados. Despite a promising start to his Test career, he has been injury prone and inconsistent. With an average of just under 40 in Test cricket, he has struggled to fulfil his early potential. He is the half brother of Pedro Collins. Domestic and T20 franchise career The experienced campaigner who also plays in the Bangladesh Premier League was bought by Rajasthan Royals in players auction for IPL 2013 for US $210,000. On 6 February 2009 the IPL franchise of Deccan Chargers bought Edwards for $150,000. His club team in Barbados is YMPC. Edwards was bought for $60,000 by Khulna Royal Bengals to play in the newly formed Bangladesh Premier League to be held in February 2012. Edwards made his first-class debut on 1 February 2002, playing for Barbados against the Windward Islands. In the first innings he opened the bowling with Tino Best; he had to wait until the second to take his only wicket in the match, that of Junior Murray. The Barbados squad had plenty of fast bowlers, with the likes of Best, Pedro Collins, Corey Collymore, Vasbert Drakes, and Ian Bradshaw, who all had international experience by mid-2003. On 3 June 2018, he was selected to play for the Winnipeg Hawks in the players' draft for the inaugural edition of the Global T20 Canada tournament. He was the leading wicket-taker in the tournament for the Winnipeg Hawks, with eleven dismissals in six matches. In July 2020, he was named in the Jamaica Tallawahs squad for the 2020 Caribbean Premier League. International career =Impressive debuts= Strong competition and injury meant Edwards struggled for selection. However, the selectors had monitored his development and in May that year Edwards impressed batsman Brian Lara while bowling in the nets. On the basis of the potential he showed, Edwards was included for the West Indies Test against Sri Lanka the following month. Edwards made his Test debut against Sri Lanka at Kingston, Jamaica, making 5 not out and returning with bowling figures of 5/36 and 1/54 in a winning West Indian effort. In his second first-class match, he produced the third-best bowling figures by a West Indies player on debut. In One Day Internationals, his debut was against Zimbabwe at Harare, taking career-best figures of 6/22 off 7 overs; as of January 2015, he is the only player to have taken 6 wickets on their ODI debut and he is only the second player after Tony Dodemaide to have taken 5 wicket hauls in both his test and ODI debuts. =Injuries= During the tour he picked up an injury to his shins, which Edwards felt badly affected his bowling in South Africa. In four Tests against South Africa, he managed eight wickets while conceding 648 runs. In the June 2009 ICC World Twenty20, Edwards suffered a back injury. He suffered a recurrence of the injury when he played for the Deccan Chargers in the Indian Premier League in October of that year. Consequently, his central contract was not renewed and Edwards later underwent back surgery. =Comeback= Fidel Edwards bowling against Australia, during 2009 ICC World Twenty20 tournament In the 2010/11 West Indian cricket season, Edwards made his comeback from injury, taking 22 wickets from 6 matches for Barbados at a cost of 23.77 runs. Having proved his fitness, Edwards was called into the West Indies squad for the first Test against Pakistan in May 2011, almost two years after he was sidelined with a back injury. Though included in the squad, he had to wait until India toured in June before returning to the side. Though he was apprehensive ahead of the first Test, he troubled the Indian batsmen and took four wickets. In March 2012 the West Indies Cricket Board announced that while Edwards was considered whenever Test and T20I teams were selected, he was overlooked in ODIs to manage his workload; he has not played an ODI since 2009. Edwards last played a One Day International in 2009, and the West Indies Cricket Board manages his workload to avoid further injuring him. A back injury incurred during the 2009 ICC World Twenty20 prevented Edwards from playing international cricket until 2011. Playing style Discussing his round-arm bowling action in 2004, Edwards remarked \\"I never copied anyone, its just natural. People feel it's a very difficult action but its like riding a bicycle. And the main advantage I get bowling in that fashion is I can swing the ball more, especially the old one. Yes, at times the swing is too wide and a few more extras are added, but I am coping with that.\\" His bowling speed is around the late 80s and early 90s mph. His fastest was clocked at 157.7 km/h in 2003.TOP 10 Fastest Bowlers in Current Cricket While his statistics attest to him being a genuine tailender, Edwards has helped save the West Indies three Test matches during his career, forming frustrating last wicket partnerships. The first instance came against Zimbabwe at Harare in 2003, where he hung in for 33 balls to deny the African nation a rare victory. In 2006, Edwards remained at the crease for 36 balls at the Antigua Recreation Ground, with India unable to claim the final wicket, while in 2009 he prevented England from a win at the same ground by remaining unbeaten on five after 26 deliveries.

He was a right-arm fast bowler and handy right-hand lower order batsman. Currently, he is coach of West Indies women's cricket team. He is perhaps best known for taking a spectacular diving catch in a Cricket World Cup match against Canada.  Playing career  Drakes made his international debut in 1994‚Äì95, when he played 5 ODI games against Australia cricket team, followed by a tour of England. He did not return to the side until the age of 33, when in September 2002 he was named in the West Indies cricket team' squad for the 2002 ICC Champions Trophy. He took the wicket of Jacques Kallis in his first international over for seven years. For the next two years, he became a regular in the side and played 12 Tests for the West Indies cricket team, debuting against Bangladesh cricket team at Dhaka on 8 December 2002. The loneliness of the West Indian fast bowler The Friday Column April 30, 2004 Capitalising on chances, and Vaas the minnow-basher He played in the 2003 ICC World Cup and finished his career with 33 Test wickets and 51 ODI wickets. With the bat, he once made 67 his only half century in international cricket. His most important Test innings, however, was arguably his unbeaten 27 which helped the West Indies cricket team to chase down a world-record target of 418, set by Australia cricket team in Antigua. The reason for his long absence from the side was his unavailability to play international cricket due to playing first-class cricket full-time. He played county cricket in the English summer and in the winter represented Border cricket team in South Africa. Trivia He is notable for being one of only five batsmen in the history of first-class cricket to be given out timed out. His case was all the more peculiar as he was not even in the country at the time. His flight to South Africa, where the match was being played, had been delayed by several hours. In honor of his best bowling performance of 5 for 93 against Australia cricket team the 'Vasbert' award is named after him.Disappearing acts  Coaching career  After his cricketing career, Drakes was appointed coach of United Arab Emirates national cricket team for a three month period that included the 2008 Asia Cup and 2008 ACC Trophy Elite.

He is a literary, film, and cultural critic and a novelist and poet, who has also written about gay rights, Christianity, and Islam. Bawer's writings on literature, gay issues and Islam have all been highly controversial. While championing such authors as William Keepers Maxwell Jr., Flannery O'Connor, and Guy Davenport, he has criticized such authors as Norman Mailer and E. L. Doctorow. A member of the New Formalists, a group of poets who promoted the use of traditional forms, he has assailed such poets as Allen Ginsberg for what he views as their lack of polish and technique. Bawer was one of the first gay activists to seriously propose same-sex marriage, especially in his book A Place at the Table (1993). While Europe Slept (2006) was one of the first to skeptically examine the rise of Islam in the Western world. Although he has frequently been described as a conservative, Bawer has often protested that such labels are misleading or meaningless. He has explained his views as follows: \\"Read A Place at the Table and Stealing Jesus and While Europe Slept and Surrender one after the other and you will see that all four books are motivated by a dedication to individual identity and individual freedom and an opposition to groupthink, oppression, tyranny.\\" Early life and education Through his father, Bawer is of Polish descent, and through his mother, whom he profiled in the September 2017 issue of Commentary,https://www.commentarymagazine.com/articles/girl-loved-hollywood/ his ancestry is English, Welsh, Scottish, Scotch-Irish, and French. In February 2018, he wrote that, according to recent research on his mother's side he was also part Dutch, Italian, and Native American (Nansemond). The Stony Brook University Arena at Stony Brook University Born and raised in New York City, Bawer attended New York City public schools and Stony Brook University, where he studied literature under the poet Louis Simpson, among others. As a graduate student, he taught undergraduate courses in literature and composition. He earned a B.A. in English from Stony Brook in 1978, followed by an M.A. in 1982 and a Ph.D. in 1983, both also in English. While in graduate school, he published essays in such academic journals as Notes on Modern American Literature and the Wallace Stevens Journal, and opinion pieces in Newsweek, the Los Angeles Times, and elsewhere. His dissertation, \\"The Middle Generation\\", was about the poets Delmore Schwartz, Randall Jarrell, John Berryman, and Robert Lowell. Writing career =Literary criticism= A revised version of Bawer's dissertation was published under the same title in 1986. Reviewing the book in The New Criterion, James Atlas called the \\"character analyses... shrewdly intuitive and sympathetic\\", found Bawer's \\"explanation for why the poets of the Middle Generation were so obsessed with [T.S.] Eliot especially persuasive\\", and described Bawer as \\"an impressive textual critic\\" with a \\"casual and self-assured\\" critical voice. In Commonweal Magazine, Robert Phillips called Bawer \\"a critic of the first order, one of the best we have today\\". The book was named an Academic Book of the Year by the American Library Association. Bawer contributed to the arts journal The New Criterion every month between October 1983 and May 1993. A New York Times Magazine article \\"The Changing World of New York Intellectuals\\", foregrounded the contributors to The New Criterion, observing that \\"The youthful contributors to Hilton Kramer's magazine‚ÄîBruce Bawer, Mimi Kramer, Roger Kimball‚Äîare still in their 20s, but they manage to sound like the British critic F.R. Leavis. Their articles are full of pronouncements about 'moral values,' 'the crisis in the humanities,' 'the significance of art.' Their mission is to defend American culture against shoddy merchandise, and they don't shirk from the task.\\" During the 1980s, Bawer also contributed book reviews to The New York Times Book Review, The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post Book World, The Washington Times, The American Scholar, Poetry, London Review of Books, and Times Literary Supplement. He served as an editor of the short-lived magazine Arrival, based in California, in 1987‚Äì88, was a member of the board of the National Book Critics Circle, and editor of the NBCC Journal in 1989‚Äì90. Bawer spent two years (1991‚Äì93) as University Preceptor at Adelphi University. In recent years, he has written considerably less literary criticism than he did in the 1980s. Much of it has appeared in The Hudson Review. =Early books= In 1987, his book The Contemporary Stylist was published by Harcourt Brace Jovanovich. The year after, Graywolf Press issued Diminishing Fictions, a collection of essays on the modern novel. Reviewing it in the Chicago Tribune, Jack Fuller complained of \\"sour notes\\", such as \\"undeserved sneers\\", but concluded that \\"What redeems Bawer's excesses is the persuasive case he makes that he is on a desperate rescue mission.\\" Graywolf published Bawer's second collection of essays on fiction, The Aspect of Eternity, in 1993. Publishers Weekly called the essays \\"beautifully written\\" and \\"a cause for celebration\\", and George Core, in The Washington Times, called Bawer \\"a first-rate critic whose continuing achievement as an independent literary journalist... is cause for our astonishment and celebration‚Äîone of the few positive signs about critics and criticism in our contentious and stuffy times\\". Bawer also published a collection of essays on poetry, Prophets and Professors, in 1995. \\"Running through these critical commentaries\\", wrote Publishers Weekly, \\"is the theme that too many younger poets are caught up in romantic excess, that the influence of Allen Ginsberg and the Beats and the confessional self-destruction of Sylvia Plath have excused so much of the sloppy, informal and poured-out emotion of today's poets... He is on the side of the formalists and those for whom poetry is not a game of literary gossip. This book is an intelligent study by someone who has read and judged a great deal of poetry and criticism.\\" In The New York Times, Katherine Knorr wrote that \\"Bawer is one of the best literary critics in America today\\", who proves \\"that the best literary criticism comes from a serious, close reading of the work that avoids the temptations of celebrity and fashionable politics\\". Reviewing Prophets and Professors, Washington Post critic Jonathan Yardley described Bawer as \\"one of the appallingly few American literary journalists whose work repays the reading\\" and \\"an intelligent, independent, tough-minded critic and a clear-eyed observer of literary affairs\\". In The New York Times Book Review, Andrea Barnet described the book as \\"immensely readable... provocative and entertaining\\", saying that Bawer was \\"thoughtful, sharply opinionated, high-minded and unafraid to slash at sacred cows\\", Leslie Schenk of World Literature Today opined that Bawer \\"has the uncanny knack of writing good sense precisely in those fields where good sense seems to have been taboo... As though with the scalpel of a surgeon removing tumors, he deftly, coolly, cuts through the ephemeral malarkey that hitherto obscured his subjects. His book A Place at the Table, for example, stands as solid as the Rock of Gibraltar in the seas of mush that otherwise surround the subject of homosexuality.\\" In Prophets and Professors, \\"Bawer performs a similar operation on American academia's pet fetish, modern poetry\\", resulting in \\"the most important book on poetry since Dana Gioia's Can Poetry Matter?\\" =Poetry= Along with Dana Gioia, Tom Disch, Charles Martin, and others, Bawer was one of the leading figures of the New Formalism movement in poetry. His poetry appeared in the 1996 anthology Rebel Angels: 25 Poets of the New Formalism, and he contributed to an essay (described as \\"heavy-handed\\" by Publishers Weekly) to the movement's manifesto, Poetry after Modernism. Bawer's poems have appeared in such magazines as Poetry, Paris Review, and The New Criterion. A chapbook of Bawer's poems, Innocence, was published in 1988 by Aralia Press, which also published individual poems by Bawer in other forms. A full-length collection of Bawer's poetry, Coast to Coast, appeared in 1993. It was selected as the year's best first book of poetry by the Dictionary of Literary Biography Yearbook. Film criticism From 1987 to 1990, Bawer served as the film critic for the conservative monthly The American Spectator. He also wrote several articles on film for The New York Times and other publications. A collection of his film reviews, The Screenplay's the Thing, was published in 1992. \\"Best known as a literary critic, Bawer is an engaging, astute, formidable film reviewer as well\\", wrote Publishers Weekly, describing Bawer as a \\"[p]olitically unpredictable\\" critic who \\"deflates the arty (Caravaggio), the preachy (Platoon; The Milagro Beanfield War) and the kitschy (The Unbearable Lightness of Being), but gives thumbs up to The World According to Garp, Raising Arizona, Roxanne, Crossing Delancey and The Mosquito Coast... One wishes he were a full-time movie critic.\\" Bawer later wrote that he left The American Spectator because of a conflict with an editor over a reference to homosexuality in one of his reviews. He has since returned to the magazine as a freelance book reviewer. Gay rights =A Place at the Table= Bawer's book A Place at the Table: The Gay Individual in American Society (1993) was published by Simon & Schuster. He described it in its first pages as \\"a reflection on the theme of homosexuality\\", motivated by the fact that current debates had \\"generated a lot more heat than light\\". The book, which criticized both heterosexuals' antigay prejudices and the political and cultural stereotypes which, in his view, were foisted on many gay people by the \\"queer subculture\\", received much attention. Reviews in mainstream media tended to be positive, while, as Bawer himself later put it, \\"antigay conservatives and queer lefties alike savaged the book\\" Author and attorney Dale Carpenter later summed up the response of many gay publications: \\"In a year-end roundup of gay-themed books for 1993, one critic for San Francisco's Bay Area Reporter called the book 'terrible,' but nevertheless 'important' because of its widespread impact. Gay professor and author David Bergman chided Bawer for allegedly failing to appreciate 'the great spectacle of human difference,' but acknowledged that Bawer had expressed 'what many people feel.'\\" Among the book's admirers were James P. Pinkerton, who, writing in Newsday, praised Bawer's \\"live and let live\\" message. Describing the book as \\"a conservative manifesto declaring what the silent majority of gays wants and why\\", John Fink of the Chicago Tribune wrote: \\"If there is one book about homosexuality and gay rights that everyone should read, it is probably this one.\\" In Reason, David Link wrote that \\"Bawer is not a champion of any cause except good sense... A Place at the Table is ultimately a defense of self-determination, and a much-needed one.\\" Lee Dembart described it in the Los Angeles Times as \\"a remarkable, gutsy, even brilliant book\\" and \\"the most interesting, provocative and original discussion of gay themes that I can recall\\". Christopher Lehmann-Haupt gave the book a mixed review, describing it as \\"eloquent\\", \\"intelligent\\", and \\"eye-opening\\", but accusing Bawer of \\"sometimes twisting the logic of those he disagrees with\\", \\"relying too heavily on his own dogma\\", and \\"failing to come to grips with some fundamental issues\\". Still, he wrote, the book \\"smashes the common stereotypes of gay people to smithereens\\". In The Washington Post, Jonathan Yardley, too, found the book \\"imperfect\\", accusing Bawer of a \\"regrettable penchant for sweeping generalizations\\", \\"a surprisingly rancorous view of conventional heterosexual marriage\\", and an occasional \\"angry edge\\", but called the book \\"courageous\\" and felt that Bawer, whose stated aim was to approach his topic \\"with reason, not rancor\\", had fulfilled that aim \\"with precisely the qualities that distinguish his literary criticism\\". Moreover, Yardley supported Bawer's case for gay marriage, even though \\"the mere mention of [it] still sends millions of Americans into orbit\\". More conservative voices included Margaret O'Brien Steinfels of the Catholic magazine Commonweal, who, in the New York Times Book Review, described the book as \\"a model polemic\\" and admired Bawer's \\"efforts to be fair and balanced\\". Yet she rejected Bawer's call for same-sex marriage, arguing that insisting on it \\"is likely to prove... explosive\\". Gay-rights opponent Maggie Gallagher, while calling the book \\"fascinating\\", criticized Bawer for being dissatisfied with \\"mere tolerance\\". Helle Bering-Jensen, in the Washington Times, sounded a similar note, arguing that while most Americans \\"are quite happy to let other folks live the lives they please\\", many \\"draw the line... at gays in the military, gay marriages, gay parenting and so forth\\". A Place at the Table was nominated for a Lambda Literary Award in the category of Gay Men's Studies and was named a Notable Book of the Year by The New York Times, which described it as a \\"sharply argued polemic\\". In a 1999 article, \\"A Book that Made a Difference\\", author and attorney Dale Carpenter noted that in the 1990s, the defining gay political causes were not revolutionary in nature but instead \\"sought to weave gays into the larger fabric of American life\\" and that \\"No author better crystallized this deep and widespread yearning than Bruce Bawer in... A Place at the Table, the decade's most important book on the gay movement.\\" The book, claimed Carpenter, \\"articulated better than any book before or since gays' rightful place in our culture\\" and \\"fueled a self- conscious movement of gay moderates and conservatives that is still redirecting gay politics\\". Largely as a result of Bawer's book, a \\"new generation\\" of gays entered politics and \\"insisted that gay organizations put issues like marriage at the top of the agenda\\". To be sure, \\"A Place at the Table wasn't solely responsible for all of this... But the book brought it together, nurtured it, and sent it on its way. Bawer's world, to a very large extent, is now our world; his methods, our methods; his goals, our goals. He wrote the book of the decade and changed gay politics forever.\\" In a 2019 article commemorating the fiftieth anniversary of the Stonewall riots, James Kirchick stated that gay-rights activists had long been divided into integrationists, who \\"argued for the incorporation of gay people into all aspects of American society\\", and separatists, who \\"believe that American society itself should be upended\\", and referred to A Place at the Table as \\"the integrationist founding text\\". =Gay issues: Other writings and activities= On an episode of the Charlie Rose Show marking the 25th anniversary of the Stonewall Riots, Bawer took part in a discussion with fellow gay moderate Andrew Sullivan and gay-left writers Tony Kushner and Donna Minkowitz. Minkowitz underlined the conflict between the two sides of the gay-rights movement by saying: \\"We don't want a place at the table! We want to turn the table over!\\" A New York Public Library lecture by Bawer, also marking the 25th anniversary of Stonewall, appeared in abbreviated form as a cover story in the New Republic. A Washington Post article about the 25th anniversary of Stonewall quoted Bawer on gay pride marches: \\"It's hard to make straight people understand how serious an issue gay rights is when they look and see a kind of Mardi Gras atmosphere... It doesn't communicate the idea that these are serious issues.\\" In a letter to The New York Times, Bawer criticized an editorial that ran on the morning of the Stonewall 25 gay-pride march. The editors chided \\"gay moderates and conservatives\\" for seeking \\"to assure the country that the vast majority of gay people are 'regular' people just like the folks next door\\". Bawer retorted, in part: \\"Well, most gays do live next door to straight people... we're not putting down cross-dressers or leathermen or anyone else; we're simply refuting an extremely misleading stereotype.\\" After the publication of A Place at the Table, Bawer wrote widely about gay life, culture, and politics. From 1994 to 1999, he was a regular columnist for The Advocate, the gay newsmagazine. His Advocate columns and other articles by Bawer on gay issues were later collected in an e-book, The Marrying Kind. In 1994, reviewing Robb Forman Dew's book The Family Heart: A Memoir of When Our Son Came Out, Bawer praised the book but added: \\"To be gay is to yearn for a time when it won't be necessary for mothers to write sensitive books about their children's coming out.\\" Reviewing a book by Urvashi Vaid in 1995, Bawer argued that \\"while more and more gay people\\" were seeking a gay-rights movement focused on \\"integration, education and conciliation\\", Vaid wished \\"to return to the day of class struggle and liberation fronts\\". The fact that \\"her rhetoric has come to seem so old so fast\\", he concluded, \\"is a measure of how gay political discourse outside the academy, anyway‚Äîhas been profoundly altered in a relatively brief time\\". Bawer explicitly called for same-sex marriage in a March 1996 New York Times op-ed. In June 1997, he expressed concern that so-called \\"morning-after\\" treatments for possible HIV infection could result in \\"increased carelessness\\" by at-risk individuals. In January 2001, he urged the Bush administration in a New York Times op-ed \\"to take substantive action on behalf of gays\\", arguing that the U.S. government was \\"now lagging behind the American people on gay issues\\". Bawer commented frequently on the treatment of gays in the films and TV. In a March 10, 1996, Times article, Bawer argued that while new films from Britain, the Netherlands, France, and Germany provided fresh, human treatments of gay people, most Hollywood movies about gays continued to be timid, banal, and formulaic. On April 14, 1996, Bawer said on the CBS Evening News, apropos of the new movie The Birdcage, that \\"A good farce has one foot in reality. A gay person going to see this movie realizes this movie doesn't have a single foot in reality.\\" Martin Walker in The Guardian cited Bawer's complaint about the makers of The Birdcage: \\"They don't get gay life. They don't get anything, outside of a narrow Hollywood idea of gay life. These characters have no dignity, nor pride.\\" Bawer was a major subject of Angela D. Dillard's 2001 book Guess Who's Coming to Dinner Now? Multicultural Conservatism in America. Reviewing it for Salon, he described it as a book written from \\"the heart of Academic Country, where the very existence of conservatives who are not straight white males can indeed generate horror and confusion (or, alternatively, amusement, perhaps bordering on clinical hysteria), and where, as surely as a multiplicity of genders, skin colors, ethnic backgrounds and sexual orientations is the collective dream, a multiplicity of viewpoints is the collective nightmare\\". He described Dillard's account of \\"gay conservative\\" as ill-informed and criticized her for, among other things, including him on \\"a list of people who have 'sided with the Religious Right'‚Äîeven though I wrote Stealing Jesus (1997), which indicts fundamentalism as a betrayal of Christianity\\". In a 1995 Washington Post article, Jim Marks cited Bawer's observation that (in Marks's paraphrase) \\"[I]t gets harder to claim that gay men and lesbians are outside mainstream culture, when so much of mainstream culture‚Äîthe Mona Lisa and Moby-Dick, to use Bawer's examples‚Äîis seen as the product of gay and lesbian minds.\\" In a 1996 piece on gay marriage, New York Times columnist Frank Rich cited Bawer's view that there existed \\"a gentlemen's agreement\\" among Washington conservatives. He quoted Bawer as saying: \\"They say 'We'll socialize with you and your significant other and we'll all be charming, as long as you don't mention it in public, and we get to say anything we want in public.'\\" A 1997 Washington Post article about an upcoming episode of Ellen DeGeneres's sitcom, Ellen, on which her character would come out of the closet, mimicking DeGeneres's own recent coming out, ended with a quote from Bawer. \\"People used to do courageous things without having a publicist around to tell the world.\\" Bawer's prominence in the gay-rights commentariat drew the ire of some leftists. Peter Kurth complained at Salon on November 30, 1998, that \\"Bruce Bawer, Gabriel Rotello, Michelangelo Signorile, and the inevitable Larry Kramer have, with [Andrew] Sullivan and a few others, secured a virtual lock on gay commentary in the American media.\\" Paul Robinson's book Queer Wars: The New Gay Right and Its Critics, published by the University of Chicago in 2005, devoted the first of its three chapters to an analysis and critique of Bawer's writings on gay issues. =Beyond Queer= The Free Press published the anthology Beyond Queer: Challenging Gay Left Orthodoxy in 1996. Edited by Bawer, it included essays by John W. Berresford, David Boaz, Stephen H. Chapman, Mel Dahl, David Link, Carolyn Lochhead, Daniel Mendelsohn, Stephen H. Miller, Jonathan Rauch, Andrew Sullivan, Paul Varnell, Norah Vincent, and John Weir, as well as Bawer. Booklist called it one of the \\"outstanding anthologies\\" of 1996\\", saying that it \\"marks the end of radical dominance in gay politics and culture\\" and \\"the beginning of a pragmatic and democratic approach to gay issues\\". Ron Hayes, writing in The Palm Beach Post, called it \\"complex, unsettling and thought provoking\\" and maintained that \\"No straight person who reads these essays will ever assume all gays are liberal again. And no gay person will ever assume that all conservatives are his enemy, either.\\" To read the essays in Beyond Queer, wrote Joseph Bottum in the Weekly Standard, \\"is to experience, again and again, this sense of language broken loose, words unmoored from meaning\\". Bottum argued that the book's contributors fail \\"to understand the internal logic of the forms of life to which they demand admittance\\"; they \\"want... the tradition without the discipline, the gravity of dogmatic religion and conventional marriage without the duties and surrenders that create gravity. They want, in other words, a reformation of language to purchase for them the fruits that require a reformation of life.\\" Bottum later reversed his views entirely, writing an article, \\"The Things We Share: A Catholic's Case for Same-Sex Marriage\\", in which he admitted that \\"there's been damage done in the course of this whole debate, some of it by me\\". Beyond Queer was nominated for a Lambda Literary Award in the category of Nonfiction Anthology. Looking back on the book in 2007, James Kirchick of the New Republic said that it had been \\"perhaps the most important work of gay nonfiction since Randy Shilts' And the Band Played On\\". =House & Home= In 1996, Dutton published House and Home, the memoir of Steve Gunderson, a gay Republican Congressman from Wisconsin, and Gunderson's partner, Rob Morris. Gunderson and Morris wrote the book with Bawer. A reviewer in The Hill called the book \\"powerful\\". Christianity =Stealing Jesus= In his book Stealing Jesus: How Fundamentalism Betrays Christianity (1997), Bawer stated, in the words of Publishers Weekly, \\"that fundamentalist Christianity... has been preaching a message of wrath and judgment\\" that \\"is incompatible with Jesus' message of love\\". While criticizing \\"Bawer's sometimes strident tone\\", Publishers Weekly said that his \\"graceful prose and lucid insights make this a must-read book for anyone concerned with the relationship of Christianity to contemporary American culture\\". Walter Kendrick, in The New York Times, noted that like A Place at the Table, Stealing Jesus was an \\"alarm bell\\", in this case about Christian fundamentalism. Although Kendrick complained that, Bawer's hopes to the contrary, there was \\"no hope of converting the fundamentalists\\", he concluded that the book might \\"prove of value simply for its clear exposition of what today's American 'fundamentalists' believe and want to do\\". The response of fundamentalist Protestants and traditional Catholics to the book was more critical. \\"The thesis of Stealing Jesus is an antinomian heresy rooted in gnostic dualism about the flesh and spirit\\", pronounced Catholic priest George W. Rutler in National Review, suggesting that \\"Bawer could some day write something about the real Church, if he read St. Francis de Sales's Treatise on the Love of God, spent a few days in Lourdes, and quieted down with a good cigar.\\" Stealing Jesus was nominated for a Lambda Literary Award in the category of Spirituality/Religion. =Christianity: Other writings and activities= Bawer has written widely on religious topics. In an April 1996 article for the New York Times Magazine, he reported on the heresy trial in the Episcopal Church over the ordination of gay clergy. In a 1997 New York Times op-ed, he discussed what he saw as \\"the growing divide between North and South in American Protestantism and the declining significance of denominational distinctions\\". In a 1998 article about Robert Duvall's film The Apostle, Bawer expressed surprise \\"that a movie with such a dark, realistic texture... should candy-coat the religious subculture in which it is set\\". In a 1998 review of New York Episcopal Bishop Paul Moores autobiography, Bawer described him as \\"a more complex figure than the privileged lefty portrayed by his critics\\". Europe Bawer moved from the U.S. to Europe in 1998, in part, as he later explained, because his long-term exposure to Christian fundamentalism via Stealing Jesus had drawn him to the purportedly more liberal life in Western Europe. In a 2004 New York Times article about American attitudes toward Europe, Richard Bernstein quoted a recent Hudson Review essay in which Bawer said, in Bernstein's paraphrase, \\"that for a time he thought about writing a book lamenting American anti-intellectualism, indifference to foreign languages and academic achievement, and susceptibility to trash TV\\", but in the end \\"didn't write that book... because he discovered that Europe wasn't so comparatively fantastic after all\\". After moving to Europe, Bawer contributed a number of travel articles to The New York Times about destinations in Norway and the Netherlands. He has also written scores of articles about the rise of Islam on the continent, the earliest being \\"Tolerating Intolerance\\", which appeared in 2002 in Partisan Review. =While Europe Slept= Bawer's book While Europe Slept: How Radical Islam is Destroying the West from Within (2006) concerns his belief in the threat that the rise of Islam in Europe poses to liberal values. Once established in Western European nations, Bawer maintains, Muslims avoid integration and answer only to sharia law, while avoiding the legal systems of their host nations, allowing abuse of women and gays, as well as Jews and other non- Muslims. In his conclusion, Bawer states that rising birthrates among Muslims and their \\"refusal\\" to integrate will allow them to dominate European society within 30 years, and that the only way to avoid such a disaster is to abolish the politically correct and multicultural doctrines that, according to him, are rife within the continent. James Kirchick of The New Republic wrote that the book confirmed Bawer's \\"intellectual consistency; witnessing American religious fundamentalism, he moved to more socially liberal Europe only to find that Europeans' vaunted cultural tolerance was overlooking a strain of Islamist religious fundamentalism that puts Jerry Falwell to shame\\". While Europe Slept was nominated for the National Book Critics Circle Award for 2006 in the criticism category, which led to controversy. Eliot Weinberger, one of the board members of the Circle, stated when he presented the list of nominations that Bawer's book was an example of \\"racism as criticism\\". The President of the Circle, John Freeman, declared: \\"I have never been more embarrassed by a choice than I have been with Bruce Bawer's While Europe Slept\\", and claimed that \\"[I]ts hyperventilated rhetoric tips from actual critique into Islamophobia.\\" J. Peder Zane, a member on the nomination committee, said that Weinberger \\"was completely unfair to Bruce Bawer\\" and insulting to the committee. While Europe Slept was translated into Spanish, Danish, Dutch, and Portuguese, and was a New York Times bestseller. Bawer discussed the book in a half-hour interview on Bill Moyers Journal. He has also talked about Islam on such programs as The Michael Coren Show in Canada and at various conferences in the U.S., Canada, and Europe. =Surrender= In Surrender: Appeasing Islam, Sacrificing Freedom (2009), Bawer argued \\"that people throughout the Western world‚Äîin reaction to such events as the Danish cartoon riots and the murder of filmmaker Theo van Gogh‚Äîare surrendering to fear\\" and thus censoring themselves and others and \\"refus[ing] to criticize even the most illiberal aspects of Islamic culture\\", thereby \\"undermin[ing] the values of individual liberty and equality on which our nation was founded\\". Ray Olson of Booklist called the book \\"Sublimely literate\\" and \\"urgent\\". Martin Sieff in the Washington Times found it \\"alarming, depressing, brilliant and remarkably courageous\\". In The New York Times Book Review, Stephen Pollard said that the book was, \\"at times, hard going\\", partly \\"because of the level of detail Bawer offers in support of his argument\\" and partly because \\"Bawer is unquestionably correct, and that fact is quite simply terrifying.\\" =The Victims' Revolution= Bawer's book The Victims' Revolution (2012) concerned the rise of identity studies in American universities. Identity studies, according to Bawer, reduce the human experience to ideologically charged jargon about power relationships among groups. Publishers Weekly said that while Bawer's \\"critique seldom engages seriously with the intellectual content of the field\\", his book was \\"a lively, cantankerous takedown of a juicy target\\" that scored \\"lots of entertaining points against the insufferable posturing and unreadable prose that pervades identity studies\\". Sohbab Ahmari, in The Wall Street Journal, praised the book for its exposure of relativism on campus, while Andrew Delbanco, in The New York Times Book Review, found Bawer's complaints outdated, arguing that universities, in Delbanco's view, are returning to traditional subjects. National Reviews Jay Nordlinger, on the other hand, praised the book's \\"wonderfulness\\" and wrote: \\"I wish people would read The Victims' Revolution. I especially wish it of students and others in academia.\\" =Islam: Other writings and activities= After moving to Europe, Bawer worked for a time as a columnist and translator for the website of Human Rights Service, an Oslo- based think tank focused on immigration and integration issues. He has also written frequently about Islam, Europe, and related topics for the Pajamas Media (now PJ Media) and Front Page websites, for City Journal, for the Gatestone Institute website, and on his blog. The New Quislings: How the International Left Used the Oslo Massacre to Silence Debate about Islam (2012) is an e-book by Bawer about the aftermath of the mass murders committed by Anders Behring Breivik on July 22, 2011. =Later books= In 2017, Bawer published The Alhambra: A Novel of Islam in Europe. Reviewing the book for FrontPage, Mark Tapson called it a \\"literate yet cinematic page-turner of a thriller\\". In 2019 Bawer published a short book called A Marriage Made at the Copa, about his parents, and two collections of essays entitled Islam and So Far.https://www.amazon.com/So-Far-Century-Politics- Culture/dp/1090465351/ref=sr_1_16?keywords=bruce+bawer&qid;=1569530069&sr;=8-16 Translated text Since living in Europe, Bawer has translated all or part of several books from Norwegian to English, including the following: * J√∏rn Holme, The Security Council Chamber (Press, 2018) * Renate Nedreg√•rd, Vestre (Press, 2017) * Geir Thomas Ris√•sen, Eidsvollsbygningen (Press, 2016) * National Tourist Routes in Norway (Press, 2015) * Jan Freuchen, Columna Transatlantica (Press, 2015) * Daniela B√ºchten, ed., Propaganda (Press, 2014) * P√•l Brekke and Fredrik Broms, Northern Lights (Press, 2013) * , Barents Portraits (Press, 2013) * Magne Furuholmen, In Transit (Press, 2013) * , Racing (Press, 2012) * , a-ha: photographs 1994‚Äì2010 (Press, 2012) * Various authors, Peter Fischli, David Weiss: Rock on Top of Another Rock (Press, 2012) * Various authors: Mark Dion: Den (Press, 2012) * Henrik H.

In later years he suffered back problems, knee injuries and an abdominal tear. These problems, in conjunction with a late start to his fully professional cricket career, limited his appearances in both international and domestic cricket. Since his debut in the 2001/02 season, he only managed to appear in 18 Test matches for New Zealand before he retired from Test cricket in December 2009 at the age of 34.

On 13 May 2010 he retired from all forms of the game and did not play in the 4th season of Indian Premier League. Brydon Coverdale on Cricinfo described him as New Zealand's best fast bowler.

He stated that the reason he defected was the fact that while New Zealand were giving good money it would not be enough to guarantee the future of his family once his cricket career would be over. Therefore, he earned money from the ICL which would guarantee his family's future. He also stated that he had no regrets and that he was a \\"victim of politics\\" because he defected. Once he terminated his contract with the ICL in June 2009 he returned to international cricket. In May 2009, the Indian Cricket League announced that several players had been released from their contracts, and in June Bond confirmed to New Zealand Cricket that he had severed ties with the unofficial league, effectively making himself available to be selected for the national team. He was duly awarded a central contract for the 2009/10 season.Booth, Lawrence. \\"Myths; And stereotypes.\\" The Spin, 30 June 2009. =Hampshire= On 22 February 2008, Bond signed for English domestic cricket team Hampshire. Bond played four County Championship matches for the club, taking 19 wickets at a bowling average of 19.21, with best figures of 7/66 which came on debut against Sussex. This was one of Bond's two five-wicket hauls for the club. Additionally, Bond played in three List-A matches for Hampshire, taking 3 wickets at a bowling average of 17.00, with best figures of 3‚Äì11. =Indian Premier League= At the auction held for the third season of the lucrative IPL, Shane Bond was one of the main attractions, with his final price being over US$750,000, because of the undisclosed tiebreaker money above the $750,000. His services were purchased by Kolkata Knight Riders, owned by Shahrukh Khan. International career Bond's first chance at international level came early in the 2001/02 season, when, following an impressive display in a match for the New Zealand academy against the touring Australian academy, he received a call-up to the Test squad to tour Australia.

Shortly thereafter, in the 2001‚Äì02 VB Series against Australia and South Africa, he earned a player-of- the-tournament award for taking 21 wickets in nine games. After the tournament he suffered a foot injury, one of the many that would mar his career, but was back in action for New Zealand's 2002 tour of the West Indies. He was the side's top wicket taker in its first-ever series win in the Caribbean. Bond continued to bowl well, again leading the New Zealand bowling averages at the 2003 World Cup. =Injuries= Shortly after the tournament he suffered a stress fracture in his back, requiring a titanium rod to be inserted. While initially he planned to make a comeback in February 2004, he remained out of the side until August 2005. Bond's remodelled bowling action proved no less lethal than its predecessor, however: in his second match back he took six wickets for 19 runs against India. =Return= Mohammad Yousuf caught and bowled in a Test match against Pakistan in 2009 In September 2009 he wore New Zealand colours once more, during a Twenty20 against Sri Lanka in Colombo. He worked his way back into the Test squad and had enough fuel for one final match-winning performance in the Dunedin Test against Pakistan. An abdominal tear ruled him out midway through the series before he decided to quit Tests and focus on limited-overs cricket. In January 2010 he was one of the biggest buys at the third IPL auction in Mumbai, fetching the maximum possible bid of $750,000 from the Kolkata Knight Riders. =Achievements and awards= Bond enjoyed strong success against Australia during his career. On 26 January 2002, he bowled New Zealand to victory over Australia, getting 5/25. In the Cricket World Cup, Bond achieved 6/23 again against Australia (New Zealand's best bowling performance in ODIs at the time) ‚Äì which including getting Ian Harvey and Brad Hogg in consecutive deliveries. Bond struggled with back problems which cause soft tissue to break. These injuries had ruled him out in a lot of international cricket in the past. Against India, Bond saved New Zealand from defeat with a spell of 6/19, including the wickets of Rahul Dravid, Sourav Ganguly and Virender Sehwag. This was the best One Day International bowling performance by a New Zealander until 2015 when Tim Southee took 7/33 against England at the 2015 World Cup. In a Test match against the West Indies, Bond took 5‚Äì69, his fourth 5-wicket haul in just 13 International Tests Matches, and went on to win the man of the match award. He stated that this was one of his best ever bowling efforts. New Zealand defeated the West Indies by 27 runs. On 14 January 2007, Bond took a hat-trick in the last over against Australia in a One Day International at the Bellerive Oval, dismissing Cameron White, Andrew Symonds and Nathan Bracken in successive deliveries, becoming just the second New Zealand player to take a hat-trick in limited-overs international cricket, although the game was still lost by 105 runs. A graph showing Bond's Test career bowling statistics and how they have varied over time. Shortly Afterwards on 23 January 2007 Bond became the second-fastest bowler in history to take 100 One-Day wickets, behind Pakistan's Saqlain Mushtaq by one match and the fastest fast bowler to reach the 100 wicket mark. Bond, however, needed 54 fewer deliveries than the Pakistani to achieve the feat, and was the fastest bowler to take 100 wickets in terms of number of deliveries bowled. On 16 February 2007, Bond took 5‚Äì23, his fourth 5-wicket haul, in the 2007 Chappell-Hadlee Trophy. This enabled New Zealand to dismiss Australia for 149, giving the New Zealanders a 10-wicket victory over them, the Australians' heaviest one day defeat, and although he sat out the final game in the Chappell-Hadlee series, he was instrumental in the eventual 3‚Äì0 series win for the first time in Chappell-Hadlee Trophy history. On 16 May 2007, Shane Bond was named New Zealand cricketer of the year for the 2006/2007 season and the best bowler for that season. In September Bond was named in the ICC's best-performing Test side over the past year. Despite attempts to have his registration cancelled, Shane Bond was given permission to sign for Hampshire in the ECB County Championship. He made his d√©but against 2007 champions Sussex on 16 April 2008, recording figures of 7‚Äì66 in the first innings. On 27 November 2009, Bond claimed his fifth five- wicket bag for New Zealand on his first test back against Pakistan. , Bond is the fastest New Zealand Cricketer to take 100 wickets in ODIs. He achieved this feat in 54 matches in January 2007. He is only bettered by Saqlain Mushtaq (53 matches, May 1997) and Mitchell Starc (53 matches, August 2016). =Retirement= In December 2009, Bond announced his retirement from Test cricket due to the injuries that had been plaguing him for years. He said he wanted to elongate his career in the Limited-Overs formats of the game. He ended his career in Test cricket taking 87 wickets in 18 matches at an average of 22.09 and at a strike rate of 38.7. On 14 May 2010, Shane Bond announced retirement from all international cricket after the 2010 ICC World Twenty20. He is regarded as the best ever bowler to play for Blackcaps after the period of Hadlee. =Playing style= Bond was a fast bowler capable of regularly bowling at speeds in excess of 145 km/h. He was first recorded exceeding 150 km/h in the 2001/02 season.Brett Lee, the world's fastest bowler?.

He retired from the position after the 2015 Cricket World Cup where New Zealand reached the final. He was widely credited with enhancing the performance of the New Zealand team during his 3-year stint, especially that of Trent Boult and Tim Southee. He became bowling coach of the Mumbai Indians in 2015, and has since become commentator for Sky Sports with Mark Richardson, Ian Smith and Simon Doull since 2016.

Regarded as one of the most naturally talented cricketers South Africa have ever produced, Gibbs was also known as an excellent fielder, like his compatriot Jonty Rhodes, with former Australian captain Ricky Ponting noting that in his opinion Gibbs is better than Rhodes in his ability to hit the stumps, with a report prepared by Cricinfo in late 2005 showing that since the 1999 Cricket World Cup, he had effected the eighth highest number of run-outs in ODI cricket of any fieldsman, with the tenth highest success rate. He was the fifth international franchise player signed to the Caribbean Premier League and the first South African player to be named to the new Twenty20 tournament. Personal life Gibbs was schooled at St Joseph's Marist College and then Diocesan College in Rondebosch. Gibbs was a gifted sportsman at school featuring in SA Schools teams for rugby, cricket and soccer. At Diocesan College Gibbs played for their First Rugby XV in the same team alongside Robbie Fleck, Selborne Boome and Dave von Hoesslin who would all go on to become Springboks. On 8 June 2007 he got married in St Kitts to Tenielle Povey, but divorced soon afterwards.  International career  Gibbs has scored two double centuries in his Test career, both contrasting innings. His first was an innings of 211 not out against New Zealand at Jade Stadium in 1999. His innings took 468 balls while his second double century, 228 against Pakistan came off just 240 balls. In that innings in Newlands, he reached a national record partnership of 368 with Graeme Smith. He has put on a further two 300-run opening stands with his captain, making them the only pair in Test history to break 300 on three occasions. He also holds the South African second wicket record, a partnership of 315* with Jacques Kallis. Gibbs famously dropped a catch in a World Cup game against Australia in 1999, when he attempted to throw the ball up into the air in celebration before he had full control of it. The player that he dropped, Steve Waugh, went on to make a century and win the game for Australia, a victory which also gave the Australian side the momentum they required to go on and win the tournament. It was claimed at the time that, immediately after the dropped catch, Waugh had \\"sledged\\" Gibbs with the statement, \\"You've just dropped the World Cup\\", but, in his autobiography Out of My Comfort Zone, Waugh denies this. Waugh did state, however, that teammate Shane Warne had noticed that Gibbs had developed a habit of throwing the ball in the air prematurely after taking catches and instructed his colleagues not to leave the crease too quickly if they happened to be caught by Gibbs, just in case the situation that happened to Waugh should actually occur. =Record breaking= Gibbs is one of only ten batsmen in ODI history to score hundreds in three consecutive innings, the others being Zaheer Abbas, Saeed Anwar, AB de Villiers, Quinton de Kock, Ross Taylor, Kumar Sangakkara, Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli and Babar Azam. Sangakkara became the only player to hit four consecutive ODI hundreds, during 2015 cricket world cup. On 6 October 2002, in Potchefstroom, in a match against Bangladeshis, Gibbs had a chance to become the first ever batsman to score four hundreds in a row. South Africa was set the target of 155 for victory, and Gibbs fell just three runs short, finishing unbeaten on 97. With just six runs needed for victory, he had the strike on 96, but Alok Kapali bowled a legside wide that went for four and made his task almost impossible. For his performances in 2004, he was named in the World Test XI by ICCICC Test Team of the Year. On 12 March 2006, Gibbs played a monumental innings in the 5th ODI against Australia, scoring 175 off just 111 balls leading South Africa to victory. He was batting with Graeme Smith after Boeta Dippenaar was out on 1(3) bowled by Nathan Bracken. This was the highest scoring One Day International match in history and his innings broke several batting records. It was the highest ever score made in an ODI against Australia, beating Robin Smith's effort in 1993. By bringing up his hundred off just 79 balls, he also brought up what was at the time the fastest ever ODI century against Australia. More importantly however, it was the fastest ever hundred by a South African batsman against any opposition, although the record would be broken later in the year by Mark Boucher. It was also the highest ever score by a batsman in South Africa. He scored 126 runs in boundaries, the most ever by a batsman. This record stood until 11 April 2011, when Shane Watson hit 150 runs in boundaries against Bangladesh. In the match against the Netherlands in the group stage of the 2007 Cricket World Cup, Gibbs hit six sixes in an over off the bowling of Daan van Bunge becoming the first player in One Day International history to do so. Ravi Shastri and Sir Garfield Sobers had previously achieved this feat in first-class cricket but to date no player has achieved this in Test Cricket. In doing so, he raised US$1 million for the Habitat for Humanity housing projects as part of a contest run by tournament sponsor Johnnie Walker. It is likely that his being awarded citizenship of St Kitts and Nevis was due to this feat. His six hitting form continued throughout the tournament and when he hit Jacob Oram into the stands during a Super Eight match he drew level with Australian batsman Ricky Ponting on 28 for most sixes in World Cup history. = Struggle with form = Gibbs at fielding practice, Adelaide Oval, January 2009. In the past two series against England and the West Indies he was brought down the order from the opening batsman to the middle order due to lack of form. After the move he regained form and looked more comfortable batting against the older ball. On 22 April 2006, Gibbs paid the price for his recent run-drought, and was dropped for the second and third Tests against the New Zealand cricket team. He has been short of confidence in Test cricket of late, and scored only 6 and 2 in the First Test at Centurion Park. South Africa's chief selector, Haroon Lorgat said, \\"We had a meeting and agreed that a break and a fresh start next season will do him a world of good.\\" This decision was widely viewed as a harsh one. He came back into the side in the middle order but continued to struggle for runs. On the conclusion of the 1st Test against Pakistan in January 2007 he had gone over 2 years without scoring a century. He had come close on many occasions to ending the drought, getting out in the nineties four times. Yet, for his performances in 2008, he was named in the World ODI XI by the ICC.http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci-icc/content/story/369272.html In April 2009, his sixteen One Day International innings since the March 2008 one-day series in Bangladesh having yielded just three fifties, even Stuart Hess, his most ardent media supporter, was moved to cast doubt over his future. Hess had famously recommended Gibbs as captaincy successor to Shaun Pollock in 2003, but now, noting that his \\"average, as an opener, in that same period is 25.25, more than 10 runs below his overall average of 35.87\\", Hess felt \\"a sense that Gibbs is living off past deeds and not playing with the requisite form needed to hold on to a national spot.\\"Hess 2009. He noted, however, that Gibbs was the only South African with more than 1,000 World Cup runs and that, of the twelve others, only Sachin Tendulkar with 57.93 and Sir Viv Richards with 63.31 had better averages: > Perhaps putting up with Gibbs's current inconsistent streak may just have to > be the pay-off South Africa have to make if it means he can help guide the > national side to greater glory in two years time. After being dropped from the side Gibbs stated that he wanted to perform well in the domestic cup and that he was feeling well about it. He stated that his aim was to play in the 2011 Cricket World Cup His Test career came to an end following the 2007/08 West Indies tour of South Africa. An innings-by-innings breakdown of Gibbs' Test match batting career, showing runs scored (red bars) and the average of the last ten innings (blue line). Domestic career =County cricket= Gibbs played for Glamorgan in the 2008 County Twenty20 tournament where he had a successful time; his highest score being 98 off just 52 balls in a losing game against Northants. He then signed up to play for Glamorgan for the 2009 County season, replacing Mark Cosgrove as the overseas player at the end of June. He also represented Glamorgan in two NatWest Pro40 League matches in that same season. Gibbs then signed for Yorkshire Carnegie for the 2010 Friends Provident t20 tournament, where he was their overseas player, scoring 101 from 53 balls against Northamptonshire to achieve his first century in English T20 cricket. =Big Bash League= In the 2011/12 season the Perth Scorchers signed Gibbs for their campaign in the Australian Big Bash League. Gibbs did a brilliant job for the team so much so that they made it to the final. He was the third highest run scorer. He scored 302 runs in 7 matches with an average of 43.14. His prominent batting helped the Scorchers to participate in the Champions League T20 which was held in South Africa during September 2012. = Indian Premier League = In April 2008, Herschelle Gibbs joined the Deccan Chargers of the Indian Premier League. His mediocre performance in 2008 season made the Chargers' management put him on sale. However, he came up with splendid knocks in the second season helping the Deccan Chargers ahead with four continuous wins in their first four matches. Of all the openers, Adam Gilchrist and Gibbs have been the most explosive pair. He also played a crucial role in the finals by scoring an unbeaten 53 (48 balls) in the final when Adam Gilchrist went out for a duck. He also took a crucial catch off Mark Boucher at point when the Royal Challengers were cruising to the victory. In the 2012 version of the IPL, he was signed by the Mumbai Indians with a reported fee of US$50,000. His top score is 69* (56) v Chennai Super Kings. In 2012, he scored 66* (46) for the Mumbai Indians. = Bangladesh Premier League = In a new T20 championship in Bangladesh, the team of Khulna Royal Bengals in the Bangladesh Premier League bought him for $50000 as their team member on 19 January 2012. Controversies In 2001, Gibbs was fined along with several teammates for smoking marijuana during that year's tour of the West Indies. Most notoriously, Gibbs was involved in the match fixing affair with former captain Hansie Cronje, who offered him $15,000 to score \\"less than 20\\" in the 5th One- Day International of a series. He tearfully claimed to the King Commission of inquiry into corruption in South African cricket that he did not follow through on his side of the bargain, scoring 74 runs. As a result, he was banned for only six months. He repeatedly refused to tour India fearing arrest and refused to even speak to Indian Police over the matter. However, Gibbs was named in the South African squad to tour India in the 2006 ICC Champions Trophy, and as a result, he had to meet with Indian Police over his involvement in the match-fixing scandal. On 15 January 2007, it was announced that Gibbs, a Cape Coloured himself would face a disciplinary panel after making racist comments during the 1st Test against Pakistan. His words had been picked up on the stump microphone saying remarks such as \\"go back to the zoo\\" and swearing to the Pakistani players and as a result heard across the world. The comments were said to have been directed at the members of the crowd after teammate Paul Harris had been abused by them whilst fielding. The Pakistani management made an official complaint to referee Chris Broad and Gibbs was banned for two Tests. He appealed against the ban but this was rejected by the ICC's code of conduct commissioner, Richie Benaud. The ban was, however, changed to one Test, one Twenty20 game and one ODI match ‚Äì all against Pakistan. Coaching career In July 2019, Gibbs was appointed as the head coach of the Rotterdam Rhinos for the inaugural edition of the Euro T20 Slam cricket tournament. Prior to this, he also had an experience of coaching teams in Shpageeza Cricket League and Kuwait's national squad.

He was a right-arm fast-medium bowler, also known as a hard-hitting batsman in ODIs, where he frequently scored a fast rate; though he was seldom able to sustain this form and keeping his wicket intact through many overs. He more often played ODIs, where many runs in a short time are desired, than Tests. International career On his Test debut, he took five wickets in the first innings against Bangladesh in Bulawayo in 2001. Blignaut took a hat-trick against Bangladesh in a Test match at Harare on 22 February 2004. He is the only bowler to take a Test hat-trick for Zimbabwe. Like Travis Friend and Henry Olonga before him, Blignaut was one of the few Zimbabwean bowlers who could exceed 90mph. In a land full of medium-fast bowlers, Blignaut (on his day) formed a lethal opening combination with the dependable Heath Streak, often rushing the batsmen for pace off the wicket. In an ODI against England at Durham in 2003, he bowled a 93mph thunderbolt to England allrounder Andrew Flintoff. In the same game, however, he went at 10 runs an over, getting neither his line nor his length right. He remained Zimbabwe's wild card, especially in the shorter formats, with the ability to either win or lose a game in a matter of overs. After playing the series against New Zealand and India in 2005, he withdrew from Zimbabwe selection because he had not been paid. His ODI strike-rate is over 100, with a high score of 63 not out, and an average of just 19. His bowling average is just above 41, with best bowling figures of 4/43, and an economy of 5.34. He was also a fine fielder. Domestic career In the Australian season 2004-05, Blignaut was contracted to play for Tasmania. Injury and poor form prevented him from playing all but a couple of games for the state. He even struggled to make an impact at club level. Eventually he returned to Zimbabwe to re-join the Test side. The second year of his contract with Tasmania was cancelled. He signed a contract with South African domestic side Highveld Lions for 2006 season. After 2006, he disappear from cricket for a few years before returning in 2010 for a few matches for Zimbabwe. After cricket He works in the family business in South Africa and Zimbabwe.

By his statistical record, he is the best bowler to have played for Zimbabwe. He is the only Zimbabwean bowler to have taken over 100 Test wickets and one of only four Zimbabwean bowlers to have taken over 100 ODI wickets. He was the head coach of Zimbabwe until early 2018 and was the bowling coach for the Kolkata Knight Riders in the Indian Premier League in 2018. In September 2018, Streak submitted an application to the court to have Zimbabwe Cricket liquidated in relation to outstanding debts. Domestic career In 1995/96, Streak played in the same Matabeleland team as his 46-year-old father Denis in the final of the Lonrho Logan Cup against Mashonaland Country Districts; this was the first instance of a father and son playing in the same first-class match for more than thirty years. On 25 April 2007, Streak resigned as Warwickshire captain, saying captaining the side was affecting his on field abilities. He was replaced as captain by Darren Maddy. At the end of the 2007 season he left Warwickshire citing family reasons.Streak ends Warwickshire stint At the end of the year of 2007, he joined the Ahmedabad Rockets in the Indian Cricket League. He played two seasons in the ICL along with appearing in the Hong Kong sixes. In 2009, he cut his ties with ICL, and in that August was appointed as the bowling coach of Zimbabwean national team. He was also given the responsibility of working with the young Zimbabwean fast bowlers and for franchise cricket. International career =Early career= He made his Test debut in Zimbabwe's tour of Pakistan 1993/1994 making his mark by taking 8 wickets in the 2nd Test at Rawalpindi ( 9‚Äì14 December 1993). In the match, Streak won the Player of the series award, took 22 wickets at an average of 13.54. =Rising through ranks= He bettered his best bowling figures in 1995 when Pakistan toured Zimbabwe taking 6/90 in the first Test at Harare. In 2000/2001, he won 2-man of the series awards, first in Zimbabwe's tour of England and then in Bangladesh's tour of Zimbabwe. He along with Andy Flower set the record for the highest 7th wicket partnership for Zimbabwe in ODIs(130) =Retirement= He retired from international cricket in October 2005 to become captain of Warwickshire County Cricket Club having previously played county cricket for Hampshire. He also captains his fellow exiled players from Zimbabwe in the Red Lions team, which plays charity games in England. Controversies Heath Streak claimed in an interview in The Observer that he was faced with moral challenges in captaining Zimbabwe. He said that he was asked to falsely tell white players that they were not talented enough and were to be replaced by black players.Triumph and despair Sport24 asked: You have been accused of being a racist by one of the suits. Your response? Heath Streak: I think Zimbabwe Cricket have far too often tried to use the race card as a way to deviate from the actual issues of poor governance. They need to start looking at themselves in the mirror. All the players I have coached and the people around me know me well enough. I don‚Äôt even need to try to vindicate myself or qualify why I‚Äôm not a racist. For me, the allegations of racism (by ZC board chairperson Tavengwa Mukuhlani) are actually laughable. Not only do I speak Ndebele, my wife and I have a black foster son. I was pretty upset by Mukuhlani‚Äôs comments and it‚Äôs something I‚Äôm considering taking action against in the future. The statements against me are not only defamatory, but they are also damaging. I have spent a lifetime building my reputation and for him to say something like that publicly is not acceptable. I take it extremely seriously. I agree 100 percent with Ray Price who said: ‚ÄúRacism is not the problem in Zimbabwean cricket. Bad cricket management is the problem.‚Äù It‚Äôs now about getting the correct personnel involved and people with the requisite skills to be able to run an organisation as big as Zimbabwe Cricket. I‚Äôm pretty hopeful that this episode will prove to be the catalyst that brings people‚Äôs attention to the changes that need to occur within Zimbabwean cricket. Throughout sports organisations, you definitely need a balance between former players, who understand the needs of professional players, and people with good corporate acumen and proven track records in the business world. We need more cricketers involved in decision-making at the top level and on the board. I would like to believe that decision-making in the future will be in the game‚Äôs best interest. It would ensure that there is a pathway for the next generation of cricketers. My son loves his cricket and, if he‚Äôs good enough to play at a professional level, I want him to be able to have the opportunity to do so in Zimbabwe and for his country of birth. In the past, cricketers have had to leave Zimbabwe and we have lost them forever. Coaching career In August 2009, Streak was appointed as the bowling coach of the Zimbabwe national cricket team. He was also given the responsibility of working with the young Zimbabwean fast bowlers and for franchise cricket. In 2010 along with his former teammate Grant Flower, Streak became a supporting coach of Zimbabwe under former English cricketer Alan Butcher. Flower became batting coach and Streak was named as bowling coach. In 2013, Streak's contract was not renewed for financial reasons. Zimbabwe Cricket had offered Streak a consultancy role but they could not guarantee him a set number of working days or specific pay which forced him to stay out of the preparations for the Bangladesh series. Finances permitting at his franchise in Bulawayo, the Matabeleland Tuskers, he remained coach there. He was appointed Bangladesh's bowling coach in May 2014 until 2016. In October 2016, Streak was appointed head coach of the Zimbabwe national cricket team. He was tasked with ensuring Zimbabwe qualify for the 2019 World Cup. Zimbabwe failed to qualify for the World Cup, and Streak was forced to resign in early 2018. He continued on in his role as bowling coach for the Kolkata Knight Riders in the IPL.

He is a wicket-keeper-batsman. From May 6, 2004 to September 5, 2019, he held the record for being the youngest test captain in history when he captained his team against Sri Lanka until Rashid Khan of Afghanistan claimed the record. Records: Youngest Test Captain cricinfo Retrieved 15 January 2020 In July 2012 Taibu, aged only 29, decided to retire from cricket to focus on his work in church. In December 2018, it was reported that he was making a return to cricket. Later the same month, he played first-class cricket for Badureliya Sports Club in the 2018‚Äì19 Premier League Tournament in Sri Lanka. International career Taibu made his first- class cricket debut at the age of 16, and his debut for Zimbabwe national team in 2001, aged 18. In 2003, he was appointed vice-captain to Heath Streak on the team's tour of England, and he was appointed national captain in April 2004, making him the youngest Test captain in history then, until Rashid Khan of Afghanistan claimed the record in 2019. Rashid Khan was 8 days younger than Taibu when he captained Afghanishtan against Bangladesh. He took a two-year break for Zimbabwe in from 2005 to 2007 when he played a season as the captain of Namibia and another season for the Cape Cobras in South Africa. He made his return to the Zimbabwean side in a series against India A in July 2007, registering a century. The following month Zimbabwe hosted South Africa for a three-game ODI series and in the final game Taibu scored a career best 107 not out. It was the first ODI century by a Zimbabwean against South Africa. During 2010 Taibu's form continued and he scored 73 against South Africa as Zimbabwe were all out for 268. The South Africans chased down the total comfortably with Hashim Amla and AB de Villiers scoring centuries.http://www.cricinfo.com/south-africa-v- zimbabwe-2010/content/current/story/482260.html He scored 98 for his side in ICC World Cup 2011 as their team won by 175 runs against Canada in Nagpur. Taibu played a splendid innings in must-win situation of World Cup. When Zimbabwe returned to Test cricket in 2011, Taibu was selected to play in their one-off Tests against Bangladesh, Pakistan and New Zealand despite making critical remarks of the country's cricket administration. He scored half- centuries in each of the three Tests. Taibu became the 5th Zimbabwean to score 3,000 runs during his innings of 53 (74) against Kenya at Eden Gardens, Kolkata during the 2011 World Cup on 20 March 2011. He along with Stuart Matsikenyeri set the record partnership in ODIs for the sixth wicket for Zimbabwe(188) Retirement On 10 July 2012, Taibu called time on his career aged 29. He said he would only do work for the church. Taibu told Zimeye: ‚ÄúI just feel that my true calling now lies in doing the Lord‚Äôs work, and although I am fortunate and proud to have played for my country, the time has come for me to put my entire focus on that part of my life.‚Äù He scored 1,546 runs in Tests with 57 catches and five stumpings, while making 3,393 runs in ODIs with 114 catches and 33 stumpings. He finishes as Zimbabwe's fourth highest run- scorer in ODIs with the second most dismissals as a wicketkeeper, behind Andy Flower.

He joined Hightown St. Mary's Cricket Club in 2016 as a player-coach- development-officer in the second-division of the Liverpool & District Cricket Competition. While writing his autobiography he realised that he would have to return to Zimbabwe. In June 2016 he accepted a role as Zimbabwe Cricket's convener of selectors and development officer, with the encouragement of Peter Chingoka. Brendan Taylor and Kyle Jarvis left county deals in September 2017 to play again for Zimbabwe, fruit of Taibu's efforts to entice them back. In 2019, Taibu wrote a book titled 'Keeper of Faith', in which he discusses socio-political situation in Zimbabwe, his childhood beatings, perception after witnessing privileged white cricketers and threats by receiving photos of dead bodies.

Cricket career Croft was (along with Andy Roberts, Michael Holding and Joel Garner) part of the potent West Indian quartet of fast bowlers from the late 70s and early 80s. With his height (6'5\\"), he bowled bouncers and was very aggressive. He was renowned for bowling wide of the crease over the wicket and angling the ball in to right- handers. His approach to the wicket was unconventional and footage of Croft bowling around the wickethttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xZTZbEQDAs show him on a run-up more typical of a left-arm bowler. Croft's figures of 8/29 against Pakistan in 1977 are still the best Test innings figures by a fast bowler from the West Indies. Croft was involved in a number of controversial incidents during the ill-tempered test series with New Zealand in 1979-80. During the Second Test at Christchurch's Lancaster Park in February 1980, the West Indies considered umpire Fred Goodall's officiating so poor that they refused to emerge from their dressing room after the tea break on Day 3 unless Goodall was immediately replaced. After 11 minutes, they were persuaded to resume. Croft collided with Goodall at the end of his bowling run-up during the fourth day's play after knocking a bail off the stumps with a previous delivery, unhappy at being no-balled frequently and having a caught-behind appeal turned down.The West Indians in New Zealand, 1979-80, Wisden, 1981; What's going on? Goodall has some news for Gavaskar, Cricinfo.com, 31 July 2003; Shoulder barges and flying stumps, Cricinfo.com, 18 February 2006; Scorecard West Indies captain Clive Lloyd later regretted not taking a firmer line with his players. County Career Lance Gibbs arranged for Croft to go to Warwickshire on a coaching scholarship in 1972 where he played two games in the second eleven. With Warwickshire already having a quartet of West Indies Test players, no opportunity presented itself at the Midlands county, but Croft did play for Lancashire in 1977, 1978 and 1982 taking 136 wickets at 26.5 in first class matches. Rebel tour In 1982 Croft accepted a place on the rebel tour of apartheid-divided South Africa, in violation of an international ban on sports tours of the country. The rebel players were granted \\"honorary whites\\" status by the South African government to allow them access to all-white cricket playing areas.AdelaideNow... Tragedy of the West Indian rebels Hoever there was controversy when Croft was ejected from a whites only seating compartment on a train out of Johannesburg. All the players who took part in the tour were banned for life from international cricket, thus marking the end of Croft's cricket playing career. Croft moved to the United States to avoid recriminations at home.Colin Croft states so in the documentary Fire in Babylon. The ban was effectively lifted in 1989, by both the WICB and the UN. Teaching career Croft taught maths at Lambrook school in Winkfield Row, Berkshire, UK, in 2007‚Äì2008 for one and a half terms. He never coached cricket at the school. Media career Since 1994, Croft has been doing cricket coverage part-time, as a commentator/analyst, and was one of the first writers for CricInfo, contributing over 500 articles so far to that entity. He has continued his sports journalism career everywhere that cricket is played, covering West Indies tours since 1994. Croft's first overseas sports journalism sojourn was to the United Kingdom in 1995. During the 2007 ICC Cricket World Cup Croft provided analysis for the BBC's Test Match Special radio coverage on all the Guyana-based matches. He continued his analyst's role during the West Indies tour of England the same year. In his private life, having been an Air Traffic Controller from 1973 to 1981, while also playing cricket for the West Indies cricket team, he has also obtained a Commercial Airline Pilot's licence in the USA, with endorsements for the UK, and worked as a Commercial Pilot in the Caribbean. He also regularly appears as a studio guest on Sky Sports when West Indies are playing.

He is a former English cricketer, journalist and England selector. Fraser played in forty-six Test matches and forty-two One Day Internationals for England. Cricket commentator Colin Bateman commented that Fraser was \\"a reliable, intelligent and hard-working bowler\\". Life and career Born in Billinge Higher End, Lancashire, Fraser was educated at the Gayton High School in Harrow, London and Orange Hill High School, Edgware, Greater London. Perhaps his finest hour came in the Barbados Test Match of the 1993/94 West Indies tour when Fraser took 8‚Äì75 in the first innings to help set up a famous victory, West Indies' first defeat at Bridgetown for over half a century. His career-best first-class cricket bowling figures of 8‚Äì53 were taken in a Test match and against the same opposition, this time at Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago, in 1997/98. Despite taking eight wickets in that innings, he was not named Man of the Match which was awarded to Carl Hooper, from the victorious West Indies side. His ODI highest score of 38 not out was made late in the innings at number 10, which included a massive six off Steve Waugh and almost brought England back from the brink of defeat against Australia during the 1990/91 tour (Australia won by three runs). Another fine moment with the bat was in a last-wicket second-innings stand with Robert Croft to save the Third Test at Old Trafford against South Africa in 1998. He also toured New Zealand representing England. Throughout his career he used a bat nicknamed the \\"Gussy Hitter\\", the blade of which was designed by his mother. Although born in Lancashire, Fraser played all of his county cricket for Middlesex in a first-class career spanning 1984 till 2002; he served as county captain from 2001 until his retirement in 2002. After that, he worked as the cricket correspondent of The Independent newspaper (2002‚Äì2009), until his appointment to the newly created role of managing director of Cricket by Middlesex County Cricket Club in January 2009. He is a regular contributor to the BBC's Test Match Special and a cricket pundit for Sky Sports. In the 1996 edition of Wisden, Fraser was one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year. He now resides in Pinner with his wife and two children, Alexander and Bethan. In 2008, in his first managerial role, Fraser secured the U15 Middlesex Schools Association County Cup with The John Lyon School, where his son was in the squad.

He is rated among the best Zimbabwean cricketers in history for his consistent left arm spin and fine batting skills. He was a fitness fanatic who spends hours in the gym, and was also regarded as a brilliant fielder who was usually seen in the gully. \\"Flower Power\\", the combination of Grant and his brother Andy Flower, was the mainstay of Zimbabwean batting for a decade. He was his team's most successful opening batsman who played the role of anchorman, with strokeplayers coming in down the order. He played a lead role in, arguably, Zimbabwe's finest Test victory, against a strong Pakistan side. He would show a liking for the Pakistani side over his career, averaging over 40 against them and scoring 3 centuries including an unbeaten 201. In July 2014, he was appointed as batting coach of the Pakistan cricket team for a period of two years. He was also the first ever batsman to have carried his bat across 2 different formats and also the only batsman to have carried out his bat in both ODIs as well as in tests. Early days Grant Flower was born in Salisbury, Rhodesia and was educated along with his brother Andy at North Park School where they were the best players in their age groups. Although always an allrounder, he bowled seamers in his early days and his bowling was rated more than his batting. He changed to spin bowling in high school. Quite clearly, Flower is part of the famous talent production line from St George‚Äôs College, which also includes England cricketers Sam and Tom Curran as well as New Zealand international Colin de Grandhomme among a plethora of other internationally capped players. In the summer of 1990/91 his elevation to a professional cricketer was confirmed when he was employed by the Zimbabwe Cricket Union. His debut first-class game for Zimbabwe came against England A. In his second match he opened the innings and was rewarded with a fifty adding what would be the first of many century partnerships with his brother Andy. At just 19, Flower was part of the 1990 ICC tournament where the winner would qualify for the World Cup. Zimbabwe would go on to win the competition with Grant Flower scoring heavily in the early games. Had they not won the competition it is likely that Zimbabwe would not have made their rise to Test cricket, at least not until much later. Grant Flower missed out on the 1992 World Cup due to injury. In 1993 Grant spent a season in England with Widnes Cricket Club in the Manchester and District Cricket Association. He also spent a season at Wallasey Cricket Club of the Liverpool Cricket Competition in 1995. International career =Test career= Flower batting for Essex against Cambridge UCCE, April 2005 After the World Cup Zimbabwe were promoted to Test status and Flower was unanimously selected to play against the Indians for the Inaugural Test match. On a flat pitch, he opened the batting for his country and dominated in a 100 run opening stand. He would go on to score 82, falling short of a century on Test debut. Zimbabwe again met the Indians this time on their home turf and again fell just short of a maiden Test century when he fell for 96. Pakistan toured Zimbabwe in 1995 and in the 1st Test Flower finally scored his maiden Test century. Not content, he went on to register double hundred. He hit only 12 boundaries and faced 523 balls as Zimbabwe scored a massive 4/544 declared. His innings would help Zimbabwe to win their first ever Test match as they won by a convincing Innings and 64 Runs. He would continue to haunt the Pakistani side, scoring his second Test century at Sheikhupura Stadium in Pakistan. In 1997 Flower became the first Zimbabwean to score a century in both innings of a Test match. Playing against New Zealand in Harare, he scored 104 and 151. A year later he scored his 5th Test century, an innings of 156 not out at Queens Sports Club against Pakistan. He would suffer a form slump after that innings, not scoring a 99 for 33 innings including 6 ducks. On 25 November 2000 he ended his slump with a fine 106 against India and would go on to score 4 50's in his next 6 innings. =One Day International career= Flower (on the right) with Essex teammate Will Jefferson. By the end of his ODI career, Flower had taken more wickets than any other Zimbabwean bowler except Heath Streak. His ODI statistics make better reading than his Test statistics. He would score 6 ODI tons and had it not been for the nervous nineties may have had many more. 9 times he was either unbeaten or dismissed in the 90's. One of his most memorable centuries would come in the final of a one-day triangular tournament in Bangladesh. Playing against Kenya he smashed an 82 ball century and finished with 140, just 2 short of the national record at the time. He holds the record for taking the most catches as fielder for Zimbabawe in ODI history(86) Flower more importantly was the first ever batsman to carry his bat right through the completed innings of an ODI. He also holds the unique record for being the only batsman in ODI cricket to have carried his bat in a One Day International match in a winning cause. =Late career= In 2004 he announced his retirement from international cricket. This was due largely to the dispute between the rebels and the Zimbabwean Cricket Union. He signed a contract with Essex as a Kolpak player where he would play alongside his brother Andy. There was some grumbling amongst Essex supporters at his signing, but this appeared to die down after his first season, when he topped the Essex 2005 List-A batting averages and was third in the number of wickets taken. =Return= Following another fine season for Essex which turned out to be his last season of county cricket, Flower was handed a shock recall to the Zimbabwe team for the tour of South Africa. He is expected to combine playing duties with his role of batting coach of the national side and was in contention to play in the 2011 Cricket World Cup held in India.http://www.cricinfo.com/south-africa-v- zimbabwe-2010/content/story/479337.html http://www.cricinfo.com/zimbabwe/content/current/story/479692.html He made his international return in October 2010 the first ODI of a three-match series vs South Africa.http://www.cricinfo.com/zimbabwe/content/story/483649.html Coaching career On May 2014, he was appointed as the batting coach of Pakistan cricket team and his contract was ended in 2019 by PCB. Currently he is the batting coach of Sri Lanka cricket team.

He was a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1991. Haynes formed a formidable partnership with Gordon Greenidge for the West Indies cricket team in Test cricket during the 1980s. Between them they managed 16 century stands, four in excess of 200. The pair made 6482 runs while batting together in partnerships, the third highest total for a batting partnership in Test cricket history.ESPNCricinfo (2011). ESPNCricinfo Partnership records. Retrieved 20 August 2011. Haynes favoured a more measured approach to batting. He compiled 7487 runs in 116 Test matches at an average of 42.29, his highest Test innings of 184 coming against England in 1980. He is one of the few Test batsman to have been dismissed handled the ball, falling in this fashion against India on 24 November 1983. He is also one of the few players to have scored a century on an ODI debut. International career He first made his name on the international scene with 148 at Antigua in a One-Day International against Australia and until recently Haynes held a number of ODI records, including most runs and most centuries. His 148 against Australia came on his debut match in One Day International which still remains the highest run ever made by a batsman on debut in ODI as well as the fastest century scored by an ODI debutant.http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/records/233754.html He played in the World Cup of 1979, won by the West Indies, and returned to the competition in 1983, 1987 and 1992. In the 25 World Cup matches, Haynes scored 854 runs at 37.13 with three fifties and one century. As of 10 December 2013 Haynes remains one of the only two players in the history of ODI cricket to have scored century on both debut and last match played, the only other being English batsman Dennis Amiss. Haynes, when facing Australia in the bitter 1990‚Äì91 series, clashed verbally with Ian Healy, Merv Hughes, Craig McDermott and David Boon, who christened him 'Dessie'. He is also noted for using delaying tactics against England during the 1989‚Äì90 Test series. Like most West Indian openers, Haynes was strong against pace and, after struggling against spin early in his career, developed into a strong player of slow bowling, exemplified by his knocks of 75 and 143 against Australia on an SCG dustbowl in 1989. Haynes had a successful career in English county cricket, playing 95 first class games for Middlesex, scoring 7071 runs at 49.1 with a best of 255* against Sussex. He was awarded his Middlesex cap in 1989 and played at Lords till 1994. He played 63 first class matches for Barbados from 1976/77 to 1994/95, scoring 4843 at 49.92 with a top score of 246 and 21 games for Western Province from 1994/95 to 1996/97, making 1340 runs at 40.6 with a best of 202*. In all first class cricket he made 26030 runs at 45.90 and 15651 more in 419 one day games at 42.07 with a top score of 152*. He scored 61 first class hundreds in all and won 55-man of the match awards in all forms of the game. Haynes was only the third West Indian to carry his bat in a Test innings. He is one of only two players in international Test Cricket to achieve this feat three times, the other being Dean Elgar. Haynes announced his retirement in March 1997 after playing a first-class game for Western Province against Natal in Cape Town. He made 83 in the first innings and was dismissed for a third-ball duck in the second and his last. Post retirement After retirement as player, Haynes has served as Chairman of Selectors of the Barbados Cricket Association, President of Carlton Cricket Club, Secretary of the West Indies Players Association and is currently a Director of the West Indies Cricket Board. He is a former Government Senator and was Chairman of the National Sports Council. His main relaxation is golf.

One of the best fast bowlers ever to have played Test cricket, he was nicknamed \\"Whispering Death\\" due to his quiet approach to the bowling crease. His bowling was smooth and extremely fast, and he used his height () to generate large amounts of bounce and zip off the pitch. He was part of the fearsome West Indian pace battery, together with Joel Garner, Andy Roberts, Sylvester Clarke, Colin Croft, Wayne Daniel and the late Malcolm Marshall that devastated batting line-ups throughout the world in the seventies and early eighties. Early in his Test career, in 1976, Holding broke the record for best bowling figures in a Test match by a West Indies bowler, 14 wickets for 149 runs (14/149). The record still stands. During his first-class cricket career, Holding played for Jamaica, Canterbury, Derbyshire, Lancashire and Tasmania. In June 1988 Holding was celebrated on the $2 Jamaican stamp alongside the Barbados Cricket Buckle. Early life Michael Holding was born on 16 February 1954, the youngest of four children to Ralph and Enid Holding who lived in Kingston. In an interview in 2020, Holding stated that his mother's family disowned her because her husband's skin was too dark. The family was passionate about sport, and only a few years after Michael was born his father enrolled him as a member of Melbourne Cricket Club at Kingston. At the age of three he was diagnosed with asthma, but by his early teenage years he no longer needed an inhaler. He led an active life, playing sport in the scrubland and wooded areas near his home. Though his family would often watch the cricket at Sabina Park, Holding preferred to play Catchy Shubby Cricket than watch. Famous quote by Holding \\"Water is for fish man\\" Cricketing career =Early career= In late 1975 the West Indies team embarked on a six-Test tour of Australia. Earlier that year the West Indies had defeated Australia in the final of the inaugural World Cup, and the teams were considered to be the best of their day. Fast bowler Bernard Julien was out of form and his place in the team was given to debutant Michael Holding who opened the bowling with Andy Roberts. He picked up a groin strain in the second Test and bowled as fast as , quicker than Jeff Thomson, Australia's fastest bowler. According to Wisden in his debut series, Holding \\"had shown himself to be Roberts' natural opening partner and indeed was timed to be faster than Jeff Thomson, Dennis Lillee and Andy Roberts, and considered that when West Indies captain Clive Lloyd chose to give Julien the new ball rather than Holding it was a mistake that cost the West Indies the match. Australia won the series 5‚Äì1, and though Holding's 10 wickets in 5 matches cost on average more than 60 runs each, Wisden believed that he had performed well enough to establish himself in the side and had the potential to bowl faster still. India visited the West Indies in March for a four-Test series. The defeat by Australia had left Andy Roberts exhausted, so he was rested for the matches against India and Holding took over as leader of the West Indies bowling attack. He finished as his team's leading wicket taker (second in the series to Indian leg spinner B. S. Chandrasekhar) with 19 wickets at less than 20 runs each and helped his team to a 2‚Äì1 victory. The West Indies toured England in 1976, and though Holding was unknown in the country the British press picked up on his performance in Australia and there was a sense of anticipation about his bowling. An early psychological blow was landed by the West Indies in a warm up match against the Marylebone Cricket Club when Holding struck Dennis Amiss on the head, leaving a wound that needed stitches. Amiss was a veteran player and likely to open for England in the forthcoming Tests and seeing him struggle against Holding's pace was a warning of things to come. In the lead up to the series the South African-born England captain Tony Greig was confident of his team's chances, saying in an interview \\"I like to think people are building these West Indians up, because I'm not really sure they're as good as everyone thinks. You must remember, that the West Indians, these guys, if they get on top they are magnificent cricketers. But if they're down, they grovel, and I intend, with the help of Closey Brian Close and a few others, to make them grovel.\\" The comments outraged the West Indians, and to the team the use of the term \\"grovel\\" in particular \\"smacked of racism and apartheid\\". Oval against England in 1976. It was his 13th Test. The West Indies fast bowling attack consisted of Roberts, Holding, Wayne Daniel, and Vanburn Holder. The first three used the bouncer liberally (Wisden notes that Holding in particular bowled \\"exceptionally fast\\"), and England's John Edrich and Brian Close suffered in particular (Close was 45 when the series started in June, and Edrich turned 39 during the second Test). In the first innings of the fifth Test, played at the Oval, Holding took 8 wickets for 92 runs which remained the best bowling figures of his first-class career and were the best bowling figures by a West Indies bowler at the ground. He took a further 6 wickets in the match to finish with 14/149, which remain the best match figures by a West Indian in a Test match. The West Indies won the five match series 3‚Äì0. According to an urban myth, during a Test match between the West Indies and England when Holding was to bowl to English player Peter Willey, the commentator at the time, Brian Johnston, described the action as \\"The bowler's Holding, the batsman's Willey\\" (a double entendre, as \\"willy\\" is British English slang for a penis). However Wisden states that there is no record of Johnston or anyone else actually saying this (although a colleague of Johnston's, Henry Blofeld, recalls the incident occurring during a Test match at The Oval in 1976.) In a limited-overs international between England and West Indies on 26 August 1976 at Scarborough, Michael Holding's return from long-leg deflected off the nearer wicket and scuttled along the pitch to break the far one with Graham Barlow and Alan Knott, on his only appearance as England's captain, stranded in mid- pitch. The dumbfounded umpires, David Constant and Arthur Jepson, rejected the run-out appeal for reasons that remain obscure. The West Indies played 26 first-class matches on the tour, winning 18 and losing just 2, making them the most successful side to tour England. =World Series Cricket= An Australian Broadcasting Corporation news report of the first WSC match. After the 1976 series against England, Holding enrolled at the University of the West Indies on a scholarship to study Computer Science. As profession cricket did not pay well, Holding was preparing himself for employment off the cricket pitch. A shoulder injury sustained towards the end of the 1976 tour of England prevented Holding from joining the West Indies squad to face Pakistan in March 1977. During the series Lloyd approached Holding about a joining a World XI team captained by England's Tony Greig to play against Australia in World Series Cricket; there was still animosity between Greig and the West Indies players over Greig's comments before the 1976 Test series in England. The series was the brainchild of Kerry Packer after his television channel, Channel 9, missed out on the rights to broadcast Australia's home Test series. Players would be paid more than they had been before, and with his earnings from the series Holding was able to buy his first car and later a house. When it became public the Australian Cricket Board and England Cricket Board threatened to ban players taking part. Packer responded to the pressure by signing the whole West Indies team to compete in the series alongside a World XI and an Australian team. Relegated to playing at football ground, the series suffered from poor crowds. The negative press surrounding the World Series ‚Äì players were labelled mercenaries ‚Äì bred a sense of camaraderie in the West Indies side, contributing to the team's dominance in the Test arena for years to come. In March 1978, after the first season of World Series Cricket, Australia embarked on a Test tour of the West Indies. Australia were severely depleted because the ACB refused to pick leading players such as Greg Chappell, Ian Chappell, and Dennis Lillee because they had played in the Packer series. Holding suffered a recurrence of his shoulder injury and so missed the series, but otherwise the West Indies began the series at full strength. Eventually external pressure on the West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) not to select players who played in the World Series resulted in three players being dropped and Clive Lloyd's resignation as captain. The rest of the team refused to play in protest and were replaced by second-choice players. The second year of World Series Cricket was more successful than the first and matches were played in front of much larger crowds. Though contracted to last three years, the competition ended after two because Packer and the ACB came to an agreement regarding broadcasting rights. =West Indies rampant= A less amusing incident for which Holding is also remembered was kicking over the stumps in anger at an umpiring decision in New Zealand in 1979/80. The tour had gone poorly almost from the beginning: West Indies had just finished a long tour of Australia, and were perhaps resentful about having a tour to unglamorous New Zealand immediately afterwards (their leading batsman of the time, Viv Richards, refused to tour). West Indies felt that the umpiring had been incompetent and against them throughout. After an appeal for caught behind was turned down, Holding turned and kicked the stumps in frustration. The Kensington Oval, Barbados, where Holding bowled a fearsome over to a 40-year-old Geoffrey Boycott. Holding was the bowler in what is often described as \\"the greatest over in Test history\\", which he bowled in 1981 in Bridgetown to English batsman Geoff Boycott. The first five balls increased in pace, causing Boycott to have to react very rapidly to avoid being hit. The final ball saw Boycott clean bowled, to the great delight of the crowd. In 1984, he along with Vivian Richards set the record for the highest 10th wicket partnership in ODI history(106*) Holding opened the bowling with Andy Roberts in 33 Tests, and the pair claimed 216 wickets at an average of 25.27 runs each, making them one of the most successful new ball partnerships. Despite modest batting talent, he holds the record for the most sixes in a Test career for any player with fewer than 1,000 career runs. He hit 36 sixes in his Test career, placing him at 32 in the all-time list. Remarkably almost a quarter of his Test runs came by way of sixes. In 2009 Rudi Webster said \\"It is difficult to overestimate how much the players in [the West Indies team led by Clive Lloyd] were admired and idolised on the cricket field. And off the field they were loved and respected for the manner in which they conducted themselves and for the role they played as outstanding ambassadors.\\" The Federation of International Cricketers' Associations began a Hall of Fame in 1999 and Holding was inducted into it. The FICA Hall of Fame ended in 2003, but all the inductees were given official recognition when they were included in the ICC's Hall of Fame on its inauguration in 2009. Post-playing career Holding has written two autobiographies the first of which, Whispering Death, was published in 1988 before he retired and the second, No Holding Back, over 20 years later in 2010. After retiring from cricket Holding ran a petrol station in Kingston called \\"Michael Holding's Service Centre\\", employing several people who were members of Melbourne Cricket Club of which he was a member. The business was initially successful, though Holding found it stressful. Broadcasting began to take up more of his time, and while he was away the petrol station suffered so in 1995 he decided to sell. He also considered taking up umpiring, though not as a profession, and considered pursuing qualifications to umpire in domestic matches in Jamaica but his time was taken up with managing the petrol station and broadcasting. =Broadcaster and ICC official= Holding's career evolved after his retirement from active play. He had never aspired to becoming a commentator but was friends with a producer at Radio Jamaica who invited him to comment on cricket. This led to him working around the Caribbean, but at this stage work was not regular enough to be his main source of income. Holding made his transition from radio commentator to television in 1990 when cricket in the Caribbean was broadcast on television around the world for the first time. Two local commentators were chosen and Holding was picked alongside Tony Cozier at the latter's recommendation. He became a broadcaster as a member of the Sky Sports cricket commentary team, as well as being a regular member of the SuperSport cricket commentary team in South Africa. The ICC created the Bowling Action Review Committee (BARC) in 1999, and on the recommendation of the WICB, Holding was one of the founding members of the committee. The role of the committee was to monitor players suspected of throwing using various video replays. The process of assessing a bowler's action has since become more scientific with more technology used and though the committee disbanded in 2005 it was influential in the ICC establishing the 15-degree maximum for bowlers straightening their arms in delivery. Even when working for the BARC, Holding was a strident critic of the ICC so in 2007 when he was approached to join the newly formed ICC cricket committee he thought a friend was playing a joke on him. Holding joined the committee and though he was initially optimistic quit in July 2008 in protest against the ICC's decision to overturn the result of the Oval Test between Pakistan and England, which was changed from a forfeit by Pakistan (who chose not to take the field in protest against being accused of ball tampering) to a draw. The forfeiture was later reinstated, and Holding resolved not to rejoin the committee. Holding has stated \\"I don't think [twenty20] is good for the game... It has its place but it will be bad unless those in charge manage it properly and I do not think they can because they are blinded by money. I can see Test cricket dying because of this.\\" Despite this he was initially supportive of the Stanford 20/20. He believed the tournament funded by Allen Stanford could revitalise Caribbean cricket (the fortunes of the West Indies team declined from the 1990s onwards). However, with the conception of the Stanford Super Series involving the England Cricket Board in 2008 he became critical of the venture as he felt that funds which had previously been invested in domestic teams were no longer of interest to Stanford. =Racism= In July 2020 Holding made widely-praised comments on his experience of and views on racism.https://inews.co.uk/sport/cricket/michael- holding-racism-video-speech-sky-sports-cricket-ebony-rainford- brent-500216?_gl=1*1bkgdmk*_ga*djNkTi1UYWxrcG5WOF8xU0lSYjVGbUJtY3JkMUpkVU56Y3JqMnpjZ0hLZ0F1S1htLWRBMEhPcUp6UGNzNlU1ag..https://amp.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/jul/08/michael- holdings-eloquence-skys-unflinching-masterpiece-on- racehttps://www.skysports.com/cricket/news/12123/12021574/michael-holding-and- ebony-rainford-brent-say-institutionalised-racism-must-be-eradicated-for-the- good-of-humanity Personal life Holding's first marriage was to Cherine Holding, a Sri Lankan, who he met when touring Australia in the late ‚Äò70s.https://www.dnaindia.com/sports/report-the-untold-story-of-whispering- death-1149570 Their son Ryan was born in 1981.

A right-arm fast bowler, he represented Australia in 53 Test matches between 1985 and 1994, taking 212 wickets. He played 33 One Day Internationals, taking 38 wickets. He took a hat-trick in a Test against the West Indies at the WACA in 1988‚Äì89 and went on to take 8/87 for the match. In 1993, he took 31 wickets in the Ashes series against England. He was a useful lower-order batsman, scoring two half-centuries in Tests and over 1,000 runs in all. He also represented the Victorian Bushrangers, Essex in English county cricket, the ACT Comets and Australia A in the World Series Cup. Childhood Hughes was born in Euroa, Victoria. He started kindergarten in Apollo Bay and his first year at school came when the family went back to Euroa. Organized sport began in 3rd grade at Werribee. In 5th grade, he pestered his father to be allowed to join football at Werribee where he held his own, despite the fact that he was one of the smallest players when out of his age group. Hughes' enthusiasm for sport was described as \\"unquenchable.\\"Patrick Keane, in association with Merv Hughes, Merv: the Full Story (Australia: HarperCollinsPublishers, 1997), page 11. Domestic career Hughes started his career playing district cricket with Footscray in 1978‚Äì79. Footscray (now called Footscray-Edgewater) has subsequently had their main home ground named after him; it is now known as the Mervyn G. Hughes Oval. He was selected for Victoria in 1981‚Äì82 and made his debut against the South Australian Redbacks. International career Hughes first appeared for Australia against India in 1985‚Äì86. He took 1‚Äì123 and was not re-selected until the Ashes series against England the following year. At the WACA Ground in 1988‚Äì89, Hughes completed a hat-trick that was unusual as it was spread across three separate overs, two innings and two different days. He had Curtly Ambrose caught behind with the last ball of his 36th over; ended the West Indies' first innings in his 37th, by removing Patrick Patterson; and more than a day later, completed his hat- trick by trapping Gordon Greenidge lbw with the first ball of the West Indies' second innings. The Australian selectors always viewed Hughes as a Test match player rather than a one-day player. He was generally only selected for the shorter game when another player was injured or otherwise unavailable. Hughes' physical presence (a burly 6'4\\"), handlebar moustache, a penchant for exuberant displays of affection for his fellow players, along with a tendency to talk to the opposition in inventively colourful language (his nickname was \\"Fruitfly\\" ‚Äì a somewhat incongruous nickname until Allan Border explained it was a reference to \\"Australia's greatest national pest\\") and a (some would say) \\"mincing\\" run-up (that at times stretched to 45 paces), made him a firm favorite amongst supporters, who would often imitate his warm-up stretches behind him en masse. In England, on his second Ashes tour in 1993, the crowd often chanted \\"Sumo\\" when he ran in to bowl.Spinner poses weighty problems ‚Äì Daily Telegraph ‚Äì 7 March 2007 Hughes played his last Test in Cape Town against South Africa in 1994. After cricket Late in his career, Hughes undertook a stint with the ACT Comets, which turned out to be unsuccessful. He claimed only five wickets at an average of 46.80 over six matches (Rodney Davison, Jimmy Maher, Jamie Cox, Shaun Young and Ryan Campbell). Merv Hughes' Test career batting performance. Hughes replaced Allan Border in June 2005 as a selector for the Australian cricket team, although his performance as a selector came under much scrutiny after many controversial decisions and the loss of the number-one ranking in Test matches after the 2009 Ashes series. However, Australia would go on to have a successful 2009‚Äì10 summer, finishing undefeated in all three forms of the game. Hughes though, was later dropped as a selector for the Australian cricket team and subsequently replaced by Greg Chappell on 29 October 2010. He is a prominent supporter of the Western Bulldogs in the Australian Football League and has also done some acting, portraying Ivan Milat in the comedy movie Fat Pizza. Additionally, Hughes has appeared on TV commercials as well, featuring losing weight with \\"The 14-day All-Bran Challenge\\" and appearing as himself in the English comedy show Hale and Pace. Personal life Hughes was a notorious consumer of alcohol and food. Towards the end of his career, this was felt to have increased damage to his knees and may have ultimately led to a shortening of his Australian and Victorian playing careers. Having always been rather overweight, he participated in both seasons of Channel Nine's Celebrity Overhaul to lose weight and improve his fitness. He was the top performer (weight-wise) in the first season of the show. Hughes is noted for his large moustache. Described by Cricinfo as being \\"of incredible proportions\\", the moustache became sufficiently synonymous with Hughes for him to be rumored to insure it for ¬£200,000. In a 2013 Sky Sports interview during the 2013 Ashes series, he quashed this rumour as being false. Other sports Hughes also played Australian rules football during the winter in the late 1970s and early 1980s; at his peak, he was a key position player for the Werribee Football Club in the Victorian Football Association first division. In the media In 2015, Hughes appeared on the Australian version of the TV show I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!. In an interview for \\"Hotspur\\" magazine, Hughes revealed he has supported Tottenham Hotspur since the early 1980s. \\"I went to a mate's house to watch the FA Cup Final, everyone in the house was supporting the other team except the guy I sat next to. He was English, and I told him I was with him 100 per cent. Spurs won and I've supported them ever since.\\"http://www.tottenhamhotspur.com/news/ashes-to-ashes-spurs-to- spurs-290909/  Footnotes   References  * Patrick Keane, in association with Merv Hughes, Merv: the Full Story (Australia: HarperCollinsPublishers, 1997) External links * * Category:1961 births Category:Living people Category:Australia One Day International cricketers Category:Australia Test cricketers Category:Essex cricketers Category:People from Euroa Category:Test cricket hat-trick takers Category:Victoria cricketers Category:Wisden Cricketers of the Year Category:ACT Comets cricketers Category:Australia national cricket team selectors Category:Australian cricketers Category:Recipients of the Australian Sports Medal Category:Werribee Football Club players Category:Cricketers from Victoria (Australia) Category:Cricketers at the 1992 Cricket World Cup Category:I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!

He had an excellent record in Test cricket and is best remembered for revolutionising the ODI format. Through the late 1980s and early 1990s, he was recognised as among the best ODI batsmen in the world, a view which has been validated in the retrospective ICC Player Rankings. His batting was often characterised by his agile footwork against both pace and spin, quick running between wickets, and willingness to take risks and intimidate bowlers. In 2019, Jones was inducted into the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame. Domestic career Jones began his first-class career in the 1981‚Äì82 season with Victoria in the Sheffield Shield. Jones also played for Durham and Derbyshire in the English County Championship. Jones captained Derbyshire to second place in the 1996 County Championship, their best finish for 60 years. Jones scored 1,338 runs in the season, more than any other Derbyshire player. He left Derbyshire mid-season in 1997 after disagreements with team mates. Jones also had run-ins with authority and teammates in his home state of Victoria. During his career, he scored 19,188 runs in first- class matches, including 55 centuries and 88 half centuries and a highest score of 324 not out, at an average of 51.85. International career Jones was selected on the 1984 tour of the West Indies after Graham Yallop had to pull out due to injury. He was not picked in the original XI, but was drafted into the side after Steve Smith fell ill. Jones himself was very ill before the Test, and deemed his score of 48 on his debut as his \\"best knock\\". Between 1984 and 1992, Jones played 52 Test matches for Australia, scoring 3,631 runs, including 11 centuries, at an average of 46.55. His most notable innings was in only his third Test, against India in the Tied Test in Madras (Chennai) in 1986. Suffering from dehydration in the oppressively hot and humid conditions, Jones was frequently vomiting on the pitch. He wanted to go off the field \\"retired ill\\" which led his captain Allan Border to say that if he could not handle the conditions, he would \\"get a Queenslander\\" (Greg Ritchie, a Queenslander like Border, was the next man in to bat). This comment spurred Jones to score 210, an innings he considered a defining moment in his career and one of the epic Test innings in Australian cricket folklore. This innings of 210 remains the highest score by an Australian cricketer in India. After the match, Jones was put on to an intravenous drip. One of the keys to Australia's unexpected victory in the 1987 Cricket World Cup was the batting foundation laid by the top three batsmen - Jones batting at number three behind the openers David Boon and Geoff Marsh. Jones would score a total of 314 runs at an average of 44, with 3 half-centuries. During a 1987 World Cup match against India, one of Jones' shots was changed from a four to a six during the innings break. Australia later won the match by one run. Jones was quoted as saying that he had spoken to the umpires to demand it was changed to a six. Jones went on to be a mainstay of the Australian Test team middle order over the next six years and being one of the stars of the successful 1989 Ashes tour of England. He was recognised for his efforts by being named as one of Cricketers of the Year in the 1990 edition of Wisden Almanack. He was controversially dropped from the test team at the start of the 1992‚Äì93 season, despite having topped the averages in the previous Test series, against Sri Lanka. Jones stayed in the one-day team a little longer: he was omitted from the one-day team for the 1993 Ashes tour, but managed to force his way back into the team for one last stint during the 1993‚Äì94 season. After Jones was dropped from the eighth and final ODI of the series in South Africa, Jones immediately announced his retirement from ODI cricket. After cricket After retiring in 1998, he continued to remain involved in cricket as a coach, commentator and writer for The Age and The Sydney Morning Herald. He was also a noted fundraiser for people with cancer. On 12 June 2006, in the Queen's Birthday Honours List, he was made a Member (AM) of the Order of Australia for \\"service to cricket as a player, coach and commentator, and to the community through fundraising activities for organisations assisting people with cancer\\". In 2007, Jones was named in Australia's \\"greatest ever ODI team.\\" He was inducted into the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame in 2019. Dean Jones's career performance graph. Coaching career Jones worked as the head coach of Islamabad United in Pakistan Super League (PSL). During his reign, Islamabad United won the 2016 and 2018 Pakistan Super Leagues. In November 2019, Jones became head coach of PSL team Karachi Kings, replacing Mickey Arthur ahead of the 5th edition of Pakistan Super League. In October 2017, Afghanistan Cricket Board (ACB) appointed Jones as the interim head coach for Afghanistan's Intercontinental Cup fixture against Hong Kong.  Commentary career  He received the nickname \\"Professor Deano\\" after giving a pitch report for a television show by dressing up as a professor prior to the group stage match of the 2004 Asia Cup between India and Sri Lanka which was at the Rangiri Dambulla International Stadium on 18 July 2004. He eventually emerged as one of the prominent broadcasters in cricket and was known for his work as commentator with Indian Premier League select dugout show in Star Sports. He also served as a summariser for BBC's Test Match Special and had a brief stint as a commentator in the Tamil Nadu Premier League as well as in the Karnataka Premier League. During his later part of commentary career, he voiced his opinions on reviving international cricket in Pakistan since 2009. He also toured war-torn Afghanistan to work as a commentator for the fifth edition of the Shpageeza Cricket League in 2017. He narrowly escaped a suicide bomb blast at the Kabul International Cricket Ground while working as a commentator during a group match of the 2017 Shpageeza Cricket League. Controversy Despite his abundant talent as a cricketer, Jones's strong personality and tendency to speak his mind sometimes resulted in friction and conflict with teammates, other players and selectors. An example is an incident on 16 January 1993 during the first one-day final of the 1992‚Äì93 Benson & Hedges World Series against West Indies at the Sydney Cricket Ground, when he asked paceman Curtly Ambrose to remove the wristband he was wearing on his bowling arm. Riled by this request, Ambrose went on to take 5/32 for the match. He followed this up in the remaining two games of the Test series with a 10-wicket haul in Adelaide and then a famous spell of 7 for 1 in Perth to help the West Indies retain the Frank Worrell Trophy. Writing about the incident over 20 years later, Jones reflected that, at the time, he was struggling to keep his place in the team after having his thumb broken by Wasim Akram. Furthermore, Damien Martyn had taken Jones's spot in the Test side, and Jones was furious after coach Bob Simpson announced the team for the upcoming Test in Adelaide and was again left out. Jones noticed that Ambrose's white wristbands were causing difficulties for the batsmen, and thought that by asking him to remove them, \\"it would create a massive stir within the Windies team and might get Ambrose to bowl a different line and length\\". Jones's commentating contract with 10 Sport was terminated after referring to South African player Hashim Amla as a \\"terrorist\\" on 7 August 2006. When Amla, who is a Muslim with a full beard, took a catch, Jones was heard to say \\"the terrorist gets another wicket\\". Jones made the comment during a commercial break, but the comment went to air live in South Africa as its broadcast had not been interrupted. He apologised for his actions. In April 2020, Jones rescinded his life membership at Cricket Victoria and removed his name from the best men's one-day player award. He suggested the administration had given \\"jobs for the boys\\" in hiring David Hussey and Michael Klinger as head coaches of the Melbourne Stars and Melbourne Renegades respectively, jobs he had applied for at the time. The comments were labelled \\"a good bit of self- promotion\\" by Cricket Victoria performance boss Shaun Graf. Death Jones died on 24 September 2020 in Mumbai due to cardiac arrest, aged 59. He was a part of the Indian Premier League (IPL) commentary team for the Star Network at the time of his death. Jones collapsed in a hotel in Mumbai at around midday IST (UTC+05:30). Fellow former Australian cricketer Brett Lee witnessed the emergency and attempted CPR to resuscitate Jones prior to an ambulance arriving. Jones was pronounced dead at hospital.

She was formerly a research associate at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., and is based at the Michigan State University. She is associated with other major centers of research in the United States and the United Kingdom. Rasmussen's early research investigated South American seabirds and fossil birds from North America. She later specialised in Asian birds describing several new species and clarifying the status of others, particularly white-eyes and owls. More recently, she has been involved in large scale collaborations looking at patterns of global biodiversity, and has assessed the taxonomic status of South Asian vultures. She was the main author of Birds of South Asia: The Ripley Guide, a landmark publication due to its greater geographical and species coverage compared to its predecessors. As a result of her study of museum bird specimens when researching for the book, she was instrumental in unveiling the extent of the theft from museums and fraudulent documentation perpetrated by eminent British ornithologist Richard Meinertzhagen. Early life and career Pamela Rasmussen is the daughter of Helen Rasmussen, a Seventh-Day Adventist, whose husband, Chester Murray Rasmussen, a doctor, had left the family when Pamela and her sisters were young. Her interest in birds started when her mother bought her the junior edition of Oliver Austin's Birds of the World, and Pamela subsequently always chose to receive bird books as presents. She took her M.S. in 1983 at Walla Walla University, an Adventist- affiliated university in southeast Washington, and her Ph.D. at the University of Kansas in 1990, where she studied blue-eyed shags, and was introduced to evolutionary theory, which had not been taught at her alma mater. Rasmussen is a visiting assistant professor of zoology, and assistant museum curator of mammalogy and ornithology, at Michigan State University (MSU), having formerly been a research associate for the eminent American ornithologist S. Dillon Ripley at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. She is a member of the American Ornithological Society (AOS) North American Classification Committee (NACC), a scientific associate with the bird group of the British Natural History Museum zoology section at Tring, and an associate editor of The Ibis, the scientific journal of the British Ornithologists' Union. She is a scientific affiliate for the Field Museum of Natural History and the founder and editor of AVoCet, MSU's avian vocalizations center. In 2020 she replaced the ornithologist Frank Gill as an editor of the IOC World Bird List, an online list maintained on behalf of the International Ornithologists' Union. Rasmussen is married to Michael D. Gottfried, who is Curator of Paleontology, Associate Professor of Geology, and Director of the Center for Integrative Studies in General Science at MSU. =Research highlights= South American seabirds Rasmussen's early work was largely focused on studies of the systematics, ecology and behaviour of Patagonian seabirds, notably cormorants. She studied plumage variations in juvenile blue-eyed, king and red-legged cormorants, and used plumage and behavioural patterns to establish relationships between king and blue-eyed shags. She also reviewed the fishing activity of olivaceous cormorants. Asian birds An 1891 painting of the forest owlet, which was rediscovered by Rasmussen in 1997 Rasmussen described four new Asian bird species from her study of museum specimens. The Nicobar scops owl Otus alius, the Sangihe scops owl Otus collari, and the cinnabar hawk owl Ninox ios, a Sulawesi endemic, all in 1998, and the Taiwan bush- warbler Bradypterus alishanensis in 2000. She rediscovered the forest owlet Athene blewitti, which had not been seen since 1884, in western India, previous searches by S. Dillon Ripley, Salim Ali and others having failed because they relied on fake documentation from Richard Meinertzhagen. In November 1997, Rasmussen and Ben King of the American Museum of Natural History spent ten days unsuccessfully searching two east Indian locations before driving west to the site of another old specimen, where King spotted a small, chunky owl with short, heavily white-feathered legs and huge claws, which Rasmussen confirmed as the target species whilst the owl was videotaped and photographed. With her colleagues, she clarified the taxonomy of Indonesian white-eyes, establishing the specific status of the Sangihe white- eye Zosterops nehrkorni and the Seram white-eye Z. stalkeri and confirmed the identity of the Serendib scops owl which had originally been discovered in Sri Lanka by local ornithologist Deepal Warakagoda. The Togian white-eye, identified as a new species by Rasmussen and her colleagues in 2008 The imperial pheasant is a rare bird found in the forests of Vietnam and Laos. Rasmussen and her co-workers used morphology, hybridisation experiments, and DNA analysis to show that this pheasant, previously thought critically endangered, is actually a naturally occurring hybrid between the Vietnamese pheasant Lophura hatinhensis and the subspecies annamensis of the silver pheasant L. nycthemera. A 2008 paper saw a return to white-eye taxonomy with the formal description of the Togian white-eye Zosterops somadikartai, an endemic species of the Togian Islands of Indonesia, which, unlike most of its relatives, lacks the white ring around the eye which give this group of birds its name. Rasmussen noted that the Togian white-eye is distinctive not only in its appearance, but also in its lilting song, which sounds higher pitched and is less varied in frequency than the songs of its close relatives. Pamela Rasmussen's interest in Asian birds led to her involvement in more specifically conservation-directed projects. Two Gyps vultures, the Indian white-rumped vulture, Gyps bengalensis, and the \\"long-billed vulture\\" suffered a 99 percent population decrease in South Asia due to poisoning by diclofenac, a veterinary drug that causes kidney failure in birds that have eaten the carcasses of treated cattle. Rasmussen showed that there are two distinct species of long-billed vulture: the Indian vulture G. indicus and slender- billed vulture G. tenuirostris. This is important to conservation, since a captive-breeding program has been established to assist the recovery of at- risk vulture species. Biodiversity Indian vulture, a vulnerable species newly split as a result of Rasmussen's research into the genus Gyps In 2005, Rasmussen was part of a large multi-institutional collaboration investigating biodiversity hotspots, which have a prominent role in conservation. The study assessed locations quantitatively for three criteria of bird diversity ‚Äì species richness, the level of threat, and the number of endemic species. The results demonstrated that hotspots did not show the same geographical distribution for each factor. Only 2.5% of hotspot areas are common to all three aspects of diversity, with over 80% of hotspots registering on only one criterion. Each criterion explained less than 24% of the variation in the other factors, suggesting that even within a single taxonomic class, different mechanisms are responsible for the origin and maintenance of various aspects of diversity. Consequently, the different types of hotspots also vary greatly in their utility as conservation tools. Rasmussen's recent work has concentrated on further large-scale collaborations with the same group of institutions studying global patterns in biodiversity. A survey of species richness and geographical range size did not show the decrease in range size from temperate regions to the tropics that had been previously assumed; although that pattern was largely true in the northern hemisphere, it did not appear to apply in the southern hemisphere. Research evaluating the relationship between extinction and human impact showed that, after controlling for species richness, the best predictors of the global pattern of extinction risk are measures of human impact, with ecological factors being of secondary importance. An examination of the distribution of rare and threatened vertebrate species, showed differing patterns for bird, mammal and amphibian species, which has consequences for hotspot-based conservation strategies. Other studies by Rasmussen and her international colleagues looked at the importance of energy availability, and a 2007 paper showed that global patterns of spatial turnover are driven principally by widespread species rather than restricted ones. This complements other work, and helps to establish a unified model of how terrestrial biodiversity varies both within and between the Earth's major land masses. Zooarchaeology A fossil site at a borrow pit in near Cheswold, Delaware created during highway construction unearthed 11 specimens of fragmentary and unassociated avian fossils, which were identified by Rasmussen as including a small loon, a small gull-like species and five specimens of a gannet-like seabird, probably Morus loxostylus, a common species in the Miocene. All of these forms were already known from a site in Chesapeake Bay, Maryland. The finds suggests that the Delaware site was the near-shore area of a large bay at the time of deposition.Rasmussen, Pamela C. (1998) \\"Early Miocene avifauna from the Pollack Farm site, Delaware \\" (PDF) in Benson, Richard N. (editor) (1998) Geology and paleontology of the lower Miocene Pollack Farm fossil site, Delaware Delaware Geological Survey Special Publication no. 21, State of Delaware & University of Delaware, 144‚Äì146 Rasmussen was also involved in a review of fossil birds from Miocene and Pliocene deposits in North Carolina. Finds included an early Miocene loon Colymboides minutus, various ducks, a crested tern closely resembling the modern royal tern Sterna maxima, and a member of the crow genus, one of the few fossil passerine birds from that period. The review found that fossil birds from this period generally closely resemble a modern species or genus, and those that do not can usually be placed in a modern family with a fair degree of confidence.\\"Miocene and Pliocene birds from the Lee Creek Mine, North Carolina\\" in Ray, C. E. & Bohaska, D. J. (2001). \\"Geology and Paleontology of the Lee Creek Mine, North Carolina, III.\\" Smithsonian Contributions to Paleobiology, 90. Smithsonian Institution Press, Washington D.C. 233‚Äì365. =Birds of South Asia= In 1992, Rasmussen took the position of assistant to S. Dillon Ripley, the former secretary of the Smithsonian, who was planning to produce a definitive guide to the birds of South Asia. When he became ill shortly after beginning the project, Rasmussen took over the project, and with artist John C. Anderton, produced Birds of South Asia: The Ripley Guide, a two-volume bird guide for the Indian subcontinent which was the first field guide for the area to include sonograms. Volume 1 contains the field guide with over 3400 illustrations in 180 plates, and more than 1450 colour maps. Volume 2 (Attributes and Status) gives specimen measurements, data about identification, status, distribution and habits. Vocalizations are described from recordings, and there are over 1000 sonagrams.Rasmussen, Pamela C; Anderton, John C. (2005): Birds of South Asia: The Ripley Guide. Lynx Edicions, Barcelona. 1508 species that have occurred in India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Nepal, Bhutan, Maldives, the Chagos archipelago and Afghanistan are covered, including 85 hypothetical and 67 'possible' species, which are given only short accounts. Notable aspects of Birds of South Asia are its distribution evidence-base ‚Äì the book's authors based their distributional information almost completely on museum specimens ‚Äì and its taxonomic approach, involving a large number of species-level splits. Its geographical range was also greater than that of older works, notably in the inclusion of Afghanistan. Many allopatric forms previously regarded as conspecific are treated by Rasmussen and Anderton as full species. Most of these had previously been proposed elsewhere, but the book introduced a number of innovations of its own. Experts on Asian birds, Nigel Collar and John Pilgrim, in 2008 analysed Rasmussen and Anderton's proposed changes, indicating which had previously been proposed by other authors, and which were novel, and required further justification. Although reviews in the birding and ornithological press have often been favourable, there have been criticisms. Peter Kennerley, author and Asian bird expert, considered that some of the illustrations are small and garish or technically inaccurate. He also believes that the over-reliance on sometimes very old museum specimens and dismissal of the wealth of observational data filed by amateur travelling birders is a mistake, and states that many of the taxonomic decisions appear to be random choices, unsupported by published research. Apart from the Meinertzhagen fraud, which is discussed in the next section, and the death of S. Dillon Ripley, other problems in the production of Birds of South Asia included the loss of the main map database during a trip to Burma, and poorly prepared specimen skins. There were also difficulties reconciling sources, delays in producing illustrations and maps, and in obtaining reliable data for \\"difficult\\" areas like Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Bangladesh and Afghanistan. The Andaman and Nicobar Islands also presented serious challenges with regard to the status and taxonomy of their avifaunas. Rasmussen considered in a 2005 paper whether the revised taxonomy of the book, with its many species splits, had significant conservation implications, but felt that the effect on species richness in South Asia was limited, and would have only a moderate conservation impact, increasing the number of potentially threatened species in the region from 6% of the total avifauna to about 7%. =Meinertzhagen fraud= Hill blue-flycatcher (formerly large blue flycatcher), a species with false Meinertzhagen records Rasmussen revealed the true extent of the major fraud perpetrated by the eminent British soldier, ornithologist and expert on bird lice, Colonel Richard Meinertzhagen. Meinertzhagen, who died in 1967, was the author of numerous taxonomic and other works on birds, and possessed a vast collection of bird and bird lice specimens; he was considered to be one of Britain's greatest ornithologists. However, British ornithologist Alan Knox had analysed Meinertzhagen's bird collection at the Walter Rothschild Zoological Museum in Tring, UK in the early 1990s, and uncovered significant fraud involving theft of specimens from museums and falsification of the accompanying documentation. When researching for Birds of South Asia, Rasmussen examined tens of thousands of bird specimens, since the late S. Dillon Ripley had strongly favoured the use of museum specimens to determine which birds to include. With Robert Prys-Jones of the Natural History Museum, she showed that the decades-old Meinertzhagen fraud was far more extensive than first thought. Many of the 20,000 bird specimens in his collection had been relabelled with regard to where they were collected, and sometimes also remounted. The false documentation delayed the rediscovery of the forest owlet, since previous searches had relied on Meinertzagen's faked records. Rasmussen's successful expedition ignored these and looked in the areas identified by the remaining genuine specimens. Meinertzhargen had been banned from the Natural History Museum's Bird Room for 18 months for unauthorised removal of specimens, and suspicions that he was stealing specimens and library material were documented by staff for over 30 years, twice reaching the verge of prosecution. Falsified records identified by Rasmussen and Prys- Jones included high-altitude occurrences of coral-billed scimitar-babbler Pomatorhinus ferruginosus, out-of-range Kashmir flycatcher Ficedula subrubra and Himalayan winter records of ferruginous flycatcher Muscicapa ferruginea and large blue flycatcher Cyornis magnirostris (now hill blue-flycatcher C. banyumas).BirdLife International 2004. Cyornis banyumas. 2006 IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Downloaded on 24 April 2008 However, some records such as those for Afghan snowfinch Montifringilla theresae, a species Meinertzhagen described, appear to be genuine.

A stylish right-handed batsman and useful left-arm seam bowler, he became famous in the 1950s as the first black captain of the West Indies cricket team. Along with Everton Weekes and Clyde Walcott, he formed what was known as \\"The Three Ws\\" of the West Indian cricket. He was the first of the two batsmen to have been involved in two 500-run partnerships in first-class cricket, the latter being Ravindra Jadeja.500-run partnerships. The Frank Worrell Trophy is awarded to the winner of the frequent Test series between Australia and West Indies He spent some time studying economics and playing in England. A memorial service was held in his honour in Westminster Abbey, the first such honour for a sportsman. In 2009, Worrell was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame. Career Frank Worrell was born in Barbados, within a mile of its Test Ground. He played First Class cricket for Barbados when he first came to prominence. By 1947 his mother had moved to New York City and his father was away at sea most of the time, and Worrell moved to Jamaica. Thereafter he played cricket for Jamaica. As a player for West Indies, Worrell made his debut in 1947-48 versus the England team of Gubby Allen. Following this series he settled in England to play for Radcliffe, Lancashire in the Central Lancashire League and to read economics at Manchester University. He made his highest Test score of 261 against England at Trent Bridge in 1950, and was a Wisden Cricketer of the Year for 1951. Following a successful campaign led by C. L. R. James, who was then editor of The Nation in Trinidad, the period of white Test captaincy in the West Indies came to an end. Worrell became the first black cricketer to captain the West Indies cricket team for an entire series, thus breaking the colour barriers then found in West Indian cricket.Potted biography of James, including his part in getting Worrell made captain He led the side on two particularly notable tours. The first was to Australia in 1960-61\\\\. Both Worrell and his opposing captain, Richie Benaud, encouraged their teams to play attacking cricket. The first Test of the series ended in a dramatic tie. Though West Indies lost the series 2-1, with one draw in addition to the tie, they took much credit for contributing to the series. Such was their performance and conduct on Australian soil that they were given a large ticker-tape parade in Australia at the end of their tour. On 3 February 1962, Nari Contractor, the captain of the touring Indian team, received a career-ending head injury from a bouncer bowled by West Indies fast bowler Charlie Griffith.Contractor has said: \\"It was as Griffith was to deliver the fourth ball of his second over that somebody opened a window in the pavilion. There were no sight screen at that time and my 100 per cent concentration wasn‚Äôt on that delivery. I saw it just inches away before it hit me. But it isn‚Äôt true that I ducked.‚Äù Quoted in Arzan Sam Wadia, \\"Nari Contractor: ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt mind living it all over again‚Äô\\", Parsi Khabar, 7 March 2009. Worrell was the first player from both sides to donate blood to the injured Contractor, which saved his life. In 1963, West Indies toured England. They were again popular, and this time they also won the series 3-1, and it was West Indies' second series victory in England after their 3-1 win in 1950.Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, 1962 edition, \\"West Indies in Australia, 1960‚Äì61\\"Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, 1964 edition, \\"West Indies in England, 1963\\" Worrell retired after the West Indies‚ÄìEngland series. When he left professional cricket, he became Warden of Irvine Hall at the University of the West Indies, and was appointed to the Jamaican Senate by Sir Alexander Bustamante. He strongly supported a closer political union between the nations of the Caribbean. He was knighted for his services to cricket in 1964. left to right: Ray Lindwall, Australian Prime Minister Robert Menzies, Lindsay Hassett, Frank Worrell. Worrell managed the West Indies during the 1964-65 visit by Australia. He accompanied the team to India in the winter of 1966-67\\\\.

No regime change was sought, nor any land occupied. In the military of the United States, strikes and raids are a group of military operations that, alongside quite a number of others, come under the formal umbrella of military operations other than war (MOOTW). Ex-military authors Bonn and Baker describe them as \\"nothing more than the conduct of conventional combat missions on an individual or small-scale basis\\", and what they mean, specifically, depends on which particular branch of the military is using them. However, they do have formal, general, definitions in the United States Department of Defense's Joint Publication 1-02: ::;strike:An attack to damage or destroy an objective or a capability. ::;raid:An operation to temporarily seize an area in order to secure information, confuse an adversary, capture personnel or equipment, or to destroy a capability culminating with a planned withdrawal. For the United States Air Force, strikes and raids are the least common types of MOOTW, there only having been eight of them in the period from 1947 to 1997, including Operation Just Cause, Operation Urgent Fury, and Operation El Dorado Canyon. For the United States Marine Corps, the latter was also a raid, and Operation Praying Mantis was a strike. Johnson, Mueller, and Taft contrast strikes and raids, using Operations Urgent Fury, Eldorado Canyon, and Just Cause as case studies. Strikes, they say, are \\"extreme\\" military responses to political problems, usually ones \\"caused by a failed diplomatic strategy\\". They are employed when other forms of coercion have failed. Raids are punishments aimed at an adversary, and may form parts of an overall coercive strategy. Strikes, when successful, embody elements of swift decisionmaking (both political and military), overwhelming force (and a large disparity between the opposing military forces), and surprise; and employ whatever forces are the most capable of rapid operation. Raids are about \\"sending a message\\" and employ whatever forces have the lowest risks or requirements for force protection, which generally (but not always) excludes employing ground forces.

He was a left-handed opening batsman. He represented New Zealand in 38 Tests from 2000 to 2004. During his cricketing career he played for Auckland, Buckinghamshire and Otago. Richardson also played for Dunedin Metropolitan in the Hawke Cup. International career An innings-by-innings breakdown of Richardson's Test match batting career, showing runs scored (red bars) and the average of the last ten innings (blue line). Richardson began his career as a left-arm spinner, batting at number 10. As his bowling ability declined, he worked on developing his batting, to the point where he was selected as an opening batsman for New Zealand, at age 29. His dour approach to batting - he described the range of shots he played as \\"the straight drive, the forward defensive and 27 variations on the leave\\" - provided vital stability to New Zealand's batting order at a time when they were notorious for collapses. Richardson scored 2776 Test runs at an average of 44.77, including four centuries and 19 fifties. His sole Test wicket came in a match against Pakistan in 2001, dismissing Mohammad Yousuf, then known as Yousuf Youhana, caught and bowled for 203. He was not known for his capable fielding in the one day game. In addition to his slow running, Richardson was also noted for developing (in conjunction with the Beige Brigade) a tradition to challenge the slowest runner of the opposing side to a running race at the conclusion of each tour. In his first race he beat Australia's Darren Lehmann. He has since raced Pakistan leg-spinner Danish Kaneria, South Africa's Neil McKenzie and England's Ashley Giles, only beating Kaneria. The Beige Brigade also supplied Richardson with a long-sleeved and hooded running suit in the New Zealand teams 1980s beige and brown colours. He retired from all forms of cricket in December 2004, saying he could not sustain the intensity needed to compete at international level. He noted that he finished with \\"a Test bowling average that is better than Sir Richard Hadlee's (22.29), and a 50-50 record in the end-of-series running race.\\" He scored 9,994 first-class runs during his career, remarked that the tally was \\"only different from Donald Bradman's Test batting average by a decimal point\\" (Bradman finished his career with an average of 99.94). After cricket Richardson has been a cricket commentator for SKY Sports since 2006. He co-hosted Prime show The Crowd Goes Wild with Andrew Mulligan from February 2006 to December 2016. He has hosted The Block NZ since 2012, and is the sports reporter for The AM Show. Previously, he has been a breakfast radio announcer for The Sound and Radio Sport (with a radio- based show of The Crowd Goes Wild). Richardson has commented in the media in defense of Donald Trump, saying in July 2018, \\"people need to give [Trump] a shot\\". He has been highly critical of Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern's decision to have a child in office. He was criticised for saying previously that 'being a mum is not a job'. After the 2018 Budget, Richardson told his tenants live on air that their rent would be going up to compensate him for losses due to the Government's budget.

He was the second ethnically black player after Paul Adams to play for the South African national cricket team. He reached second place in the ICC Test match bowling ratings and was the third South African cricketer to take 300 Test cricket wickets, after Shaun Pollock and Allan Donald. In December 2017, his son Thando Ntini was named in South Africa‚Äôs squad for the 2018 Under-19 Cricket World Cup. He played his last match against India in 2011. Early recognition Ntini was born in Mdingi, a small village in Cape Province, which is near King William's Town (currently in Eastern Cape Province). He was discovered by a Border Cricket Board development officer, who was setting up a mini-cricket programme. Although Ntini was both too old and too big to participate in the programme the officer, Raymond Booi, noticed the bared-footed cowherd's enthusiasm and talent for bowling. He lent the 15-year-old Ntini a pair of plimsolls and arranged for him to participate in a net session in King William's Town. Ntini impressed Booi, who contacted Greg Hayes, the head of the development programme. The pair placed Ntini in a junior cricket festival in Queenstown and Hayes purchased Ntini his first pair of boots for the festival, but later had to give the young bowler instructions not to wear them indoor or when herding cattle. Two years later, he was selected to tour England with the South Africa Under-19 squad and played all five of the youth internationals. England dominated both One Day Internationals (ODIs) during the tour, with the South Africans only managing to take one wicket across the two matches, which fell to Pierre Joubert. In the Test series, which England won 2‚Äì0, Ntini claimed nine wickets, the second-most by a South African bowler. His bowling was expensive, coming at a rate of 4.53 runs per over: more than any other South African with the exception of Mark Boucher, who is best known as a wicket-keeper. Domestic career Ntini at Edgbaston, 31 July 2008. After two matches for Border against the touring Kenyans,Ntini made his First-class cricket debut in November 1995, facing an England XI. He claimed two wickets in England's only innings as Border were beaten comprehensively. In his debut season, Ntini claimed 17 wickets at an average of 37.05 in First- class competitions. His best performance in an innings came against Free State, when he claimed three wickets for 49 runs (3/49) during his 17 overs. He again toured with the national Under-19s in March and April 1996, touring India, where he played three youth Tests and one of the three ODIs. After claiming five wickets in the first Test and none in the second, Ntini displayed his talent in the third match, taking 6/53 in the first innings and 3/48 in the second innings. International career Ntini (second right) bowling at the WACA Ground in Perth on 16 December 2005, day one of the first Test, Australia v South Africa. He took 5 wickets for 64 runs on the day, having previously made his international debut at the same venue in 1998. Ntini returned to the South African side for a Sharjah tournament in 2000. His improvement was clear as he bowled with greater control. In 2003, he became the first South African to take 10 wickets at Lord's. Arguably his best performance, however, came when Ntini took 13 wickets for 132 runs against the West Indies in the Port of Spain on 12 April 2005. This remains the most wickets taken by a South African cricketer in a Test match. On 3 March 2006, Ntini also achieved the best bowling figures by a South African in an ODI, demolishing Australia with 6 wickets for 22 runs. A popular figure in South African sport, Ntini was voted their favourite sportsman in a research poll conducted by the South African Press Association.Ntini voted South Africa's favorite sportsperson  South Africa Cricket News  ESPN Cricinfo.

Ntini went on to establish himself as South Africa's premier fast bowler and one of the leading fast bowlers in the world. In February 2009, he was ranked as the world's fifth-best Test bowler behind Muttiah Muralitharan, Dale Steyn, Stuart Clark and Mitchell Johnson, but had dropped to being 25th-best ODI bowler, according to the ICC rankings.Lgiccrankings.Com. Retrieved on 2012-08-20. On 20 January 2007, Ntini dislodged Mohammad Sami to take his 300th Test wicket in his 74th Test. On 1 August 2008, he removed England opener Alastair Cook to claim his 350th Test wicket in his 90th Test. Ntini played his 100th Test on 17 December 2009, becoming the only black South African cricketer to reach that mark. Sponsors Castle Lager promised every fan in attendance a free beer in celebration on the day he took his first wicket and he duly obliged on the second day when he bowled Andrew Strauss of England. However, after already having lost his place in the ODI side, he was dropped from the Test side after poor performances against England. Ntini retired from all forms of international cricket in a T20I against India on 9 January 2011. To date, Ntini is one of only two players to have played more than 100 Test matches without scoring a 50.http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/stats/index.html?class=1;filter=advanced;orderby=high_score;qualmin1=100;qualval1=matches;size=200;template=results;type=batting Courtney Walsh is the other.

Retrieved on 2012-08-20. Ntini thanked Cricket South Africa for sticking by him. On 17 July 2020, while on SABC 2's Morning Live, Ntini detailed the alleged racism he experienced throughout his career. He claimed other players would not sit with him during meals and said he \\"was forever lonely\\" in the Proteas team. Ntini further stated that he used to run to the stadium and back to hotels to avoid being lonely on the team bus. Ntini's comments came shortly after fellow South African cricketer Lungi Ngidi called for the national team to show support towards the Black Lives Matter movement. Coaching career In January 2016, Ntini was appointed as the assistant coach of the Zimbabwean national cricket team with a two-year contract. Following the sacking of the previous coach Dav Whatmore, Ntini was appointed as interim head coach for the home series against India in 2016. He resigned from the role as coach in January 2018, although Ntini was reported to have claimed that he was asked to step down by the board on the basis of alleged complaints from the players over his coaching methods.

He is often acknowledged as the greatest West Indian fast bowler of all time, and certainly one of the most complete fast bowlers the cricketing world ever saw. His Test bowling average of 20.94 is the best of anyone who has taken 200 or more wickets.Records / Test matches / Bowling records / Best career bowling average Cricinfo. He achieved his bowling success despite being, by the standards of other fast bowlers of his time, a short man ‚Äì he stood at , while most of the great quicks have been well above and many great West Indian fast bowlers, such as Joel Garner, Curtly Ambrose and Courtney Walsh, were or above. He generated fearsome pace from his bowling action, with a dangerous bouncer. Marshall was also a very dangerous lower middle-order batsman with ten Test fifties and seven first-class centuries. In 2009, Marshall was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame. To mark 150 years of the Cricketers' Almanack, Wisden named him in an all-time Test World XI. Early years Marshall was born in Bridgetown, Barbados. His father, Denzil DeCoster Edghill, also an outstanding cricketer who played for Kingspark cricket club in St. Philip and the son of Claudine Edghill and Guirdwood Ifill, was a policeman; he died in a traffic accident when Marshall was one year old. His mother was Eleanor Welch. Malcolm had three half-brothers and three half- sisters. He grew up in the parish of Saint Michael, Barbados and was educated at St Giles Boys' School from 1963 to 1969 and then at Parkinson Comprehensive from 1969 to 1973.Pat Symes, ‚ÄòMarshall, Malcolm Denzil (1958‚Äì1999)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, Sept 2011 accessed 21 Dec 2011 He was partly taught cricket by his grandfather, who helped to bring him up after his father's death. He played cricket for the Banks Brewery team from 1976. His first representative match was a 40-over affair for West Indies Young Cricketers against their English equivalents at Pointe-√†-Pierre, Trinidad and Tobago in August 1976. He made nought and his eight overs disappeared for 53 runs. Marshall's initial senior appearance was a Geddes Grant/Harrison Line Trophy (List A) match for Barbados on 13 February 1978; again he got out without scoring and did not take a wicket. Four days later, he made his first-class debut against Jamaica, and whilst he failed to score runs, he claimed 6‚Äì77 in the Jamaican first innings. On the back of this single first-class appearance he was selected to tour India in 1978/79, many first-choice West Indian stars being unavailable having committed themselves to playing World Series Cricket. Marshall heard of his selection on the radio while working in the storeroom at Banks Brewery and later claimed he did not know where India was. International debut Marshall made his Test d√©but in the Second Test at Bangalore on 15 December 1978. He immediately developed a career-long antipathy to Dilip Vengsarkar due to his aggressive appealing. Despite doing little of note in the three Tests he played on that tour, he did take 37 wickets in all first-class games, and Hampshire saw enough in him to take him on as their overseas player for 1979, remaining with the county until 1993. He was in West Indies' World Cup squad, but did not play a match in the tournament. Hampshire were not doing well at the time, but nevertheless he took 47 first-class wickets, as well as picking up 5‚Äì13 against Glamorgan in the John Player League. Marshall came to prominence in 1980, when in the third Test at Old Trafford he accounted for Mike Gatting, Brian Rose and Peter Willey in short order to spark an England collapse, although the match was eventually drawn despite Marshall taking 7‚Äì24. After 1980/81 he was out of the Test side for two years, but an excellent 1982 season when he took 134 wickets at under 16 apiece, including a career-best 8‚Äì71 against Worcestershire, saw him recalled and thereafter he remained a fixture until the end of his international career. In seven successive Test series from 1982/83 to 1985/86 he took 21 or more wickets each time, in the last five of them averaging under 20. His most productive series in this period was the 1983/84 rubber against India, when he claimed 33 wickets as well as averaging 34 with the bat and making his highest Test score of 92 at Kanpur. A few months later he took five in an innings twice at home against Australia. At the peak of his career, he turned down an offer of US$1 million to join a rebel West Indies team on a tour to South Africa, still suffering international sporting isolation due to apartheid. At the peak Marshall relinquished his county duties during the 1984 tour of England. In a Test series that came to be known as the \\"Blackwash\\", the West Indians completed a 5‚Äì0 triumph, to date the only visiting team in England to have achieved such a feat. Marshall played a key role, taking the second-most wickets in the series with 24, behind only Joel Garner who took 29, and establishing his reputation as one of the finest bowlers in the world. In the series, he took five or more wickets in an innings three times, had the best bowling average - conceding only 18.20 runs per wicket, and the best strike rate - averaging one wicket every 42 deliveries.http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/records/bowling/most_wickets_career.html?id=260;type=series In the first test at Edgbaston, which the West Indies won by an innings and 180 runs, he ended the Test career of local Warwickshire opener Andy Lloyd after half an hour; he had already faced a few short deliveries from both Marshall and Garner but was then caught unawares by a delivery from Marshall that rose sharply and struck him flush on the temple behind his right eye. Lloyd soon had to retire hurt when he realized he was suffering blurred vision in his right eye and was hospitalized for several days. In the third Test at Headingley, Marshall ran through England's batting order in the second innings to finish with 7/53, despite having broken his thumb whilst fielding in the first innings. He also came out to bat at number 11 in West Indies' first innings despite his injury, allowing his team to gain a further psychological advantage as Larry Gomes completed an unbeaten century (Marshall batted one- handed that day, with one arm in plaster). In 1984/85 Marshall had another successful series at home against New Zealand, although there were calls for his bouncers to be ruled as intimidatory beyond what was acceptable, and that Marshall should have been admonished by the umpires. A rising delivery broke the nose of Mike Gatting, England's captain, in a one-day match in February 1986; Marshall later found bone fragments embedded in the leather of the ball. As well as the bouncer, however, Marshall succeeded in swinging the ball in both directions. He also used an in-swinging yorker as well as developing an effective leg-cutter, and with the exception of the 1986/87 New Zealanders, against whom he could only manage nine wickets at 32.11, no side seemed to have an answer to him. 1988 saw his career-best Test performance of 7‚Äì22 at Old Trafford, and he ended the series with 35 wickets in five Tests, at 12.65. Marshall was coming towards the end of his international career, moreover, and though he took 11 wickets in the match against India at Port of Spain the following winter, he played his last Test at The Oval in 1991. His final Test wicket ‚Äì his 376th ‚Äì was that of Graham Gooch. These efforts led him to retain the number 1 ranking in ICC Test Bowling Rankings for the year 1990 (which he attained in 1989). Later career Marshall's final appearances for West Indies came in One Day International cricket ‚Äì the 1992 World Cup. However, in his five matches in the tournament, he took just two wickets, both in the penultimate game against South Africa at Christchurch. This was the only time Marshall played for West Indies against South Africa in his career, though he played provincial cricket for Natal in both 1992/93 and 1993/94. Whilst playing at Natal, his experience was invaluable, and his guidance was an influential spark in the early career of Shaun Pollock. Today, Shaun Pollock attributes much of his success to his mentor, Marshall.Shaun Pollock enhanced his family name Mark Nicholas, The Daily Telegraph, 14 January 2008. He was in the Hampshire team that won the 1992 Benson & Hedges Cup. He played for Hampshire again in 1993, taking 28 wickets at a shade over 30 runs apiece, but that was to be the end of his time in county cricket, and in 1994 his only game in England was against the South Africans for the Scarborough President's XI during the Festival. He played five matches for Scotland in the 1995 Benson and Hedges Cup without much success, and his last senior games were for Natal in 1995/96. In his very last senior appearance, against Western Province in a limited-overs game at Cape Town, the first of his two victims was his former international teammate Desmond Haynes. He took over 1,000 wickets for Hampshire, and received more than ¬£60,000 (tax free) in his benefit year in 1987.  Illness and death  In 1996, Marshall became coach both of Hampshire and the West Indies, although the latter's steadily declining standards during this period brought a considerable amount of criticism his way. In 1999, during the World Cup it was revealed that Marshall had colon cancer. He immediately left his coaching job to begin treatment, but this was ultimately unsuccessful. He married his long-term partner, Connie Roberta Earle, in Romsey on 25 September 1999, and returned to his home town, where he died on 4 November aged 41, weighing little more than 25 kg.Symes 2008. \\"The worldwide outpouring of grief,\\" wrote journalist-friend Pat Symes, \\"was testimony to the genuine love and admiration he engendered.\\" At the funeral service at the Garfield Sobers Gymnasium in Wildey, Barbados, former West Indian fast bowler Rev. Wes Hall whispered the last rites in the belief that Marshall, having found God again in the last few weeks of his life, was off to Heaven. His coffin was carried at the service by five West Indian captains. He was buried at St Bartholomew's Church, Barbados. The Malcolm Marshall Memorial Trophy was inaugurated in his memory, to be awarded to the leading wicket-taker in each England v West Indies Test series. Another trophy with the same name was set up to be the prize in an annual game between Barbados and Trinidad and Tobago. Malcolm Marshall Memorial cricket games are also played in Handsworth Park, Birmingham, England.

He has played 101 Test matches and 185 One Day Internationals for South Africa between 1993 and 2004, mainly as an opening batsman. His half brother Peter, also played provincial cricket for Western Province, and then later for the South Africa cricket team which included the highlight of the Cricket World Cup in 1992. He was the coach of Indian Cricket Team from 2008‚Äì2011. He was appointed as the coach of the South African cricket team in June 2011 and he stepped down in August 2013. Playing career Kirsten made his Test debut against Australia in Melbourne in 1993. He retired from international cricket in 2004 after crafting a match-winning 76 in his final innings, against New Zealand. Against the same country he had made history by becoming the first-ever Protea to play in 100 Test matches. Over the years, he gained a reputation as being a sturdy batsman in both Test cricket and One Day cricket. He could up the tempo of an innings if he needed to, but more often than not he simply waited for the bad ball, much like Steve Waugh and Justin Langer. He was also a reliable fielder. Kirsten held the South African records for most runs and centuries in a Test career, before both were surpassed by Jacques Kallis. He was the first Test batsman to make hundreds against each of the other 9 Test nations. He scored 275 runs against England as a result of batting for over 14 and a half hours as South Africa followed on at Kingsmead in Durban, it still stands as the second-longest innings (in terms of duration) in Test history. The high score was later surpassed by Graeme Smith when he made 277 against England in 2003. He still holds the record for highest innings by a South African in a One Day International; 188 not-out made against the United Arab Emirates during the 1996 World Cup, which is the tenth highest innings of all time in One Day International cricket, and the third-highest score in World Cup cricket history. This record stood until it was surpassed by Chris Gayle who scored 215 against Zimbabwe in 2015. Later, that record was surpassed by Martin Guptill who scored 237* against the West Indies in the quarter finals of that very World Cup. Coaching career =India (2008‚Äì2011)= After retirement, Kirsten organised his own cricket academy. In November 2007, it emerged that Kirsten was a candidate for the vacant post of coach of the India team. The BCCI offered him a two-year contract for the post, and despite voicing reservations about concerns he had about having the full support of India players, he confirmed he would be taking the job on 4 December. He officially started as coach on 1 March 2008. However, he travelled to Australia with India beforehand during the test series. His first full series in charge was against his home country, South Africa in March‚ÄìApril 2008 which was drawn 1‚Äì1. Also, he coached India to the finals of the Kitply Cup and 2008 Asia Cup (India lost both the finals). During his tenure as Coach of India, Indian cricket team won a home series against Australia beating them 2‚Äì0. Apart from clinching the Border-Gavaskar trophy, he also coached India to its first bilateral series win in Sri Lanka against Sri Lanka and India's first Test and One-Day International series victories against New Zealand in New Zealand after 40 years. India also won the Compaq Cup, defeating Sri Lanka in the finals on 14 September 2009 by 46 runs. A highly accomplished batsman himself, he has brought in a considerable amount of improvement in the batting performances, which is largely associated with his ability to instill better confidence among younger players. Kirsten has been praised by all players for improving/enhancing their playing techniques, motivating them and discussing tactics that can be deployed on the field. The results could be clearly seen within months. He is considered the key force behind the clearly visible performance improvement in all players. In 2010, Prior to the start of India's tour of South Africa, Indian captain M.S. Dhoni described him as \\"The best thing to happen to Indian cricket.\\" In 2017, Kirsten spoke to HBR about the qualities of a great coach, coaching a young team, and learning from one's mistakes. Some edited excerpts of his interview are at Harvard Business Review Ascend.  World Cup 2011  After the tour of South Africa, which India drew 1‚Äì1 in the Test series lost 3‚Äì2 in ODIs, Kirsten announced he would not renew his contract with BCCI because of family commitments.

Immediately after the announcement Kirsten was linked with joining South Africa as their coach as the South Africa coach Corrie van Zyl also announced his contract would end after the World Cup as well. Kirsten ended his tenure as coach after India won the 2011 Cricket World Cup defeating Sri Lanka by 6 wickets and 10 balls to spare on 2 April 2011 at Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai, India.http://www.espncricinfo.com/icc_cricket_worldcup2011/engine/match/433606.html During the celebration, he was carried around the ground by Suresh Raina, Yusuf Pathan and Virat Kohli to show their respect. Kirsten cleared the air of any rumours about a renewal in contract by adopting a modest approach on his further availability as coach to the Indian team by stating that he wanted to say goodbye to India to spend time with his family. =South Africa (2011‚Äì2013)= On 5 June 2011, Kirsten was appointed the full-time coach of the South Africa national cricket team for a term period of two years. His first decision was to name AB De Villiers as the new captain for the limited overs game, replacing Graeme Smith who remains as the Test side captain. Kirsten began his term as coach on 1 August and his first assignment was a home series against Australia. He took over from Corrie van Zyl, who was an interim coach for 14 months after Mickey Arthur resigned following the home series against England in 2009‚Äì10. Under Kirsten, in August 2012, the South African team reached number 1 in the ICC Test rankings, by defeating England 2‚Äì0. He did not renew his contract with Cricket South Africa (CSA) and stepped down as the coach of the national team in August 2013 citing family commitments. He has been signed as the head coach of the Bangalore-based IPL team Royal Challengers Bangalore for a three-year contract beginning from the IPL's Eleventh edition.

Early days Mashud played for the Bangladesh U-19 side in 1993. Apart from his keeping duties. he also took the important responsibility of batting at No. 3. Within couple of years, he graduated to the national team and played against the touring England 'A' team in February 1995. His ODI debut came later in the year at Sharjah. In Test cricket He made an impressive Test debut with the bat, scoring 32 and 21* in the historic match against India in November 2000. Cricinfo Scorecard: Bangladesh Vs India Nov. 2000 (Retrieved on 2010-07-09) But his most memorable moment in Test cricket came in the West Indies in May 2004. Despite taking a first innings lead of 64, Bangladesh ran into trouble, losing their first seven wickets for just 123 runs. Mashud then led a late order recovery to take the score to 271/9 (decl.). The declaration came just after Mashud completed his hundred (103*). He was given excellent support by Rafiq (29) and Tapash (26). Cricinfo Scorecard: Bangladesh Vs. WI 1st test May 2004 (Retrieved on 2010-07-12) Behind the stumps, his 87 victims from 44 matches does not sound very impressive, but he was playing for a side which possessed very little venom in their bowling department. In ODI cricket Mashud had little chance to show his mettle as a one-day batsman, as he almost inevitably came to bat with his team struggling. Still, he managed to get a top score of 71*, against the Australians in 2005. Cricinfo Scorecard: Natwest Series 9th match June 2005 (Retrieved on 2010-07-12) With the Bangladesh spinners being more effective in limited-over games, Mashud had more chance to show his class. His 91 catches and 35 stumpings in ODI testify to that. In ICC Trophy Mashud was a vital member of the triumphant Bangladesh team in the 1997 ICC trophy. There, he topped the batting averages for his country, scoring 92 runs and getting out only once. He was MoM in the SF against Scotland after scoring 70 and sharing a 115 run partnership with Aminul Islam. In the final, he scored a quickfire 15* from just 7 deliveries to take Bangladesh home to a last ball victory. His innings included two massive hits for six. He also enjoyed a highly successful time behind the stumps with 12 catches and 11 stumpings. Banglacricket 1997 ICC Trophy (Retrieved on 2010-07-13) The end His place in the side came under threat, however, with the emergence of Mushfiqur Rahim, combined with his own failure to score a half century in 24 Test innings.

He announced his retirement from international cricket in 2008 but continues to play domestic cricket in Bangladesh as captain of the Rajshahi Division team. Mashud announced his retirement from domestic cricket after captaining his team to win the title in 2011. THE END. Controversies Mashud had a brief stint as captain of Bangladesh. But, he lost his captaincy in acrimonious circumstances following the 2003 World Cup in Africa. Bangladesh suffered defeats at the hands of Canada and Kenya amidst allegations of match fixing. Although the allegations were not proved Mashud was stripped of his captaincy duty. In February 2006, he was fined after being found guilty of bringing the game into disrepute during a match against Sri Lanka.

The definitive characteristics of St. Louis-style pizza are a very thin cracker-like crust made without yeast, the common (but not universal) use of Provel processed cheese, and pizzas cut into squares or rectangles instead of wedges. The pizza may be found at local chains, such as most notably Imo's Pizza, and as standalone offerings at many local restaurants; frozen St. Louis-style pizza is also available at the local supermarkets such as Schnuck's. Characteristics and preparation =Crust= The crust is made without yeast, as opposed to a deep dish Chicago-style pizza or the thin but leavened New York-style pizza, yielding a somewhat crisp and cracker-like crust that cannot be easily folded. Instead of the larger pie-like wedges typical of many pizza styles, St. Louis pizza is typically cut into three- or four-inch squares, a style referred to as party or tavern cut.Foods of Saint Louis MO Correspondingly, some local restaurants make their pizzas rectangular rather than round. The reason remains unknown. Some say Ed Imo‚Äîfounder of a prominent chain of St. Louis pizzerias‚Äîwas a tile layer and cut his pizza accordinglyBastianich. (2011). Lidia's Italy in America, New York: Alfred Knopf. . Page 272.; others say it is a practical measure that seeks to keep the thin crust from cracking under the weight of the toppings. File:St. Louis-style pizza (2).jpgA St. Louis-style pizza being sliced into squares =Cheese= St. Louis-style pizza often includes a white processed cheese known as Provel. Provel is a trademark for a combination of three cheeses (provolone, Swiss, and white cheddar) used instead of (or, rarely, in addition to) the mozzarella or provolone common to other styles of pizza. Provel cheese was developed by the St. Louis firm Costa Grocery in the 1950s and is made in Wisconsin primarily for the St. Louis market. The cheese is not widely available outside the St. Louis area. Image:Provel.jpgProvel pasteurized processed cheese for pizza in a 5-pound block =Sauce= The sauce is often seasoned with more oregano than other pizza types. Despite its thin crust, St. Louis-style pizza can be layered deeply with many different toppings because of the sturdiness of the cracker-like crust. Some of the sauces have a sweetness to them, which is likely due to the influence of Sicilian immigrants upon Italian foods in St. Louis.

The grove is a tract containing over 100 mature Giant Sequoia (Sequoiadendron giganteum) trees. It also contains a number of sequoia stumps, remaining from when the grove's ancient trees were logged in the late 1870s to 1890s, before being protected by its United States Forest Service acquisition in 1928.

Variety, 3 March 1965, p. 69. He appeared with his comedy partner Oliver Hardy in 107 short films, feature films, and cameo roles. Laurel began his career in music hall, where he developed a number of his standard comic devices, including the bowler hat, the deep comic gravity, and the nonsensical understatement. His performances polished his skills at pantomime and music hall sketches. He was a member of \\"Fred Karno's Army\\", where he was Charlie Chaplin's understudy.McCabe 2005, p. 143. Robson, 2005 Retrieved: 18 June 2012. He and Chaplin arrived in the United States on the same ship from the United Kingdom with the Karno troupe. Laurel began his film career in 1917 and made his final appearance in 1951. He appeared with his comic partner Oliver Hardy in the film short The Lucky Dog in 1921, although they did not become an official team until late 1927. He then appeared exclusively with Hardy until retiring following his comedy partner's death in 1957. In 1960, Laurel was given an Academy Honorary Award for his pioneering work in comedy, and he has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 7021 Hollywood Blvd. Laurel and Hardy ranked top among best double acts and seventh overall in a 2005 UK poll to find the Comedians' Comedian. In 2019, Laurel topped a list of the greatest British comedians compiled by a panel on the television channel Gold. In 2009, a bronze statue of the duo was unveiled in Laurel's home town of Ulverston. Early life Plaque at Laurel's birthplace in Ulverston Arthur Stanley Jefferson was born in his grandparents' house on 16 June 1890 in Argyle Street, Ulverston, Lancashire, to Arthur Jefferson, a theatre manager from Bishop Auckland, and Margaret (n√©e Metcalfe), an actress from Ulverston. He was one of five children.Midwinter, Eric. \\"Laurel, Stan\\". Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, 2006. Retrieved: 20 March 2010. His parents were both active in the theatre and always very busy. In his early years, Laurel spent much time living with his maternal grandmother, Sarah Metcalfe. He attended school at King James I Grammar School in Bishop Auckland, County Durham, and the King's School in Tynemouth, Northumberland. Stan Laurel plaque, Britannia Music Hall, Glasgow He moved with his parents to Glasgow, Scotland, where he completed his education at Rutherglen Academy. His father managed Glasgow's Metropole Theatre, where Laurel began work. His boyhood hero was Dan Leno, one of the greatest English music hall comedians. With a natural affinity for the theatre, Laurel gave his first professional performance on stage at the Panopticon in Glasgow at the age of sixteen, where he polished his skills at pantomime and music hall sketches.Bowers 2007, pp. 143‚Äì147. It was the music hall from where he drew his standard comic devices, including his bowler hat and nonsensical understatement. In 1912 Laurel worked together with Ted Desmond on tour in Netherlands and Belgium as a comedy double act known as the Barto Bros. Their act, which involved them dressing as Romans, finished when Laurel was offered a spot in an American touring troupe. After Laurel left England for America the pair maintained a life-long friendship, sending letters and photos that documented Laurel's rise from an unknown British comedy actor in 1913 to one of the biggest names in Hollywood in the 1950s. The correspondence, spanning around 50 years and including photos of them being reunited in the US, was put up for auction by Mr Desmond's grandson Geoffrey Nolan in 2018. He joined Fred Karno's troupe of actors in 1910 with the stage name of \\"Stan Jefferson\\"; the troupe also included a young Charlie Chaplin. The music hall nurtured him, and he acted as Chaplin's understudy for some time. Karno was a pioneer of slapstick, and in his biography Laurel stated, \\"Fred Karno didn't teach Charlie [Chaplin] and me all we know about comedy. He just taught us most of it\\". Chaplin and Laurel arrived in the United States on the same ship from Britain with the Karno troupe and toured the country. During the First World War, Laurel registered for military service in America on 5 June 1917, as required under the Selective Service Act. He was not called up; his registration card states his status as resident alien and his deafness as exemptions. Laurel and Hardy appeared for the first time together in The Lucky Dog (1921), long before they became a team. Stan's brother (Edward Jefferson) also appeared in this short as the butler. The Karno troupe broke up in the spring of 1914. Stan joined with two other former Karno performers, Edgar Hurley and his wife Ethel (known as \\"Wren\\") to form \\"The Three Comiques\\". On the advice of booking agent Gordon Bostock, they call themselves \\"the Keystone Trio\\". Stan started to do his character as an imitation of Charlie Chaplin and the Hurleys began to do their parts as silent comedians Chester Conklin and Mabel Normand. They played successfully from February through October 1915, until the Hurleys and Stan parted ways. Between 1916 and 1918, he teamed up with Alice Cooke and Baldwin Cooke, who became his lifelong friends, to form the Stan Jefferson Trio. One year after launching his film career, Laurel was the co-star of Frauds and Frenzies with Larry Semon in 1918. Amongst other performers, Laurel worked briefly alongside Oliver Hardy in the silent film short The Lucky Dog (1921), before the two were a team. It was around this time that Laurel met Mae Dahlberg. Around the same time, he adopted the stage name of Laurel at Dahlberg's suggestion that his stage name Stan Jefferson was unlucky, due to it having thirteen letters. The pair were performing together when Laurel was offered $75 a week to star in two-reel comedies. After making his first film Nuts in May, Universal offered him a contract. The contract was soon cancelled during a reorganisation at the studio. Among the films in which Dahlberg and Laurel appeared together was the 1922 parody Mud and Sand. By 1924, Laurel had given up the stage for full-time film work, under contract with Joe Rock for 12 two- reel comedies. The contract had one unusual stipulation: that Dahlberg was not to appear in any of the films. Rock thought that her temperament was hindering Laurel's career. In 1925, she started interfering with Laurel's work, so Rock offered her a cash settlement and a one-way ticket back to her native Australia, which she accepted.Bergan 1992, p. 33. The 12 two-reel comedies were Mandarin Mix-Up (1924), Detained (1924), Monsieur Don't Care (1924), West of Hot Dog (1924), Somewhere in Wrong (1925), Twins (1925), Pie-Eyed (1925), The Snow Hawk (1925), Navy Blue Days (1925), The Sleuth (1925), Dr. Pyckle and Mr. Pryde (1925) and Half a Man (1925). Laurel and Hardy Laurel next signed with the Hal Roach studio, where he began directing films, including a 1926 production called Yes, Yes, Nanette (in which Oliver Hardy had a part under the name \\"Babe\\" Hardy). It had been his intention to work primarily as a writer and director. The same year, Hardy, a member of the Hal Roach Studios Comedy All Star players, was injured in a kitchen mishap and hospitalised. Because he was unable to work on the scheduled film, Get 'Em Young, Laurel was asked to return to acting to fill in. Starting early in 1927, Laurel and Hardy began sharing the screen in several short films, including Duck Soup, Slipping Wives and With Love and Hisses. The two became friends and their comic chemistry soon became obvious. Roach Studios' supervising director Leo McCarey noticed the audience reaction to them and began teaming them, leading to the creation of the Laurel and Hardy series later that year. Together, the two men began producing a huge body of short films, including The Battle of the Century, Should Married Men Go Home?, Two Tars, Be Big!, Big Business, and many others. Laurel and Hardy successfully made the transition to talking films with the short Unaccustomed As We Are in 1929. They also appeared in their first feature in one of the revue sequences of The Hollywood Revue of 1929, and the following year they appeared as the comic relief in the lavish all-colour (in Technicolor) musical feature The Rogue Song. Their first starring feature Pardon Us was released in 1931. They continued to make both features and shorts until 1935, including their 1932 three-reeler The Music Box, which won an Academy Award for Best Short Subject. =Trouble at Roach Studio= During the 1930s, Laurel was involved in a dispute with Hal Roach which resulted in the termination of his contract. Roach maintained separate contracts for Laurel and Hardy that expired at different times, so Hardy remained at the studio and was \\"teamed\\" with Harry Langdon for the 1939 film Zenobia. The studio discussed a series of films co-starring Hardy with Patsy Kelly to be called \\"The Hardy Family.\\" But Laurel sued Roach over the contract dispute. Eventually, the case was dropped and Laurel returned to Roach. The first film that Laurel and Hardy made after Laurel returned was A Chump at Oxford. Subsequently, they made Saps at Sea, which was their last film for Roach. =Second World War= Stan Laurel in a still from The Tree in a Test Tube (1943), a colour short made for the US Department of Agriculture In 1941, Laurel and Hardy signed a contract at 20th Century-Fox to make ten films over five years. Laurel found, to his shock, that he and Hardy were hired only as actors, and were not expected to contribute to the staging, writing, or editing of the productions. When the films proved very successful, Laurel and Hardy were granted more freedom and gradually added more of their own material. They had made six Fox features when the studio suddenly abandoned B-picture production in December 1944. The team had signed another contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in 1942, resulting in two more features.MacGillivray, Scott. Laurel & Hardy: From the Forties Forward. Second edition: New York: iUniverse, 2009 ; first edition: Lanham, Maryland: Vestal Press, 1998. Revisiting his music hall days, Laurel returned to England in 1947 when he and Hardy went on a six-week tour of the United Kingdom performing in variety shows. Mobbed wherever they went, Laurel's homecoming to Ulverston took place in May, and the duo were greeted by thousands of fans outside the Coronation Hall. The Evening Mail noted: \\"Oliver Hardy remarked to our reporter that Stan had talked about Ulverston for the past 22 years and he thought he had to see it.\\"\\"Stan at Queen's first Royal Variety Show\\" . North West Evening Mail. The tour included a Royal Variety Performance in front of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth in London. The success of the tour led them to spend the next seven years touring the UK and Europe. Around this time, Laurel found out that he had diabetes, so he encouraged Hardy to find solo projects, which he did, taking parts in John Wayne and Bing Crosby films. In 1950, Laurel and Hardy were invited to France to make a feature film. The film was a disaster, a Franco-Italian co-production titled Atoll K. (The film was entitled Utopia in the US and Robinson Crusoeland in the UK.) Both stars were noticeably ill during the filming. Upon returning to the United States, they spent most of their time recovering. In 1952, Laurel and Hardy toured Europe successfully, and they returned in 1953 for another tour of the continent. During this tour, Laurel fell ill and was unable to perform for several weeks.Bergen 1992, p. 118. In May 1954, Hardy had a heart attack and cancelled the tour. In 1955, they were planning to do a television series called Laurel and Hardy's Fabulous Fables based on children's stories. The plans were delayed after Laurel suffered a stroke on 25 April 1955, from which he recovered. But as the team was planning to get back to work, Hardy had another stroke on 14 September 1956, and was unable to return to acting. =Hardy's death= Oliver Hardy died on 7 August 1957.

Laurel was gracious to fans and spent much time answering fan mail. His phone number was also listed in the telephone directory and he would take calls from fans. Jerry Lewis was among the comedians to visit Laurel, and Lewis received suggestions from him for the production of The Bellboy (1960). Lewis paid tribute to Laurel by naming his main character Stanley in the film, and having Bill Richmond play a version of Laurel as well.Brody, Richard. \\"Front Row: Jerry Lewis, Writer\\" , New Yorker, 5 May 2011.

Van Dyke played Laurel on \\"The Sam Pomerantz Scandals\\" episode of The Dick Van Dyke Show. Laurel was offered a cameo role in It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World (1963), but turned it down. He did not want to be on screen in his old age, especially without Hardy. The cameo appearance was then given to Jack Benny. Personal life Wide Open Spaces in 1924. Laurel and Mae Dahlberg never married but lived together as common-law husband and wife from 1919 to 1925, before Dahlberg accepted a one-way ticket from Joe Rock to go back to her native Australia.Simon Louvish, Stan and Ollie, The Roots of Comedy, Faber & Faber 2001 In November 1937, Dahlberg was back in the US and sued Laurel for financial support. At the time, Laurel's second marriage was in the process of a divorce, with Dahlberg's legal suit adding to Laurel's woes.

They are the primary food source for reindeer/caribou. Cladonia species are of economic importance to reindeer-herders, such as the Sami in Scandinavia or the Nenets in Russia. Antibiotic compounds are extracted from some species to create antibiotic cream. The light green species Cladonia stellaris is used in flower decorations. Although the phylogeny of the genus Cladonia is still under investigation, two main morphological groups are commonly differentiated by taxonomists: the Cladonia morpho-type and the Cladina morpho-type. The Cladonia morpho-type has many more species, and is generally described as a group of squamulose (grow from squamules), cup-bearing lichens. The Cladina morpho-types are often referred to as forage lichens, mat-forming lichens, or reindeer lichens (due to their importance as caribou winter forage). Cladonia perforata (\\"perforate cladonia\\") is one of two on the U.S. Endangered Species List, and it should never be collected. It exists only in a few small populations in Florida. Several Cladonia species grow on sand dunes. The presence, and luxuriant carpet-like growth, of Cladonia species is one of the defining characters of grey dune, a priority habitat for conservation under the E.U. Habitats Directive. Cladonia species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Chionodes continuella. Selected species Selected species of Cladonia include:Walewski.

In September 2016, she owned over in Walmart shares. As of September 2020, Walton has a net worth of $68.8 billion, making her the 12th- richest person and the richest woman in the world. Early life and education Walton was born in Newport, Arkansas. She was raised along with her 3 brothers in Bentonville, Arkansas and graduated from Bentonville HS in 1966. She graduated from Trinity University in San Antonio, Texas, with a B.A. in economics. Career In her early career, Walton was an equity analyst and money manager for First Commerce Corporation and headed investment activities at Arvest Bank Group. She was also a broker for EF Hutton. In 1988, Walton founded Llama Company, an investment bank, where she was president, chairwoman and CEO. Walton was the first person to chair the Northwest Arkansas Council and played a major role in the development of the Northwest Arkansas Regional Airport, which opened in 1998. At the time, the business and civic leaders of Northwest Arkansas Council found a need for the $109 million regional airport in their corner of the state. Walton provided $15 million in initial funding for construction. Her company, Llama Company, underwrote a $79.5 million bond. The Northwest Arkansas Regional Airport Authority recognized Walton's contributions to the creation of the airport and named the terminal the Alice L. Walton Terminal Building. She was inducted into the Arkansas Aviation Hall of Fame in 2001. In the late 1990s, Llama Co. closed and, in 1998, Walton moved to a ranch in Millsap, Texas, named Walton's Rocking W Ranch. An avid horse-lover, she was known for having an eye for determining which 2-month- olds would grow to be champion cutters. Walton listed the farm for sale in 2015 and moved to Fort Worth, Texas, citing the need to focus on the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art, the Bentonville, Arkansas, art museum she founded that opened in 2011. In his 1992 autobiography Made in America, Sam Walton remarked that Alice was \\"the most like me‚Äîa maverick‚Äîbut even more volatile than I am.\\" Art Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art, Bentonville, Arkansas Walton and her mother would often paint watercolors on camping trips. Her interest in art led to the Walton Family Foundation developing the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Bentonville, Arkansas. In December 2004, Walton purchased art sold from the collection of Daniel Fraad and Rita Fraad at Sotheby's, in New York. In 2005, Walton purchased Asher Brown Durand's celebrated painting, Kindred Spirits, in a sealed-bid auction for a purported US$35 million. The 1849 painting, a tribute to Hudson River School painter Thomas Cole, had been given to the New York Public Library in 1904 by Julia Bryant, the daughter of Romantic poet and New York newspaper publisher William Cullen Bryant, who is depicted in the painting with Cole. She has also purchased works by American painters Winslow Homer and Edward Hopper, as well as a notable portrait of George Washington by Charles Willson Peale, in preparation for the opening of Crystal Bridges.Crystal Bridges website In 2009, Walton acquired Norman Rockwell's \\"Rosie the Riveter\\" for $4.9 million. Walton's attempt to quit smoking inspired her to purchase a painting reminiscent of an earlier painting by John Singer Sargent by Alfred Maurer which depicts a full-length woman smoking. Another painting, by Tom Wesselmann, is titled \\"Smoker #9\\" and depicts a hyper realistic, disembodied hand and mouth smoking a cigarette. In a 2011 interview, she spoke about acquiring great works by other artists. She described Marsden Hartley as \\"one of my favorite artists-he was a very complex guy, somewhat tormented, but a very spiritual person, and love the emotion and the feel and the spirituality of his work\\". She went on to say \\"and Andrew Wyeth-the mystery and loneliness that is expressed. How do you paint loneliness?\\" Political contributions Alice Walton was the 20th-largest individual contributor to 527 committees in the U.S. presidential election 2004, donating US$2.6 million to the conservative Progress for America group. As of January 2012, Walton had contributed $200,000 to Restore Our Future, the super PAC associated with Mitt Romney's presidential campaign. Despite hailing from a largely Republican family, Alice donated $353,400 to the Hillary Victory Fund, a joint fundraising committee supporting Clinton and other Democrats, in 2016. Personal life Walton married a prominent Louisiana investment banker in 1974 at age 24, but they were divorced 2¬Ω years later. According to Forbes, she married \\"the contractor who built her swimming pool\\" soon after, \\"but they, too, divorced quickly\\". Walton has been involved in multiple automobile accidents, one of them fatal. She lost control of a rented Jeep during a 1983 Thanksgiving family reunion near Acapulco and plunged into a ravine, shattering her leg. She was airlifted out of Mexico and underwent more than two dozen surgeries; she suffers lingering pain from her injuries. In April 1989, she struck and killed 50 year-old Oleta Hardin, who had stepped onto a road in Fayetteville, Arkansas. Witnesses stated that Walton was speeding at the time, but no charges were filed. In 1998, she hit a gas meter while driving under the influence of alcohol. She paid a $925 fine.

He divorced his wife in 1895 and became a vocal critic of the Republic, the Dreyfusard camp, and of democracy in general.Beum, Robert (1997). \\"Ultra-Royalism Revisited: An Annotated Bibliography,\\" Modern Age, Vol. 39, No. 3, p. 304. Together with Charles Maurras (who remained a lifelong friend), he co-founded (1907) and was an editor of the nationalist, integralist periodical Action Fran√ßaise. A deputy from 1919 to 1924, he failed to win election as a senator in 1927 ‚Äì despite having gained prominence as the voice of the monarchists.

Scandals and later life When his son Philippe committed suicide in 1923, Daudet accused the republican authorities of complicity with anarchist activists in what he believed to be a murder, and lost a lawsuit for defamation brought against him by the driver of the taxi in which Philippe's body was found. Condemned to five months in prison, Daudet fled and was exiled in Belgium, receiving a pardon in 1930. In 1934, during the Stavisky Affair, he was to denounce Prime Minister Camille Chautemps, calling him the \\"leader of a gang of robbers and assassins\\". He also showed particular detestation for the subsequent Prime Minister L√©on Blum, candidate of a coalition of socialists and other parties of the left. A supporter of the Vichy administration headed by Marshal P√©tain, L√©on Daudet died in Saint-R√©my-de-Provence.

G. Collingwood. H√°rbar√∞slj√≥√∞The name can be anglicized as H√°rbardslj√≥d, H√°rbarthslj√≥th, H√°rbardhslj√≥dh, Harbardsljod and variations on this. (Old Norse: 'The Lay of H√°rbar√∞r') is one of the poems of the Poetic Edda, found in the Codex Regius and AM 748 I 4to manuscripts. It is a flyting poem with figures from Norse Paganism. Synopsis \\"Thor threatens Greybeard\\" (1908) by W. G. Collingwood. In this poem, the ferryman Harbard and the god Thor compete in a flyting or verbal contest with one other. The ferryman H√°rbar√∞r (Greybeard) is rude and obnoxious towards Thor who is returning to Asgard after a journey in J√∂tunheimr, the land of the giants. H√°rbar√∞r obstructs his way and refuses him passage across a swollen river. He begins by saying that Thor dresses poorly (in a beggars clothes, without pants) and that his mother is dead. In the course of the poem, Harbard boasts of his sexual prowess, his magical and tactical abilities, asking Thor about his. Thor responds, telling how he defeated Giants. Ultimately, after mocking him at length, Harbard curses Thor and tells him to walk around. Structure The poem is significantly less structured than most Eddic poems, and is predominantly written in a metric form known as m√°lah√°ttr or \\"conversational style.\\" However, other metrical forms are also to be discerned, while some of the text is pure prose. In the last decade, several scholars have concluded that the poem is an intentionally stylized version of the traditional flyting structure. Theories Some early commentators, such as F. W. Bergmann and Viktor Rydberg argued that H√°rbar√∞ was in fact Loki. Although the name H√°rbar√∞ means \\"Grey beard,\\" in the opening exchange of insults Thor addresses the ferryman as one would speak to a youthful servant. Some believe that H√°rbar√∞r's confessed exploits also are allegedly more akin to those of Loki than Odin. However, H√°rbar√∞r repeatedly boasts of his conquests of giantesses, as does Odin in Havamal. Loki in Lokasenna and H√°rbar√∞ in H√°rbar√∞slj√≥√∞ both accuse Thor's wife Sif of adultery, a charge that is never denied and may have been commonly known. They also speak identical half-lines, accusing Thor of being unmanly. Despite these arguments, this theory was rejected by later scholars such as Finnur J√≥nsson, Fredrick Sander, and Felix Niedner, in favor of identifying H√°rbar√∞ with Odin, based, among other things, on Odin's statement in Grimnism√°l 47 that H√°rbar√∞ is one of his by-names.Klaus von See, et al., editors, Kommentar zu den Liedern der Edda, , 2:155; Carol Clover, \\"H√°rbardslj√≥√∞ as Generic Farce\\", in The Poetic Edda, Essays on Old Norse Mythology.

This ground-breaking novel was one of the first pieces of LGBTQ children's literature to garner broad attention. While the book is often noted as the first lesbian picture book, Jane Severance's book, When Megan Went Away, also has lesbian characters and debuted ten years before Newman's.  Background  The idea for Heather Has Two Mommies was not Newman's own.\\"The More Things Change ... Heather has Two Mommies Turns 20.\\" 2009: 58. Biography In Context; Gale. Web. <http://link.galegroup.com/apps/doc/A210441012/BIC?u=wash43584&sid;=BIC&xid;=cc667152>. While out for a walk, Newman was approached by lesbian parents and asked to write a children's story about a family like theirs. The parents explained that there were no books that they could show their daughter that portrayed the life of a family with lesbian parents. Newman wrote the story for this purpose, but did not expect the book to gain widespread controversy.  Summary  The story is about a child, Heather, raised by lesbian women: her biological mother, Jane, who gave birth to her after artificial insemination, and her biological mother's same-sex partner, Kate. At Heather's playgroup, her family situation is discussed simply and positively, as are those of other children in other family units.Annotated Bibliography of Children's Books With Gay and Lesbian Characters Resources for Early Childhood Educators and Parents At first, Heather becomes upset when she realizes that many of her other peers at the playgroup have a daddy and she does not. Molly, the caretaker at the play group, ensures that all the children at the play group understand that all families are special and no family type is better than any of the others.  Reception  The American Library Association ranked it the 9th most frequently challenged book in the United States in the 1990s; a similar phenomenon can be seen in the Sugartime! episode of the American television series Postcards from Buster. In the 1980s, comparable political controversy erupted in the United Kingdom over the book Jenny Lives with Eric and Martin. Comedian Bill Hicks famously included the book in one of his stand-up routines. The book and the controversy over it were parodied in the 2006 Dav Pilkey book Captain Underpants and the Preposterous Plight of the Purple Potty People. In it, the parallel-universe Miss Singerbrains (the school librarian) invites the two main characters, George and Harold, to read the book Mommy Has Two Heathers. Doris Robinson, the regional services manager at Fairview Park Regional Library in Cleveland, claims that books such as Heather Has Two Mommies should have a place in schools and libraries around the country, \\"as long as they tastefully, accurately and appropriately portray the subject matter.\\"BERNSTEIN, MARGARET. \\"Children's Books on Gay Lifestyles are Causing some People to Squirm.\\" THE SEATTLE TIMES, 1991, NewsBank. Web. Furthermore, Robinson recognizes that keeping LGBTQ subject matter from children would do them a disservice as homosexual couples become a recognized part of society. Robinson asserts that because homosexual families deserve respect, exposing children to Heather Has Two Mommies will teach them to be more accepting of these families. John Leo, the editor in chief of Minding the Campus, believes that while accepting homosexuals in today's society is important, books like Heather Has Two Mommies have a different purpose, to \\"celebrate the wonders of double-mommy and double-daddy households.\\"Leo John. \\"Heather Has a Message.\\" US News & World Report. August 17, 1992. Web. Leo insists that there is a difference between celebrating and respecting various types of familial structures and that schools should not take part in promoting certain familial structures over others. Leo is concerned that various religious conflicts could occur when children are celebrating gay family structures at school. In Fayetteville, North Carolina, people tried to have Heather Has Two Mommies banned from local libraries and schools.Newman, Leslea. \\"\\"Heather\\" and Her Critics.\\" 1997: 149+. Literature Resource Center; Gale. Web. <http://link.galegroup.com/apps/doc/A19225959/LitRC?u=wash43584&sid;=LitRC&xid;=325dc1d1>. They were unsuccessful in their attempts, so instead they paid for advertisements in local newspapers to convince citizens to vote against the construction of 5 new libraries in the Fayetteville area. The advertisements conveyed that the libraries were in \\"pursuit of legitimizing homosexuality\\" and compared homosexuality to \\"prostitution, bestiality or incest....\\"  Analysis  According to Jennifer Esposito, a professor at Georgia State University, Leslea Newman attempts to normalize lesbian family structure in Heather Has Two Mommies but unintentionally does just the opposite. When Heather acknowledges that she does not have a daddy it makes her sad. Esposito argues that because Heather gets upset that she does not have a father instead of wondering why she has two mothers, it portrays that there is a problem with having two mommies. Furthermore, Esposito believes that Heather Has Two Mommies \\"dequeers\\" lesbian households by making them equivalent to heterosexual households. She believes that this does a disservice to those children that live in those households because their experience in the real world is a lot different than what is portrayed in the story. Esposito thinks that books dealing with lesbian families should take the approach of informing people that these households are just as normal as other households while at the same time addressing the unique problems they face.

Almaden Lake Park. It is named after the New Almaden Quicksilver Mines, which were named after the mercury mine in (old) Almad√©n, Spain, and produced mercury that was used to process ore during the Gold Rush.AVCA About Almaden Valley Like its Spanish namesake, California's Almaden had a number of quicksilver mines. The mercury was used during gold extraction in the California Gold Rush, but the mines were closed in 1975 and have been converted into Almaden Quicksilver County Park. Despite the closure of the mines, there still remains a high mercury content in the nearby soil, creeks and rivers, and signs are posted alongside them warning people not to eat the fish. Many of the names in Almaden retain their mercury mine themes. For example, there are streets called Silver Lode Lane and Silver Mine Drive (the latter of which was renamed). Also, many places in Almaden still use the name Quicksilver. In December 1959, the Regents of the University of California selected Almaden Valley to be the site of the next campus of the University of California system. Unfortunately, news of this decision caused property values in the area to increase so rapidly that the Regents could no longer afford to buy the needed land. After another year of study, the Regents selected another site much farther south, which opened in 1965 as the University of California, Santa Cruz. Geography The neighborhood is south east of the town of Los Gatos, west of the Santa Teresa neighborhood of San Jose and south of Blossom Hill Rd. The informal borders are generally Coleman Rd. at the northern end, McKean Rd. at the southern end, where the valley becomes mostly rural, and the town of Los Gatos to the west. The valley is located between the Santa Teresa Hills and the Santa Cruz Mountains, with Mount Umunhum to the west dominating the local geography.

It is among the nation's key public institutions and carries out economic functions as prescribed by law. It was established in 1922. The principal objective of the Bank of Latvia is to regulate currency in circulation by implementing monetary policy to maintain price stability in Latvia. Until 31 December 2013, the bank was responsible for issuing the former Latvian currency, the lats. The Bank of Latvia administration is located in Riga. The fiscal year for the bank begins on 1 January and ends on 31 December. History On 7 September 1922, the Constitutional Assembly adopted the Law on the Establishment of the Bank of Latvia. The Bank of Latvia was granted emission rights. The Bank's interim statutes were approved on 19 September 1922, with the decision of the Cabinet of Ministers, and its initial capital was 10 million lats. On 24 April 1923, Saeima approved the Statute of the Bank of Latvia, signed by President JƒÅnis ƒåakste on 2 July. The bank was headed by a council and board. The Council consisted of a chairman, a deputy, and 11 members, but the board included a director general, his deputy, and three directors. On 17 June 1940, Latvia was occupied and was incorporated into the USSR on 5 August. On 25 July, the Law on the Nationalization of Banks and Large Industrial Enterprises was adopted. After the Second World War, both money emission and the Treasury's functions were performed by the USSR State Bank, but the money system of the Latvian SSR was under its full control. On 2 March 1990, the Latvian SSR Supreme Council passed the Law \\"On Banks\\" and the decision \\"On the Bank of Latvia\\". It determined that the Bank of Latvia, a local central bank, was reestablished as an independent state bank, a money issuing center, a central bank in relation to commercial banks, an organizer of the execution of the state budget, and a monetary policy regulator. However, only after the Declaration of 4 May 1990 on the restoration of independence of the Republic of Latvia and the collapse of the USSR with the decision of the Republic of Latvia Supreme Council of 3 September 1991 \\"On the Reorganization of Banking Institutions in the Territory of the Republic of Latvia\\", the Bank of Latvia became the only central and issuing bank. It took over the ownership and structure of the USSR banks, Latvijas RepublikƒÅnisko banku, and other state credit institutions. On 4 March 1992, the Supreme Council of the Republic of Latvia passed the Law \\"On the Acquisition of the Bank of Latvia established in 1922\\". The Bank of Latvia's status as the central bank of the country and the issue bank was definitively consolidated by the laws of the Republic of Latvia \\"On Banks\\" and \\"On the Bank of Latvia\\" adopted on 19 May 1992. For the first time in Latvia, the independence of the national central bank from the government policy was ensured through legislation. The Law \\"On the Bank of Latvia\\" did not envisage its commercial activities, therefore, a decision was taken on the restructuring and privatization of 49 Bank of Latvia branches. Monetary policy strategy and exchange rate policy Like most central banks of the world, the main goal of the Bank of Latvia is to provide inflation at a certain level. After joining the European Union (EU), until its membership in the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), the Bank of Latvia was able to pursue its monetary policy, provided that it is in line with the common EU interests, does not harm the development of other EU Member States, and contributes to economic stability. Membership in the EU also envisages joining EMU and the euro. After joining the EU, Latvia had to demonstrate its ability to meet the EMU accession criteria. One of these criteria was the two-year membership of the Exchange Rate Mechanism II (ERM II). Latvia joined it on 2 May 2005. ERM II means that at least two years before the euro changeover, the lats had been pegged to the euro and the exchange rate of the lats against the euro may fluctuate by no more than +/- 15% against the lats' pegging rate in euro. In order to achieve its main goal, as well as successfully entering the EMU, the Bank of Latvia implemented a fixed exchange rate strategy (EUR 1 = Ls 0.702804). Fluctuations around the fixed coupling rate are possible within +/- 1%. The Bank of Latvia had been implementing the lats attraction policy since February 1994, when the lats was pegged to the SDR basket of currencies. The lats was pegged to the euro on 1 January 2005. Also, at the beginning of 2006 and 2007, the Bank of Latvia operated a refinancing rate instrument, a rate for travel. In a situation where banks do not intend to actively use the instruments offered by the Bank of Latvia, the increase of the refinancing rate has a more signaling function. Management The Bank of Latvia is managed by the Bank's Board and Management Board. The council consists of eight people: the president of the bank, his deputy, and six members of the council. The Bank's Supervisory Council is managed by the President of the Bank of Latvia. The Governing Council of the Bank of Latvia takes decisions on behalf of the Bank of Latvia. For the practical work and operational management of the Bank of Latvia, the Bank Council establishes a permanent board of six people. The Bank's Governor approves the structure of the Bank of Latvia and recruits and dismisses the Bank of Latvia's employees. =Governors= * KƒÅrlis Vanags (1 November 1922 ‚Äî 14 October 1923) * Edgars ≈†vƒìde (15 October 1923 ‚Äî 21 September 1926) * KƒÅrlis Vanags (22 September 1926 ‚Äî 13 July 1940) * KƒÅrlis Zandersons (13 July 1940 ‚Äî 21 July 1940) * Art≈´rs Graudi≈Ü≈° (26 March ‚Äì 30 July 1990) * PƒÅvils Sakss (31 July 1990 ‚Äì 3 September 1991) * Einars Rep≈°e (3 September 1991 ‚Äì 20 December 2001) * IlmƒÅrs Rim≈°ƒìviƒçs (21 December 2001 ‚Äì 20 December 2019) * MƒÅrti≈Ü≈° KazƒÅks (21 December 2019 ‚Äì present) See also *Economy of Latvia *Latvian lats *European Central Bank *Latvia and the euro References External links * Official site of Latvijas Banka * Official site of Latvijas Banka Category:Economy of Latvia Latvia Category:Banks of Latvia Latvia Category:1922 establishments in Latvia Category:Banks established in 1922 ","title":"Bank of Latvia"},{"id":"897374","text":"Chalmers Student Union (Chalmers Studentk√•r or ChS) is the student union at Chalmers University of Technology in Gothenburg, Sweden.

In 1911 a proposal to start The Cort√®ge, an annual carnival parade now seen by 250,000 people each year, was accepted. The union's own magazine Tofsen was first published in 1944, and ChS obtained its first union building Lopphuset that same year. A new union building was opened in 1952.

Designed under the leadership of Alec Issigonis, more than 1.6 million were manufactured between 1948 and 1972 in three series: the MM (1948 to 1953), the Series II (1952 to 1956), and the 1000 series (1956 to 1979). Initially available as a two-door saloon and tourer (convertible), the range was expanded to include a four-door saloon in 1950, a wood-framed estate car (the Traveller) from October 1953 and panel van and pick-up truck variants from MayPaul Skilleter's book \\"The world's supreme small car Morris Minor\\" 1953\\\\.

Indeed, so identified has the car become with a particular reading of Englishness Development =Origins= The Minor was conceived in 1941. Although the Nuffield Organization was heavily involved in war work and a governmental ban existed on civilian car production, Morris Motors' vice chairman, Miles Thomas, wanted to prepare the ground for new products to be launched as soon as the war was over. Vic Oak, the company's chief engineer, had already brought to Thomas' attention a promising junior engineer, Alec Issigonis, who had been employed at Morris since 1935 and specialised in suspension design, but he had frequently impressed Oak with his advanced ideas about car design in general. Issigonis had come to Oak's particular attention with his work on the new Morris Ten, which was in development during 1936/7. This was the first Morris to use unitary construction and was conceived with independent front suspension. Issigonis designed a coil-sprung wishbone system, which was later dropped on cost grounds. Although the design was later used on the MG Y-type and many other postwar MGs, the Morris Ten entered production with a front beam axle. Despite his brief being to focus on the Ten's suspension, Issigonis had also drawn up a rack and pinion steering system for the car. Like his suspension design, this was not adopted, but resurfaced in the postwar years on the MG Y-type, but these ideas proved that he was the perfect candidate to lead the design work on a new advanced small car. With virtually all resources required for the war effort, Thomas nonetheless approved the development of a new small family car that would replace the Morris Eight. Although Oak (and Morris's technical director, Sidney Smith) were in overall charge of the project, Issigonis was ultimately responsible for the design, working with only two other draughtsmen. Thomas named the project 'Mosquito' and ensured that it remained as secret as possible, both from the Ministry of Supply and from company founder William Morris (Lord Nuffield), who was still chairman of Morris Motors, and as widely expected, would not look favourably on Issigonis' radical ideas. Issigonis' overall concept was to produce a practical, economical, and affordable car for the general public that would equal, if not surpass, the convenience and design quality of a more expensive car. In later years he summed up his approach to the Minor; that he wanted to design an economy car that \\"the average man would take pleasure in owning, rather than feeling of it as something he'd been sentenced to\\" and \\"people who drive small cars are the same size as those who drive large cars and they should not be expected to put up with claustrophobic interiors.\\" Issigonis wanted the car to be as spacious as possible for its size, and comfortable to drive for inexperienced motorists. Just as he would with the Mini 10 years later, he designed the Mosquito with excellent roadholding and accurate, quick steering, not with any pretence of making a sports car, but to make it safe and easy to drive by everyone. =Original design features= Issigonis' design included the same ideas he had proposed for the Ten before the war: independent suspension, rack and pinion steering, and unitary construction. In the case of the Mosquito, Issigonis was inspired by the Citro√´n Traction Avant, a car he greatly admired, and he proposed using torsion bars on each wheel, as on the Citro√´n, rather than the usual coil spring system. The French car, launched in 1934, had also been an early example of the use of rack and pinion steering. Nearly every feature of the Minor served the joint aims of good handling and maximum interior space. For example, Issigonis specified wheels for the Mosquito. These were smaller than any other production car of the time (the existing Morris Eight had wheels). These small wheels reduced intrusion into the cabin space and minimised the car's unsprung mass, giving better ride comfort and stability. For the same reasons, the wheels themselves were placed as far as possible towards each corner of the Mosquito's floorpan. The same went for the placement of the engine, as far as possible towards the front of the engine compartment. Most cars of the time had a front beam axle, which forced the engine to be mounted behind the front axle line. While this meant that, with only a driver on board, the weight distribution was fairly even, when laden with passengers, cars often became severely tail-heavy, leading to unstable handling and oversteer. The new Morris's independent suspension meant there was no front axle, allowing the engine to be placed low down and far forward. Putting the Mosquito's engine in the nose meant that the car was nose-heavy when lightly laden, leading to superior directional stability, and when fully laden it achieved nearly equal weight balance, so handling and grip remained good regardless of the load carried. Placing the engine further forward also maximised cabin space. As proposed by Issigonis, the engine itself was also radical, being a water-cooled flat-four unit. One of Miles Thomas's few restrictions on the Mosquito project was that it had to have an engine that would not fall afoul of the British horsepower tax, which taxed cars under a formula relating to their engine cylinder bore. At the same time, Thomas wanted the car to appeal to the all-important export markets, which had no such restrictions, and generally favoured larger-engined cars. Issigonis' solution was the flat-four engine, which could easily be produced in two versions ‚Äì a narrow-bore 800-cc version for the British market and a wide-bore 1100-cc version for export. Both versions would use identical parts, except for the actual cylinder blocks (which could still be produced on the same machinery) and the pistons. The flat-four layout reduced the overall length of the engine, further increasing potential cabin space, and reduced the car's centre of gravity for improved handling. =Pre-production changes= The engine was to prove a step too far for the Mosquito project. As the car approached completion in 1946, the war was over and secrecy was no longer necessary or possible to maintain, as more and more Morris staff and executives had to be involved to start production. Many were pessimistic about the radical car's prospects and especially the huge cost in tooling up for a design that shared no parts with any existing Morris product. Lord Nuffield himself took a strong dislike to both the Mosquito and Issigonis, famously saying that the prototype resembled a poached egg. Nuffield preferred to continue production of the conventional Morris Eight, which succeeded very well before the war, with some minor styling and engineering improvements. He particularly objected to the Mosquito's expensive and unconventional engine design. Whatever Nuffield's personal views, all of the Mosquito's radical features were looking increasingly unlikely to be implemented while maintaining an acceptable final purchase price and without incurring too much setup costs at the Cowley factory. Thomas and Vic Oak drew up a plan to create a three-model range of cars using Issigonis' design - the Mosquito with an 800-cc engine, a mid-sized model (tentatively designated the Minor after a previous small Morris launched in 1928) with an 1100-cc engine, and a new Morris Oxford with a 1500-cc version of the engine, all sharing different- sized variants of the same platform and with sporting MG and luxury Wolseley versions to achieve further economies of scale. There was also the matter of timing ‚Äì a big rush existed for British manufacturers to get new models to market following the end of the war. Austin was known to be working on an all- new but conventional car, which would be launched in 1947. The Mosquito was proposed for launch in 1949 and that deadline was appearing increasingly unlikely due to the untried nature of many of the car's features. The Morris board insisted on launching the Mosquito at the first postwar British Motor Show in October 1948. This meant that several of Issigonis' proposals were reviewed ‚Äì first the all-independent torsion bar suspension was changed for a torsion-sprung live rear axle and this was then substituted by a conventional leaf-sprung arrangement. All of Miles Thomas' suggestions for spreading the cost of developing the new car and broadening the design's appeal were treated sceptically by the Morris board and vetoed by Lord Nuffield. It became clear that the only way to overcome the personal and financial obstacles to the project was to adopt a lightly revised version of the Morris Eight's obsolete side-valve engine. Thomas resigned his position at Morris Motors over the debacle. Despite the changes the fundamental principles of Issigonis' concept ‚Äì a spacious cabin, small wheels at each corner, a forward-placed engine, rack and pinion steering, and independent torsion-bar front suspension ‚Äì remained. While Thomas had been battling for the Mosquito's future, Issigonis had been settling the car's styling. Although in his later career he became known for very functional designs, Issigonis was heavily influenced by the modern styling of American cars, especially the Packard Clipper and the Buick Super. A new feature was a low-set headlamps, integral with the grille panel (Issigonis had originally sketched hidden lamps concealed behind sections of the grille, but these were never implemented). The original Mosquito prototype, which drew Lord Nuffield's \\"poached egg\\" comment, was designed with similar proportions to prewar cars, being relatively narrow for its length. In late 1947, with Cowley already tooling up for production, Issigonis was unhappy with the appearance of the car. He had the prototype cut lengthways and the two halves moved apart until it looked \\"right\\". The production model was thus 4 inches (10 cm) wider than the prototype, and in keeping with Issigonis' design principles, this further improved interior space and roadholding. It also gave the car distinctive (and recognisably modern) proportions ‚Äì contrast with the Austin A30, launched in 1952, but still recognisably prewar in size and proportions. The last-minute change to the design required a number of workarounds ‚Äì bumpers had already been produced, so early cars had ones cut in half with a four-inch plate bolted between the joint. The bonnet had a flat fillet section added to its centreline and the floorpan had two two-inch sections added either side of the transmission tunnel. =From Mosquito to Minor= The last change made was to the car's name. The Mosquito codename was widely expected to be the name of the production model, but Nuffield disliked it. Also, Issigonis' last-minute size increase and the fitment of the larger-than-planned sidevalve engine needed to be considered; while still a small car, the new Morris was no longer the ultra-compact economy car that it had been on the drawing board, and the Mosquito name seemed inappropriate. Morris's marketing department wanted a reassuring name for what it worried would be an innovative, radical car that would be difficult to sell to a cautious public. So, the Minor name, intended for the midsized model in Thomas' planned trio of new cars, was adopted for what would become the smallest postwar Morris. The original 1928 Morris Minor had itself introduced a number of innovative features and had been the first four-wheeled car to sell for ¬£100. The new Morris Minor was launched at the British Motor Show at Earls Court in London on 27 October 1948. The original range consisted solely of a two-door saloon or a two-door tourer with a 918-cc engine and a starting price of ¬£358. At the same show, Morris also launched the new Morris Oxford and Morris Six models, plus Wolseley variants of both cars, which were scaled-up versions of the new Minor, incorporating all the same features and designed with Issigonis' input under Oak's supervision. Thus, Issigonis' ideas and design principles underpinned the complete postwar Morris and Wolseley car ranges, although not the same extent that Miles Thomas had initially proposed. Minor MM The original Minor MM series was produced from 1948 until 1953. It included a pair of four-seat saloons, two-door and (from 1950) a four-door, and a convertible four-seat Tourer. The front torsion bar suspension was shared with the larger Morris Oxford MO, as was the almost- unibody construction. Although the Minor was originally designed to accept a flat-4 engine, late in the development stage it was replaced by a side-valve inline-four engine, little changed from that fitted in the early 1930s Morris Minor and Morris 8, with a bore of 57 mm but with the stroke of 90 mm and not 83 mm, and producing 27.5 hp (21 kW) and 39 lbf¬∑ft (50.3 N¬∑m) of torque. The engine pushed the Minor to just 64 mph (103 km/h) but delivered . Brakes were four-wheel drums. Early cars had a painted section in the centre of the bumpers to cover the widening of the production car from the prototypes. This widening of 4 inches (102 mm) is also visible in the creases in the bonnet. Exports to the United States began in 1949 with the headlamps removed from within the grille surround to be mounted higher on the wings to meet local safety requirements. In 1950 a four-door version was released, initially available only for export, and featuring from the start the headlamps faired into the wings rather than set lower down on either side of the grille. The raised headlight position became standard on all Minors in time for 1951. From the start, the Minor had semaphore-type turn indicators, and subsequent Minor versions persisted with these until 1961. An Autocar magazine road test in 1950 reported that these were \\"not of the usual self-cancelling type, but incorporate[d] a time-basis return mechanism in a switch below the facia, in front of the driver\\". It was all too easy for a passenger hurriedly emerging from the front passenger seat to collide with and snap off a tardy indicator \\"flipper\\" that was still sticking out of the B-pillar, having not yet been safely returned by the time-basis return mechanism to its folded position. Another innovation towards the end of 1950 was a water pump (replacing a gravity dependent system), which permitted the manufacturer to offer an interior heater \\"as optional equipment\\". When production of the first series ended, just over a quarter of a million had been sold, 30% of them the convertible Tourer model. A 918 cc-engined tourer tested by the British magazine The Motor in 1950 had a top speed of and could accelerate from 0‚Äì in 29.2 seconds. However, the 918 cc engine did 0‚Äì60 mph in 50+ seconds. A fuel consumption of was recorded. The test car cost ¬£382 including taxes.

Raised headlights were introduced with this bodystyle. Minor Series II In 1952, the Minor was substantially re-engineered following the merger of the Nuffield Organisation (Morris's parent company) with the Austin Motor Company to form the British Motor Corporation. As part of a rationalisation programme to reduce the production of duplicate components for similar vehicles, the Minor drivetrain was completely replaced with an Austin-derived engine, gearbox, propshaft, differential and axle casing. The more modern Austin-designed overhead valve A-series engine, which had been designed for the Minor's main rival, the Austin A30, was smaller in all dimensions, but nevertheless gave noticeable performance improvements over the pre-war side-valve Morris unit it replaced. The 52 second drive to 60 mph (97 km/h) was still calm, but top speed increased to 63 mph (101 km/h). Fuel consumption also rose to . An estate version was introduced in 1952, known as the Traveller (a Morris naming tradition for estates, also seen on the Mini). The Traveller featured an external structural ash (wood) frame for the rear bodywork, with two side- hinged rear doors. The frame was varnished rather than painted and a highly visible feature of the body style. Travellers were built alongside the saloon model at Cowley minus their rear bodies. The half-completed cars were then shipped to the MG factory at Abingdon where the bodies (built in Coventry) would be mated to the chassis and the final assembly carried out. This was because the main Cowley production lines were no longer fully equipped to deal with body-on-frame vehicles such as the Traveller while the MG lines still handled these sorts of cars and had experience working with wood-framed bodies. Commercial models, marketed as the Morris Quarter Ton Van and Pick-up were added in May 1953.Ray Newell, Morris Minor, 60 Years on the Road, pages 106 to 118 Rear bodies of the van versions were all steel. The four-seat convertible and saloon variants continued as well. The Motor magazine tested a four-door saloon in 1952. It reported a top speed of and acceleration from 0‚Äì in 28.6 seconds. A fuel consumption of was recorded. The test car cost ¬£631 including taxes. From 1952‚Äì56, an 803 cc A-Series inline-four engine was used, producing at 4,800 rpm and of torque at 2,400 rpm A horizontal slat grille was fitted from October 1954, as well as a new dashboard with a central speedometer. 269,838 examples of the Series II had been built when production ended in 1956. 1953.morris.minor.rearview.arp.jpgMinor four-door saloon registered October 1953 Morris Minor Traveller - Flickr - exfordy (1).jpgMinor Traveller registered September 1954 File:Morris Minor Series II.jpgMorris Minor Series II two-door saloon (with later horizontal slat grille) File:Oldtimer Expo 2008 - 015 - Morris Minor Cabriolet.jpgMorris Minor Series II Tourer (with later horizontal slat grille) Minor 1000 =Series III= In 1956, the Minor received a major programme of updates intended to keep the car competitive into the 1960s. Where previously the Minor had been offered with a broad range of colours and trim options, the 'Minor 1000' (so named for its 948cc engine) shifted emphasis towards rationalisation of components to access improved economies of scale, and thus enabled increased production volumes to help the Minor retain a significant share of the small car market during a period where car ownership was becoming more commonplace. The dawn of the motorway era necessitated the fitting of a new 948cc (57.9 cu in) variant of the BMC A-Series engine, elevating top speed from 63 mph to 75 mph, and reducing 0-60 mph acceleration from 52.5 secs to 31.3 secs.http://www.gbclassiccars.co.uk/morris_minor.html Driving was further improved by a substantially revised gearbox, which incorporated taller ratios for more relaxed cruising speeds and a remote selector allowing a shorter gear lever and less ponderous gearchange action. This new engine and gearbox was the product of a broader engine policy at BMC, and had been developed for use in a range of their smaller vehicles, including the Austin A35, A40 Farina, and Austin-Healey Sprite/MG Midget, to maximise parts sharing and thus reduce production costs, servicing costs and consumer costs across the model range. A series of changes to the body pressings for the roof/scuttle and bonnet panels yielded a large wraparound rear windscreen and one-piece curved front windscreen, which markedly improved visibility and lent a modernised appearance to the car at relatively small outlay. Many of the 'luxury' items, such as leather trim, were replaced with more durable and cheaper materials, and over the course of the following years the range of available paint and interior colours was dramatically reduced. Various unique Minor trim items and components (such as light units and heaters) were also gradually replaced with ubiquitous items from the BMC range. This programme of changes succeeded in giving access to improved economies of scale to allow production to be ramped up. By the turn of the 1960s, over 100,000 Minors were being produced per year, compared to fewer than 50,000 per year a decade earlier.http://www.morrisminorspares.com/production-figures-i19 In 1961 the semaphore-style trafficators were replaced by flashing direction indicators. These were US-style red at the rear (using the same bulb filament as the brake lamp) and white at the front (using a second brighter filament in the parking lamp bulb) which was legal in the UK and many export markets at the time (such as New Zealand). On the two door cars, the rear wings were modified to remove the openings for the trafficators; on the 4-door, the B-pillar pressing was modified to leave a ‚Äòblank‚Äô in place of the trafficator housing. An upmarket car based on the Minor floorpan using the larger BMC B-Series engine was sold as the Riley One-Point-Five/Wolseley 1500 beginning in 1957: versions of this Wolseley/Riley variant were also produced by BMC Australia as the Morris Major and the Austin Lancer. 1960 Morris Minor 1000 2-door sedan (26676151933).jpgMorris Minor 1000 2-door saloon 1962 Morris Minor 1000 sedan (18823882102).jpgMorris Minor 1000 4-door saloon Morris Minor 1000 01.JPGMorris Minor 1000 Convertible Traveller (4196830669).jpgMorris Minor 1000 Traveller (registered February 1966) Morris Minor Emblem.jpgMorris Minor bonnet ornament MM1000 4DS 1956 06 innen 2005.jpgInterior =Minor Million= In December 1960 the Morris Minor became the first British car to sell more than 1,000,000 units. To commemorate the achievement, a limited edition of 350 two- door Minor saloons (one for each UK Morris dealership) was produced with distinctive lilac paintwork and a white interior. Also the badge name on the side of the bonnet was modified to read \\"Minor 1,000,000\\" instead of the standard \\"Minor 1000\\". The millionth Minor was donated to the National Union of Journalists, which planned to use it as a prize in a competition in aid of the union's Widow and Orphan Fund. The company, at the same time, presented a celebratory Minor to London's Great Ormond Street Hospital for Sick Children, but this car was constructed of cake. =Series V (ADO59)= The final major upgrades to the Minor were made in 1962. Although the name Minor 1000 was retained, the changes were sufficient for the new model to be given its own ADO development number. Morris chassis numbering convention refers to these cars as 'Series V', the 'Series IV' designation having been assigned to the Morris Mini Minor. A new, larger version of the existing A-Series engine had been developed in conjunction with cylinder head specialist Harry Weslake for the then new ADO16 Austin/Morris 1100 range. This new engine used a taller block than the 948 cc unit, with increased bore and stroke bringing total capacity up to 1,098 cc. Although fuel consumption suffered moderately at 38 mpg, the Minor's top speed increased to 77 mph (124 km/h), and a 20% increase in torque gave an altogether more responsive drive. The revised engine was teamed to a stronger gearbox fitted with baulk ring synchromesh replacing the previous cone-clutch type. Drum brakes were retained on each corner, but the front units were increased from 7 inches (18 cm) to 8 inches (20 cm) in diameter. Other changes included a modified dashboard with toggle switches, white-on-black speedometer unit (incorporating a warning light for a blocked oil filter), textured alloy fascia, and a new glove-box cover design (a fully enclosing bottom-hinged cover on the passenger side, and fixed open aperture surround on the driver's side). A two-spoke 'safety' steering wheel (shared with the Morris 1100) and new heater (now with fresh air ventilation) were fitted in 1964, completing the interior upgrade. Larger combined front side/indicator light units, common to many BMC vehicles of the time, were fitted to the front wings, and larger tail lamp units were fitted at the rear. Both incorporated separate amber flashers for directional indicators. From 1965, no further production improvements were made to the Minor,http://mmoc- ni.co.uk/2012/12/03/minor-history/ with resource being channelled into improving the ADO16 (the Minor's spiritual successor and Britain's best- selling car in the 1960s), and development of the Morris Marina, which would succeed the Minor on the Cowley production lines in 1971. In 1969, production of the Traveller variants was moved to the ex-Wolseley plant at Adderley Park, where the van and pick-up models were already made. This freed up production space at Cowley and simplified the production chain as the Traveller's rear bodies were built at the Morris Bodies factory in Coventry. Adderley Park- built Travellers were offered in a new range of colours from the paint range that had been introduced for 1970, including vibrant shades such as Limeflower (lime green) and Aqua (turquoise). From 1971 Minors were fitted with a steering-column mounted ignition key and a steering lock rather than the facia-mounted ignition switch used up to that point. ;Engines *1956‚Äì62 (Series III): 948 cc A-series inline-four, 37 bhp (28 kW) at 4,750 rpm and 50 lb/ft (68 N¬∑m) at 2,500 rpm *1962‚Äì72 (Series V): 1,098 cc A-series inline-four, 48 bhp (36 kW) at 5,100 rpm and 60 lb/ft (81 N¬∑m) at 2,500 rpm Decline and replacement During the life of the Minor 1000 model, production declined - as the Mini and 1100/1300 had become BMC's best selling models by the mid 1960s. The last Convertible/Tourer was manufactured on 18 August 1969, and the saloon models were discontinued in November 1970. Production of the more practical Traveller and commercial versions ceased in April 1971. According to Newell (1997), 1.6 million Minors were made in total and Wainwright (2008) even claims that 1,619,857 Minors of all variants were ultimately sold. Overseas production in the form of ckd Kit Assembly continued in New Zealand until 1974. The last new Morris minor, a 4 door blue saloon, currently unregistered with less than 200 miles on the clock, was assembled at The Brittans group, Dublin assemblers in 1975, the same year British Leyland ordered the company to cease assembly of their vehicles for the Irish market. =The Minor vs Volkswagen= The decline and cancellation of Minor production was source of some consternation by industry commentators in the late 1960s,Cowin, Chris (2012), British Leyland: Chronicle of a Car Crash () p.57 who believed that further development of the car had the potential to challenge the Volkswagen Beetle in export markets. The Volkswagen, which was developed as a small family car with a very similar brief to the Minor, had been upgraded consistently over 25 years, and retained a healthy market share in export markets (especially developing countries), where it was very often the lowest priced new car on the market.Howard, Tony (December 1976). \\"New VWs reflect determinedly cheerful mood\\". SA Motor. Cape Town, South Africa: Scott Publications: 31‚Äì32. It went on to achieve over 21 million units before cancellation in 2003. Having said this, in the year of the Minor's cancellation (1971), over 1.3 million Beetles were produced (its peak year of production).https://www.thesamba.com/vw/archives/info/beetle_productionfigures.php This corresponded to over 80% of total Minor production in 23 years, or ten times the production volume of Minors in their peak year (1958) when 113,699 were built. This gulf of production capacity made the Minor's ability to effectively challenge the Beetle, which had a global distributor and servicing network, moot. Some historians also report that the Minor was being sold at a loss during its final years. British Leyland management were pinning hopes for greater market share and profitability on the Morris Marina, which was being specifically developed for assembly on the Minor production lines at Cowley, thereby precluding the continuance of Minor production in any event. =Successors= The Minor was officially replaced on the Cowley production lines by the Morris Marina (ADO28), which was developed primarily in response to Ford's top-selling (and in many respects, conservatively engineered) Escort. Building a larger mid-sized car capable of volume sales (particularly in the lucrative fleet-buying market) was becoming increasingly key in maintaining healthy sales figures, and was an issue BMC had consistently failed to address hitherto. The Marina was developed under the watchful eye of British Leyland management, and used a modified version of the Minor chassis floorplan, extended to increase the wheelbase by 10 inches. Many other Minor components, including much of the suspension, were used in the running gear, which served to streamline production changeover and minimise the financial outlay associated with chassis development and retooling. The spiritual successor to the Morris Minor was arguably the ADO16 Austin/Morris 1100 range, which had been launched in 1962 and aimed at the same small family-car market (and actually replaced the Minor in some export markets such as Australia and New Zealand). The crisp styling, hydrolastic suspension and innovative front- wheel drive system (itself a \\"scaling-up\\" of the Mini principle) made ADO16 a worthy successor to the (in its day) strikingly forward-looking Minor. However, due to the British Motor Corporation's commitment to both the Morris factory at Cowley, and Austin plant at Longbridge ‚Äì in addition to a healthy demand for both products ‚Äì production of the two cars continued in parallel for nearly 10 years. Indeed, production of ADO16 outlasted that of the Minor by only three years or so, before being replaced by the innovative, export- oriented, yet under-developed Austin Allegro in 1974. Safety Despite the four major updates of the Minor in its 23-year production run, very few actively designed \\"safety features\\" were ever engineered into the Minor's design. Provisions were made for seat belt fittings in the early '60s, but the rigid structure of the car's monocoque body made it dangerously unabsorbent to impact. For a short time in 1968, the thickness of the steel used in the bonnet and doors was decreased from 1.2 mm to 1.0 mm to act as a form of crumple zone, but as the wings continued to be made of 1.4 mm mild steel, the modification was pointless and ineffectual and was reversed in 1969 as it increased passenger compartment crush in collisions. The Mark II model changed from the \\"lowlight\\" model to comply with Canadian lighting standards, with higher and brighter headlights to increase visibility in fog and during dark Canadian winters. Australian models, and tourer models made in Britain and exported to Australia, featured safety glass windscreens and safety glass windows, to comply with local regulations. Australian models also had blinking indicator lights in addition to the standard trafficator arms on the indigenous Minor 1000. Morris quarter ton van and pick-up Closed van and open flat-bed (\\"pick-up\\") versions of the Minor were built from 1953 until the end of production. They were designed for commercial use with small businesses, although many were also used by larger corporations. Van versions were popular with the General Post Office, the early versions of these (to around 1956) having rubber front wings to cope with the sometimes unforgiving busy situations in which they were expected to work. Both the van and the pickup differed from the monocoque construction of the Saloon and Traveller variants by having a separate chassis. They also differed in details such as telescopic rear dampers, stiffer rear leaf springs and lower-ratio differentials to cope with heavier loads. The commercial versions were initially marketed as the Morris Quarter Ton Van and Pick-up, with a Series III designation applied from 1956. The names Morris 6cwt Van and Pickup was used following the introduction of the 1098cc engine in 1962 and 8cwt versions were added in 1968.A Cwt was the short-form term for a \\"hundredweight\\" which was a pre-metric unit of weight measurement used in Britain, equivalent to about 50 kg. Use of the term in the name of a light commercial vehicle was common in Britain, and indicated the maximum load (by weight) that the van was designed to carry. As BMC's policy was to provide both Austin and Morris with complete commercial vehicle ranges, Austin-badged variants of the Minor van and pick-up were sold following the end of Austin A35 production in 1968. These featured Austin badging and the corporate Austin 'crinkle-cut' radiator grille but were otherwise identical to the standard Minor commercials, and were sold as the Austin 6cwt and Austin 8cwt.

The enduring affection for the \\"Moggie\\" (also a common British nickname for an undistinguished cat, or a Morgan) or \\"Morrie\\" (as it is often known in Australia and New Zealand) is reflected in the number of restored and improved Morris Minors currently running in Britain and Australasia. In addition to more powerful engines, desirable improvements necessitated by the increase in traffic density since the Minor was withdrawn from volume production include the replacement of the original equipment drum brakes with discs. Other important upgrades include the version of the A-series engine, derided by Morris Marina enthusiasts as a key reason why many Marinas were scrapped, and the similarly sized Nissan A engine, which shares all common dimensions to the Morris Minor engine, except piston size. Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson once stated that the Morris Minor is Britain's Volkswagen Beetle (although this was meant in a derogatory way rather than favourably). There is still an extensive parts backup for these cars, and parts are cheap compared to modern day cars. Replacement panels for the Morris Minor were still being made in 2002 by the Durable Car Company in Sri Lanka.

Robinson was the first actor to portray the character of Gordon Robinson on the PBS children's TV program Sesame Street. When Sesame Street began in 1969, not only did Robinson play Gordon, but he also provided the voice of the puppet Roosevelt Franklin and also was one of the show's producers. He left the show in 1972. In later years, when producers needed a last name for the Gordon character, then played by Hal Miller and then Roscoe Orman, they used Matt's last name. He wrote and produced the films Save the Children and Amazing Grace in the early 1970s, and authored scripts for Sanford and Son and Eight Is Enough. In 1983, he joined the staff of the NBC's The Cosby Show as a producer and staff writer. By that time, he was beginning to show symptoms of Parkinson's disease, but stayed with the show for seven seasons despite the difficulty. He ultimately died from the disease on August 5, 2002 in Los Angeles at the age of 65. Family, early life Born Matthew Thomas Robinson Jr., in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to Matthew Robinson Sr. and Marie (n√©e Henson) Robinson on January 1, 1937. His father worked as a postal worker and one of the first African American columnists for The Philadelphia Independent newspaper, while his mother worked as an elementary-school teacher. Robinson attended West Philadelphia High School in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, before going on to Pennsylvania State University in University Park, Pennsylvania, and graduating in 1958 with a degree from the College of the Liberal Arts and Sciences. While at Penn State, Robinson was elected president of the Penn State Omega Psi Phi fraternity, one of the first African American fraternities founded at a prominently African American college or university‚ÄîHoward University in Washington, D.C. Career In 1962, Robinson wrote a slave revolt drama titled Rained All Night. He began his media career in 1963 as a writer, and soon after producer and on-air talent, at television station WCAU-TV in his hometown of Philadelphia. Robinson produced and hosted Opportunity in Philadelphia, a weekly televised employment service oriented toward African-Americans. By televising job opportunities, Opportunity in Philadelphia sought to allay the apprehension many minorities felt when looking for work. Robinson established his talent at WCAU, ultimately leading to future successes as a producer and actor. =Sesame Street= Robinson's television breakthrough came in 1969 when he joined the Children's Television Workshop (CTW) to assist in the development of a new children's program for National Educational Television titled Sesame Street. His initial role was to produce and oversee filmed segments focusing on the diversity of different characters on the show. Robinson was eventually chosen to play the fictional character of Gordon in the series, after the performance of the character in test episodes by another actor, Garrett Saunders, did not work out as the producers had hoped. Gordon was the first character with spoken lines on the show, as a result of difficulty in finding someone to fill the figure. This was against Robinson's original intentions upon joining the show, as he preferred a behind-the-scenes role, and was initially reluctant to take the part. Dolores Robinson commented on his backseat role on the set: \\"He was by nature shy, and he knew that they were having a difficult time casting Gordon. And the people overseeing the taping up in the booth, peering at the monitors, kept saying, 'Matt knows what to do. He should be the Gordon.'‚Äù He ultimately resigned from the role in 1972. Despite resigning from the character Gordon in 1972, Robinson continued to work with the show, scripting and voicing Roosevelt Franklin sketches until 1975. One reason why he resigned from the show completely in 1975 was because he did not agree with the decision to have Susan work outside the home, as he felt that women should stay home. Since 1972, two other actors, Hal Miller (1972‚Äì1974) and Roscoe Orman (1974‚Äìpresent) have played the role of Gordon. Later, when Gordon and Susan needed a surname, Robinson's was used in tribute. Robinson wrote one of the first Sesame Street-themed storybooks in 1972, titled Gordon of Sesame Street's Storybook. It was composed of four of his originally written children stories, \\"No More Milk\\", \\"Fisher-Man\\", \\"Fire-Man,\\" and \\"A Lot of Hot Water\\". The cover has a Gordon Robinson caricature reading to different children. Roosevelt Franklin While with CTW, Robinson also played the voice of a reddish-magenta puppet named Roosevelt Franklin. Robinson worked closely with Jim Henson to accurately design the character, the first black-influenced Muppet. Other minority-based Muppets created by Henson and Robinson were Baby Ray Francis, Mobley Mose and a Latino Muppet, A.B. Cito. Roosevelt Franklin promoted ideals such as family, pride, respect, and geography while also showing a passion for rhyming and blues music. By both creating the character and performing Franklin's voice for three seasons, Robinson helped his puppet become one of the show's main characters. In addition, Franklin continued to make appearances until 1975. The puppet was pulled from the show because a negative perception of the character among African-Americans began to grow. This resulted from Franklin's frequently unruly behavior at the fictional elementary school, which was deemed a bad example for the audience. Additional arguments for the character's departure were rooted in its overly excessive black image, or lack thereof. Dolores Robinson has stated that Roosevelt Franklin became a televised vehicle for her then-husband's anger with racism and pride in black people. Robinson recorded and released the first Sesame Street album to be focused on a single character, The Year of Roosevelt Franklin (Gordon's Friend from Sesame Street). Released in 1971, and then re-released in 1974 under the name My Name is Roosevelt Franklin, the album dealt with many appropriate behaviors for children; aside from basic topics such as numbers and letters, it also touched on traffic safety, sharing and getting along with others. All tracks were co- written with the help of Joe Raposo. The album was again released on compact disc in 2010 as a part of a set titled Old School: Volume 2, also including \\"Grover Sings the Blues\\" and \\"The Count Counts\\". =Post-Sesame Street= Following his time with CTW, Robinson continued to produce and write for movies, television and the stage. He wrote and produced, under the direction of Stan Lathan, Save The Children (1973), a musical performance that was a spinoff of a black exposition conducted by People to Save Humanity. Robinson would continue his work as a producer and writer in the 1974 film Amazing Grace, which was about a group of neighbors seeking to overthrow some shady, money-hungry politicians. Other post-Sesame Street work included writing episodes for Sanford and Son, The Waltons and Eight Is Enough, and writing and producing for Captain Kangaroo, a children's television series on CBS that aired from 1955 to 1984. He also starred on The Candy Apple News Company, a locally produced children's television series that aired in the 1970s and 1980s on WCAU-TV, Channel 10 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. In the show, a small human cast interacted with puppets in a radio and newspaper office. =The Cosby Show (1983‚Äì1990)= In 1983, Robinson joined the crew of NBC's The Cosby Show as a producer and writer. The family sitcom, which aired from 1984 for eight seasons until 1992, revolved around the life of the Huxtable family ‚Äì an affluent African-American family in Brooklyn, New York. Robinson transitioned among writer, executive story consultant, executive story editor and soundtrack writer for over 50 episodes of the show, eventually becoming a co-producer. He acted in one episode, \\"Cliff's Nightmare\\", as a French scientist. =The Confessions of Stepin Fetchit (1993)= Written by Robinson and directed by Bill Lathan, The Confessions of Stepin Fetchit is a one-man play that focuses on Lincoln Perry, who was a popular black comic character in 1930s films but soon came under fire by civil rights advocates. The play was meant as a call to history as well as a discussion forum for reflection on Perry's life story as one of America's first black movie stars.

In 1997, during her father's struggle with the disease, daughter Holly Robinson Peete and her husband, NFL quarterback Rodney Peete, started the HollyRod Foundation. The foundation was created to reach out to all those affected by Parkinson's disease or autism and provide medical, physical and emotional support. Located within the Center for Parkinson's Research and Movement Disorders at the Keck School of Medicine at the University of Southern California, the HollyRod Foundation is able to provide low or no-cost treatment as well as various services to the underserved in greater Los Angeles. Robinson died in his sleep at his Los Angeles home on Monday, August 5, 2002 at the age of 65. A memorial service was held on the morning of Friday, August 9, 2002 at the Writers Guild of America Theater in Beverly Hills, California. He is survived by daughter and actress Holly Robinson Peete, son and production assistant Matthew Robinson III, former spouse Dolores Robinson and five grandchildren.

It was the main-stay of Air France's predecessor, A√©ropostale in its efforts to establish intercontinental air mail services and support French colonialism and French cultural influence between the wars. Its pilots included famous poets and French men of letters such as Antoine de Saint Exup√©ry and Jean Mermoz as well as the usual veterans from World War I. Design and development Late 28 photo from NACA Aircraft Circular No.112 The Lat√©co√®re 28 was a development of the Lat√©co√®re 26. It was braced high-wing single-engined monoplane initially powered by a Renault 12Jbr engine. The Lat√©co√®re 28 had a fixed tailwheel undercarriage and enclosed cockpit for two crew. The cabin was fitted for eight-passengers with access to a washroom. A total of about fifty planes of several versions were built between 1927 and 1932. The seaplane version, the Lat√©co√®re 28-3, was the first to make a postal delivery crossing of the South Atlantic when Jean Mermoz flew from Dakar to Natal in 21 hours and a half aboard the Comte-de-La Vaulx (prototype n¬∞ 919) on 12 May 1930. Unfortunately the plane was lost at sea during the return flight (with no loss of life, nor of mail). This high-wing single engine plane was first built with Renault engines which were soon replaced by Hispano Suiza 12 giving 500 hp (370 kW). The floatplane version had the Hispano Suiza 12Lbr giving 650 hp (480 kW). Operational service The first aircraft were used by A√©ropostale on the African mail routes connecting Casablanca and Dakar. The aircraft also inaugurated a Paris-Madrid service. It became famous in South America because of the regular mail service it ensured, from France to Argentina, and further on. With this plane it was possible to send a letter from Paris to Santiago de Chile in what seemed then like an astonishingly short four days. Previously, the mail steamships had taken weeks or months. It had a very limited military career. Venezuela bought three for use as bombers, and the government of France gave several to the republican side in the Spanish Civil War.

He served with the Royal New Zealand Air Force and also the Royal Air Force instructing as a second lieutenant on radar in Britain, during World War II. After the war, he designed and built mobile radio equipment, although his first company went into receivership. In 1969, he founded Tait Electronics Ltd, now operating as Tait Radio Communications, Christchurch (New Zealand), with men who had decided to remain loyal and see him through; now his company is considered a world leader in mobile radio. He had persisted in keeping his manufacturing base in New Zealand, with 95 per cent of production exported to 160 countries. In the 1992 New Year Honours, Tait was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire, for services to manufacturing and export. He was awarded the IEEE Ernst Weber Engineering Leadership Recognition in 1998. In the 1999 Queen's Birthday Honours, he was appointed a Knight Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to technology, manufacturing and export.

Early life and family Born in Wellington on 4 April 1916, Toogood was the son of Henry Featherston Toogood and Ethel Lois Copus \\"Noonie\\" Toogood (n√©e Butler). Through his mother, Toogood was the great-grandson of John Howell, who established a whaling station at Riverton, and his second wife, Caroline Brown, whose mother was MƒÅori from the NgƒÅi Tahu iwi. Toogood did not learn of his MƒÅori ancestry until he was 18 years old. Toogood was educated at Wellesley College and Wellington College, where he had an inauspicious career, apart from excelling in the dramatic arts. On 30 June 1948, Toogood married Cynthia Holden Webb at St Peter's church, in Willis Street, Wellington. Cynthia's brother was Sir Richard Webb, who served as the New Zealand Chief of Defence Staff between 1971 and 1976. The Toogoods went on to have two sons, including Kit Toogood, who has been a High Court judge since 2011. Military service Toogood joined the army following the outbreak of World War II. As an ammunition officer, he saw active service in Greece, North Africa and Italy, rising to the rank of major. He was mentioned in dispatches in 1944, in recognition of gallant and distinguished service in Italy. In 1953, Toogood was awarded the Efficiency Decoration. Acting and broadcasting career After leaving school, Toogood became involved in theatre and radio, including a role in New Zealand's first radio soap opera. On a troopship on the way home from World War II, he ran his first quiz show. After the war, Toogood picked up where he had left off as a stage actor, voice-over artist and radio announcer. He began his career as a radio host in 1946 and was the originator of the game show It's in the Bag, in which he popularised the catch-phrases, \\"By hokey\\", and \\"What will it be, customers - the money or the bag?\\", in New Zealand. It's in the Bag eventually moved on to network television, where it was equally successful. He published his autobiography Out Of The Bag in 1979. Toogood hosted numerous other TV shows for the Broadcasting Corporation of New Zealand and Television New Zealand, including the panel show Beauty and the Beast and the children's quiz show W3. He retired from It's in the Bag in the 1980s, handing over the mantle to radio and TV host John Hawkesby. In the 1977 New Year Honours, Toogood was appointed a Companion of the Queen's Service Order for community services. Toogood was awarded a special lifetime achievement award by the New Zealand Academy of Film and Television Arts in New Zealand in 1999. Death Toogood died in Auckland in 2001, and his ashes were buried in Karori Cemetery. Cynthia Toogood died in 2005.

Some biblical scholars believe it to have been located east of the Jordan River, in the vicinity of Wadi Yabes. The name Jabesh means \\"dry\\" in Hebrew. Jabesh Gilead is mentioned in the Hebrew Bible Book of Judges, in the first and second books of Samuel and in the book of Chronicles. Jabesh Gilead is primarily mentioned in connection with King Saul's and King David's battles against the Philistines and Ammonites. Bible narratives ;Book of Judges In the Book of Judges, Chapters 19‚Äì21, eleven tribes of Israel had all but wiped out the tribe of Benjamin. Only 600 men from Benjamin remained on the Rimmon Rock. However the eleven tribes relented from destroying the whole tribe, and they decided that they needed to find wives for the 600 men since all other people in Benjamin had been killed. But they had taken an oath not to give their daughters to a Benjaminite, so they found the one city in Israel that had not joined the fight: Jabesh. All the inhabitants were executed under the Herem except for 400 virgins. They brought back 400 virgins from Jabesh and gave them to the men on Rimmon Rock. ;Books of Samuel and Chronicles Later Saul from the tribe of Benjamin and the city of Gibeah is made king of Israel. A month later in 1 Samuel 11 Nahash of Ammon attacks Jabesh, and Saul leads Israel to the defense of Jabesh. When Saul dies in 1 Samuel 31 it is not the tribe of Benjamin who retrieve his body from the Philistines, nor David, but men of Jabesh (giving honour to the rescuer of their city). Identification The identification of Jabesh-Gilead has been studied for a long time. The most likely locations are said to be Tell el- Maqlub and Tell Abu al-Kharaz.

His work as a film director includes hit comedy Came a Hot Friday, an adaptation of classic New Zealand play The End of the Golden Weather, and What Becomes of the Broken Hearted?, the sequel to Once Were Warriors. Early life and family Mune was born in Auckland, and educated at Wesley College in the same city. He was married to the writer Josie Mune until her death in 2015. Acting Mune acted on stage while training to be a teacher in Wellington. After time acting in the UK, he returned to his native New Zealand and won a Feltex award in 1975 after starring in one-off television drama Derek. Another award followed for playing Leo Moynihan, the secretary of a trade union in television series Moynihan. In 1987 he appeared in the TVNZ documentary mini-series Erebus: The Aftermath for which he won the award for Best Male in a Dramatic Role. In 1994 Mune won another New Zealand television award after playing Prime Minister Sir Robert Muldoon in television mini-series Fallout, which depicted the end of the Muldoon-led National Government. Mune featured in a documentary about the making of Shakespeare's King Lear called In The Shadow of King Lear by New Zealand company Theatre at Large giving insight into his acting process. He has gone on to appear in a range of New Zealand feature films, including A Song of Good, Savage Honeymoon and I'm Not Harry Jenson. He played Winston Churchill in American telemovie Ike: Countdown to D-Day, and Buster Keaton in Lucy: The Lucille Ball Story. Mune was a support role in the Australian drama Wanted, opposite Rebecca Gibney and Robyn Malcolm that premiered in 2016. Directing and writing Mune took multiple creative roles on 1976 anthology series Winners and Losers, which saw him collaborating with director Roger Donaldson. The two first collaborated on Derek; Mune directed and wrote some episodes of the new series, and acted in others. Having helped script Donaldson's first feature film, dystopian thriller Sleeping Dogs, Mune also appeared on-screen alongside its star, Sam Neill. Mune's other writing credits include adapting classic Ian Cross novel The God Boy into a well-regarded telemovie, the movie version of children's fable The Silent One, and co-writing Goodbye Pork Pie, the first New Zealand feature to win large audiences in its home country. In 1985 he made his feature debut as a director with hit comedy Came a Hot Friday. Based around the escapades of two smalltown conmen in 50s era New Zealand, the film is based on the novel by Ronald Hugh Morrieson. Mune won further acclaim in 1991 for directing 'coming of age' drama The End of the Golden Weather, an adaptation of parts of Bruce Mason's classic one-man play. Mune spent a number of years developing this passion project and seeking finance, working with Mason on the project before Mason died. What Becomes of the Broken Hearted? won nine of its 13 New Zealand Film Award nominations in 1999. The film is the sequel to hard-edged drama Once Were Warriors, which became New Zealand's most successful feature film soon after release. It remains Mune's biggest commercial success to date. Mune's other directorial projects include a feature-length documentary on comedian (and Came a Hot Friday actor) Billy T James, teenage drama The Whole of the Moon, and UVF thriller The Grasscutter. For television, he directed episodes of comedy series Letter to Blanchy and anthology series The Ray Bradbury Theater. He was one of a large team of second unit directors on Peter Jackson's adaptation of The Lord of the Rings and played a small cameo in the first film. In 2008 Mune directed depression- era telefeature movie Life's A Riot. Mune also had a cameo role as a judge, after the actor cast in the role did not show up. Mune: An Autobiography was published in 2010.

Found in the western Atlantic Ocean and Indo-Pacific region, the family contains about 26 species in two genera. One species (Pempheris xanthoptera) is the target of subsistence fisheries in Japan, where the fish is much enjoyed for its taste. Sweepers are occasionally kept in marine aquaria.  Description  Deeply keeled, compressed bodies and large eyes typify sweepers, their form somewhat like hatchetfish; both cycloid and ctenoid scales may be present. The small, short dorsal fin begins before the body's midpoint and may have four to seven spines; the anal fin is extensive and usually has three spines. The mouth is subterminal and strongly oblique. Species of the genus Parapriacanthus have much more cylindrical bodies. Some species possess photophores. All but the curved sweeper (Pempheris poeyi) possess a gas bladder. The largest species is the common bullseye (Pempheris multiradiata) at long; most other species measure or less. Colouration is relatively subdued.  Behaviour  Red Sea dwarf sweepers (Parapriacanthus guentheri) Characteristically shallow water, schooling fish (especially as juveniles), sweepers are nocturnal and seek shelter under ledges or in the caves, nooks, and crannies of reefs or eroded, rocky shorelines during the day. They are often found sharing these hiding places with cardinalfishes and bigeyes, also nocturnal species. At night, sweepers forage for zooplankton, their primary food. At least one species, the small-scale bullseye (Pempheris compressa) of Australia, is known to enter coastal estuaries whilst young.

Medieval Hebrew was a literary and liturgical language that existed between the 4th and 19th century. It was not commonly used as a spoken language, but mainly in written form by rabbis, scholars and poets. Medieval Hebrew had many features that distinguished it from older forms of Hebrew. These affected grammar, syntax, sentence structure, and also included a wide variety of new lexical items, which were either based on older forms or borrowed from other languages, especially Aramaic, Greek and Latin.Encarta-encyclopedie Winkler Prins (1993‚Äì2002) s.v. \\"Hebreeuwse taal. ¬ß1. Oud-Hebreeuws en Midden-Hebreeuws\\". Microsoft Corporation/Het Spectrum. History In the Golden age of Jewish culture in the Iberian Peninsula, important work was done by grammarians in explaining the grammar and vocabulary of Biblical Hebrew; much of this was based on the work of the grammarians of Classical Arabic. Important Hebrew grammarians were Judah ben David Hayyuj and Jonah ibn Janah. A great deal of poetry was written, by poets such as Dunash ben Labrat, Solomon ibn Gabirol, Judah Halevi, David Hakohen Abraham ibn Ezra and Moses ibn Ezra, in a \\"purified\\" Hebrew based on the work of these grammarians, and in Arabic quantitative metres (see piyyut). This literary Hebrew was later used by Italian Jewish poets. The need to express scientific and philosophical concepts from Ancient Greek and medieval Arabic motivated Medieval Hebrew to borrow terminology and grammar from these other languages, or to coin equivalent terms from existing Hebrew roots, giving rise to a distinct style of philosophical Hebrew. Many have direct parallels in medieval Arabic. The Ibn Tibbon family, and especially Samuel ibn Tibbon were personally responsible for the creation of much of this form of Hebrew, which they employed in their translations of scientific materials from the Arabic. At that time, original Jewish philosophical and theological works produced in Spain were usually written in Arabic, but as time went on, this form of Hebrew was used for many original compositions as well. Another important influence was Maimonides, who developed a simple style based on Mishnaic Hebrew for use in his law code, the Mishneh Torah. Subsequent rabbinic literature is written in a blend between this style and the Aramaized Rabbinic Hebrew of the Talmud. By late 12th and early 13th centuries the cultural center of Mediterranean Jewry was transferred from an Islamic context to Christian lands. The written Hebrew used in Northern Spain, Provence (a term for all of the South of France) and Italy was increasingly influenced by Latin, particularly in philosophical writings, and also by different vernaculars (Proven√ßal, Italian, etc.). In Italy we witness the flourishing of a new genre, Italian-Hebrew philosophical lexicons. The Italian of these lexicons was generally written in Hebrew characters and are a useful source for the knowledge of Scholastic philosophy among Jews. One of the earliest lexicons was that by Moses b. Shlomo of Salerno, who died in the late 13th. century; it was meant to clarify terms that appear in his commentary on Maimonides' Guide of the Perplexed. Moses of Salerno's glossary was edited by Giuseppe Sermoneta in 1969. There are also glossaries associated with Jewish savants who befriended Pico della Mirandola. Moses of Salerno's commentary on the Guide also contains Italian translations of technical terms, which brings the Guide's Islamic-influenced philosophical system into confrontation with 13th-century Italian scholasticism. Hebrew was also used as a language of communication among Jews from different countries, particularly for the purpose of international trade. Mention should also be made of the letters preserved in the Cairo geniza, which reflect the Arabic-influenced Hebrew of medieval Egyptian Jewry. The Arabic terms and syntax that appear in the letters constitute a significant source for the documentation of spoken medieval Arabic, since Jews in Islamic lands tended to use colloquial Arabic in writing rather than classical Arabic, which is the Arabic that appears in Arabic medieval sources.

Compression algorithm  rzip operates in two stages. The first stage finds and encodes large chunks of duplicated data over potentially very long distances (900 MB) in the input file. The second stage uses a standard compression algorithm (bzip2) to compress the output of the first stage. It is quite common these days to need to compress files that contain long distance redundancies. For example, when compressing a set of home directories several users might have copies of the same file, or of quite similar files. It is also common to have a single file that contains large duplicated chunks over long distances, such as PDF files containing repeated copies of the same image. Most compression programs won't be able to take advantage of this redundancy, and thus might achieve a much lower compression ratio than rzip can achieve. The intermediate interface between the two stages is made of a byte-aligned data stream of which there are two commands, a literal (\\"add\\") with length and data: type:8 = 0 => literal/add range of count bytes count:16 = 1..65535 data:8..‚àû = literal data to be inserted (n whole bytes) and a match (\\"copy\\") with length and offset parameters: type:8 = 1 => match/copy range of count bytes count:16 = 31..65535 offset:32 = offset to position to be copied from Literal or match/copy lengths of greater than 65,535 bytes are split into multiple instructions. End-of-stream is indicated with a zero-length literal/add (type=0,count=0) command and immediately followed by a 32-bit CRC checksum.  Reference implementation  A rolling- checksum algorithm based on the one in rsync is used to locate potential matches from over such a large dataset. As the hash buckets fill up, previous hashes (\\"tags\\") are discarded based on twice. The tags are discarded in such a manner as to provide fairly good coverage, with a gradually decreasing match granularity as the distance increases. This implementation does not search for match lengths of fewer than 31 consecutive bytes.  Advantages  The key difference between rzip and other well known compression algorithms is its ability to take advantage of very long distance redundancy. The well known deflate algorithm used in gzip uses a maximum history buffer of 32 KiB. The Burrows-Wheeler transform block sorting algorithm used in bzip2 is limited to 900 KiB of history. The history buffer in rzip can be up to 900 MiB long, several orders of magnitude larger than gzip or bzip2. Rzip is often much faster than bzip2, despite using the bzip2 library as a back end. This is because rzip feeds bzip2 with shrunken data, so that bzip2 has to do less work. Simple comparisons (although too small for it to be an authoritative benchmark) have been produced.Choosing the Right Zip Code  Disadvantages  rzip is not suited for every purpose. The two biggest disadvantages of rzip are that it cannot be pipelined (so it cannot read from standard input or write to standard output), and that it uses a high amount of memory: a typical compression run on a large file might use hundreds of megabytes of RAM. If there is a lot of RAM to spare and a very high compression ratio is required, rzip should be used, but if these conditions are not satisfied, alternate compression methods such as gzip and bzip2, which are less memory-intensive, should be used instead of rzip. There is at least one patch to enable pipelining.  History  rzip was originally written by Andrew Tridgell as part of his PhD research.  Alternative implementations  = lrzip = lrzip (Long Range ZIP) is an improved version of rzip. Its file format is incompatible with rzip's. It has the following improvements: * LZMA, LZO, DEFLATE, Bzip2, and ZPAQ compression (as opposed to Bzip2 only) * No dictionary limit, not even limited by available RAM * Ability to test data for compressibility before compressing, preventing the computer from wasting time by trying to compress incompressible data * Ability to be pipelined from standard input / standard output (with a loss in compression ratio) * Ability to disable last-stage compression for use with another compressor * Optional AES-128 encryption = rzip64 = rzip64 is an extension of rzip for very large files that can utilize multiple CPU cores in parallel. There are benchmark results. Most important, however, is the ability of rzip64 to be interrupted at any time. Thereby a running compression task (that may easily take several hours for large files) survives even a system maintenance reboot without losing already completed work and can be resumed later. The file format of rzip64 is identical to the original rzip. = REP = REP is an alternative implementation of rzip algorithm by Bulat Ziganshin used in his FreeArc archiver as preprocessor for LZMA/Tornado compression algorithms. In FreeArc, REP finds large-distance matches and then LZMA compress the remaining data. For example, on computer with 2 GB RAM, REP finds matches that is at least 512 bytes long at the distances up to 1 GB, and then LZMA finds any remaining matches at the distances up to 128 MB. So, working together, they provide the best compression possible on 2 GB RAM budget. Being optimized for stream decompression and collaborative work with LZMA, REP has some differences from the original RZIP implementation. First, by default it finds only matches that are 512+ byte long, since benchmarking proved that this is optimal setting for overall REP+LZMA compression. Second, it uses a sliding dictionary that's about 1/2 RAM long, so decompression doesn't need to reread data from decompressed file. REP's advantage is its multiplicative rolling hash that is both quick to compute and has near-ideal distribution. Larger minimal match length (512 bytes compared to 32 bytes in rzip) allowed for additional speed optimizations, so that REP provides very fast compression (about 200 MB/s on Intel i3-2100). = SREP = SREP (SuperREP) is an implementation of Tridgell's idea of LZ compressor that doesn't store its dictionary in RAM, using instead SHA1 hashes of processed blocks to compare their contents. It allows the program to compress files that are about 10x larger than RAM available. Decompression performed either by reading data from decompressed part of file, or by storing in the memory future matches (future- LZ compression algorithm). Of course, future-LZ compression requires 2 passes over input file but decompression needs tiny memory. In one experiment, 22 GB file compressed with minimum match length of 512 bytes and full 22 GB dictionary required just 2 GB of RAM for decompression.

Just One of the Guys is a loose adaptation of William Shakespeare's Twelfth Night. The film ranked number 48 on Entertainment Weekly's list of the \\"50 Best High School Movies\\".50 Best High School Movies from Entertainment Weekly Plot Terri Griffith is an aspiring teenage journalist in Phoenix who feels that her teachers don't take her articles seriously because of her good looks. After failing to get her dream job as a newspaper intern, she comes to the conclusion that it is because she is a girl. With her parents out of town on a two-week Caribbean vacation, Terri decides to remedy the situation. Enrolling at a rival high school, she enlists the help of her little brother, Buddy, and her best friend Denise to disguise herself as a boy. Along the way she meets Rick Morehouse, a nerd who becomes her pet project. After helping him through an image makeover and encouraging him to start talking to girls, Terri starts to fall for him. After many episodes in and out of school, including fending off a group of bullies led by bodybuilder Greg Tolan, dealing with her real college boyfriend Kevin and being set up on a blind date with a potential new girlfriend named Sandy, Terri manages to be accepted as \\"one of the guys\\". At the senior prom, a jealous Greg picks a fight with Rick, who ultimately trounces the bully in front of the entire class. When Terri's boyfriend shows up unexpectedly and discovers the ruse, Rick assumes that Terri's big secret was that she was gay. To prove otherwise, Terri opens her shirt and reveals her breasts to Rick. Although she admits to loving him, Rick rejects her, prompting a desperate Terri to kiss him in front of everyone. To placate the awestruck students, Rick derisively announces that Terri \\"has tits\\" before leaving the prom and Terri behind. Heartbroken and humiliated, Terri retreats to her room and writes a long article on what it is like to be a girl in boys' clothing, detailing all of her experiences, both good and bad. Terri returns to her own school. When her article is printed in the newspaper, she receives high praise and finally earns her dream job at the newspaper. Nevertheless, she still finds herself yearning for Rick, who has not spoken to her since the prom. One day during the summer, Rick suddenly turns up after reading her article. Realizing their true feelings for each other, they reconcile and make plans for another date. They decide to go for a drive in Terri's car, but before Buddy can join them, an attractive blonde on a motorcycle rides up and beckons to him with a smile. Buddy then climbs onto the back of her motorcycle, and both couples happily drive away.

Nietzsche used the phrase to express his idea that the Enlightenment had eliminated the possibility of the existence of God. However, proponents of the strongest form of the Death of God theology have used the phrase in a literal sense, meaning that the Christian God, who had existed at one point, has ceased to exist. Nietzsche's complete statement is, \\"God is dead. God remains dead. And we have killed him. How shall we comfort ourselves, the murderers of all murderers? What was holiest and mightiest of all that the world has yet owned has bled to death under our knives: who will wipe this blood off us? What water is there for us to clean ourselves? What festivals of atonement, what sacred games shall we have to invent? Is not the greatness of this deed too great for us? Must we ourselves not become gods simply to appear worthy of it?\\" The phrase first appeared in Nietzsche's 1882 collection The Gay Science (, also translated as \\"The Joyful Pursuit of Knowledge and Understanding\\").in sections 108 (New Struggles), 125 (The Madman), and for a third time in section 343 (The Meaning of our Cheerfulness). However, it is most famously associated with Nietzsche's Thus Spoke Zarathustra (), which is most responsible for making the phrase popular. Other philosophers had previously discussed the concept, including Philipp Mainl√§nder and Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel. Previous citings Before Nietzsche, the phrase can be found in G√©rard de Nerval's 1854 Poem \\"Le Christ aux oliviers\\" (\\"Christ at the olive trees\\"),http://www.gerard-de-nerval.net/lechristauxoliva.html and claims he was citing a speech from Jean Paul. Victor Hugo wrote in Les Mis√©rables \\"God is perhaps dead\\",https://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Page:Hugo_- _Les_Mis%C3%A9rables_Tome_V_(1890).djvu/119 here apparently citing G√©rard de Nerval himself. Hugo replies that de Nerval \\"confuses progress with God, and takes the interruption of the movement (progress) with the death of the Being.\\" Discussion by Hegel Discourses of a \\"death of God\\" in German culture appear as early as the 17th century and originally referred to Lutheran theories of atonement. The phrase \\"God is dead\\" appears in the hymn \\"Ein Trauriger Grabgesang\\" (\\"A mournful dirge\\") by Johann von Rist. Contemporary historians believe that 19th-century German idealist philosophers, especially those associated with Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, are responsible for removing the specifically Christian resonance of the phrase relating to the death of Jesus Christ and associating it with secular philosophical and sociological theories. Although the statement and its meaning are attributed to Nietzsche, Hegel had discussed the concept of the death of God in his Phenomenology of Spirit, where he considers the death of God to \\"Not be seen as anything but an easily recognized part of the usual Christian cycle of redemption\\". See page 265. Later on Hegel writes about the great pain of knowing that God is dead \\"The pure concept, however, or infinity, as the abyss of nothingness in which all being sinks, must characterize the infinite pain, which previously was only in culture historically and as the feeling on which rests modern religion, the feeling that God Himself is dead, (the feeling which was uttered by Pascal, though only empirically, in his saying: Nature is such that it marks everywhere, both in and outside of man, a lost God), purely as a phase, but also as no more than just a phase, of the highest idea.\\" Hegel's student Richard Rothe, in his 1837 theological text Die Anf√§nge der christlichen Kirche und ihrer Verfassung, appears to be one of the first philosophers to associate the idea of a death of God with the sociological theory of secularization.Josephson- Storm (2017), pp. 75‚Äì6. German philosopher Max Stirner writes in 1844 about the death of God and about the killing of God by humans during the Enlightenment in his book The Ego and its Own.\\"At the entrance of the modern time stands the ‚ÄòGod-man‚Äô. At its exit will only the God in the God-man evaporate? And can the God-man really die if only the God in him dies? They did not think of this question, and thought they were finished when in our days they brought to a victorious end the work of the Enlightenment, the vanquishing of God: they did not notice that man has killed God in order to become now - ‚Äòsole God on high‚Äô. The other world outside us is indeed brushed away, and the great undertaking of the men of the Enlightenment completed; but the other world in us has become a new heaven and calls us forth to renewed heaven-storming: God has had to give place, yet not to us, but to - man. How can you believe that the God-man is dead before the man in him, besides the God, is dead?\\" Max Stirner: The Ego and its Own - Introduction of part II In philosophic literature there is a discussion of the possible influence of Max Stirner on Nietzsche. Role in the philosophy of Philipp Mainl√§nder Before Nietzsche, the concept was popularized in philosophy by the German philosopher Philipp Mainl√§nder. It was while reading Mainl√§nder, that Nietzsche explicitly writes to have parted ways with Schopenhauer. In Mainl√§nder's more than 200 pages long criticism of Schopenhauer's metaphysics, he argues against one cosmic unity behind the world, and champions a real multiplicity of wills struggling with each other for existence. Yet, the interconnection and the unitary movement of the world, which are the reasons that lead philosophers to pantheism, are undeniable. They do indeed lead to a unity, but this may not be at the expense of a unity in the world that undermines the empirical reality of the world. It is therefore declared to be dead. Nietzsche's formulation The idea is stated in \\"The Madman\\" as follows: But the best known passage is at the end of part 2 of Zarathustra's Prolog, where after beginning his allegorical journey Zarathustra encounters an aged ascetic who expresses misanthropy and love of God: Explanation Nietzsche used the phrase to sum up the effect and consequence that the Age of Enlightenment had on the centrality of the concept of God within Western European civilization, which had been essentially Christian in character since the later Roman Empire. The Enlightenment had brought about the triumph of scientific rationality over sacred revelation; the rise of philosophical materialism and Naturalism that to all intents and purposes had dispensed with the belief in or role of God in human affairs and the destiny of the world. Nietzsche recognized the crisis that this \\"Death of God\\" represented for existing moral assumptions in Europe as they existed within the context of traditional Christian belief. \\"When one gives up the Christian faith, one pulls the right to Christian morality out from under one's feet. This morality is by no means self-evident ... By breaking one main concept out of Christianity, the faith in God, one breaks the whole: nothing necessary remains in one's hands.\\"trans. Walter Kaufmann and R.J. Hollingdale; Twilight of the Idols, Expeditions of an Untimely Man, sect. 5 This is why in \\"The Madman\\", a passage which primarily addresses nontheists (especially atheists), the problem is to retain any system of values in the absence of a divine order. The Enlightenment's conclusion of the \\"Death of God\\" gave rise to the proposition that humans ‚Äì and Western Civilization as a whole - could no longer believe in a divinely ordained moral order. This death of God will lead, Nietzsche said, not only to the rejection of a belief of cosmic or physical order but also to a rejection of absolute values themselves ‚Äî to the rejection of belief in an objective and universal moral law, binding upon all individuals. In this manner, the loss of an absolute basis for morality leads to nihilism. This nihilism is that for which Nietzsche worked to find a solution by re-evaluating the foundations of human values. Nietzsche believed that the majority of people did not recognize this death out of the deepest-seated fear or angst. Therefore, when the death did begin to become widely acknowledged, people would despair and nihilism would become rampant. Although Nietzsche puts the statement \\"God is dead\\" into the mouth of a \\"madman\\"Read the whole section here from Thomas Common's translation The Madman Section 125 in The Gay Science, he also uses the phrase in his own voice in sections 108 and 343 of the same book. In the madman passage, the man is described as running through a marketplace shouting, \\"I seek God! I seek God!\\" He arouses some amusement; no one takes him seriously. Maybe he took an ocean voyage? Lost his way like a little child? Maybe he's afraid of us (non-believers) and is hiding? ‚Äî much laughter. Frustrated, the madman smashes his lantern on the ground, crying out that \\"God is dead, and we have killed him, you and I!\\" \\"But I have come too soon,\\" he immediately realizes, as his detractors of a minute before stare in astonishment: people cannot yet see that they have killed God. He goes on to say: Earlier in the book (section 108), Nietzsche wrote: \\"God is dead, but given the way of men, there may still be caves for thousands of years in which his shadow will be shown. And we ‚Äî we still have to vanquish his shadow, too.\\" The protagonist in Thus Spoke Zarathustra also speaks the words, commenting to himself after visiting a hermit who, every day, sings songs and lives to glorify his god as noted above. What is more, Zarathustra later not only refers to the death of God but states: \\"Dead are all the Gods.\\" It is not just one morality that has died, but all of them, to be replaced by the life of the , the super man: Nietzsche believed there could be positive new possibilities for humans without God. Relinquishing the belief in God opens the way for human creative abilities to fully develop. The Christian God, he wrote, would no longer stand in the way, so human beings might stop turning their eyes toward a supernatural realm and begin to acknowledge the value of this world. Nietzsche uses the metaphor of an open sea, which can be both exhilarating and terrifying. The people who eventually learn to create their lives anew will represent a new stage in human existence, the ‚Äî i.e., the personal archetype who, through the conquest of their own nihilism, themselves become a sort of mythical hero. The \\"death of God\\" is the motivation for Nietzsche's last (uncompleted) philosophical project, the \\"revaluation of all values\\". Martin Heidegger understood this aspect of Nietzsche's philosophy by looking at it as the death of metaphysics. In his view, Nietzsche's words can only be understood as referring not to a particular theological or anthropological view but rather to the end of philosophy itself. Philosophy has, in Heidegger's words, reached its maximum potential as metaphysics and Nietzsche's words warn of its demise and the end of any metaphysical worldview. If metaphysics is dead, Heidegger warns, that is because from its inception that was its fate.Wolfgan Muller-Lauter, , Walter de Gruyter 2000  Tillich, Altizer, and the Death of God theological movement in the 1960s  Although theologians since Nietzsche had occasionally used the phrase \\"God is dead\\" to reflect increasing unbelief in God, the concept rose to prominence in the late 1950s and 1960s, subsiding in the early 1970s.Gundry, S.N. \\"Death of God Theology\\" in Evangelical Dictionary of Theology, ed. Walter A. Elwell, Grand Rapids: Baker (2001), p. 327. The German-born theologian Paul Tillich, for instance, was influenced by the writings of Nietzsche, especially his phrase \\"God is dead.\\" The October 22, 1965, issue of Time magazine contained an article in the \\"Religion\\" section, entitled \\"Theology: The God Is Dead Movement,\\" that addressed a movement among American theologians who openly embraced the notion of the death of God. Then six months later the controversial Easter issue of Time appeared on April 8, 1966, shocking the public with the provocative question‚Äîin huge red type against a black background‚Äî\\"Is God Dead?\\" The main proponents of this theology in the mid- to late 1960s included Christian theologians John Robinson, Thomas J. J. Altizer, William Hamilton, Gabriel Vahanian, Paul van Buren, and the Jewish theologian and rabbi Richard L. Rubenstein. William Hamilton wrote the following about American radical theologian Thomas J. J.

It is effectively the horizontal equivalent to the utility cat command which operates on the vertical plane of two or more files. History The version of \`paste\` bundled in GNU coreutils was written by David M. Ihnat and David MacKenzie.https://linux.die.net/man/1/paste Usage The utility is invoked with the following syntax: paste [options] [file1 ..] Description Once invoked, will read all its ' arguments. For each corresponding line, will append the contents of each file at that line to its output along with a tab. When it has completed its operation for the last file, will output a newline character and move on to the next line. exits after all streams return end of file. The number of lines in the output stream will equal the number of lines in the input file with the largest number of lines. Missing values are represented by empty strings. Though potentially useful, an option to have paste emit an alternate string for a missing field (such as \\"NA\\") is not standard. A sequence of empty records at the bottom of a column of the output stream may or may not have been present in the input file corresponding to that column as explicit empty records, unless you know the input file supplied all rows explicitly (e.g. in the canonical case where all input files all do indeed have the same number of lines).

Founded by Dallas Taylor and Luke Morton on November 30, 1997, in Ocala, Florida; subsequently its additional members were from Tampa. They released Act of Depression, Cries of the Past, and The Changing of Times with the band's original vocalist Dallas Taylor. Following his departure, Spencer Chamberlain became lead vocalist. The band then released They're Only Chasing Safety and Define the Great Line, gaining a certified gold rating for both. These two albums have given them more mainstream and commercial success. They have received three Grammy nominations in 2007, 2010 and 2019 respectively and have recorded a live CD/DVD box set entitled Survive, Kaleidoscope, which was released on May 27, 2008. From late February to early May, the band recorded their sixth studio album entitled Lost in the Sound of Separation, which was released on September 2, 2008, and peaked at number 8 on the Billboard 200. Their seventh album, √ò (Disambiguation), was released on November 9, 2010. It was, to date, the only Underoath release without the band's last original member, drummer and vocalist Aaron Gillespie, who had parted ways with the band earlier in the year.Aaron Gillespie Leaves Underoath Ultimate Guitar On October 2, 2012, Underoath announced that they would be disbanding in 2013. However, they announced their reunion on August 17, 2015. On February 22, 2018, Underoath announced their eighth studio album, Erase Me, would be released on April 6, 2018; their first album in 8 years and their first in 10 years with founding drummer Aaron Gillespie. The first single was \\"On My Teeth.\\"  History  = Formation and Act of Depression (1997‚Äì2000) = On November 30, 1997, Underoath formed with Dallas Taylor, and guitarist Luke Morton, in Ocala, Florida. Morton devised the name Underoath \\"from somewhere in the Bible.\\" Drummer Aaron Gillespie, who attended Morton's church, was then asked to play with them. Gillespie agreed, and the group recruited guitarist Corey Steger and bassist Octavio Fernandez; the band members were all in high school. After a year of playing at festivals and touring the area around Florida, Underoath signed to Alabama's Takehold Records in 1999. Around this time Luke Morton had left the band without appearing on any of their formal recordings. They released their debut Act of Depression, which sold over 2,000 copies. = Cries of the Past and The Changing of Times (2000‚Äì2003) = In 2000, keyboardist Christopher Dudley joined Underoath, and the five-song, forty-minute long record, Cries of the Past was released, quickly selling 3,000 copies. In 2001, Takehold Records was bought out by Seattle's Tooth & Nail Records and Underoath was subsequently signed to the label's subsidiary, Solid State Records. In January 2002, bassist Grant Brandell joined Underoath. The band then began working on their Solid State debut, The Changing of Times, with Cries of the Past producer James Paul Wisner. The album was released on February 26, 2002, and produced one single titled \\"When the Sun Sleeps\\". Dallas Taylor explained that the lyrics on The Changing of Times were about \\"people playing with other people's emotions and how it can leave you bitter\\" and \\"struggling through life's hardships and trying to find God in all of it.\\" The band was criticized by critics and long-time fans for the album's style because it had changed from the sound of their previous releases. However, The Changing of Times went on to outsell both of their earlier releases combined. In 2003, Underoath supported the album's release with their first inclusion on Warped Tour, however their participation in the tour came to an end when Taylor (under controversial conditions) was asked to leave the band. Keyboardist, Chris Dudley explained at that time that Taylor could no longer tour with Underoath for various reasons and left on his own decision. Under speculation of a potential break up, the band then went on a supporting tour with Atreyu in August 2003 with Matt Tarpey as the temporary lead vocalist, while at the time being a part of Winter Solstice. In October 2003, at the CMJ Fest in New York City, the band reappeared with Spencer Chamberlain, formerly of the band This Runs Through, as the new lead vocalist. Chamberlain had toured with Underoath when fronting his former band and at one time was roommates with Dudley; their previous friendship with Chamberlain was considered when making him lead vocalist. Gillespie explained that before Chamberlain had been in the band, the group members \\"didn't really get along\\", however, after Chamberlain joined \\"everything was just normal, we clicked\\". After Chamberlain became a permanent member, Underoath discussed the possibility of changing the name and becoming a new band. Ultimately, the members decided to remain as Underoath. = They're Only Chasing Safety (2004‚Äì2005) = After taking the end of 2003 off from touring to begin working on an album, the band scheduled time in February 2004 to begin recording. During the early months of 2004, Underoath returned to the studio with Chamberlain as lead vocalist and producer James Paul Wisner. They're Only Chasing Safety was released on June 15, 2004, and proved to be a more commercial success for the band, going onto outsell the previous three albums combined. The album sold close to 100,000 copies in its first week of release and was certified gold by the end of 2005, selling more than 487,000 copies. With Gillespie being the only original member, They're Only Chasing Safety had been a vast change in sound and rhythm from what they performed earlier on. \\"Reinventing Your Exit\\" and \\"It's Dangerous Business Walking out Your Front Door\\" were released as the album's two singles and both songs spawned music videos that received frequent airplay on MTV2 and Fuse. In March 2005, Underoath participated in the inaugural Taste of Chaos tour, and shortly after, embarked on their first headlining tour. The band premiered two brand- new songs during the length of the tour. They played a part of the Warped Tour, but declined to perform for the entirety of the tour in order to take time to record another album.

Matt Goldman, who produced albums for Copeland and Norma Jean, and Adam Dutkiewicz, guitarist for Killswitch Engage, enlisted as producers. Chamberlain noted that the vocals for the album would sound less like an imitation of former vocalist Taylor, but more like the vocals of Chamberlain's former band. The lyrics were also meaningful to Chamberlain because they had been written about \\"things that have molded him into who he is today\\". An unfinished version of the album was leaked onto BitTorrent websites and P2P services months before the release date. Drummer Aaron Gillespie, during the short time after the recording of Define the Great Line, recorded the debut album for his side-project The Almost, which was produced by Seattle producer Aaron Sprinkle and was released April 3, 2007. In April 2006, the band had been courted by several major record labels, instead re-signing with Tooth & Nail Records because they felt that major labels \\"don't get heavy bands\\" and \\"we don't really agree with a lot of the business practices major labels employ sometimes.\\" On April 21, Underoath flew to Sweden to work with Popcore Films, to create music videos for \\"In Regards to Myself\\" and \\"Writing on the Walls\\"; the latter was chosen as the lead single for the album and was later nominated for the 2007 Grammy Award for Best Short Form Music Video. Dudley commented that the videos were \\"high-energy videos and more intricate than any video we've ever done.\\" Released on June 20, 2006, Define the Great Line sold 98,000 copies in its first week and debuted on the Billboard 200 Chart at number 2, the highest debut for a Christian album since 1997. With the debut of Define the Great Line, Underoath simultaneously released a special edition version of the album featuring special artwork and a DVD that includes another behind-the-scenes movie and a \\"making of\\" video. Define the Great Line was certified Gold by the RIAA on November 11, 2006, representing 500,000 shipped units of the album.

A statement from the band stated that the members \\"felt it necessary to take some immediate time to focus on our friendship, as that's more important than risking it for the sake of touring at this time.\\" In an Alternative Press cover story on Underoath, Michael \\"Fat Mike\\" Burkett told the magazine that Chamberlain had confided in him that Underoath's band members had been \\"having a lot of arguments over their religious beliefs.\\" Burkett admitted to Punknews.org that he had poked fun at the band for their beliefs, but emphasized that he befriended Underoath's band members at the start of the tour and had a personal policy of not making jokes on-stage about anyone he was not friends with or did not like personally. It was also spread that the band's withdrawal from the tour was due to Chamberlain's rumored drug problems and time spent in rehabilitation, to which Gillespie responded, \\"If there was something serious going on like that and he was in rehab, we'd have to tell the press. But it's just not true.\\" Underoath toured extensively throughout Europe, Australia and Asia in the late 2006, from February to April in 2007 toured with Taking Back Sunday and Armor for Sleep. Underoath shot videos for the songs \\"You're Ever So Inviting\\" and \\"A Moment Suspended in Time\\" in February 2007; both videos have been released and \\"You're Ever So Inviting\\" won MTV's Battle of the Videos on May 23, 2007.

Musical style and influences  = Christianity = Underoath's members have identified as Christian in their earlier years and have stated that they are a Christian band. However, as vocalist Spencer Chamberlain explains, \\"[We are Christian but] in a different way. We're not like your average Christian band.\\" He explains that Christianity is the \\"backbone of our lives, especially in the way that we handle certain things, but it's not so much the backbone of our lyrics. It's not like every song is a lesson from the Bible or something. It's just normal life struggles.\\" Keyboardist Christopher Dudley stated that a majority of Underoath's audience is not Christian, nor are the bands with whom they would often tour. Though the band has been noted for \\"setting precedent in both Christian rock and beyond\\", only a portion of their albums are sold in the Christian marketplace. Chamberlain said, \\"I look at us as just another band in the secular market like with all these other hardcore bands and we just happen to be a Christian band that has different beliefs.\\" However, in an interview with Alternative Press, Drummer Aaron Gillespie stated that \\"I'm definitely a Christian, but I don't think Underoath should be a 'Christian band'\\" Upon releasing their comeback single, \\"On My Teeth\\", from Erase Me, the band's first song to feature profanity in their entire career, the band updated their Spotify profile to read \\"The band who once openly‚Äîand without apology‚Äîprofessed their faith-based worldview onstage nightly, have since moved beyond the realm of seemingly impenetrable polemics. At various junctures, Erase Me illustrates those moments of sanctuary, anxiety, betrayal and conflict that inevitably arise when humanity grapples with belief systems.\\" The band has since openly distanced themselves from Christianity and organized religion. In a 2018 interview, Spencer Chamberlain stated that, \\"my journey and my role in playing in a Christian band, I held a huge burden and I got burnt really bad and was treated awfully. I'm not saying religion is wrong for everyone, but for me it was wrong. It ruined my life, turned me into a drug addict and people were awful to me the whole time. I never felt more alone in my life than when I was Christian.\\" = Genre = Underoath have been labeled as metalcore, hardcore, post-hardcore, emo, screamo, The band's style has changed over the years, as explained by AllMusic: \\"since their inception, Florida's Underoath have evolved from a run-of-the-mill Christian metalcore band into a fluid, dynamic, and energized rock group that adeptly blends emotive melody, charged punk rock rhythms, and a chunky, engaging bottom end.\\" and Christian metal. Jesus Freak Hideout also took notice of this, mentioning in a review that \\"Underoath's sound has evolved a lot - from metal to emocore to straight-up hardcore.\\" As demonstrated on their first release, Act of Depression, Underoath initially played a combination of hardcore and metalcore mixed with black metal and death metal. The band kept a similar sound on their second album, Cries of the Past, featuring occasional traces of black metal, but the band later moved away from this style to embrace a more melodic- leaning post-hardcore sound. On the follow up release, Underoath stood \\"at the heavy metal crossroads on The Changing of Times, a hardcore album that parallels classic arena rock.\\" The band experimented with electronic elements, with Casey Boland of Alternative Press noting that the album \\"was an Olympic pole vault-like leap forward for Underoath,\\" and that the band was \\"welcoming the process of evolution.\\" He also noted the addition of Aaron Gillespie's clean singing, which offered \\"a compelling counterpoint and presaged a swarm of bands adopting the sing-scream dichotomy that would become the hallmark of 'screamo.'\\" Cross Rhythms noted the growing popularity of the band, and described them as playing \\"an interesting mix of hardcore and indie rock, utilising loops, keyboards, acoustic guitars and melodic vocal harmonies, amongst the onslaught of heavy guitars and screeching hardcore vocals.\\" Underoath underwent an extreme overhaul preceding their fourth release, They're Only Chasing Safety, with Dallas Taylor and Octavio Fernandez leaving the band and Spencer Chamberlain taking over lead vocal duties. This marked a radical shift for Underoath, \\"as the band ditched its formerly metal leanings for the decidedly friendly confines of screamo,\\" a change with ignited a debate over which was better, \\"old\\" or \\"new\\" Underoath. A review by Alex Henderson of AllMusic classifies the album under an alternative rock style which could be described as screamo, post-hardcore, or melodic hardcore, and which differed from full-out metalcore. In another review, Andrew Segal of Cross Rhythms described the album as nu metal, and said that, while on the heavier side of the rock scale, the album is well produced and \\"shows more signs of intelligence than the [nu-metal] genre is often credited with.\\" For their fifth album, Define the Great Line, Underoath abandoned the pop choruses of the previous album and instead demonstrated a heavier and more eclectic style, updating their sound with \\"weird\\" time changes and ambient post-metal passages. According to Sputnikmusic, while the album is basically a modern metalcore recording, it incorporated other influences including post-metal guitar leads on several tracks and ambient electronica on tracks such as \\"Salmarnir.\\" AllMusic stated that the band found the \\"delicate middle ground between throat-shredding grindcore and My Chemical Romance/From Autumn to Ashes-style emo-punk,\\" and Cross Rhythms described the album as \\"an impressively versatile project where metal riffs and emo breakdowns, screamo noise and memorable hooks collide in a veritable sonic feast.\\" Underoath's sixth album, Lost in the Sound of Separation, established Spencer Chamberlain as the front-man, and saw the band incorporating some industrial elements. With the departure of the last original member of Underoath, Aaron Gillespie, the band underwent their \\"biggest shift in sound for the band in a long time.\\" On their release, √ò (Disambiguation), Underoath featured a darker and more immersive approach than their previous albums, and used a heavy atmospheric and ambient sound and also utilized groove sections on some tracks. Then on their comeback album, Erase Me, the band presented a more radio rock sound while also sticking with the band's post-hardcore sound with the return of original member Aaron Gillespie on drums taking over clean vocals for the first time since his departure from the band however does share cleans with front man Spencer Chamberlain throughout the record. = Influences = Bassist Grant Brandell has explained that Underoath's music has been influenced by various bands such as Refused, At the Drive-In, Jimmy Eat World, Radiohead and Isis. When Taylor left Underoath following the release of The Changing of Times, an album that somewhat foreshadowed the changes to come for the band, the group's style took a considerable change as new vocalist Chamberlain joined. With Chamberlain, the writing dynamic change in the band ‚Äì now Gillespie and Chamberlain wrote the lyrics they sang ‚Äì and Underoath released They're Only Chasing Safety. Then Define the Great Line was released in which Chamberlain noted that his vocals sounded less like himself imitating Taylor's vocals, and more similar to the vocals of his previous band, This Runs Through. Alternative Press stated, \\"[Chamberlain's] bellow [is] more carnal and guttural, [and] his high end more tuneful than whiny.\\"  Band members  Current members * Aaron Gillespie ‚Äì drums, clean vocals (1997-2010, 2015-present) * Christopher Dudley ‚Äì keyboards, synthesizers, samplers, programming (2000-2013, 2015-present) * Timothy McTague ‚Äì lead guitar, backing vocals (2001-2013, 2015-present) * Grant Brandell ‚Äì bass guitar (2002-2013, 2015-present) * Spencer Chamberlain ‚Äì lead vocals, additional guitars (2003-2013, 2015-present) * James Smith ‚Äì rhythm and lead guitar (2003-2013, 2015-present)  Discography  ; Studio albums * Act of Depression (1999) * Cries of the Past (2000) * The Changing of Times (2002) * They're Only Chasing Safety (2004) * Define the Great Line (2006) * Lost in the Sound of Separation (2008) * √ò (Disambiguation) (2010) * Erase Me (2018)  References  Category:1997 establishments in Florida Category:2013 disestablishments in Florida Category:American Christian metal musical groups Category:Christian hardcore musical groups Category:American metalcore musical groups Category:American post-hardcore musical groups Category:American screamo musical groups Category:Christian rock groups from Florida Category:Heavy metal musical groups from Florida Category:Musical groups disestablished in 2013 Category:Musical groups established in 1997 Category:Musical groups from Tampa, Florida Category:Ocala, Florida Category:Solid State Records artists Category:Tooth & Nail Records artists Category:Musical groups reestablished in 2015 ","title":"Underoath"},{"id":"897497","text":"The 14th Dalai Lama with Tseten Samdup Chhoekyapa and 2 of the Bogside Artists in Maribor Slovenia at the unveiling of their mural painting in May 2012 The Bogside Artists are a trio of mural painters from Derry, Northern Ireland, consisting of brothers Tom and William Kelly, and Kevin Hasson (b. 8 January 1958). Their most famous work, a series of outdoor murals called the People's Gallery, is located in the Bogside neighbourhood of Derry and depicts the events surrounding sectarian violence and civil rights protests in Northern Ireland during the Troubles. Career The Bogside Artists first began working together in 1993 to document the events surrounding the Northern Ireland Troubles. With supplies donated from local residents, they painted several murals on the walls of Rossville Street buildings commemorating the Battle of Bogside and Bloody Sunday. From 1994 to 2008, they painted a total of twelve murals on this street in the Bogside, which they named The People's Gallery. The People's Gallery spans the entire length of Rossville Street, which runs through the centre of the Bogside. It is a unique visual display ‚Äì an entire street devoted to the history in art form of over three decades of political conflict in the province as it affected the city and it occupies no less than four pages in the Lonely Planet (2012). The gallery has never been promoted either by the local council or by any other body including the tour bodies or arts bodies many of which are run by Sinn F√©in. It was in the Bogside on 30 January 1972 that 13 civilians were killed by British Army paratroopers in the Bloody Sunday disturbances (an additional civilian died later). The murals were officially inaugurated in August 2007 and an additional mural dedicated to Nobel Peace Prize Laureate and retired leader of the Social Democratic and Labour Party, John Hume was completed in 2008. The Bogside Artists have exhibited their work widely in various cities, including Boston, Sydney, Brisbane, Chicago, London and Washington, D.C. They have painted a number of other works, most notably a mural of Martin Luther King Jr. in Washington D.C. In September 2011 they painted a mural for the town of Vordernberg Austria on the controversial theme of the New World Order. More recently they completed a mural for Europe's City of Culture Maribor, Slovenia that was unveiled by the Dalai Lama. They see their work as humanitarian and human as \\"men speaking to men\\" ( Tom Kelly, spokesman) and have little time or interest in contemporary art. \\"All real art is contemporary as it has its origins in the truthful state of mind which is timeless\\". On their website you will find their manifesto. In addition to their work as muralists, the Bogside Artists also conducted numerous art workshops throughout the years with local Catholic and Protestant children to promote cross-community understanding.

Their hard rock sound ‚Äì often described as desert rock ‚Äì contains elements of psychedelia, blues, heavy metal, punk rock, acid rock, alternative rock, and other genres. It often features distinctive repetitive drum beats, a propensity for free-form jamming, and \\"trance-like\\" or \\"sludgy\\" grooves. The involved musicians often play in multiple bands simultaneously, and there is a high rate of collaboration between bands. The Palm Desert Scene is also notable for fostering stoner rock pioneers Kyuss. The term \\"stoner rock\\" is sometimes used interchangeably with the term \\"desert rock\\". However, not all Palm Desert scene bands are \\"stoner rock\\" and not all stoner rock bands sound exactly like those in Palm Desert. Palm Desert has been named by Blender magazine as \\"one of the top seven rock n' roll cities in America\\". History The scene evolved from various Palm Desert bands' (especially Yawning Man's) marijuana-driven instrumental jam sessions in the desert. It is largely known for its heavy, grinding riffs and association with the use of illicit substances, particularly marijuana, peyote, LSD, and magic mushrooms. These jam sessions inevitably contained some psychedelic rock influences. Possibly because of the scene's proximity to Mexico and Spanish speaking communities, there is a significant influence of Latin music on Palm Desert rock which is very evident with the El Miradors. Due in part to their roots as smalltime bar bands, many of the Palm Desert bands have strong blues elements in their music as well. Palm Desert bands built a large local following by frequently performing at bars and parties in and around the isolated towns of Southern California's desert areas. The band Kyuss, specifically, performed shows at desert parties known as \\"generator parties\\". These shows consisted of small crowds of people partying in the desert, beer drinking, drugs, and the use of gasoline-powered generators to provide electricity for the musical equipment. Kyuss and Queens of the Stone Age member Josh Homme commented that playing in the desert \\"was the shaping factor for [Kyuss]\\", noting that \\"there's no clubs here, so you can only play for free. If people don't like you, they'll tell you. You can't suck.\\" The Palm Desert Scene gets well featured and rave reviews in the local annual world- famous Coachella Music Fest in nearby Indio. The Desert Sessions One project within this scene are the Desert Sessions, in which Josh Homme invites a group of musicians, most of whom are from the Palm Desert scene, to Rancho De La Luna, a studio in the desert, where they write, rehearse and record some 10 songs in one week's time. The songs are recorded and then never played again by the same lineup, though a number of Desert Sessions songs have later been covered on albums by Queens Of The Stone Age and become part of the QOTSA live repertoire. The Desert Sessions series has now yielded 12 volumes, which have been released in pairs on CD but individually in 10\\" vinyl EP format. Though the series is commonly associated with the Palm Desert Scene, not all artists in the scene have participated, and there have been other artists to contribute to the project who are clearly not from the scene, such as John McBain of Red Bank, New Jersey's Monster Magnet, Dean Ween of Pennsylvania's Ween and England's PJ Harvey.

He partnered with his brother Al and mining engineer Richard Gird in a handshake deal that produced millions of dollars in wealth for all three men. During the course of Tombstone's mining history, about US $85,000,000 in silver was produced from its mines.  Early life  Ed Schieffelin's family tree Ed Schieffelin was born in a coal-mining region of Wellsboro, Pennsylvania, the son of a prominent New York and Pennsylvania family, in 1847. His great-grandfather Jacob Schieffelin, Sr., born in 1757, joined the Loyalist army and served as Henry Hamilton's secretary during the Revolutionary War. Schieffelin was captured in 1779 and held prisoner in Williamsburg, Virginia. He escaped to Canada, where in 1780 he was appointed a lieutenant in the Queen's Rangers by Henry Clinton. He spent time in Montreal and Detroit, before returning to New York, where in 1794 he founded a drug company with his brother Lawrence. This firm still exists as a liquor import house, Schieffelin & Somerset. In January 1849, Jacob, Jr. traveled to California with his sons Alfred and Edward Girard on the ship Morrison. They arrived in September, but almost immediately booked passage home via Panama in November. Jacob Schieffelin, Jr. traveled overland and joined his brother and Ed. Schieffelin's father Clinton Emanuel Del Pela Schieffelin settled in the Rogue Valley, Oregon Territory, in the mid-1850s to raise cattle, grain and children. The family maintained an interest in the mining activities in the area.  Hunt for gold and silver  At age 17, Schieffelin set out on his own as a prospector and miner. He began looking for gold and silver in about 1865. From Oregon, he went east to Coeur d'Alene, then searched across Nevada into Death Valley, back into Colorado and then New Mexico. In 1876, David P. Lansing of Phoenix, Arizona, described Schieffelin as \\"about the strangest specimen of human flesh I ever saw. He was tall and had black hair that hung several inches below his shoulder and a beard that had not been trimmed or combed for so long a time that it was a mass of unkempt knots and mats. He wore clothing pieced and patched from deerskins, corduroy and flannel, and his hat was originally a slouch hat that had been pieced with rabbit skin until very little of the original felt remained.\\" A year later as a 30-year-old, Schieffelin moved to California to find gold. He surveyed the Grand Canyon area as well. Unsuccessful, he heard that a group of Hualapai Indians had enlisted as scouts for the U.S. Army, which was establishing a camp to counter the Chiricahua Apache threat and to secure the nearby border with Mexico. The Army established Camp Huachuca at the foot of the Huachuca Mountains in Pima County, Arizona Territory on March 3, 1877. Silver had already been discovered in some northern areas of Arizona Territory, but the southern portion had been under continued Apache attack. Schieffelin accompanied the scouts on a few trips into the back country while prospecting part-time. He finally decided to stay put and explore the hills east full-time. The hills east of the San Pedro River where he prospected could be dangerous. They were only about from the hostile Chiricahua Apache Indians led by Cochise, Geronimo and Victorio that had established a stronghold in the Dragoon Mountains. = Ore discovery = Ed Schieffelin in 1880 Bisbee with specks of silver on the surface. Frederick Brunckow, a Prussian-born mining engineer, discovered silver in the hills of Cochise County in 1858. He built a cabin near the San Pedro River after finding a small silver deposit nearby. He hired three other white men and about a dozen Mexican miners. In September 1860, two of the white men were robbed and murdered at the cabin and Brunchow was found dead in the mine with a rock drill through him. The German cook blamed the Mexican workers for the murders. After Brunckow's death, ongoing conflict with native Indians prevented further development of the mines for several years. Brunckow's San Pedro mine influenced Ed Schieffelin to prospect the rocky outcropping northeast of the cabin. In 1876, Schieffelin and his party were attacked by Apaches, and a man named Lenox was killed. The cabin was the site of 22 murders during the frontier days. When friend and fellow army scout Al Sieber learned what Schieffelin was up to, he is quoted as telling him, \\"The only rock you will find out there will be your own tombstone\\". Another account reported Schieffelin's friends told him, \\"Better take your coffin with you; you will find your tombstone there, and nothing else.\\" In 1877, Schieffelin used Brunckow's cabin as a base of operations to survey the country. After many months, Ed was working the hills east of the San Pedro River when he found pieces of silver ore in a dry wash on a high plateau called Goose Flats. It took him several more months to find the source. When he located the vein, he estimated the vein to be long and wide. Schieffelin's claim was sited near Lenox's grave site, and when he filed his first mining claim on September 21, 1877, he fittingly named his stake \\"Tombstone\\".Horn p. 26, 27 Flat broke, Schieffelin persuaded William Griffith to pay for the legal paperwork required to file a mining claim on September 3, 1877. Tucson did not have an assay office, and when they showed the sample ore to some local men, they thought it was worthless. With only 30 cents in his pocket, Schieffelin set out to find his brother Al, whom he had not seen in four years. He believed Al was working the Silver King mine, about to the north in central Arizona Territory near present-day Globe. But Schieffelin learned that Al had moved on to the McCracken Mine in Signal City, Arizona, another north. Schieffelin spent his 30 cents on tobacco and had to pause in his search for his brother to earn enough money to go on. He found a job as a hoist operator at the Champion silver mine, and for fourteen days hauled up a dozen tons of ore every night by cranking a hand windlass. = Partnership formed = Ed Schieffelin with his pick and canteen Schieffelin's Mine as it looks today Inside Schiefflin's Mine When Ed finally located his brother in February 1878, Al asked the foreman at the McCracken mine to look at brother Ed's ore specimens. The foreman thought the samples were mostly lead. Unconvinced, Schieffelin showed the samples to 20 or 30 others who had some expertise, and they all thought the ore worthless. Frustrated, Schieffelin threw his ore specimens out his brother's cabin door, as far as he could throw, but at the last minute held on to three of them. For the next four weeks he worked in the McCracken Mine, wielding a pick and shovel. Ed learned about the McCracken Mine's recently arrived assayer, Richard Gird, who had a reputation as an expert. Taking his last three ore samples, Ed Schieffelin asked Gird if he thought they were worth assaying. Gird took a look and said he'd get back to Ed. Three days later, Al shook Ed out of his bunk and said Gird wanted to see him now. When they met, Gird told Ed that he valued the best of the ore samples at $2,000 a ton. Ed, Al Schieffelin and Richard Gird formed a partnership on the spot. Gird offered his expertise, connections, and a grubstake. They shook hands on their three-way deal, a gentlemen's agreement that was never put down on paper but that resulted in millions of dollars of wealth for all three men. When Richard resigned, his employer offered to make him general superintendent of the mine, but he refused. Gird bought a second-hand blue spring wagon and loaded it with supplies, his assay equipment, and also bought a second mule that with Ed's mule could haul the wagon. Gird wanted time to wind up his affairs and to wait for spring and better weather, but Ed insisted they depart immediately. Al hesitated to leave his well-paid, $4.00 a day job as a miner. Ed and Gird didn't wait for him, but left that day. Al reconsidered and joined them that night. Reaching Arizona Territory, and despite reports of continued Apache raids and the murder of miners and ranchers in the area, the three men returned to Cochise County and set up camp at the Brunckow cabin. The deaths of several locals at the hands of the Apache Indians were testified to by the fresh graves near the cabin. The \\"Old South Shaft Ore Quarry, Face of Tough- nut Mine, part of Town of Tombstone, Arizona. Dragoon Mountains, with Cochise Stronghold in background,\\" mammoth plate, by the American photographer Carleton E. Watkins, 1880 The three partners formed the Tombstone Gold and Silver Mining Company to hold title to their claims. Gird built a crude assay furnace in the cabin's fireplace. He found that Schieffelin's initial find of silver ore was valuable, but within a few weeks of mining the vein, Ed discovered it ended in a pinch about three feet deep. His brother Al and Gird were despondent but Ed was optimistic he could find more ore deposits. He continued his search for many more weeks until one day Al found Ed joyously exclaiming over another sample of float ore he had found. Indifferently, Al told Ed he was a \\"lucky cuss,\\" and that became the name of one of the richest mining claims in the Tombstone District. The ore samples assayed at $15,000 a ton. Ed shortly afterward identified another claim, the \\"Tough Nut\\" lode, rich in horn silver. On June 17, 1879, Schieffelin showed up in Tucson driving the blue spring wagon carrying the first load of silver bullion valued at $18,744 (about $ today) = Tombstone founded = Ed Schieffelin in 1880 When the first claims were filed, the initial settlement of tents and cabins was located at Watervale near the Lucky Cuss mine. By March 1879, about 100 residents occupied tents and shacks at Watervale. Former Territorial Governor Anson P.K. Safford offered financial backing for a cut of the men's mining claims, and Ed Schieffelin, his brother Al, and their partner Richard Gird formed the Tombstone Mining and Milling Company and built a stamping mill. On March 5, 1879, U.S. Deputy Mineral Surveyor Solon M. Allis finished laying out a new town site on a mesa named Goose Flats at , to top of the Tough Nut mine, and large enough to hold a growing town. The town was named \\"Tombstone\\" after Schieffelin's initial mining claim. The shelters at Watervale were relocated to the new town site and a scattering of cabins and tents were quickly built for about 100 residents. During the first few months of mining, the upper portion of the Tombstone mining district was accidentally discovered by Ed Williams and Jack Friday. Late one night, their mules broke loose and dragging their chain, left the miners' dry camp for water along an Indian trail. The men tracked the mules' chain trail all the way to the Schieffelin camp. Williams and Friday noticed a bright gleam where the iron had dragged across bare rock. They filed a claim for their find, but Al and Ed Schieffelin and Richard Gird contested their claim, asserting it violated their earlier claims. When the two parties finally resolved their arguments and counterclaims, they agreed to divide the ground. Williams and Friday took the higher end, which they called the Grand Central, and the Schieffelin company took the lower end, which they named the Contention in remembrance of the quarrel that led to its founding. Those two mines were eventually the most profitable mines in Tombstone. Some of the ore from the \\"Lucky Cuss\\", \\"Tough Nut\\", and the \\"Contention\\" mines assayed at around $15,000 to the ton. Stock certificate of the Consolidated Tombstone Gold and Silver Mining Company Ed Schieffelin preferred prospecting to running a mine and he left Tombstone to find more ore. When he returned four months later, Gird had lined up buyers for their interest in the Contention, which they sold for $10,000 to J.H. White and S. Denson, who represented W.D. Dean of San Francisco. The sellers thought the $10,000 price was exorbitant. The Grand Central and Contention claims turned out to be the richest claims in the district, producing millions of dollars in bullion. The Schieffelin company also soon sold a half-interest in the Lucky Cuss, and the other half turned into a steady stream of money. left On March 13, 1879, Al and Ed Schieffelin sold their two-thirds interest in the Tombstone Mining and Milling Company, which owned the Tough Nut mine, for US$1 million each to the Corbin brothers, Hamilton Distin of Philadelphia, and Simmons Squire of Boston. Safford became president of the new Tombstone Gold and Silver Milling and Mining Company with Richard Gird as superintendent. Ed moved on, but Al remained in Tombstone for some time longer. Gird later sold off his one-third interest for US$1 million, doubling what the Schieffelins had been paid. Gird remained in the territory but Ed Schieffelin left to pursue other interests. When Cochise County was formed in February 1881, Tombstone became the county seat. In 1881, early in Tombstone's rapid growth, Ed's brother Al built Schieffelin Hall as a theater, recital hall, and a meeting place for Tombstone citizens. His great-niece Mary Schieffelin Brady reopened it in 1964 and it remains an attraction in Tombstone. It is the largest standing adobe structure in the southwest United States. At its height in the mid-1880s, Tombstone's population was officially about 7,000 miners, but some estimates figure in an additional 5‚Äì7,000 women and children, Chinese, Mexicans, and prostitutes. In the late 1880s, the silver mines reached the water table and the mines eventually filled with water. Tombstone's population faded, until tourism became its main attraction.  Later life  The custom-fitted steamer New Packet built by Ed and Al Schieffelin at the wharf in St. Michael, Alaska, two hours before its departure for a trip up the Yukon River. Ed had accumulated more than $1 million in wealth as a result of the silver boom. While he had maintained a casual appearance, including long hair and beard, he cleaned himself up. He traveled to New York City, Chicago, Washington, D.C., and other cities. He met many distinguished people. Ever restless, over the next 20 years Ed showed up at nearly every boom town in the West. Schieffelin had made a practice of studying maps and believed there was a great \\"continental belt\\" of mineral wealth that extended from South America through Mexico, the United States, and British Columbia.Berton, P., (1958). The Klo(=)dike Fever. Alfred A Knopf: New York, pp. 11-12. During 1882, Ed prepared for what he planned to be a three- year survey of mineral wealth. He began the expedition with his brother Al and three others on a trip up the Yukon River. They commissioned construction of and fitted out a small, shallow-draft sternwheel steamer which they named the New Packet. Schieffelin prospected during the trip in Alaska and found some specks of gold. He was for a while convinced he had found the continental belt he had been searching for. But he was extremely discouraged by the Arctic cold he experienced, up to 50 F below zero (-46 C). He decided that mining in Alaska was a lost cause and he returned to the lower 48 states. In 1883, he returned to San Francisco, where he met Mrs. Mary E. Brown. They married the same year in La Junta, Colorado, and they spent part of the winter in Salt Lake City, Utah. In the spring of 1884, they returned to California, where Ed built a mansion for his wife across the bay from San Francisco in Alameda. They bought a home in Los Angeles that they shared with Ed's brother Al until Al died of consumption in 1885.  Early death  The Ed Schieffelin monument in southeast Arizona. Ed Schieffelin In 1897 Schieffelin bought a ranch near his brothers Effingham (Eff) and Jacob (Jay) outside Woodville, now Rogue River, Oregon. He continued prospecting in the Canyonville area, where he searched for gold and silver. On May 12, 1897, after he had not shown up in town for supplies for several days, his neighbor checked on him and found him face down on the floor of his miner's cabin. The coroner ruled that he had died of a heart attack. The ore samples found in his cabin were later reported to have assayed at more than $2,000 to the ton. Other reports from his family said it was only valued at $7 per ton. Schieffelin did not leave a map or directions behind pointing to the origins of his discovery. He was initially buried near his cabin about east of Canyonville. It was shortly afterward learned that he had requested to be buried in Tombstone. \\"It is my wish, if convenient, to be buried in the dress of a prospector, my old pick and canteen with me, on top of the granite hills, about three miles westerly from the City of Tombstone, Arizona, and that a monument, such as prospectors build when locating a mining claim, be built over my grave.\\" Schieffelin was interred about northwest of Tombstone, Arizona, near the dry wash in which he originally found silver ore and the later location of the Grand Central Mine. He was buried as his will specified: in mining clothes, with pick, shovel, and his old canteen. He divided his estate between his wife and his brother Jay. \\"I give my wife, Mary E. Schieffelin, all interests, both real and personal properties‚Äîin Alameda and Santa Clara Counties, California‚Äîalso fifteen $1,000 University of Arizona Bonds. All other properties, both real and personal, I give to my brother, Jay L. Schieffelin.\\" Mary Schieffelin moved to New York City after her husband's death.  Legacy  A tall monument representing the type of marker a miner makes in claiming a strike was erected near the spot of his original claim. The plaque on it reads, \\"Ed Shieffelin, died May 12, 1897, aged 49 years, 8 months. A dutiful son, a faithful husband, a kind brother, and a true friend.\\" Years before, Schieffelin had written, \\"I never wanted to be rich, I just wanted to get close to the earth and see mother nature's gold.\\" Schieffelin Gulch Road in the Rogue Valley, Oregon is named after the family who homesteaded there. There are widely varying estimates of the value of gold and silver mined during the course of Tombstone's history. In 1883, writer Patrick Hamilton estimated that during the first four years of activity the mines produced about $25,000,000 (approximately $ today). Other estimates include $40 million to $85 million (about $ to $ today). Renewed mining is planned for the area. The character actor Strother Martin played Schieffelin in the 1967 episode \\"Silver Tombstone\\" of the syndicated television series Death Valley Days. In the story line, after years of failure, Schieffelin is convinced that he is on the verge of a bonanza. He invites his brother to join him in the pending strike. Jamie Farr appears as Dick Gird.

The Hamilton‚ÄìJacobi equation is particularly useful in identifying conserved quantities for mechanical systems, which may be possible even when the mechanical problem itself cannot be solved completely. The Hamilton‚ÄìJacobi equation is also the only formulation of mechanics in which the motion of a particle can be represented as a wave. In this sense, it fulfilled a long-held goal of theoretical physics (dating at least to Johann Bernoulli in the eighteenth century) of finding an analogy between the propagation of light and the motion of a particle. The wave equation followed by mechanical systems is similar to, but not identical with, Schr√∂dinger's equation, as described below; for this reason, the Hamilton‚ÄìJacobi equation is considered the \\"closest approach\\" of classical mechanics to quantum mechanics. (particularly the discussion beginning in the last paragraph of page 491)Sakurai, pp. 103‚Äì107. In mathematics, the Hamilton‚ÄìJacobi equation is a necessary condition describing extremal geometry in generalizations of problems from the calculus of variations. It can be understood as a special case of the Hamilton‚ÄìJacobi‚ÄìBellman equation from dynamic programming. Notation Boldface variables such as \\\\mathbf{q} represent a list of N generalized coordinates, : \\\\mathbf{q} = (q_1, q_2, \\\\ldots, q_{N-1}, q_N) A dot over a variable or list signifies the time derivative (see Newton's notation). For example, : \\\\dot{\\\\mathbf{q}} = \\\\frac{d\\\\mathbf{q}}{dt}. The dot product notation between two lists of the same number of coordinates is a shorthand for the sum of the products of corresponding components, such as : \\\\mathbf{p} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{q} = \\\\sum_{k=1}^N p_k q_k. Mathematical formulation Given the Hamiltonian H(q,p,t) of a mechanical system (where q, p are coordinates and momenta of the system and t is time) the Hamilton‚ÄìJacobi equation is written as a first-order, non-linear partial differential equation for the Hamilton's principal function S(q,t), The Hamilton's principal function is defined as the function of the upper limit of the action integral taken along the minimal action trajectory of the system, where \\\\mathcal{L} is the Lagrangian of the system and where the trajectory satisfies the Euler‚ÄìLagrange equation of the system, :\\\\frac{ d}{ dt}\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\mathcal{L}}{\\\\partial\\\\dot{q}}=\\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\mathcal{L}}{\\\\partial q}. Calculating the variation of S with respect to variation of the end-point coordinate, : \\\\delta S = \\\\int \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\mathcal{L}}{\\\\partial q}\\\\delta q + \\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\mathcal{L}}{\\\\partial\\\\dot{q}}\\\\delta\\\\dot{q} \\\\right) dt =\\\\int \\\\left( \\\\frac{d}{dt}\\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\mathcal{L}}{\\\\partial \\\\dot{q}}\\\\delta q + \\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\mathcal{L}}{\\\\partial\\\\dot{q}}\\\\frac{d}{dt}\\\\delta{q} \\\\right)dt =\\\\int \\\\frac{d}{dt}\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\mathcal{L}}{\\\\partial \\\\dot{q}}\\\\delta q\\\\right) dt =\\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\mathcal{L}}{\\\\partial \\\\dot{q}}\\\\delta q = p\\\\delta q, leads to Using this result and calculating the variation of S with respect to variation of the time of the end-point leads directly to the Hamilton‚ÄìJacobi equation, : \\\\delta S = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\delta t + \\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\mathcal{L}}{\\\\partial \\\\dot{q}}\\\\delta q = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\delta t - \\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\mathcal{L}}{\\\\partial \\\\dot{q}}\\\\dot{q}\\\\delta t = -H\\\\delta t \\\\;, or where \\\\delta q = -\\\\dot{q}\\\\delta t is the change of the trajectory at the old end-point due to the time shift and where H = \\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\mathcal{L}}{\\\\partial \\\\dot{q}}\\\\dot{q}-\\\\mathcal{L} is the Hamiltonian of the system. Alternatively, as described below, the Hamilton‚ÄìJacobi equation may be derived from Hamiltonian mechanics by treating S as the generating function for a canonical transformation of the classical Hamiltonian :H = H(q_1,q_2,\\\\ldots, q_N;p_1,p_2,\\\\ldots, p_N;t). The conjugate momenta correspond to the first derivatives of S with respect to the generalized coordinates :p_k = \\\\frac{\\\\partial S}{\\\\partial q_k}. As a solution to the Hamilton‚ÄìJacobi equation, the principal function contains N+1 undetermined constants, the first N of them denoted as \\\\alpha_1,\\\\, \\\\alpha_2, ... , \\\\alpha_N, and the last one coming from the integration of \\\\frac{\\\\partial S}{\\\\partial t}. The relationship between \\\\textbf{p} and \\\\textbf{q} then describes the orbit in phase space in terms of these constants of motion. Furthermore, the quantities :\\\\beta_k=\\\\frac{\\\\partial S}{\\\\partial\\\\alpha_k},\\\\quad k=1,2, \\\\ldots, N are also constants of motion, and these equations can be inverted to find \\\\textbf{q} as a function of all the \\\\alpha and \\\\beta constants and time. Comparison with other formulations of mechanics The HJE is a single, first-order partial differential equation for the function of the N generalized coordinates q_1,\\\\, q_2, ... , q_N and the time t . The generalized momenta do not appear, except as derivatives of S . Remarkably, the function S is equal to the classical action. For comparison, in the equivalent Euler‚ÄìLagrange equations of motion of Lagrangian mechanics, the conjugate momenta also do not appear; however, those equations are a system of N , generally second-order equations for the time evolution of the generalized coordinates. Similarly, Hamilton's equations of motion are another system of 2N first-order equations for the time evolution of the generalized coordinates and their conjugate momenta p_1,\\\\, p_2, ... , p_N . Since the HJE is an equivalent expression of an integral minimization problem such as Hamilton's principle, the HJE can be useful in other problems of the calculus of variations and, more generally, in other branches of mathematics and physics, such as dynamical systems, symplectic geometry and quantum chaos. For example, the Hamilton‚ÄìJacobi equations can be used to determine the geodesics on a Riemannian manifold, an important variational problem in Riemannian geometry. Derivation using a canonical transformation Any canonical transformation involving a type-2 generating function G_2 (\\\\textbf{q}, \\\\textbf{P}, t) leads to the relations : \\\\mathbf{p} = {\\\\partial G_2 \\\\over \\\\partial \\\\mathbf{q}}, \\\\quad \\\\mathbf{Q} = {\\\\partial G_2 \\\\over \\\\partial \\\\mathbf{P}}, \\\\quad K(\\\\mathbf{Q},\\\\mathbf{P},t) = H(\\\\mathbf{q},\\\\mathbf{p},t) + {\\\\partial G_2 \\\\over \\\\partial t} and Hamilton's equations in terms of the new variables \\\\mathbf{P}, \\\\,\\\\mathbf{Q} and new Hamiltonian K have the same form: : \\\\dot{\\\\mathbf{P}} = -{\\\\partial K \\\\over \\\\partial \\\\mathbf{Q}}, \\\\quad \\\\dot{\\\\mathbf{Q}} = +{\\\\partial K \\\\over \\\\partial \\\\mathbf{P}}. To derive the HJE, we choose a generating function G_2 (\\\\textbf{q}, \\\\textbf{P}, t) in such a way that, it will make the new Hamiltonian K=0. Hence, all its derivatives are also zero, and the transformed Hamilton's equations become trivial :\\\\dot{\\\\mathbf{P}} = \\\\dot{\\\\mathbf{Q}} = 0 so the new generalized coordinates and momenta are constants of motion. As they are constants, in this context the new generalized momenta \\\\textbf{P} are usually denoted \\\\alpha_1,\\\\, \\\\alpha_2, ... , \\\\alpha_N , i.e. P_m =\\\\alpha_m and the new generalized coordinates \\\\textbf{Q} are typically denoted as \\\\beta_1,\\\\, \\\\beta_2, ... , \\\\beta_N , so Q_m =\\\\beta_m . Setting the generating function equal to Hamilton's principal function, plus an arbitrary constant A: :G_2(\\\\mathbf{q},\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\alpha},t)=S(\\\\mathbf{q},t)+A, the HJE automatically arises :\\\\mathbf{p}=\\\\frac{\\\\partial G_2}{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{q}}=\\\\frac{\\\\partial S}{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{q}} \\\\, \\\\rightarrow \\\\, H(\\\\mathbf{q},\\\\mathbf{p},t) + {\\\\partial G_2 \\\\over \\\\partial t}=0 \\\\, \\\\rightarrow \\\\, H\\\\left(\\\\mathbf{q},\\\\frac{\\\\partial S}{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{q}},t\\\\right) + {\\\\partial S \\\\over \\\\partial t}=0. Once we have solved for S(\\\\mathbf{q},\\\\boldsymbol\\\\alpha, t) , these also give us the useful equations : \\\\mathbf{Q} = \\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta = {\\\\partial S \\\\over \\\\partial \\\\boldsymbol\\\\alpha}, or written in components for clarity : Q_{m} = \\\\beta_{m} = \\\\frac{\\\\partial S(\\\\mathbf{q},\\\\boldsymbol\\\\alpha, t)}{\\\\partial \\\\alpha_{m}}. Ideally, these N equations can be inverted to find the original generalized coordinates \\\\textbf{q} as a function of the constants \\\\boldsymbol\\\\alpha, \\\\,\\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta, and t , thus solving the original problem. Action and Hamilton's functions Hamilton's principal function S and classical function H are both closely related to action. The total differential of S is: : dS =\\\\sum_i \\\\frac{\\\\partial S}{\\\\partial q_i} dq_i + \\\\frac{\\\\partial S}{\\\\partial t}dt so the time derivative of S is :\\\\frac{ dS}{ dt} =\\\\sum_i\\\\frac{\\\\partial S}{\\\\partial q_i}\\\\dot{q}_i+\\\\frac{\\\\partial S}{\\\\partial t} =\\\\sum_ip_i\\\\dot{q}_i-H = L. Therefore, :S=\\\\int L\\\\,dt , so S is actually the classical action plus an undetermined constant. When H does not explicitly depend on time, :W=S+Et=S+Ht=\\\\int(L+H)\\\\,dt=\\\\int\\\\mathbf{p}\\\\cdot d\\\\mathbf{q}, in this case W is the same as abbreviated action. Separation of variables The HJE is most useful when it can be solved via additive separation of variables, which directly identifies constants of motion. For example, the time t can be separated if the Hamiltonian does not depend on time explicitly. In that case, the time derivative \\\\frac{\\\\partial S}{\\\\partial t} in the HJE must be a constant, usually denoted (-E ), giving the separated solution : S = W(q_1,q_2, \\\\ldots, q_N) - Et where the time-independent function W(\\\\textbf{q}) is sometimes called Hamilton's characteristic function. The reduced Hamilton‚ÄìJacobi equation can then be written : H\\\\left(\\\\mathbf{q},\\\\frac{\\\\partial S}{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{q}} \\\\right) = E. To illustrate separability for other variables, we assume that a certain generalized coordinate q_k and its derivative \\\\frac{\\\\partial S}{\\\\partial q_k} appear together as a single function :\\\\psi \\\\left(q_k, \\\\frac{\\\\partial S}{\\\\partial q_k} \\\\right) in the Hamiltonian : H = H(q_1,q_2,\\\\ldots, q_{k-1}, q_{k+1},\\\\ldots, q_N; p_1,p_2,\\\\ldots, p_{k-1}, p_{k+1},\\\\ldots, p_N; \\\\psi; t). In that case, the function S can be partitioned into two functions, one that depends only on qk and another that depends only on the remaining generalized coordinates :S = S_k(q_k) + S_\\\\text{rem}(q_1,\\\\ldots, q_{k-1}, q_{k+1}, \\\\ldots, q_N, t). Substitution of these formulae into the Hamilton‚ÄìJacobi equation shows that the function œà must be a constant (denoted here as \\\\Gamma_k ), yielding a first-order ordinary differential equation for S_k (q_k), : \\\\psi \\\\left(q_k, \\\\frac{ d S_k}{ d q_k} \\\\right) = \\\\Gamma_k. In fortunate cases, the function S can be separated completely into N functions S_m (q_m), : S=S_1(q_1)+S_2(q_2)+\\\\cdots+S_N(q_N)-Et. In such a case, the problem devolves to N ordinary differential equations. The separability of S depends both on the Hamiltonian and on the choice of generalized coordinates. For orthogonal coordinates and Hamiltonians that have no time dependence and are quadratic in the generalized momenta, S will be completely separable if the potential energy is additively separable in each coordinate, where the potential energy term for each coordinate is multiplied by the coordinate-dependent factor in the corresponding momentum term of the Hamiltonian (the Staeckel conditions). For illustration, several examples in orthogonal coordinates are worked in the next sections. =Examples in various coordinate systems= Spherical coordinates In spherical coordinates the Hamiltonian of a free particle moving in a conservative potential U can be written : H = \\\\frac{1}{2m} \\\\left[ p_{r}^{2} + \\\\frac{p_{\\\\theta}^{2}}{r^{2}} + \\\\frac{p_{\\\\phi}^{2}}{r^{2} \\\\sin^{2} \\\\theta} \\\\right] + U(r, \\\\theta, \\\\phi). The Hamilton‚ÄìJacobi equation is completely separable in these coordinates provided that there exist functions Ur(r), UŒ∏(Œ∏) and Uœï(œï) such that U can be written in the analogous form : U(r, \\\\theta, \\\\phi) = U_{r}(r) + \\\\frac{U_{\\\\theta}(\\\\theta)}{r^{2}} + \\\\frac{U_{\\\\phi}(\\\\phi)}{r^{2}\\\\sin^{2}\\\\theta} . Substitution of the completely separated solution :S = S_{r}(r) + S_{\\\\theta}(\\\\theta) + S_{\\\\phi}(\\\\phi) - Et into the HJE yields : \\\\frac{1}{2m} \\\\left( \\\\frac{ dS_{r}}{ dr} \\\\right)^{2} + U_{r}(r) + \\\\frac{1}{2m r^{2}} \\\\left[ \\\\left( \\\\frac{ dS_{\\\\theta}}{ d\\\\theta} \\\\right)^{2} + 2m U_{\\\\theta}(\\\\theta) \\\\right] + \\\\frac{1}{2m r^{2}\\\\sin^{2}\\\\theta} \\\\left[ \\\\left( \\\\frac{ dS_{\\\\phi}}{ d\\\\phi} \\\\right)^{2} + 2m U_{\\\\phi}(\\\\phi) \\\\right] = E. This equation may be solved by successive integrations of ordinary differential equations, beginning with the equation for \\\\phi : \\\\left( \\\\frac{ dS_{\\\\phi}}{ d\\\\phi} \\\\right)^{2} + 2m U_{\\\\phi}(\\\\phi) = \\\\Gamma_{\\\\phi} where \\\\Gamma_\\\\phi is a constant of the motion that eliminates the \\\\phi dependence from the Hamilton‚ÄìJacobi equation : \\\\frac{1}{2m} \\\\left( \\\\frac{ dS_{r}}{ dr} \\\\right)^{2} + U_{r}(r) + \\\\frac{1}{2m r^{2}} \\\\left[ \\\\left( \\\\frac{ dS_{\\\\theta}}{ d\\\\theta} \\\\right)^{2} + 2m U_{\\\\theta}(\\\\theta) + \\\\frac{\\\\Gamma_{\\\\phi}}{\\\\sin^{2}\\\\theta} \\\\right] = E. The next ordinary differential equation involves the \\\\theta generalized coordinate : \\\\left( \\\\frac{ dS_{\\\\theta}}{ d\\\\theta} \\\\right)^{2} + 2m U_{\\\\theta}(\\\\theta) + \\\\frac{\\\\Gamma_{\\\\phi}}{\\\\sin^{2}\\\\theta} = \\\\Gamma_{\\\\theta} where \\\\Gamma_\\\\theta is again a constant of the motion that eliminates the \\\\theta dependence and reduces the HJE to the final ordinary differential equation : \\\\frac{1}{2m} \\\\left( \\\\frac{ dS_{r}}{ dr} \\\\right)^{2} + U_{r}(r) + \\\\frac{\\\\Gamma_{\\\\theta}}{2m r^{2}} = E whose integration completes the solution for S . Elliptic cylindrical coordinates The Hamiltonian in elliptic cylindrical coordinates can be written : H = \\\\frac{p_{\\\\mu}^{2} + p_{ u}^{2}}{2ma^{2} \\\\left( \\\\sinh^{2} \\\\mu + \\\\sin^{2} u\\\\right)} + \\\\frac{p_{z}^{2}}{2m} + U(\\\\mu, u, z) where the foci of the ellipses are located at \\\\pm a on the x-axis. The Hamilton‚ÄìJacobi equation is completely separable in these coordinates provided that U has an analogous form : U(\\\\mu, u, z) = \\\\frac{U_{\\\\mu}(\\\\mu) + U_{ u}( u)}{\\\\sinh^{2} \\\\mu + \\\\sin^{2} u} + U_{z}(z) where : U_\\\\mu(\\\\mu), U_ u( u) and U_z(z) are arbitrary functions. Substitution of the completely separated solution :S = S_{\\\\mu}(\\\\mu) + S_{ u}( u) + S_{z}(z) - Et into the HJE yields : \\\\frac{1}{2m} \\\\left( \\\\frac{ dS_{z}}{ dz} \\\\right)^{2} + U_{z}(z) + \\\\frac{1}{2ma^{2} \\\\left( \\\\sinh^{2} \\\\mu + \\\\sin^{2} u\\\\right)} \\\\left[ \\\\left( \\\\frac{ dS_{\\\\mu}}{ d\\\\mu} \\\\right)^{2} + \\\\left( \\\\frac{ dS_{ u}}{ d u} \\\\right)^{2} + 2m a^{2} U_{\\\\mu}(\\\\mu) + 2m a^{2} U_{ u}( u)\\\\right] = E. Separating the first ordinary differential equation : \\\\frac{1}{2m} \\\\left( \\\\frac{ dS_{z}}{ dz} \\\\right)^{2} + U_{z}(z) = \\\\Gamma_{z} yields the reduced Hamilton‚ÄìJacobi equation (after re-arrangement and multiplication of both sides by the denominator) : \\\\left( \\\\frac{ dS_{\\\\mu}}{ d\\\\mu} \\\\right)^{2} + \\\\left( \\\\frac{ dS_{ u}}{ d u} \\\\right)^{2} + 2m a^{2} U_{\\\\mu}(\\\\mu) + 2m a^{2} U_{ u}( u) = 2ma^{2} \\\\left( \\\\sinh^{2} \\\\mu + \\\\sin^{2} u\\\\right) \\\\left( E - \\\\Gamma_{z} \\\\right) which itself may be separated into two independent ordinary differential equations : \\\\left( \\\\frac{ dS_{\\\\mu}}{ d\\\\mu} \\\\right)^{2} + 2m a^{2} U_{\\\\mu}(\\\\mu) + 2ma^{2} \\\\left(\\\\Gamma_{z} - E \\\\right) \\\\sinh^{2} \\\\mu = \\\\Gamma_{\\\\mu} : \\\\left( \\\\frac{ dS_{ u}}{ d u} \\\\right)^{2} + 2m a^{2} U_{ u}( u) + 2ma^{2} \\\\left(\\\\Gamma_{z} - E \\\\right) \\\\sin^{2} u = \\\\Gamma_{ u} that, when solved, provide a complete solution for S . Parabolic cylindrical coordinates The Hamiltonian in parabolic cylindrical coordinates can be written : H = \\\\frac{p_{\\\\sigma}^{2} + p_{\\\\tau}^{2}}{2m \\\\left( \\\\sigma^{2} + \\\\tau^{2}\\\\right)} + \\\\frac{p_{z}^{2}}{2m} + U(\\\\sigma, \\\\tau, z). The Hamilton‚ÄìJacobi equation is completely separable in these coordinates provided that U has an analogous form : U(\\\\sigma, \\\\tau, z) = \\\\frac{U_{\\\\sigma}(\\\\sigma) + U_{\\\\tau}(\\\\tau)}{\\\\sigma^{2} + \\\\tau^{2}} + U_{z}(z) where U_\\\\sigma (\\\\sigma) , U_\\\\tau (\\\\tau) , and U_z(z) are arbitrary functions. Substitution of the completely separated solution :S = S_{\\\\sigma}(\\\\sigma) + S_{\\\\tau}(\\\\tau) + S_{z}(z) - Et + \\\\text{constant} into the HJE yields : \\\\frac{1}{2m} \\\\left( \\\\frac{ dS_{z}}{ dz} \\\\right)^{2} + U_{z}(z) + \\\\frac{1}{2m \\\\left( \\\\sigma^{2} + \\\\tau^{2} \\\\right)} \\\\left[ \\\\left( \\\\frac{ dS_{\\\\sigma}}{ d\\\\sigma} \\\\right)^{2} + \\\\left( \\\\frac{ dS_{\\\\tau}}{ d\\\\tau} \\\\right)^{2} + 2m U_{\\\\sigma}(\\\\sigma) + 2m U_{\\\\tau}(\\\\tau)\\\\right] = E. Separating the first ordinary differential equation : \\\\frac{1}{2m} \\\\left( \\\\frac{ dS_{z}}{ dz} \\\\right)^{2} + U_{z}(z) = \\\\Gamma_{z} yields the reduced Hamilton‚ÄìJacobi equation (after re-arrangement and multiplication of both sides by the denominator) : \\\\left( \\\\frac{ dS_{\\\\sigma}}{ d\\\\sigma} \\\\right)^{2} + \\\\left( \\\\frac{ dS_{\\\\tau}}{ d\\\\tau} \\\\right)^{2} + 2m U_{\\\\sigma}(\\\\sigma) + 2m U_{\\\\tau}(\\\\tau) = 2m \\\\left( \\\\sigma^{2} + \\\\tau^{2} \\\\right) \\\\left( E - \\\\Gamma_{z} \\\\right) which itself may be separated into two independent ordinary differential equations : \\\\left( \\\\frac{ dS_{\\\\sigma}}{ d\\\\sigma} \\\\right)^{2} + 2m U_{\\\\sigma}(\\\\sigma) + 2m\\\\sigma^{2} \\\\left(\\\\Gamma_{z} - E \\\\right) = \\\\Gamma_{\\\\sigma} : \\\\left( \\\\frac{ dS_{\\\\tau}}{ d\\\\tau} \\\\right)^{2} + 2m U_{\\\\tau}(\\\\tau) + 2m \\\\tau^{2} \\\\left(\\\\Gamma_{z} - E \\\\right) = \\\\Gamma_{\\\\tau} that, when solved, provide a complete solution for S.  Waves and particles  = Optical wave fronts and trajectories = The HJE establishes a duality between trajectories and wave fronts. For example, in geometrical optics, light can be considered either as ‚Äúrays‚Äù or waves. The wave front can be defined as the surface {\\\\cal C}_{t} that the light emitted at time t=0 has reached at time t. Light rays and wave fronts are dual: if one is known, the other can be deduced. More precisely, geometrical optics is a variational problem where the ‚Äúaction‚Äù is the travel time T along a path,T=\\\\frac{1}{c}\\\\int_{A}^{B}ndswhere n is the medium's index of refraction and ds is an infinitesimal arc length. From the above formulation, one can compute the ray paths using the Euler-Lagrange formulation; alternatively, one can compute the wave fronts by solving the Hamilton-Jacobi equation. Knowing one leads to knowing the other. The above duality is very general and applies to all systems that derive from a variational principle: either compute the trajectories using Euler-Lagrange equations or the wave fronts by using Hamilton-Jacobi equation. The wave front at time t, for a system initially at \\\\textbf{q}_{0} at time t_{0}, is defined as the collection of points \\\\textbf{q} such that S(\\\\textbf{q},t)=\\\\text{const}. If S(\\\\textbf{q},t) is known, the momentum is immediately deduced,\\\\textbf{p}=\\\\frac{\\\\partial S}{\\\\partial\\\\textbf{q}}.Once \\\\textbf{p} is known, tangents to the trajectories \\\\dot{\\\\textbf{q}} are computed by solving the equation\\\\frac{\\\\partial{\\\\cal L}}{\\\\partial\\\\dot{ \\\\textbf{q}}}=\\\\boldsymbol{p}for \\\\dot{\\\\textbf{q}}, where {\\\\cal L} is the Lagrangian. The trajectories are then recovered from the knowledge of \\\\dot{\\\\textbf{q}}. =Relationship to the Schr√∂dinger equation= The isosurfaces of the function S(\\\\textbf{q}, t) can be determined at any time t. The motion of an S-isosurface as a function of time is defined by the motions of the particles beginning at the points \\\\textbf{q} on the isosurface. The motion of such an isosurface can be thought of as a wave moving through \\\\textbf{q}-space, although it does not obey the wave equation exactly. To show this, let S represent the phase of a wave : \\\\psi = \\\\psi_{0} e^{iS/\\\\hbar} where \\\\hbar is a constant (Planck's constant) introduced to make the exponential argument dimensionless; changes in the amplitude of the wave can be represented by having S be a complex number. We may then rewrite the Hamilton‚ÄìJacobi equation as : \\\\frac{\\\\hbar^{2}}{2m} abla^2 \\\\psi - U\\\\psi = \\\\frac{\\\\hbar}{i} \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\psi}{\\\\partial t} which is the Schr√∂dinger equation. Conversely, starting with the Schr√∂dinger equation and our ansatz for \\\\psi, we arrive at : \\\\frac{1}{2m} \\\\left( abla S \\\\right)^{2} + U + \\\\frac{\\\\partial S}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\frac{i\\\\hbar}{2m} abla^{2} S. The classical limit (\\\\hbar \\\\rightarrow 0) of the Schr√∂dinger equation above becomes identical to the following variant of the Hamilton‚ÄìJacobi equation, : \\\\frac{1}{2m} \\\\left( abla S \\\\right)^{2} + U + \\\\frac{\\\\partial S}{\\\\partial t} = 0.  Applications  =HJE in a gravitational field= Using the energy‚Äìmomentum relation in the form :g^{\\\\alpha\\\\beta}P_\\\\alpha P_\\\\beta - (mc)^2 = 0 for a particle of rest mass m travelling in curved space, where g^{\\\\alpha \\\\beta}are the contravariant coordinates of the metric tensor (i.e., the inverse metric) solved from the Einstein field equations, and c is the speed of light. Setting the four-momentum P_\\\\alpha equal to the four-gradient of the action S , :P_\\\\alpha =-\\\\frac{\\\\partial S}{\\\\partial x^\\\\alpha} gives the Hamilton‚ÄìJacobi equation in the geometry determined by the metric g : :g^{\\\\alpha\\\\beta}\\\\frac{\\\\partial S}{\\\\partial x^\\\\alpha}\\\\frac{\\\\partial S}{\\\\partial x^\\\\beta} -(mc)^2 = 0, in other words, in a gravitational field. =HJE in electromagnetic fields= For a particle of rest mass m and electric charge e moving in electromagnetic field with four-potential A_i = (\\\\phi,\\\\Alpha) in vacuum, the Hamilton‚ÄìJacobi equation in geometry determined by the metric tensor g^{ik} = g_{ik} has a form :g^{ik}\\\\left ( \\\\frac{\\\\partial S}{\\\\partial x^i} + \\\\frac {e}{c}A_i \\\\right ) \\\\left ( \\\\frac{\\\\partial S}{\\\\partial x^k} + \\\\frac {e}{c}A_k \\\\right ) = m^2 c^2 and can be solved for the Hamilton principal action function S to obtain further solution for the particle trajectory and momentum: :x = - \\\\frac {e}{c \\\\gamma}\\\\int A_z \\\\,d\\\\xi, :y = - \\\\frac {e}{c \\\\gamma} \\\\int A_y \\\\,d\\\\xi, :z = - \\\\frac {e^2}{2c^2 \\\\gamma^2}\\\\int (\\\\Alpha^2 - \\\\overline {\\\\Alpha^2 }) \\\\, d \\\\xi, :\\\\xi = ct - \\\\frac{e^2}{2 \\\\gamma^2 c^2}\\\\int (\\\\Alpha^2 - \\\\overline {\\\\Alpha^2}) \\\\, d \\\\xi, :p_x = - \\\\frac{e}{c}A_x , p_y = - \\\\frac{e}{c}A_y, :p_z = \\\\frac{e^2}{2\\\\gamma c}(\\\\Alpha^2 - \\\\overline {\\\\Alpha^2}), :\\\\mathcal{E}= c\\\\gamma + \\\\frac{e^2}{2 \\\\gamma c}(\\\\Alpha^2 - \\\\overline {\\\\Alpha^2}), where \\\\xi = ct - z and \\\\gamma^2 = m^2 c^2 + \\\\frac{e^2}{c^2} \\\\overline{A}^2 with \\\\overline{\\\\mathbf{A}} the cycle average of the vector potential.

It stars Al Pacino, Catherine Keener, Evan Rachel Wood, Rachel Roberts, Jay Mohr, and Winona Ryder. The story follows a fading director creating a virtual actor to star in his films and the attempts he makes to keep her non-presence a secret as she becomes more famous. Simone garnered mixed reviews from critics but was a minor box-office hit, grossing $19.6 million worldwide against its $10 million budget. Plot When Nicola Anders (Winona Ryder), the star of out-of-favor director Viktor Taransky's (Al Pacino) new film, refuses to finish it, Taransky is forced to find a replacement. Contractual requirements totally prevent using her image in the film, so he must re-shoot. Instead, Viktor experiments with a new computer program he inherits from late acquaintance Hank Aleno (Elias Koteas) which allows the creation of a computer-generated woman which he can easily animate to play the film's central character. Viktor names his virtual actor \\"Simone\\", a name derived from the computer program's title, Simulation One. Seamlessly incorporated into the film, Simone (Rachel Roberts) gives a fantastic performance, exactly controlled by Viktor. The film is immediately a huge success. The studio, and soon the world, ask \\"who is Simone?\\" Viktor initially claims that Simone is a recluse and requests her privacy be respected, but that only intensifies media demands for her to appear. Viktor intends to reveal the secret of her non-existence after the second picture. To satisfy demand, he executes a number of progressively ambitious stunts relying on misdirection and cinematic special effects technology. Eventually, it escalates to simulated remote location video live interviews. In one instance, two determined tabloid reporters discover Viktor used out-of-date stock photography as a background during an interview instead of being on that site as claimed and blackmail him into getting Simone to make a live appearance. He arranges her to perform a song at a stadium event appearing in a cloud of smoke and then using flawless holographic technology. The perception of being in person is reinforced with realtime visualization on the stadium's monitors. Simone becomes even more famous, simultaneously becoming a double winner for the Academy Award for Best Actress, tying with herself in the process. Once the pressure of serving his creation reaches a breaking point for Viktor, he decides to ruin Simone's career as an act of vengeance. Simone's next film, I Am Pig, is her directorial debut and a tasteless treatment about zoophilia intended to disgust audiences, which not only fails to achieve the desired effect of audience alienation but also serves to foster her credibility as a risk-taking, fearless and avant-garde artist. Taransky's subsequent attempts to discredit Simone by having her drink, smoke and curse at public appearances and use politically incorrect statements similarly backfire when the press instead begins to see her as refreshingly honest. As a last resort, Taransky decides to dispose of Simone completely by using a computer virus to erase her and dumps the hard drive and floppy disks into a steamer trunk and buries it at sea, then announces to the press she has died of a rare virus contracted on her Goodwill Tour of the Third World. During the funeral, the police interrupt, open the coffin and find only Simone's cardboard cutout. He is arrested and shown a security camera video where he loads a large trunk on his yacht. After being charged with her murder, he admits that Simone is not a person, but a computer program. The chest containing the computer data is brought up empty. Viktor's daughter Lainey and ex-wife Elaine enter his studio to try to help. They find Viktor's forgotten virus source disk (Plague) and apply an anti-virus program to eradicate the computer virus. They revive Simone and have her appear on national television laughing while holding up a newspaper headline with her obituary. They pick up a confused Viktor, to whom Elaine asks to get back together with. In the end, Simone and Viktor are remotely interviewed at home about their new (virtual) baby, used as a cover story for her absence. Simone is concerned about her child's future and decides to enter politics. The film shows how the fake is produced using the chroma key technique. A post-credits sequence shows Viktor creating fake footage of Simone in a supermarket, which one of her pursuers sees, believing it real.

The film grossed $19,576,023 worldwide. =Critical response= Simone received mixed reviews from critics. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gave it a 50% approval rating based on 150 reviews, with an average rating of 5.8/10. The site's consensus reads: \\"The satire in S1m0ne lacks bite, and the plot isn't believable enough to feel relevant.\\" Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average out of 100 top reviews from mainstream critics, calculated an average score of 49, based on 38 reviews. Roger Ebert was critical of Niccol wasting his premise by giving it a broad appeal with \\"sitcom simplicity\\" and his cast a narrow direction for their characters, saying \\"He wants to edge it in the direction of a Hollywood comedy, but the satire is not sharp enough and the characters, including the ex-wife, are too routine.\\" The Guardians Peter Bradshaw wrote that, \\"It's reasonable material, but there are no real plot twists or unexpected implications; it all just rolls out easily in a Hollywood that director Niccol makes appear so unreal as to be an easy target\\". Marc Savlov of The Austin Chronicle said, \\"What really irked me about Simone was that it stank of the very thing it appeared to be mocking: it's a big-budget, commercial film taking potshots at big-budget, commercial filmmaking (as well as overripe, over-earnest indies), and although it strives constantly for a sense of knowing, winking irony, the only thing ironic about it is how much it resembles its supposed target.\\" Elvis Mitchell of The New York Times said, \\"[T]he writer-director Mr. Niccol is satirizing the kinds of dazzling empties he himself has made. [Mr. Niccol is] fascinated with surfaces -- the films he's been involved with (he wrote The Truman Show and wrote and directed Gattaca) are a mix of populism and deconstruction. His newest effort, Simone, goes beyond postmodern to post-entertainment -- it's tepid and vapid.\\" See also * Lars and the Real Girl * The Congress * Her References External links  * Category:2002 films Category:2000s satirical films Category:2000s science fiction comedy-drama films Category:American films Category:American satirical films Category:American science fiction comedy- drama films Category:English-language films Category:Films about computing Category:Films about telepresence Category:Films directed by Andrew Niccol Category:Films produced by Michael De Luca Category:Films scored by Carter Burwell ","title":"Simone (2002 film)"},{"id":"897546","text":"Vendela Maria Kirsebom (born 12 January 1967) is a Norwegian-Swedish -Turkish model and actress living in Oslo, Norway.

Early life Born as Zalman or as Yeshua Zalman Sverdlov (in Russian: Zinovy Mikhailovich Sverdlov), the future Zinovy Peshkov was the second child and eldest son in a Jewish family in Nizhny Novgorod. His father, Mikail Izraylevich (1846?-1921), was a relatively prosperous itinerant coppersmith and copper engraver from the region of Bialystok in the Kingdom of Poland, in an area of Belarusian and Lithuanian influence. His mother, Elizaveta Solomonovna Averbach (1864-1900), was related to merchant families of a city which, since the beginning of the 19th century, had experienced vigorous economic development. Zinovy's generation was emblematic of the fate of Jewish families who were in contact with the principal powers at the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries. In fact, out of the eight known children of Mikhail and Elisabeth, some settled in Soviet Russia ‚Äì sometimes by adopting the new regime ‚Äì while others, having chosen emigration, after crossing Western Europe, settled in the United States. Thus Sarah, the oldest daughter, born in Polotsk, near Vitebsk (in present-day Belarus) in 1876, emigrated to New York around 1913. She died there in 1947. Zinovy, the oldest of the sons, born in 1884, was followed by Yakov (1885-1919), the future political colleague of Lenin. Following these two brothers, who had singular and opposite destinies, several sons and daughters arrived who in their turn, were separated by politics and emigration. These include, other than Sarah, Zinovy, Sophie (who died in 1951 in Saratov), Sore (died in 1964), Lev (born 1893, died in 1914 in Russia) and (, born 1886, emigrated to the USA, returned to Soviet Russia in 1918, shot in 1939). The protege of Gorky Reluctant to pursue his studies and prepared from adolescence for any adventure, the young Zinovy trolled the streets of Nizhny Novgorod on the fringes of legality, spending his time with the many thugs on the banks of the Volga. In 1896, salvation came upon his meeting a character who undoubtedly had ties to the Sverdlov family, although we have no knowledge of the exact relations between them. Originally from the region where he was placed under house arrest (Nizhny Novgorod, his home town, is 100 km north of Arzamas, where he was exiled), Maxim Gorky ‚Äì who was then 28 years old ‚Äì took under his protection the young Zinovy, who he undoubtedly saw as a kind of double as well as a quirky reflection of his own journey. Gorky organized meetings, promoting his ideas throughout Russia with an uncommon energy. Acting as a kind of secretary and ‚Äújack of all trades‚Äù, Zinovy brought him a support that was as fervent as it was efficient. He shared his arrests and imprisonments ordered by a hostile regime, at a moment when Gorky was at the threshold of huge success both in and out of Russia, a success which relied on a radical criticism of the aristocracy. Under the guidance of his mentor, the young man, perhaps at the advice of Stanislavski, tried himself in the theater in Moscow as well as in writing. He also collected romantic conquests and opened himself to the world. 1902 was a milestone for Gorky and Sverdlov. The presentation on the stage of the Moscow Theater of ‚ÄúThe Lower Depths‚Äù marked the first triumph of the writer. At the same moment, his election to the Academy of Literature ‚Äì which had been annulled by Nicholas II ‚Äì a major public event, joined another more private one, the adoption at Arzamas, under Russian Orthodox rites, of the young Zinovy. In order to bypass the law limiting movement and settlement of Jews in the empire, but also to mark his link with the writer, Zinovy was baptized on September 30, 1902, in the city church. He officially changed his name, adopting the real last name of Gorky, Peshkov, since the latter was his official godfather. Wishing to avoid induction into the armies of the Tsar during the Russo-Japanese war of 1904, Zinovy Peshkov went abroad. After Finland, England and Sweden, he ended up settling in Canada, where he worked in a number of trades. Few details are known about this wandering life, except those which his letters to Gorky reveal to us. The 1905 revolution and its upheavals drove the writer into exile. Maxim Gorky and Zena Peschkoff,(sic) His Adopted Son. Portrait photograph circa 1910, by Alice Boughton. In April 1906, Zinovy joined his friend on a dock in New York, the first step in a tour in which mobs crowded in to hear his speeches. The New York Times interviewed Peshkov, giving information about Gorky's forthcoming visit, and noting that their source \\"Nikolay Zavolzsky Pieshkoff (sic), Gorky's adopted son\\", had fled Russia and for more than a year: \\"has been living quietly on the east side and earning his living in the mailing room of Wilshire's Magazine.\\" Four days later the New York Times covered an event where Gorky spoke at length, and was supported by Mark Twain. In this report Peshkov is described as: \\"Kikolay Zavolsky Pieshkoff, the adopted son of Gorky\\". Unfortunately American opinion, at first charmed by the oratorical capacities of Gorky, to which Peshkov‚Äôs intermediation provided picturesque relief, changed quickly when it learned that the writer was travelling not with his wife, but with his mistress, Maria Andreieva. Persona non grata, Gorky was forced after being expelled from his hotel to find an improvised pied-a-terre in New York. In October, he left the United States bound for Italy, leaving Zinovy behind. After a year of wandering across the Pacific Ocean from San Francisco to New Zealand, Peshkov rejoined his adopted father in Italy in May 1907. This was the period of the ‚ÄúSchool of Capri‚Äù, which was an especially formative time for him since many intellectuals and artists (Chaliapine, for example), gathered there; in addition, there were Bolshevik revolutionaries in exile ‚Äì Lenin, Bogdanov, Lunatsharsky, Bazarov, etc. ‚Äì generously hosted by the writer who assumed all the costs of these visits, in which political theory and action were in daily contact, threatening the Tsarist empire with the greatest danger. Zinovy, once again acting as Gorky‚Äôs secretary, organized this collective life, supervised the details, profiting as well from these unusual encounters to which he was a witness. He rubbed shoulders with Lenin, whom he bore little respect, whose relations with Gorky he later indicated were complicated by often divergent opinions. It was during October 1910, while staying at La Spezia with Alexander Amfiteatrov, that he married the daughter of a Cossack colonel five days after meeting her. He emigrated with her to the United States, where he struggled to find a situation. Shortly afterward, they were separated. From this short liaison, Peshkov had a daughter, Elizabeth. This wife, Lydia Bourago (1889-1966) was perhaps related to Colonel Alexander Bourago, hero of the 1878 war against Turkey, who died in 1883. She is sometimes referred to under the name of Vicomtesse de Combette. Her daughter, Elisabeth Peshkov, was married to Ivan Markov, Soviet ambassador to Rome, who was liquidated in 1937 by order of Stalin. In 1913 he returned to Capri, where he once again took up his activities with Gorky, who, shortly afterward, profiting from an amnesty offered by the Romanovs to writers guilty of criminal opinions, returned to Russia. The First World War surprised Zinovy in Italy in August 1914. As in 1905, he had no desire to serve the Tsar. Without our being able to know the deeper reasons ‚Äì he had no particular ties to France during his exile from the empire, having resided mainly across the Atlantic or in Italy ‚Äì he went to the French consulate in Genoa to enlist in the Foreign Legion. The hero of the Foreign Legion Major Peshkov, 1926 Guided to the recruitment post in Nice, he enlisted on August 31, 1914 as EVDG (an acronym for ‚Äúvoluntary enlisted for the duration of the war‚Äù) in the marching battalion of the 1st Foreign Regiment. Two months were sufficient to equip and train the volunteers at the beginning of the conflict. Peshkov, who was special ‚Äì in addition to Russian, he knew French, English, Italian and German, which was useful in a unit containing men from all over the world ‚Äì was given the rank of 1st class on October 21, 1914. Named corporal on April 1, 1915, he was put in command of a squad. Several days later, in May 1915, during combat with his division before Arras, he was seriously wounded. During the capture of Carency, a bullet shattered his arm while he was leading his soldiers. Peshkov‚Äôs regiment, like its twin, the 2nd marching regiment of the Foreign Legion, absorbed many Russian Jews assembled in these two units, who distinguished themselves in the battle of the Somme and that of Artois. The attack at Carency in May 1915 was a bloody one for these volunteers, as their losses were very great. Treated near the front, he had to find the strength to make it to the rear. After succeeding in borrowing a train, he found himself in the American hospital at Neuilly, where only amputation saved him from death. Decorated, Corporal Peshkov underwent rehabilitation and then was pensioned. He then returned to Italy. Introduced into high society, where he was a sensation, he gave lectures on the horrors of war, probably inspired by the meetings organized with Gorky several years earlier, which had a great public success. He then found himself again in Paris. On June 22, 1916, Peshkov again enlisted ‚Äúfor the duration of the war‚Äù with the grade of 2nd class. He was attached to the 20th section of the military staff. In Paris, he met Philippe Berthelot, Secretary General of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, who realized what this young mutilated soldier, bedecked with decorations, could bring in terms of propaganda aimed at neutral countries, first of all the United States, a place with which Peshkov was well acquainted. Convinced of the value of this strategy, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Briand sent Zinovy to the French Ambassador, Jusserand, with the grade of temporary 3rd class interpreter (lieutenant), for the duration of his mission. At the end of nine months, Peshkov returned to Paris, having accomplished his mission. In fact, in April 1917, President Wilson had the Senate vote on a declaration of war. The United States joined the allies in the conflict. At that time, diplomatic attention was focused on the European continent. Promoted to the rank of 2nd class interpreter officer (captain) on May 13, 1917, Peshkov was present at the events which plunged Russia into the revolution. In May, the French government sent a mission to the provisional government. He was then asked to participate, the objective being for France to convince the new Russian power to continue the war against the German Empire. This return to his roots was, for Zinovy, an occasion to renew ties to his native land and his family. By way of his brother Yakov, he had contacts with the Bolsheviks, but in no way shared their point of view. He probably saw his brother Vieamine as well as his sisters who had remained in Russia, all supporters of the revolution. The contacts with Gorky were cold, but this climate did not harm the solid friendship which tied the two men. Lenin‚Äôs seizure of power in October was rapidly followed in December by the Brest-Litovsk armistice, which put an end to the Russo-German war, which was a setback for the French diplomatic mission. Zinovy returned to Paris, but the French government, aware of the diplomatic capabilities of Captain Peshkov, soon sent him to advise the White Armies on all the fronts of the civil war which was then bloodying Russia. He was promoted temporary head of a battalion for the duration of his mission from December 9, 1918. He also met the ataman of the Cossacks, Semenov, in Vladivostok, then Admiral Kolchak in the Urals to help him in reorganizing his army. The defeat of the latter sent him in February 1920 to the Caucasus, where he attempted in vain to play a role with General Wrangel. The definitive victory of the Red Army over the Whites in November obligated Peshkov to return to Paris. At that time, Peshkov was still a man of fashion, who had been ‚Äúlaunched‚Äù according to the expression popular during that period. He was received in the greatest homes in the company of Princess Salomea Andronikova, who he had met in the Caucasus, brought to Europe and with whom he was sharing his life. He was made permanent Captain by a decree of January 14, 1920. He was attached to the 1st Foreign Regiment. He was later attached to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to be sent to the United States on January 21, 1921. Returning in May, he remained as secretary of the French delegation of the International Commission for Russia. Still tied to Russia, Zinovy, secretary general of an organization ‚Äúagainst famine‚Äù, relayed the desperate appeal of Gorky to the international press to gain popular opinion for food aid for his country. This campaign ‚Äì and the time the writer spent in Germany where he was undergoing treatment ‚Äì brought the adoptive father and son closer together. In May 1922, he was put at the disposal of Marshall Lyautey, commander of the troops in Morocco, to be attached to the staff of Meknes. Then he was allocated to the 4th Foreign Infantry Regiment on February 17, 1923, where he commanded the 12th company. Once again, everything about this appointment was astonishing. Peshkov, who received French nationality only the following year, was again in the Foreign Legion with the rank of chief of battalion, although he had no training in command and no experience in the position. Nevertheless, he met the challenge. ‚ÄúThe Magnificent One- Armed Man‚Äù, as he was nicknamed by his soldiers, led his troops into combat with courage. In June 1925, his left leg was injured during an attack at Bab Taza, ‚Äúfor the sake of symmetry‚Äù he quipped, showing the right sleeve of his uniform, useless for the past ten years. Zinovy, who continued to maintain his ties to foreign affairs, alternated periods of command with diplomatic missions. His stay at the French embassy in the United States from 1926 to 1929 did not prevent him from paying a visit to Gorky at Sorrento during vacations, prior to the writer‚Äôs permanent departure for the USSR. During this time Peshkov had a relationship with Irving Thalberg. He met him in Paris in March 1928, with a possible project of adapting his work on the Foreign Legion (published in English as The Bugle Sounds: Life in the Foreign Legion). During his many stays cut short by his command in Morocco, he played an important role in the Levant, particularly intervening with Shi‚Äôite groups in Gabal Amil (now southern Lebanon). During this epoch, he met his second wife, Jacqueline Delaunay-Belleville, the widow of a diplomat, but this marriage, like the earlier one, was quickly dissolved. On the eve of global conflict, chief of battalion Peshkov commanded a unit in Morocco with panache and vigor; his celebrity brought him into close and regular contact with many personalities, members of high society and journalists. It was in this position in North Africa, commander of the 3rd Battalion of the 2nd Foreign Regiment, that he learned of the collapse of the French troops facing the Wehrmacht in May 1940. The Gaullist diplomat After having heard the appeal on June 11 of General de Gaulle, then in refuge in London, he decided to join him. His project succeeded, but his first contacts with the head of Free France were difficult. Nevertheless, at the end of 1941, de Gaulle promoted him to the rank of Colonel (he remained almost 20 years the head of battalion) and sent him on a mission to South Africa, where he organized the transport of arms for the allied troops, while keeping an eye on Madagascar, which was relatively near. As was often the case, Peshkov succeeded in establishing confidential relations with the head of the armies in the region, General Smuts. The British occupation of the Big Island precipitated events. Uninterested in a critical and controversial involvement with the English, whom he liked, Zinovy then arranged to be sent to French West Africa, where he brilliantly organized the rallying of the colonies. Appointed Brigadier General in April 1944, Peshkov was soon sent as a delegate of the French Committee of National Liberation to the Republic of China to meet with Chiang Kai-shek, who had just broken with Vichy. Upon arrival at Chung King, the new capital of the country due to the Japanese occupation, Zinovy had to deal with the presence of another French mission sent by General Giraud, a competitor which he knew how to marginalize with subtlety. Made ambassador in November 1944, his presence once again gave him an occasion to demonstrate his capacity to make himself appreciated by leaders of all backgrounds which were so numerous in a China in full revolution. After this Chinese period, Peshkov was named French ambassador to Japan in 1946 (or more precisely, head of the French liaison mission with the superior allied commander in the Far East). He was close to General MacArthur, whom he admired, since upon the return of the hero of the Philippines, he was not able to hide the interest he showed toward this officer, who impressed him with his uniqueness. On December 14, 1946 he invested MacArthur with the Grand Cross of the Legion of Honor. Concerned with looking after the defeated, the diplomat devoted himself to creating ties of confidence with the Japanese government, which he succeeded gradually in achieving during his mandate. In 1950, General Peshkov was retired and replaced by Maurice Dejean. He left Japan for a final return to Paris. Two years later, the government granted him the honor of the Grand Cross of the Legion of Honor, which profoundly touched the young roughneck of Nijni Novgorod. The return to action of General de Gaulle in 1958 pleased General Peshkov, who had always respected the chief of Free France. Upon his return, the head of state did not forget his loyal ally of the hard times. He charged him with a number of diplomatic missions before sending him in 1964 to Chiang Kai-shek. Since France had decided to support Popular China ‚Äì i.e. to recognize it diplomatically ‚Äì the announcement of this turnaround had to be done with the greatest respect for the aged marshal in refuge in Taiwan. The choice of Zinovy was a great homage given to these two soldiers of exceptional destiny. Zinovy Peshkov died in Paris in November 1966. His ashes are in the Sainte-Genevi√®ve-des-Bois Russian Cemetery. At his request, his tombstone bears only the following inscription: \\"ZINOVI PECHKOFF LEGIONNAIRE 16 X 1884 27 XI 1966 Published work The Foreign Legion in Morocco, 1927.

As such, beta is a useful measure of the contribution of an individual asset to the risk of the market portfolio when it is added in small quantity. Thus, beta is referred to as an asset's non-diversifiable risk, its systematic risk, market risk, or hedge ratio. Beta is not a measure of idiosyncratic risk. Interpretation of values By definition, the value- weighted average of all market-betas of all investable assets with respect to the value-weighted market index is 1. If an asset has a beta above (below) 1, it indicates that its return moves more (less) than 1-to-1 with the return of the market-portfolio, on average.https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/beta.asp In practice, few stocks have negative betas (tending to go up when the market goes down). Most stocks have betas between 0 and 3. Treasury bills (like most fixed income instruments) and commodities tend to have low or zero betas, call options tend to have high betas (even compared to the underlying stock), and put options and short positions and some inverse ETFs tend to have negative betas. Importance as risk measure Beta is the hedge ratio of an investment with respect to the stock market. For example, to hedge out the market-risk of a stock with a market beta of 2.0, an investor would short $2,000 in the stock market for every $1,000 invested in the stock. Thus insured, movements of the overall stock market no longer influence the combined position on average. Beta thus measures the contribution of an individual investment to the risk of the market portfolio that was not reduced by diversification. It does not measure the risk when an investment is held on a stand-alone basis.  Technical aspects  =Mathematical definition= The market beta of an asset i is defined by (and best obtained via) a linear regression of the rate of return of asset i on the rate of return on the (typically value-weighted) stock-market index: :r_{i,t} = \\\\alpha_i + \\\\beta_i\\\\cdot r_{m,t} + \\\\varepsilon_t, where Œµt is an unbiased error term whose squared error should be minimized. The y-intercept is often referred to as the alpha. The ordinary least squares solution is :\\\\beta_i = \\\\frac {\\\\mathrm{Cov}(r_i,r_m)}{\\\\mathrm{Var}(r_m)}, where Cov and Var are the covariance and variance operators. Betas with respect to different market indexes are not comparable. = Relationship between own risk and beta risk = By using the relationships between standard deviation, variance and correlation: \\\\sigma \\\\equiv \\\\sqrt{\\\\mathrm{Var}(r)}, \\\\rho_{a,b} = \\\\mathrm{Cov}(r_a, r_b)/\\\\sqrt{ \\\\mathrm{Var}(r_a) \\\\mathrm{Var}(r_b) }, this expression can also be written as :\\\\beta_i = \\\\rho_{i,m}\\\\frac{\\\\sigma_i}{\\\\sigma_m}, where œÅi,m is the correlation of the two returns, and œÉi and œÉm are the respective volatilities. This equation shows that the idiosyncratic risk (œÉi) is related to but often very different market beta. If the idiosyncratic risk is 0 (i.e., the stock returns do not move), so is the market-beta. The reverse is not the case: A coin toss bet has a zero beta but not zero risk. Attempts have been made to estimate the three ingredient components separately, but this has not led to better estimates of market-betas. = Adding an asset to the market portfolio = Suppose an investor has all his money in the market m and wishes to move a small amount into asset class i. The new portfolio is defined by :r_p = (1 - \\\\delta) r_m + \\\\delta r_i. The variance can be computed as :\\\\operatorname{Var}(r_p) = (1 - \\\\delta)^2 \\\\operatorname{Var}(r_m) + 2 \\\\delta (1 - \\\\delta) \\\\operatorname{Cov}(r_m, r_i) + \\\\delta^2 \\\\operatorname{Var}(R_i) . For small deltas, the Œ¥2 terms can be ignored, :\\\\operatorname{Var}(r_p) \\\\approx (1 - 2 \\\\delta) \\\\operatorname{Var}(r_m) + 2 \\\\delta \\\\operatorname{Cov}(r_m,r_i). Using the definition of \\\\beta_i = \\\\operatorname{Cov}(r_m, r_i) / \\\\operatorname{Var}(r_i), this is :\\\\operatorname{Var}(r_p) / \\\\operatorname{Var}(r_m) \\\\approx 1 + 2 \\\\delta (\\\\beta_i - 1). This suggests that an asset with Œ≤ greater than 1 increases the portfolio variance, while an asset with Œ≤ less than 1 decreases it if added in a small amount. = Beta as a linear operator = Market-beta can be weighted, averaged, added, etc. That is, if a portfolio consists of 80% asset A and 20% asset B, then the beta of the portfolio is 80% times the beta of asset A and 20% times the beta of asset B. r_p = w_a\\\\cdot r_a + w_b\\\\cdot r_b \\\\Rightarrow \\\\beta_{p,m} = w_a\\\\cdot \\\\beta_{a,m} + w_b\\\\cdot \\\\beta_{b,m} .  Choice of market portfolio and risk- free rate  In practice, the choice of index makes relatively little difference in the market betas of individual assets, because broad value- weighted market indexes tend to move closely together. Academics tend to prefer to work with a value-weighted market portfolio due to its attractive aggregation properties and its close link with the CAPM. Practitioners tend to prefer to work with the S&P500; due to its easy in-time availability and availability to hedge with stock index futures. A reasonable argument can be made that the U.S. stock market is too narrow, omitting all sorts of other domestic and international asset classes. Thus another occasional choice would be the use of international indexes, such as the MSCI EAFE. However, even these indexes have returns that are surprisingly similar to the stock market. A benchmark can even be chosen to be similar to the assets chosen by the investor. For example, for a person who owns S&P; 500 index funds and gold bars, the index would combine the S&P; 500 and the price of gold. However, the resulting beta would no longer be a market-beta in the typical meaning of the term. The choice of whether to subtract the risk-free rate (from both own returns and market rates of return) before estimating market-betas is similarly inconsequential. When this is done, usually one selects an interest rate equivalent to the time interval (i.e., a one-day or one-month Treasury interest rate.) Empirical estimation It is important to distinguish between a true market-beta that defines the true expected relationship between the rate of return on assets and the market, and a realized market-beta that is based on historical rates of returns and represents just one specific history out of the set of possible stock return realizations. The true market- beta could be viewed as the average outcome if infinitely many draws could be observed---but because observing more than one draw is never strictly the case, the true market-beta can never be observed even in retrospect. Only the realized market-beta can be observed. However, on average, the best forecast of the realized market-beta is also the best forecast of the true market-beta. Estimators of market-beta have to wrestle with two important problems: # The underlying market betas are known to move over time. # Investors are interested in the best forecast of the true prevailing market-beta most indicative of the most likely future market-beta realization (which will be the realized risk contribution to their portfolios) and not in the historical market-beta. Despite these problems, a historical beta estimator remains an obvious benchmark predictor. It is obtained as the slope of the fitted line from the linear least-squares estimator. The OLS regression can be estimated on 1-5 years worth of daily, weekly or monthly stock returns. The choice depends on the trade off between accuracy of beta measurement (longer periodic measurement times and more years give more accurate results) and historic firm beta changes over time (for example, due to changing sales products or clients). = Improved estimators = Other beta estimators reflect the tendency of betas (like rates of return) for regression toward the mean, induced not only by measurement error but also by underlying changes in the true beta and/or historical randomness. (Intuitively, one would not suggest a company with high return [e.g., a drug discovery] last year also to have as high a return next year.) Such estimators include the Blume/Bloomberg beta (used prominently on many financial websites), the Vasicek beta, the Scholes- Williams beta, and the Dimson beta. * The Blume beta estimates the future beta as 2/3 times the historical OLS beta plus 1/3 times the number 1. A version based on monthly rates of return is widely distributed by Capital IQ and quoted on all financial websites. It predicts future market-beta poorly. * The Vasicek beta varies the weight between the historical OLS beta and the number 1 (or the average market beta if the portfolio is not value-weighted) by the volatility of the stock and the heterogeneity of betas in the overall market. It can be viewed either as an optimal Bayesian estimator or a random-effects estimator under the (violated) assumption that the underlying market-beta does not move. It is modestly difficult to implement. It performs modestly better than the OLS beta. * The Scholes-Williams and Dimson betas are estimators that account for infrequent trading causing non-synchronously quoted prices. They are rarely useful when stock prices are quoted at day's end and easily available to analysts (as they are in the US), because they incur an efficiency loss when trades are reasonably synchronous. However, they can be very useful in cases in which frequent trades are not observed (e.g., as in private equity) or in markets with rare trading activity. These estimators attempt to uncover the instant prevailing market-beta. When long-term market- betas are required, further regression toward the mean over long horizons should be considered.  Equilibrium use: fair reward for risk?  In the idealized capital asset pricing model (CAPM), beta risk is the only kind of risk for which investors should receive an expected return higher than the risk-free rate of interest. This is discussed in the CAPM article and the Security Market Line article. When used within the context of the CAPM, beta becomes a measure of the appropriate expected rate of return. Due to the fact that the overall rate of return on the firm is weighted rate of return on its debt and its equity, the market-beta of the overall unlevered firm is the weighted average of the firm's debt beta (often close to 0) and its levered equity beta.  Use in performance measurement  In fund management, adjusting for exposure to the market separates out the component that fund managers should have received given that they had their specific exposure to the market. For example, if the stock market went up by 20% in a given year, and a manager had a portfolio with a market-beta of 2.0, this portfolio should have returned 40% in the absence of specific stock picking skills. This is measured by the alpha in the market-model, holding beta constant. Non-market betas Occasionally, other betas than market-betas are used. The arbitrage pricing theory (APT) has multiple factors in its model and thus requires multiple betas. (The CAPM has only one risk factor, namely the overall market, and thus works only with the plain beta.) For example, a beta with respect to oil-price changes would sometimes be called an \\"oil-beta\\" rather than \\"market- beta\\" to clarify the difference. Betas commonly quoted in mutual fund analyses often measure the exposure to a specific fund benchmark, rather than to the overall stock market. Such a beta would measure the risk from adding a specific fund to a holder of the mutual fund benchmark portfolio, rather than the risk of adding the fund to a portfolio of the market. Special cases Utility stocks commonly show up as examples of low beta. These have some similarity to bonds, in that they tend to pay consistent dividends, and their prospects are not strongly dependent on economic cycles. They are still stocks, so the market price will be affected by overall stock market trends, even if this does not make sense. Foreign stocks may provide some diversification. World benchmarks such as S&P; Global 100 have slightly lower betas than comparable US-only benchmarks such as S&P; 100\\\\. However, this effect is not as good as it used to be; the various markets are now fairly correlated, especially the US and Western Europe. Derivatives are examples of non-linear assets. Beta relies on a linear model. An out of the money option may have a distinctly non-linear payoff. The change in price of an option relative to the change in the price of the underlying asset (for example a stock) is not constant. For example, if one purchased a put option on the S&P; 500, the beta would vary as the price of the underlying index (and indeed as volatility, time to expiration and other factors) changed.

It is a statutory body that regulates and inspects all clinics in the United Kingdom providing in vitro fertilisation (IVF), artificial insemination and the storage of human eggs, sperm or embryos. It also regulates human embryo research. Background to the establishment of the HFEA After the birth of Louise Brown, the world's first IVF baby, in 1978, there was concern about the implications of this new technology. In 1982, the UK government formed a committee chaired by philosopher Mary Warnock to look into the issues and see what action needed to be taken. Hundreds of interested individuals including doctors, scientists and organisations such as health, patient and parent organisations as well as religious groups gave evidence to the committee. In the years following the Warnock report, proposals were brought forward by the government in the publication of a white paper Human Fertilisation and Embryology: A Framework for Legislation in 1987. The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990 was drafted taking the report into account. Legal framework =Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990= The 1990 Act provided for the establishment of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA), an executive, non-departmental public body, the first statutory body of its type in the world. The HFEA is the independent regulator for IVF treatment and human embryo research and came into effect on 1 August 1991. The 1990 Act ensured the regulation, through licensing, of: *the creation of human embryos outside the body and their use in treatment and research *the use of donated gametes and embryos *the storage of gametes and embryos. The Act also requires the HFEA keep a database of every IVF treatment carried out since that date and a database relating to all cycles and use of donated gametes (egg and sperm). =Cloning= In 2001, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology (Research Purposes) Regulations 2001/188 extended the purposes for which embryo research could be licensed to include \\"increasing knowledge about the development of embryos\\", \\"increasing knowledge about serious disease\\", and \\"enabling any such knowledge to be applied in developing treatments for serious disease\\". This allows researchers to carry out embryonic stem cell research and therapeutic cloning providing that an HFEA Licence Committee considers the use of embryos necessary or desirable for one of these purposes of research. The Human Reproductive Cloning Act 2001 was introduced to explicitly prohibit reproductive cloning in the UK, but it was repealed Human Reproductive Cloning Act 2001 by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990 =Donor anonymity= In 2004, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (Disclosure of Donor Information) Regulations 2004/1511, enabled donor-conceived children to access the identity of their sperm, egg or embryo donor upon reaching the age of 18. The Regulations were implemented on 1 April 2005 and any donor who donated sperm, eggs or embryos from that date onwards is, by law, identifiable. Since that date, any person born as a result of donation is entitled to request and receive the donor's name and last known address, once they reach the age of 18. =European Union Tissues and Cells Directive= The European Union Tissues and Cells Directives (EUTCD) introduced common safety and quality standards for human tissues and cells across the European Union (EU). The purpose of the directives was to facilitate a safer and easier exchange of tissues and cells (including human eggs and sperm) between member states and to improve safety standards for European citizens. The EUTCD was adopted by the Council of Ministers on 2 March 2004 and published in the Official Journal of the European Union on 7 April 2004. Member States were obliged to comply with its provisions from 7 April 2006. =Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 2008= In 2005, the House of Commons Science and Technology Select Committee published a report on Human Reproductive Technologies and the Law. This inquiry investigated the legislative framework provided by the 1990 Act and challenges presented by technological advance and \\"recent changes in ethical and societal attitudes\\". In light of the Committee's report, and legislative changes that had already been made, the Department of Health undertook a review of the 1990 Act. They then held a public consultation based on their review of the Act, and following this published a White Paper, Review of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act, within which Government presented its initial proposals to revise the legislation. A Joint Committee of both houses scrutinised the Government's recommendations, and provided its views on what ought to be the final form of the Bill to be brought to parliament. The Bill was finally brought to the House of Lords in November 2007, passing through the House of Commons through Spring and Autumn of 2008, and finally receiving Royal Assent on 13 November 2008. The HFE Act 2008 updates the law to ensure it is fit for purpose in the 21st century. It is divided into three parts: #amendments to the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990 #parenthood #miscellaneous and general. The main new elements of the Act are: *ensuring that the creation and use of all human embryos outside the body ‚Äì whatever the process used in their creation ‚Äì are subject to regulation *a ban on selecting the sex of offspring for social reasons *continuing to require that clinics take account of \\"the welfare of the child\\" when providing fertility treatment, and replacing the previous requirement that they also take account of the child's \\"need for a father\\" with \\"supportive parenting\\" *allowing for the recognition of both partners in a same-sex relationship as legal parents of children conceived through the use of donated sperm, eggs or embryos *enabling people in same sex relationships and unmarried couples to apply for an order allowing for them to be treated as the parents of a child born using a surrogate *changing restrictions on the use of data collected by the HFEA to make it easier to conduct research using this information *provisions clarifying the scope of legitimate embryo research activities, including regulation of \\"human admixed embryos\\" (embryos combining both human and animal material). Current responsibilities The current statutory functions of the HFEA, as a regulator under the HFE Acts 1990 and 2008 and other legislation include: *license and monitor clinics carrying out in vitro fertilisation (IVF) and donor insemination *license and monitor establishments undertaking human embryo research *maintain a register of licences held by clinics, research establishments and storage centres *regulate storage of gametes (eggs and sperm) and embryos *implement the requirements of the European Union Tissue and Cells Directive (EUTCD) to relicense IVF clinics and to license Intrauterine Insemination (IUI), Gamete Intrafallopian Transfer (GIFT) and other services. Policy decisions *As of 2017, centres receiving sperm donation could distribute sperm to no more families than the number specified by the donor, and the donor could not specify more than ten. *In October and November 2007, the HFEA decided on a policy to reduce multiple births from fertility treatment. This forms part of a wider national strategy to reduce the risk of multiple births from fertility treatment involving professional bodies, patient groups and NHS-funding bodies. Multiple pregnancy is the single biggest risk to patients and children born as a result of fertility treatment. Women undergoing IVF treatment are twenty times more likely to have a multiple birth than if they conceive naturally. After carefully considering views from clinics, patients and professional bodies, the HFEA decided to set a maximum multiple birth rate that clinics should not exceed, which will be lowered each year. All clinics will have their own strategy setting out how they will lower the multiple birth rate in their clinic by identifying the patients for whom single embryo transfer is the most appropriate treatment. The HFEA aims to reduce multiple births from IVF treatment to 10% over a period of years. *In September 2007, after an extensive consultation with the UK public, the Authority decided that there is no fundamental reason to prevent cytoplasmic hybrid research.HFEA statement on its decision regarding hybrid embryos Individual research teams should be able to undertake research projects involving the creation of cytoplasmic hybrid embryos, provided that an HFEA Licence Committee is satisfied that their planned research is necessary and desirable. They must also meet the overall standards required by the HFEA for any embryo research. In January 2008, the HFEA granted licenses to Newcastle University and King's College London to carry out cytoplasmic hybrid research projects *In 2007 the Authority agreed to allow women to be able to donate their eggs to research projects, provided that there are strong safeguards in place to ensure the women are properly informed of the risks of the procedure and are properly protected from coercion *In 2006, the HFEA approved in principle the screening of embryos for genes that may lead to certain cancers in middle age *In 2005, the HFEA granted a licence to treat mitochondrial diseases by allowing researchers to attempt to create an embryo with two genetic mothers *In 2004, the HFEA granted British scientists a licence to produce cloned human cells, making it only the second country in the world to permit such a procedure Current and former members * Chair ‚Äì Sally Cheshire * Deputy Chair ‚Äì Gemma Hobcraft * Chief Executive ‚Äì Peter Thompson Former Chairs include Professor Lisa Jardine, Walter Merricks, Shirley Harrison, Lord Richard Harries, Dame Suzi Leather, Baroness Ruth Deech and Colin Campbell.

The sexes are similar. The yellow-crested cockatoo is found in wooded and cultivated areas of East Timor and Indonesia's islands of Sulawesi and the Lesser Sundas. It is easily confused with the largerBirdLife Species Factsheet, retrieved 10 February 2010Birds in backyards factsheets: Sulphur-crested Cockatoo and more common sulphur-crested cockatoo, which has a more easterly distribution and can be distinguished by the lack of pale yellow coloring on its cheeks (although some sulphur-cresteds develop yellowish patches).

The eggs are white and usually two in a clutch. The incubation is shared by both parents. The eggs are incubated for about 28 days and the chicks leave the nest about 75 days after hatching. Status and conservation A legally owned family pet from the United Kingdom The yellow- crested cockatoo is critically endangered. Numbers have declined dramatically due to illegal trapping for the cage-bird trade. Between 1980 and 1992, over 100,000 of these birds were legally exported from Indonesia, yet a German proposal submitted to CITES to move it to Appendix ICITES proposal was not approved. It has since been moved to Appendix I. The current population is estimated at fewer than 2,500 individuals and is thought to be declining in number. The subspecies C. s. abbotti is found only on the island of Masakambing. Its population on this tiny island (about 5 km2 or 1.9 mi2) had fallen to 10 as of June and July 2008. The decline results from trapping and logging, especially of mangrove (Avicennia apiculata) and kapok trees. Several national parks provide protection of their habitat, including Rawa Aopa Watumohai National Park on Sulawesi, Komodo National Park on Komodo Island, the national parks of Manupeu Tanah Daru and Laiwangi Wanggameti on Sumba, and the Nino Konis Santana National Park in East Timor (Timor-Leste). Introduced population An introduced population of these birds is found in Hong Kong They are a common sight across the densely populated area on both sides of the harbour, easily spotted in the woods and public parks in the north and west of Hong Kong Island. The large group has apparently developed from a number of caged birds that have been released into the Hong Kong area over many years. An often repeated story is that Hong Kong Governor Sir Mark Aitchison Young released the Government House's entire bird collection ‚Äì including a large number of yellow-crested cockatoos ‚Äì hours before surrendering Hong Kong to Japanese troops in December 1941.HK Magazine Friday, February 18th 2005, pp6-7 References  External links  * ARKive - images and movies of the yellow-crested cockatoo (Cacatua sulphurea) * mytoos.com - information on cockatoos in captivity * BirdLife Species Factsheet * Red Data Book yellow- crested cockatoo Category:Feral parrots Category:Birds of Sulawesi Category:Birds of the Lesser Sunda Islands yellow-crested cockatoo ","title":"Yellow-crested cockatoo"},{"id":"897567","text":"Insemination is the introduction of sperm into a female animal‚Äôs reproductive system for the purpose of impregnating or fertilizing the female for sexual reproduction. The sperm is introduced into the uterus of a mammal or the oviduct of an oviparous (egg-laying) animal. In mammals, insemination normally occurs during sexual intercourse or copulation, but insemination can take place in other ways, such as by artificial insemination. In humans, the act and form of insemination has legal, moral and interpersonal implications. However, whether insemination takes place naturally or by artificial means, the pregnancy and the progress of it will be the same. Insemination may be called in vivo fertilisation (from in vivo meaning \\"within the living\\") because an egg is fertilized inside the body, this is in contrast with in vitro fertilisation (IVF). In plants, the fertilization process is referred to as pollination. It is the process of transfer of pollen grains from one anther to stigma of other plants. Natural insemination Insemination of a woman by sexual intercourse is referred to as \\"natural insemination\\" (NI) (i.e., insemination by natural means). Natural insemination involves ejaculation during penile‚Äìvaginal penetration, with the erect penis deep inside the vagina, which is well lubricated. If an artificial lubricant needs to be used, care must be taken that it does not have spermicidal properties. The effects of vaginal lubricants on sperm function: an in vitro analysis During ejaculation, semen, containing male gametes known as sperm, is expelled through the penis into the moist and warm environment of the female‚Äôs reproductive tract. The semen then passes from the vagina through the vaginal vault, cervix and into the uterus, and then into the fallopian tubes. The average volume of semen produced at ejaculation is 2 to 5ml (about 1 teaspoon).https://www.netdoctor.co.uk/conditions/sexual-health/a12002/semen- and-sperm-quality/ Of the millions of sperm propelled during ejaculation, if an egg or ovum is present in a fallopian tube, fertilization may be achieved when any sperm reaches the ovum, at which point the objective of insemination is achieved. In most cultures, insemination by a male through sexual intercourse, whether the woman's husband, normal sex partner or not, is subject to social and sexual inhibitions and taboos, and has legal, moral and interpersonal implications. The term is also used in the context of third- party insemination, where a male who is not the woman's usual sexual partner (i.e., a sperm donor) fathers a child for the woman by providing his sperm through sexual intercourse rather than by providing his sperm for it to be used to produce a pregnancy in the woman by artificial means. The incidence of natural insemination by a sperm donor is usually a private matter, and may also carry greater health risks than where sperm has been processed by a fertility center. Advocates claim natural insemination generates higher pregnancy rates and a more 'natural' conception which does not involve the intervention and intrusion of third parties. However, it has not been medically proven that natural insemination has an increased chance of pregnancy. Additionally, conceiving through natural insemination is considered a natural process, so the father may be liable for child support and have custody and other rights of the child. The law usually draws a distinction between a man fathering a child by natural means, and a man who provides his sperm for it to be used to father a child by artificial means (i.e. by artificial insemination). Artificial insemination Artificial insemination Artificial insemination is the introduction of sperm into the reproductive tract of a female by means other than sexual intercourse for the purpose of impregnating or fertilizing the female. In humans, artificial insemination may be used when a woman or her normal sex partner cannot, for any of a number of reasons, conceive by natural means. A number of artificial insemination strategies are available, including intracervical insemination (ICI) and intrauterine insemination (IUI). Compared with natural insemination, artificial insemination may be more invasive, and may require professional assistance and medical expertise, which will have a higher cost. ICI attempts to simulate natural insemination, without the sexual element. It is painless and is the simplest, easiest and most common method of artificial insemination, and can be performed in the home, either by the female on herself or with non-professional assistance. ICI involves the introduction of unwashed or raw semen into the vagina at the entrance to the cervix, usually by means of a needleless syringe. The sperm for insemination may be provided by either a sexual partner of the female‚Äôs choice or by a sperm donor. Donor sperm is most commonly used by lesbian couples, single women,Single Mothers by Choice.com and heterosexual couples when the male partner is suffering from male infertility. There have been situations where a female has been inseminated with sperm collected from a female‚Äôs partner before him going off to war or even harvested after he has already died. What Is Posthumous Sperm Retrieval? How a Man Can Father Children Even After His Death There are laws in some countries which restrict and regulate who can donate sperm and who is able to receive artificial insemination, and the consequences of such insemination. Subject to any regulations restricting who can obtain donor sperm, donor sperm is available to all women who, for whatever reason, want or need it. Some women living in a jurisdiction which does not permit artificial insemination in the circumstance in which she finds herself may travel to another jurisdiction (a 'fertility destination') which permits it. (See Sperm donation laws by country.) Artificial insemination has been and continues to be commonly used in livestock breeding as an efficient way of increasing production. Other forms of insemination In various other animal species, sperm can be introduced into the female's reproductive tract by various means. For example, in some species of hemiptera sperm can be introduced violently by traumatic insemination, parenteral injection through the body wall. In some species of animals, sperm finds its way through the body wall when the spermatophore is left in contact with the female's skin, such as in the onychophora (velvet worms).

He was known for his aggressive batting and his fast-medium swing bowling. He is nicknamed \\"Zulu\\" because of his fluency in the Zulu language. Since his retirement he has occasionally commentated on cricket in both Zulu and Xhosa, as the two languages are mutually intelligible. In September 2019, Klusener was appointed as the head coach of the Afghanistan national cricket team. Career =Domestic career= Klusener played for KwaZulu-Natal (Nashua Dolphins) in the domestic level in South Africa between 1991 and 2004. In 2004, Northamptonshire County Cricket Club signed him on a contract running until late 2008. At Wantage Road he impressed with his fired- up seam bowling and his hard-hitting in the low middle-order. Due to family bereavements back home, it was announced that his contract with the county would not be renewed at the end of the 2008 season. In late 2007, he started playing in the Indian Cricket League Twenty20 tournament in India for the Kolkata Tigers team.Chennai Superstars bt Kolkata Tigers, enter final =International career= Klusener made his Test debut for South Africa against India in Calcutta during the second Test in 1996/97. At the time playing primarily as a bowler, Klusener took some fearful hammering in the first innings at the hands of Mohammad Azharuddin, who at one point hit him for five consecutive fours, but Klusener returned what would remain career best figures of eight for 64 in the second. Klusener will be remembered mainly for his contributions in One Day Internationals, in which he became feared as a hard hitting batsman and was voted as Man of the Tournament during the 1999 World Cup. He showed glimpses of his big-hitting in the years leading to the 1999 World Cup. His baseball-style backlift and thunderous hitting symbolised the tournament and his heroics nearly took South Africa to the final. He was also voted as a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 2000. His international career tapered off after this, due mainly to persistent ankle injuries, as well as a public dispute with the then South African captain Graeme Smith, who at a breakfast meeting shortly after his appointment to the captaincy described Klusener as a \\"disruptive force\\" to the younger players within the South African national cricket team, with the quote ending up in the South African press.Smith: Klusener can \\"ruin a team\\", Cricinfo, retrieved on 18 April 2009 Later Klusener and Smith patched up their differences.Klusener offers olive branch to Smith, Cricinfo, retrieved on 18 April 2009Klusener back in action, BBC Sport, retrieved on 18 April 2009 He had scored 1,906 runs in 49 matches with a highest score of 174 and 80 wickets with best of 8/64 in Test Matches. In ODI's he scored 3,576 runs in 171 matches at an average of 41.1 with a highest score of 103 and took 192 wickets with a best of 6/49. =1999 World Cup= In the 1999 Cricket World Cup, South Africa had progressed to the semi- finals, and Klusener till then had an excellent tournament, taking 17 wickets and scoring 250 runs (including two half centuries) in 8 matches and building a reputation as a hard-hitting batsman in tight situations. He won four Man of the Match awards out of the nine matches South Africa played in the tournament. The four awards were consecutive with respect to South Africa's wins (one match in between was won by Zimbabwe). The only other South African to win this award in this tournament was Jacques Kallis. The second semi-final was played between Australia and South Africa in Edgbaston, England. Australia, having been put in to bat, set a target of 214 for South Africa to chase in 50 overs. Klusener came in to bat when South Africa were 175/6 in 44.5 overs, and by virtue of his big-hitting (along with support from other batsmen), South Africa entered the final over at 205/9, needing nine runs to win with only one wicket remaining. The two batsmen at the crease were Klusener (on strike) and Allan Donald. Klusener scored consecutive fours in the first two balls of the over (bowled by Damien Fleming), levelling the scores and leaving South Africa with only 1 run to win in 4 balls with Klusener on strike. The third ball was a dot, and Donald narrowly escaped getting run out when he backed out too far and tried to get back to his crease. The fourth saw Klusener mis-hit his shot to mid-wicket fielder Mark Waugh. Klusener went for the run, although chances of a run-out were high and two balls were still remaining. However, Donald at the other end, keeping his eyes on the ball and hoping to avoid another mix-up like in the last delivery, did not see Klusener sprinting down the pitch and did not hear the call to run, and Klusener was almost at the bowler's end by the time Donald (who had also dropped his bat) began running. By then, Waugh had thrown the ball to Fleming, who rolled it to Adam Gilchrist who took the bails off at the other end, meaning Donald was run-out by some distance, thus ending the match with the scores level. However, a tie meant that Australia progressed to the final since they had beaten South Africa in the group stages of the tournament. As commentator Bill Lawry put it during the final ball: > \\"...this will be out surely ‚Äì oh it's out, it's gonna be run out...oh, that > is South Africa out ‚Äì Donald did not run, I cannot believe it. Australia go > into the World Cup Final ‚Äì ridiculous running with two balls to go. Donald > did not go, Klusener came ‚Äì what a disappointing end for South Africa.\\" Australia went on to win the tournament; although Klusener's heroics weren't in vain, as he was voted the Player of the Series.http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/65234.html In 2014, Klusener stated in an interview that Donald was not to blame for what happened. Klusener stated that he became impatient and, although he made it to the bowler's end, there was genuinely no run. After the match, he was cross at himself and regretted making that run.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRZdqb9LiiM  Coaching career  Klusener severed all of his ties with the Indian Cricket League in late 2009 and then completed a Level-three coaching course provided by Cricket South Africa in Spring 2010. Klusener confirmed he was in negotiations with the Bangladesh Cricket Board about becoming the team bowling coach. However, in early September 2010 the Bangladesh Cricket Board confirmed that they were still awaiting a response from Klusener.http://www.cricinfo.com/bangladesh/content/current/story/475371.html Lance Klusener had finally turned down the offer to take over as Bangladesh's bowling coach, replacing Sri Lanka's Champaka Ramanayake. Klusener was reportedly unable to convince his wife about a permanent move to Bangladesh.http://www.espncricinfo.com/bangladesh/content/story/475554.html From 2012 until 2016 he was head coach of the Dolphins, whom he represented in domestic cricket during his playing career, In 2016, he started as batting coach for the Zimbabwe national team. He also coached the Lyca Kovai Kings in India. In July 2019, Klusener was appointed as the head coach of the Glasgow Giants for the inaugural edition of the Euro T20 Slam cricket tournament. In September 2019, Klusener was appointed as the head coach of the Afghanistan national cricket team. Personal life Klusener enjoys fishing.

According to the 2018 QS World University Rankings: \\"In the field of Education, it is ranked 9th in the world and 2nd in Asia; in the field of linguistics, it is ranked 151-200th in the world; in the field of Psychology, it is ranked 251-300th in the world; in the field of Social Science and Management, it is ranked 323rd in the world\\". Graduates of EdUHK have been the recipients of about 75% of the Chief Executive's Award for Teaching Excellence since its inception in 2003/2004. History and recent developments The history of The Education University of Hong Kong (EdUHK) can be traced back to 1853. St. Paul's College introduced the first formalised program of in-service teacher training. This was described in its Annual Report for 1994/95. On 25 April 1994, under the recommendation made by the Education Commission Report No 5, The Hong Kong Institute of Education (HKIEd) was formally established by the merger of: *Northcote College of Education, established in 1939 and named after Sir Geoffrey Northcote, a former Governor of Hong Kong. The college was at 21 Sassoon Road, now headquarters of the Li Ka Shing Medical Faculty of HKU.http://www.hku.hk/daao/newsletter/web_0103/p24-27.pdf *Grantham College of Education, established in 1951 and named after Sir Alexander Grantham, a former Governor of Hong Kong. It was located at 42 Gascoigne Road. *Sir Robert Black College of Education, established in 1960 and named after Sir Robert Brown Black, a former Governor of Hong Kong. *Hong Kong Technical Teachers‚Äô College, established in 1974. *Institute of Language in Education, established in 1982 and previously under the supervision of the then Education Department. Established in 1994 upon the foundation of 70 years of teacher training by the former Colleges of Education, the HKIEd is the only University Grants Committee funded institution dedicated professional teacher education in Hong Kong. HKIEd provides doctorate, master and undergraduate degrees, postgraduate diploma, certificates and a range of in-service programmes to around 7,000 pre-service students and serving teachers. In October 1997, the Institute moved to its new campus in Tai Po near the Tai Po Industrial Estate. It has a Sports Centre at Pak Shek Kok, Tai Po, as well as a Town Centre campus in Tseung Kwan O. In 2001, the HKIEd HSBC Early Childhood Learning Centre was established on the campus. The HKIEd Jockey Club Primary School was founded on the campus in the following year. From 1 May 2004, the institute was granted self-accrediting status in respect of its own teacher education programs at degree-level and above. In June 2009, the Institute won extra annual funding of HK$22 million from the Hong Kong Government to provide 120 undergraduate degree places for three new undergraduate programs and 30 research postgraduate places for the 2009‚Äì2012 triennium. In January 2010, the University Grants Committee endorsed the HKIEd's plans for Research Postgraduate programmes and undergraduate programs in three disciplines: \\"Humanities\\" (mainly Language), \\"Social Sciences\\", and \\"Creative Arts & Culture\\". The approval is seen as a step closer for the institute to gaining its university title by becoming a fully-fledged university of education with a range of disciplines and strong research capacity. HKIEd will launch its first batch of non-education programmes, namely the Bachelor of Arts in Language Studies and Bachelor of Social Sciences in Global and Environmental Studies in September 2010. Both programs have already secured the support of the External Validation Panel of the Hong Kong Council for Accreditation of Academic and Vocational Qualifications. Preparations for the launching of the third Education-Plus programme, Bachelor of Arts in Creative Arts and Culture, in 2011/2012 are underway. The Institute operates four institute-level research centres had been set up to facilitate the growth of expertise in multi-disciplinary research. On 11 September 2015 the University Grants committee accepted the application by the Institute of Education to become a university, and on 26 January 2016 the adoption of the title \\"The Education University of Hong Kong\\" was approved. Accordingly, The Hong Kong Institute of Education (Amendment) will be gazetted on 19 February 2016 and introduced into the Legislative Council on 2 March 2016. In January 2016, the Institute was awarded self-accrediting status in three further programme areas, covered by its existing Programme Area Accreditation status: Chinese Studies, English Studies and Environmental Studies. On 27 May 2016, the Institute was formally renamed The Education University of Hong Kong in recognition of its \\"efforts and contributions over the years\\". Academic organisation There are three faculties and a number of non-faculty academic units at the University, which provide study programmes and courses for students. The Graduate School was established in April 2010 to support EdUHK (the then HKIEd) in the management and quality assurance of its higher degree programmes. =Faculties= * Faculty of Liberal Arts and Social Sciences * Faculty of Education and Human Development * Faculty of Humanities * Graduate School = Research centres= * Academy of Hong Kong Studies (AHKS) * Assessment Research Centre (ARC) * Centre for Governance and Citizenship (CGC) * The Joseph Lau Luen Hung Charitable Trust Asia Pacific Centre for Leadership and Change (APCLC) Major facilities =Sports centre= The 5.3 hectare Sports Centre is located at 55 Yau King Lane, Tai Po Kau, facing Tolo Harbour. It houses a range of outdoor and indoor sports and recreational facilities including: * grandstand with undercover seating for 1,200 spectators * 400-metre all-weather track with facilities for field events * natural grass soccer pitch * artificial turf soccer / hockey pitch * five tennis courts * jogging path with six fitness stations * fitness room * parking spaces. Controversy over the proposed HKIEd-CUHK merger In January 2007, a public row broke out between the management and the government over the future of the institute. Battle lines were drawn between the Vice-Chancellor Paul Morris and former Secretary for Education and Manpower, Prof. Arthur Li. The dispute had apparently been brewing for some time, as far back as June 2002, when the new Education Secretary Arthur Li was appointed. Apparently, Li favoured a merger of the institute with The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK). Morris opposed the merger, and had for some time been campaigning to establish the institute as a university in its own right. Morris maintained he had been warned by the Chairman of the Council, Dr. Thomas Leung Kwok-fai, as far back as June 2006, that his tenure would end unless he agreed to the amalgamation of the institute with the CUHK. =Timeline= *24 June 2002 ‚Äì Shortly after Li's appointment as Education Secretary, Li had apparently invited Morris to dinner and proposed a merger of the institute with the Chinese University. Li also apparently offered Morris to head the \\"super education centre\\". *19 July 2002 ‚Äì Morris was allegedly told by Simon Ip Sik-on, a former chairman of the institute's council, during a lunch he shared with Li and two other senior institute officials that Li threatened to render the institute unviable if a merger could not be achieved. *14 October 2002 ‚Äì Fanny Law had met with Arthur Li, Dr. Leung and its former vice chairman Alfred Chan Wing-kin. She issued an \\"internal email\\" to staff, stating the institute's wish for an early indication of a possible merger with the education faculty of the CUHK. *25 January 2007 ‚Äì The governing council of the institute decided in a vote of 10 to 3, with three abstentions, not to renew Vice Chancellor Morris' contract. Leung denied Morris' assertion about the threats to the security of his tenure, instead accusing Morris of misinterpreting him. Leung insisted that there was no connection between the two.RTHK news article This led to speculation that the Education and Manpower Bureau (EMB) was trying to force an amalgamation of the institute with the CUHK.Mingpao article , *26 January 2007 ‚Äì Deputy Vice Chancellor Professor Bernard Luk Hung-kay () alleged on RTHK Radio 1's Openline Openview phone-in program that during the summer of 2003, after results of the Language Proficiency Assessment for Teachers were released, the media reported (falsely) that most of 330 teachers who had failed in the test were from The Hong Kong Institute of Education. Professor Luk accused Law for not having set the record straight and alleged that this publicity resulted in a sharp fall in the number of applications for the next year, though the numbers had since recovered through hard work of the staff. Prof Luk also corroborated Vice Chancellor Morris' version of events by revealing a secret breakfast meeting that took place between Dr. Leung and the Vice Chancellor in June 2006. *5 February 2007 ‚Äì Luk alleged both in his open letterBernard Luk's article in MingPao and on RTHK Radio 1's Openline Openview program that Li had made veiled threats both against him and Morris in the past. For their refusal to make a news release denouncing those teachers who exceeded the placement quota for their profession and who were about to lose their current jobs, Arthur Li was quoted by Luk to have said on 26/27 June 2004, \\"I'll remember this. You will pay.\\" (The quote was said in English). Luk suggests in his letter that the time is up for his \\"pound of flesh.\\" Luk also alleged that during January 2004, Li had phoned Morris to once again urge Morris to take the lead in amalgamating with CUHK. He threatened to reduce future student intake quotas of HKIEd otherwise. Luk pointed out that there had been numerous newspaper articles written by IEd staff members in the past few years criticizing the EMB education reform and policies. Luk maintained this resulted in a number of phone calls from a certain high-ranking official in the EMB, demanding the immediate dismissals of those four staff members, which they refused to entertain.Prof. Luk's open letter *6 February 2007 ‚Äì Staff members Leung Yan-wing () and Ip Kin-yuen () asked Legco to investigate further or set up an open hearing into the allegations. Legco member Cheung Man Kwong told RTHK Radio 1's Openline Openview phone-in program that he along with eight other Democratic camp members had already written to Legco's Education Committee chairman Tsang Yok- sing, urging him to convene an emergency meeting to investigate these allegations of government interference in the running of IEd. Students overwhelmingly passed vote of no-confidence in Governing Board Chairman Thomas Leung Kwok-fai: of 680 the voters, only 36 students backed Leung. There were 65 abstentions and eight voided ballot papers. *7 February 2007 ‚Äì It was announced that Legco's Education Committee would convene on 12 February 2007 to discuss any further action and that it would invite both IEd representatives and Arthur Li himself if necessary.RTHK *9 March 2007 ‚Äì Pro- government legislators blocked an attempt to set up a Legco inquiry to investigate allegations over meddling with the academic freedom and autonomy of educational institutions. The vote failed by 30:21 with one abstention. *Chief Executive Donald Tsang set up a commission headed by Justice Woo Kwok- hing. *16 March 2007 ‚Äì Justice Woo Kwok-hing resigned to avoid potential accusations of lack of impartiality. *22 March 2007 ‚Äì Commission hearings commenced. *20 June 2007 ‚Äì The commission dismissed allegations that Li had interfered with the institutional autonomy, but pinned the blame on Fanny Law. Law resigned immediately from her post of Commissioner of the Independent Commission Against Corruption. *13 March 2009 ‚Äì the Secretary for Education took out a judicial review application to challenge the Commission's findings in 2007. In recognising that academic freedom is a self-contained right under Articles 34 and 137 of the Basic Law, the Court of First Instance held that the Permanent Secretary's (Mrs Fanny Law) approach did not violate the institute's right to academic freedom as she had not made any direct or indirect threats of sanction. The judicial review was allowed in March 2009.

For locals to visit the cost is Rp. 30,000 but foreign visitors are charged ten times that amount. There are a number of volcanoes and volcanic craters close to Bandung, such as the Kawah Putih crater lake around 50 km to the south. Together with Mount Burangrang and Bukit Tunggul, it is a remnant of the ancient Mount Sunda after the plinian eruption caused the Caldera to collapse. In April 2005, the Directorate of Volcanology and Geological Hazard Mitigation raised an alert, forbidding visitors from going up the volcano. \\"Sensors on the slopes of the two mountains - Anak Krakatoa on the southern tip of Sumatra Island and Tangkuban Perahu in Java - picked up an increase in volcanic activity and a build-up of gases, said government volcanologist Syamsul Rizal.\\"http://www.thejakartapost.com/detaillatestnews.asp?fileid=20050413185123&irec;=1 thejakartapost.com On the mountain's northern flank is Death Valley, which derives its name from a frequent accumulation of poisonous gases.Mount Tangkuban Perahu Tourism, indonesia-tourism.com History of volcanic activity A study conducted in 2001 determined that Tangkuban Perahu has erupted at least 30 times in the previous 40,750 years. Studies of the tephra layers within three kilometres of the crater revealed that 21 were minor eruptions and the remaining were significant eruptions. The eruptions that occurred prior to approximately 10,000 years ago were magmatic/phreatomagmatic, and the ones that occurred after 10,000 years ago were phreatic.Kartadinata, Okuno, Nakamura & Kobayashi, Eruptive History of Tangkuban Perahu Volcano, West Java, Indonesia : A Preliminary Report , Journal of Geography, 2001 The volcano erupted as recently as 26 July 2019.Smithsonian Institution Global Volcanism Program On 2 August 2019, the volcano experienced eight minor eruptions, and as a result, the place has been closed down for visitors. Legend The name translates roughly to \\"upturning of (a) boat\\" or \\"upturned boat\\" in Sundanese, referring to the local legend of its creation. The story tells of \\"Dayang Sumbi\\", a beauty who lived in West Java. She cast away her son \\"Sangkuriang\\" for disobedience, and in her sadness was granted the power of eternal youth by the gods. After many years in exile, Sangkuriang decided to return to his home, long after the two had forgotten and failed to recognise each other. Sangkuriang fell in love with Dayang Sumbi, his mother, and planned to marry her, only for Dayang Sumbi to recognise his birthmark just as he was about to go hunting. To prevent the marriage from taking place, Dayang Sumbi asked Sangkuriang to build a dam on the river Citarum and to build a large boat to cross the river, both before the sunrise. Sangkuriang meditated and summoned mythical ogre-like creatures -buto ijo or green giant(s)- to do his bidding. Dayang Sumbi saw that the tasks were almost completed and called on her workers to spread red silk cloths east of the city, to give the impression of impending sunrise. Sangkuriang was fooled, and upon believing that he had failed, kicked the dam and the unfinished boat, resulting in severe flooding and the creation of Tangkuban Perahu from the hull of the boat.

It is sometimes considered synonymous with ignosticism. Overview Theological noncognitivists argue in different ways, depending on what one considers the \\"theory of meaning\\" to be. One argument holds to the claim that definitions of God are irreducible, self-instituting relational, circular. For example, a sentence stating that \\"God is He who created everything, apart from Himself\\", is seen as circular rather than an irreducible truth. Michael Martin writing from a verificationist perspective concludes that religious language is meaningless because it is not verifiable.Martin, Michael. Atheism: A Philosophical Justification. Temple University Press, 1990. Martin, Michael. \\"Positive Atheism and The Meaninglessness of Theism\\", Infidels.org George H. Smith uses an attribute-based approach in an attempt to prove that there is no concept for God: he argues that there are no meaningful attributes, only negatively defined or relational attributes, making the term meaningless. An example: Consider the proposition of the existence of a \\"pink unicorn\\". When asserting the proposition, one can use attributes to at least describe the concept such a cohesive idea is transferred in language. With no knowledge of \\"pink unicorn\\", it can be described minimally with the attributes \\"pink\\", \\"horse\\", and \\"horn\\". Only then can the proposition be accepted or rejected. The acceptance or rejection of the proposition is distinct from the concept. It is asserted by Steven J. Conifer that to be a positive atheist, one who not only lacks a belief in gods but who furthermore denies that gods exist, is to give credence to the existence of a concept of something for God to refer to, because it assumes that there is something understandable to not believe in.Conifer, Steven J. \\"Theological Noncognitivism Examined\\" (archive) See also * Newton's flaming laser sword * Problem of religious language  References  External links * Atheism, Agnosticism, Noncognitivism (1998) by Theodore M.

Like most tunicates, larvaceans are filter feeders. Unlike most other tunicates, they live in the pelagic zone, specifically in the photic zone, or sometimes deeper. They are transparent planktonic animals, generally less than in body length, excluding the tail. Anatomy The larvacean resembles that of the tadpole-like larvae of most tunicates. Like a common tunicate larva, the adult Appendicularia have a discrete trunk and tail. Lervaceans produce a test ‚Äì a shell made of protein and cellulose ‚Äì called a \\"house\\". In most species, the house surrounds the animal like a bubble. Even for species in which the house does not completely surround the body, such as Fritillaria, the house is always present and attached to at least one surface. These houses are discarded and replaced regularly as the animal grows in size and its filters become clogged; in Oikopleura, a house is kept for no more than four hours before being replaced. No other tunicate is able to abandon its test in this fashion. Discarded larvacean houses account for a significant fraction of organic material descending to the ocean depths. The tail of larvaceans contain a central notochord, a dorsal nerve cord, and a series of striated muscle bands enveloped either by epithelial tissue (oikopleurids) or by an acellular basement membrane (fritillarids). Unlike the Ascidiacea larvae, the tail nerve cord in larvaceans contain some neurons. Feeding Larvaceans have greatly improved the efficiency of food intake by producing a test, which contains a complicated arrangement of filters that allow food in the surrounding water to be brought in and concentrated prior to feeding. By regularly beating the tail, the larvacean can generate water currents within its house that allow the concentration of food. The high efficiency of this method allows larvaceans to feed on much smaller nanoplankton than most other filter feeders. Like most tunicates, larvaceans feed by drawing particulate food matter into their pharyngobranchial region, where food particles are trapped on a mucus mesh produced by the pharynx and drawn into the digestive tract. The mucus mesh lies over two clefts in the pharynx, one on either side, rather than the much larger number of clefts found in most other tunicates. Furthermore, the Appendicularia retain the ancestral Chordate characteristics of having the clefts, and the anus open directly to the outside, and by the lack of the atrium and the atrial siphon found in related classes. Reproduction and genetics larvaceans reproduce sexually. The immature animals resemble the tadpole larvae of ascidians, albeit with the addition of developing viscera. Once the trunk is fully developed, the larva undergoes \\"tail shift\\", in which the tail moves from a rearward position to a ventral orientation and twists 90¬∞ relative to the trunk. Following tail shift, the larvacean begins secretion of the first house. The recent development of techniques for expressing foreign genes in Oikopleura dioica has led to the advancement of this species as a model organism for the study of gene regulation, chordate evolution, and development.

It removes airborne grease, combustion products, fumes, smoke, heat, and steam from the air by evacuation of the air and filtration. In commercial kitchens exhaust hoods are often used in combination with fire suppression devices so that fumes from a grease fire are properly vented and the fire is put out quickly. Commercial vent hoods may also be combined with a fresh air fan that draws in exterior air, circulating it with the cooking fumes, which is then drawn out by the hood. In most exhaust hoods, a filtration system removes grease (the grease trap) and other particles. Although many vent hoods exhaust air to the outside, some recirculate the air to the kitchen. In a recirculating system, filters may be used to remove odors in addition to the grease. The device is known as an extractor hood in the United Kingdom and Singapore, as a range hood in Canada and the United States, and as a rangehood in Australia and New Zealand. It is also called a kitchen hood, stove hood, exhaust hood, cooker hood, vent hood, or ventilation hood. Other names include cooking canopy, extractor fan, fume extractor, and electric chimney. Description An extractor hood consists of three main components: a skirt or capture panel to contain the rising gases (also known as the \\"effluent plume\\"), one or more grease filters, and a fan or tangential blower for forced ventilation. There are two major configurations of extractor hoods: ducted (or vented) application, and ductless (or recirculating) application. In a ducted application, the output collar of the extractor hood's blower motor is attached to a duct system, which terminates outside the building. In a ductless application, a filter, often containing activated charcoal, removes odor and smoke particles from the air before releasing the cleaned air back into the kitchen. A ducted system allows for removal of all forms of airborne contamination, while a ductless one recirculates heat and moisture into the kitchen. In addition, a ducted application eliminates the need for regular replacement of the filters, and avoids the airflow restriction (and resultant loss of power) caused by them. However, ducted application can be impractical, due to lack of space or ability to install a duct system, make-up air requirements, or the additional cost of heating/cooling the make-up air. Some range hood designs allow for both types of applications. Exhaust hoods almost always include built-in lighting to illuminate the cooking surface. In addition, some manufacturers offer matching accessories, such as backsplash panels, pot racks, shelf units, or dish racks. The main advantage of an extractor hood is that it can easily filter the airflow, without harming the edible materials and can be easily installed if it is semi-automatic. Extractor hoods controls are typically electronic, though some low-end models use electromechanical controls. Extractor hoods with electronic controls can offer remote control, motorized height adjustment, thermal sensor, overheat protection, boost mode, delayed shut-off, filter cleaning reminder, active noise cancellation, temperature display, user presets (memory), and so on. Extractor hoods may be made from a variety of materials, including: stainless steel, copper, bronze, nickel silver, zinc, tempered glass, wood, aluminum, brass, heat-resistant plastics, and more. NFPA 96 Standard for Ventilation Control and Fire Protection of Commercial Cooking says that mesh filters shall not be used. It requires that \\"Listed\\" grease filters shall be tested in accordance with UL 1046, Standard for Grease Filters for Exhaust Ducts. Types of kitchen hoods Kitchen hoods are broadly classified into ducted hoods and ductless hoods. This classification of these kitchen hoods is done purely on the basis of how the hoods process the air that is being sucked in. =Ducted kitchen hoods= Ducted kitchen hoods are the most common and a primary type of kitchen hood. As the name suggests, a ducted kitchen hood has a duct that is used to process and expel any smoke that is generated on top of the kitchen hob. Saturday, 25 May 2019 Large sized duct hoods are widely used not just in homes but also in commercial restaurants and communal kitchens too. =Ductless kitchen hoods= Ductless kitchen hoods do not have a duct that is used to process the air. Instead, it makes use of strong air filtration and then pumps out the air back into the room. These types of range hoods are usually used in houses. Filters A filter is pertinent to a kitchen hood as it helps in filtering the odours that are generated while cooking. A filter will take in all the odour, the dust and dirt that passes through the hood and clears out the airways. = Types of filters = Broadly, kitchen hood filters are available in three different types. Mesh filters Also known as cassette filters, mesh filters are made from aluminium mesh strips placed one over the other in succession. They are highly effective in the capture and removal of oil and grease from smoke of both ducted and ductless chimneys. With the volume of filtration being high, these types of filters need to be cleaned once every week. Baffle filters These type of filters are made out of steel/aluminium frames with curved panels. The curves in these panels are capable of catching up on grease, oil and other such particulates. Highly durable and easy to clean, they need to be cleaned once every month and are used in both ducted and ductless chimneys. Charcoal filters Charcoal filters are made out of fine powdered activated carbon charcoal that is in a honeycomb structure. Used primarily in a ductless chimney for the filtration of odors, a charcoal filter has no cleaning method and is usually replaced once every 6 months or so. = Cleaning kitchen hood filters = A kitchen hood filter gathers up dust and dirt all along while it is clearing it out. This will decrease the quality of air that is being filtered out regularly. Hence, for a better performance of the kitchen hood, the filter must either be replaced or cleaned once every fortnight. In order to clean a kitchen hood filter, the simplest method is to use baking powder. For this, the hood filter is placed in a large pot of water, drop in half a spoon of baking powder. This pot with the filter and the baking powder is now heated to boil on a stove. As the water boils, the grease and the dirt can be seen being removed slowly and steadily. Hood overhang Greater hood overhangs are suggested to help contain cooking fires in the hood area protected by the fire suppression system.Optimizing Airflows in Foodservice Facilities - Part 2  TABLE 1.

Sarada Devi is also reverentially addressed as the Holy Mother (Sri Sri Maa) by the followers of the Sri Ramakrishna monastic order. Sri Sarada Devi or Sri Sri Maa is one of the notable woman saints and mystics of the nineteenth century. She paved the way for the future generation of women to take up monasticity as the means and end of life. In fact the Sri Sarada Math and Ramakrishna Sarada Mission situated at Dakshineshwar is based on the ideals and life of Sri Sri Maa. Sri Sarada Devi played an important role in the growth of the Ramakrishna Movement. Sri Sarada Devi was born in Joyrambati. At the age of five she was betrothed to Sri Ramakrishna, whom she joined at Dakshineswar Kali temple when she was in her late teens. According to her biographers, both lived lives of unbroken continence, showing the ideals of a householder and of the monastic ways of life. After Sri Ramakrishna's death, Maa Sarada Devi stayed most of the time either at Joyrambati or at the Udbodhan office, Calcutta. The disciples of Sri Ramakrishna regarded her as their own mother, and after their guru's death looked to her for advice and encouragement. The followers of the Ramakrishna movement and a large section of devotees across the world worship Sri Sri Maa Sarada Devi as an incarnation of the Adi Parashakti or the Divine Mother. Biography = Birth and parentage = Sarada Devi's house at Joyrambati (centre) where she lived for the majority of her life Saradamani Devi was born of Brahmin parents as the eldest daughter on 22 December 1853, in the quiet village of Jayrambati in present-day West Bengal, India. Her parents, Ramachandra Mukhopadhyay and Shyama Sundari Devi,https://belurmath.org/sri-sarada-devi/ were poor. Her father Ramchandra earned his living as a farmer and through the performance of priestly duties. According to traditional accounts, Ramachandra and Syama Sundari had visions and supernatural events foretelling the birth of a divine being as their daughter.Gahanananda, p. 95 Sarada lived the simple life of an Indian village girl. As a child Sarada‚Äîthen known as Saradamani‚Äîwas fascinated by traditional Hindu folklore and narratives. As in the case of most girls of rural upbringing, she did not receive any formal education but learned to serve others as she helped her mother run a large household and looked after her younger brothers. During the terrible famine of 1864, Sarada worked ceaselessly as her family served food to hungry people. She was interested in the clay models of goddesses Kali and Lakshmi, which she worshiped regularly. She is said to have started meditating from her childhood and traditional accounts recount her mystic visions and experiences. According to Sarada Devi, she used to see a bevy of eight girls of her age coming from an unknown place and escorting her in her chores during her childhood.Gahanananda, p. 96 = Betrothal = Ramakrishna‚Äîthen known as Gadadhar Chattopadhayay and a priest of the Dakshineswar Kali Temple since 1855‚Äîwas practising spiritual austerities. His mother and brother thought that a marriage would be a good steadying effect on him, by diverting his attention away from spiritual austerities and visions.Jackson, p. 18 It is reported that Ramakrishna himself indicated Saradamani as the bride.Gahanananda, p. 97 \\"Vain is your search in this place and that. Go to Jayrambati, and there in the house of Ramachandra Mukhopadhyaya, you will find her who is marked out for me.\\" In May 1859, Sarada was betrothed to Ramakrishna. Sarada was 5 years old and Ramakrishna was 23; the age difference was typical for 19th century rural Bengal.Jackson, p. 18 \\"Such child marriages were still widespread in nineteenth-century India, despite vehement condemnations by both English authorities and Hindu reformers. Analogous to the Western betrothal, child marriage committed the partners to one another, with the actual of living together and assuming family responsibilities delayed until puberty.\\"Spivak, p. 207 After the betrothal, Sarada was left to the care of her parents and Ramakrishna returned to Dakshineswar. Sarada next met Ramakrishna when she was fourteen years old, and she spent three months with him at Kamarpukur. There, Ramakrishna imparted to Sarada instructions on meditation and spiritual life.Gahanananda, p. 98 Ramakrishna's frequent bhava samadhi (ecstasy)http://www.belurmath.org/gospel/chapter01.htm and unorthodox ways of worship led some onlookers to doubt his mental stability, while others regarded him as a great saint. Sarada joined Ramakrishna at Dakshineswar in 1872 on her own accord when she was eighteen, after hearing these rumours about his mental health. She found Ramakrishna to be a kind and caring person. = At Dakshineswar Kali Temple = The south side of the nahabat (music tower), where Sarada Devi lived in a small room on the ground floor. Sarada Devi's tiny room on the ground floor of the nahabat, now a shrine At Dakshineswar, Sarada Devi stayed in a tiny room in the nahabat (music tower). She stayed at Dakshineswar until 1885, except for short periods when she visited Jayrambati.Gahanananda, p. 99 By this time Ramakrishna had already embraced the monastic life of a sannyasin; as a result, the marriage was never consummated.Carl T. Jackson, Vedanta for the West, p. 18 As a priest, Ramakrishna performed the ritual ceremony‚Äîthe Shodashi Puja where Sarada Devi was made to sit in the seat of goddess Kali, and worshiped as the divine mother Tripurasundari. According to Swami Saradananda a direct disciple of Ramakrishna, Ramakrishna married to show the world an ideal of a sexless marriage. Ramakrishna regarded Sarada as an incarnation of the Divine Mother, addressing her as Sree Maa (Holy Mother) and it was by this name that she was known to Ramakrishna's disciples. Sarada Devi's days began at 3 am. After finishing her ablutions in the BhƒÅgirathi-Hooghly, she would practice japa and meditation until daybreak.Gahanananda, p. 102 Ramakrishna taught her the sacred mantras, and instructed her how to initiate people and guide them in spiritual life. Sarada Devi is regarded as Ramakrishna's first disciple. Except for her hours of meditation, most of her time was spent in cooking for Ramakrishna and the growing number of his devotees. While Sarada Devi remained completely in the background, her unassuming, warm personality attracted some female devotees to become her lifelong companions.The Gospel of the Holy Mother, \\"Introduction\\" During Ramakrishna's last days, during which he suffered from throat cancer, Sarada Devi played an important role in nursing him and preparing suitable food for him and his disciples. It is reported that after Ramakrishna's death in August 1886, when Sarada Devi tried to remove her bracelets as the customs dictated for a widow, she had a vision of Ramakrishna in which he said, \\"I have not passed away, I have gone from one room to another.\\"Gahanananda, p. 105 According to her, whenever she thought of dressing like a widow, she had a vision of Ramakrishna asking her not to do so.Gahanananda, p. 107 After Ramakrishna's death, Sarada Devi continued to play an important role in the nascent religious movement. She remained the spiritual guide of the movement for the next 34 years.Hixon, p. xv = Pilgrimage = After Ramakrishna's death, Sarada Devi began her pilgrimage through North India, accompanied by a party of women disciples including Lakshmi Didi, Gopal Ma, and Ramakrishna's householder and monastic disciples. The party visited the Vishwanath Temple of god Shiva at Banaras and the city of Ayodhya, which is associated with life of god Rama. Later, she visited Vrindavan which is associated with Lord Krishna. According to traditional accounts, at Vrindavan, she experienced nirvikalpa samadhi and began her role as guru. She initiated several of Ramakrishna's disciples including Mahendranath Gupta, Yogen with a mantra.Gahanananda, pp. 107‚Äì108 According to her traditional biographers and disciples, to call her \\"Mother\\" was no mere expression of respect and all those who met her became aware of a maternal quality in her. = At Calcutta = Sarada Devi worshiping at her Udbodhan residence in Calcutta. After the pilgrimage, Sarada Devi lived alone in Kamarpukur, the village where Ramakrishna was born. There, she endured poverty, verging on starvation for a year. In 1888, when the news reached the lay and monastic disciples of Ramakrishna that she needed their care and attention, they invited her to Calcutta and arranged for her stay. Swami Saradananda built a permanent house for Sarada Devi in Calcutta. The house was named the Udbodhan House, after the Bengali monthly magazine published by the Ramakrishna Math. The house, also known as Mayerbati (\\"Holy Mother's House\\"), is where she spent the longest period of her life outside Jayrambati. Sarada Devi went to Calcutta because she had many hardships in Kamarpukur. She had no financial resources and about no one could take care of her. She tried to hide her situation, but it leaked out. When the devotees at Calcutta heard this, they persuaded Sarada Devi to come to Calcutta.A Short Life of The Holy Mother by Swami Bodhasarananda At Udbodhan House, Sarada Devi was accompanied by other women disciples and devotees of Ramakrishna, Golap Ma, Yogin Ma, Gopaler Ma, Lakshmi Didi and Gauri Ma being the best known. An increasing number of people began to flock for guidance, instructions and spiritual initiation.Gahanananda, p. 115‚Äì116 Other Western women followers of Ramakrishna Order including Sister Nivedita and Sister Devamata formed close relationship with her. According to her biographers, her innate motherliness put visitors at ease. Swami Nikhilananda, her direct disciple writes, \\"Though she had no children of the flesh, she had many of the spirit.\\" She regarded all her disciples as her own children. Sarada Devi received the highest reverence from the Ramakrishna Order and its devotees. Ramakrishna had bade her continue his mission after his death and wanted his disciples not to make any distinction between himself and her. According to her devotees and traditional biographers, the hospitality of Sarada Devi was unique and was characterised by motherly care and solicitude.Gahanananda, p. 113 Traditional accounts recount the mystical experiences of her devotees. Some dreamt of her as a goddess in human form though they had never seen her picture before. Others reportedly received their initiation from her in their dream. One such example is of Girish Chandra Ghosh, the father of Bengali drama, who reportedly saw Sarada Devi in a dream when he was nineteen years old and received a mantra. When he met her many years later, to his astonishment she was the same person in the dream.Gahanananda, p. 115 = Last days = Sarada Devi spent her final years moving back and forth between Jayrambati and Calcutta. In January 1919, Sarada Devi went to Jayrambati and stayed there for over a year. For the next five months she continued to suffer. Shortly before her death, she gave the last advice to the grief-stricken devotees, \\"But I tell you one thing‚Äîif you want peace of mind, do not find fault with others. Rather see your own faults. Learn to make the whole world your own. No one is a stranger my child: this whole world is your own!\\" This is considered as her last message to the world. She died at 1.30 am on Tuesday the 21 July 1920 at Mayer Badi (in the first floor of the Shrine Room), Kolkata. Her body was cremated at the Belur Math, opposite side of River Ganga where her husband Sri Ramakrishna's body was cremated at Kashipore,Baranagroe,Ratan,Babu ghat. The place where she was cremated is now known as Holy Mother's ghat at Belurmath. Today a temple stands at that spot. Teachings and quotes Sarada Devi did not write any books; her utterances and reminiscences have been recorded by her disciples including Swami Nikhilananda, Swami Tapasyananda. Though uneducated Sarada Devi's spiritual insight and utterances are highly regarded by scholars like Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak, who writes, \\"We have bits and pieces of her exquisite remarks as testimony.\\" *Practise meditation, and by and by your mind will be so calm and fixed that you will find it hard to keep away from meditation.Gahanananda, p. 118 *The mind is everything. It is in the mind alone that one feels pure and impure. A man, first of all, must make his own mind guilty and then alone can he see another man's guilt.Gahanananda, p. 119 * \\"I tell you one thing. If you want peace of mind, do not find fault with others. Rather see your own faults. Learn to make the whole world your own. No one is a stranger, my child; the whole world is your own.\\" * One must have devotion towards one's own guru. Whatever may be the nature of the guru, the disciple gets salvation by dint of his unflinching devotion towards his guru.Gahanananda, p. 120  Impact and legacy  Sarada Devi played an important role as the advisory head of a nascent organisation that became a monastic order devoted to social work‚Äîthe Ramakrishna Mission. Gayatri Spivak writes that Sarada Devi \\"performed her role with tact and wisdom, always remaining in the background.\\" She also initiated several prominent monks into the Ramakrishna Order. Swami Nikhilananda, who was a freedom fighter and a follower of Mahatma Gandhi, accepted Sarada Devi as his guru and joined the Ramakrishna Order. He eventually founded the Ramakrishna-Vivekananda Center in New York.Hixon, p.xiii Though uneducated herself, Sarada Devi advocated education for women. She entrusted Devamata with the implementation of her dream‚Äîa girls' school on the Ganges, where Eastern and Western pupils could study together. In 1954, Sri Sarada Math and Ramakrishna Sarada Mission, a monastic order for women was founded in the honour of Sarada Devi. Swami Vivekananda wrote a letter to her to get her opinion about his intention to attend the Parliament of Religions in Chicago. Only after receiving the blessing from her did he decide to go to America.

Beginning as a writer (and later director) of comedy films, he is best known for his work for Hammer, for whom he directed 14 films, and science fiction films. He enjoyed a long career in the film industry from the early 1930s until the early 1980s. Reprinted from Reference Guide to British and Irish Film Directors Early life and career Guest was born to John Simon Grossman and Julia Ann Gladys Emanuel in Maida Vale, London. He later changed his name to Val Guest (officially in 1939). His father was a jute broker, and the family spent some of Guest's childhood in India before returning to England. His parents divorced when he was young, but this information was kept from him. Instead he was told that his mother had died. He was educated at Seaford College in Sussex, but left in 1927 and worked for a time as a bookkeeper. Guest's initial career was as an actor, appearing in productions in London theatres. He also appeared in a few early sound film roles, before he left acting and began a writing career. =Writer= For a time, around 1934, he was the London correspondent for The Hollywood Reporter (when the publication began a UK edition),Wheeler Winston Dixon, Rutgers University Press, 11 July 2007, Film Talk: Directors at Work, Retrieved 10 November 2014 (see page 26 paragraph two), before beginning work on film screenplays for Gainsborough Pictures. This came about because the director Marcel Varnel had been incensed by comments Guest had made in his regular column, \\"Rambling Around\\", about the director's latest film. Challenged to write a screenplay by Varnel, Guest co-wrote his first script, which became No Monkey Business (1935) directed by Varnel. This was to be the beginning of a long and fruitful partnership between the two men. Guest was placed under contract as a staff writer at Gainsborough's Islington Studios in Poole Street. Guest wrote screenplays for the rest of the decade. His credits included All In (1936) for Varnel; Public Nuisance No. 1 (1936); A Star Fell from Heaven (1936); O-Kay for Sound (1937) for Varnel with The Crazy Gang; Alf's Button Afloat (1938) with Flanagan and Allen. He also wrote the Will Hay comedies Oh, Mr Porter! (1937) and Ask a Policeman (1939). He wrote Hi Gang! (1941) for Ben Lyon and Bebe Daniels. Directing career Guest became a fully-fledged director in the early 1940s (he had been responsible for some second-unit work previously). His first film was an Arthur Askey short, The Nose Has It (1942), warning of the dangers of spreading infection. Guest's debut feature was Miss London Ltd. (1943), again with Askey; Guest had worked on the scripts of earlier Askey films. Guest's second feature as director also starred Askey, Bees in Paradise (1944). He followed this with two films starring Vic Oliver and Margaret Lockwood, Give Us the Moon (1944) and I'll Be Your Sweetheart (1945); the latter was the first and only musical from Gainsborough Studios. Guest directed two films based on the Just William stories, Just William's Luck (1947) and William Comes to Town (1948). He wrote and directed a thriller, Murder at the Windmill (1949). =Yolande Donlan= Guest then made the comedy Miss Pilgrim's Progress (1949) with Yolande Donlan who became his wife. The two reunited on The Body Said No! (1950); Mister Drake's Duck (1951), with Douglas Fairbanks Jr.; Penny Princess (1952) with Dirk Bogarde. =Hammer Films= Guest began an association with Hammer films when he directed The Men of Sherwood Forest (1954). After The Runaway Bus (1955) with Frankie Howerd he made Life with the Lyons (1955) with Daniels and Lyon, a spin off of their radio show. It was popular enough for Guest to make a sequel The Lyons in Paris (1955). He did a thriller Break in the Circle (1954) and Dance, Little Lady (1954). Despite his career in comedy films, he was offered the chance to direct Hammer's first Quatermass film, adapted from the BBC television serial by Nigel Kneale. Uncertain about taking it on, (he was not a fan of science fiction), he was persuaded to do so by his wife, Yolande Donlan. Guest shot The Quatermass Xperiment (1955) as though it was a television documentary.Obituary: Val Guest, Daily Telegraph, 16 May 2006 Its success led the Hammer company changing its direction. He followed it with a drama They Can't Hang Me (1955) and musical It's a Wonderful World (1956). Republic Pictures hired him to make the thriller The Weapon (1956) and he directed a comedy, Carry On Admiral (1957). Quatermass had been a big hit and Hammer asked Guest to direct the first sequel, Quatermass 2 (1957). They also used him to do The Abominable Snowman (1957), from a Kneale TV play, and a POW movie, The Camp on Blood Island (1958). Guest made a comedy Up the Creek which led to a sequel Further Up the Creek (1958). Hammer asked him back to do another war movie, Yesterday's Enemy (1959) with Stanley Baker. Then he made the film version of Expresso Bongo (1959) with Dolan, giving an early role to Cliff Richard. Guest returned to comedy with Life Is a Circus (1960) starring Bud Flanagan. He made another for Hammer with Stanley Baker, a tough crime film, Hell Is a City (1960). He followed this with a thriller for Hammer, The Full Treatment (1960). Guest's next film, The Day the Earth Caught Fire (1961), won Guest and Wolf Mankowitz a BAFTA Award for Best Screenplay.\\"Film: Best British Screenplay 1962\\", BAFTA Guest made Jigsaw (1962) and 80,000 Suspects (1963).

Later career Guest was one of five credited directors (another was John Huston) to work on the spoof James Bond film Casino Royale (1967), a critically mauled picture in its day. Producer Charles K. Feldman asked Guest if he would direct, linking material to make what was left uncompleted, after the departure of Peter Sellers from the project, into a coherent narrative. Guest opted for an 'Additional Sequences' credit after he saw the completed film. He made a thriller Assignment K (1968) then a musical Toomorrow (1970), a film with Olivia Newton-John in the lead. According to Christopher Hawtree, it is \\"a staggeringly dreadful movie\\". Guest issued an injunction against Harry Saltzman, the producer, because he had not been paid for his work, and the film was quickly pulled from screenings. Around the same time, Guest wrote and directed When Dinosaurs Ruled the Earth (1970) for Hammer. Guest directed the soft core sex comedy Au Pair Girls (1972) and he followed this by directing the first of the Confessions of... series of sex comedy films, Confessions of a Window Cleaner (1974).

Guest's final feature film work was writing and directing The Boys in Blue (1982), a vehicle for the British comedy double act Cannon and Ball. The film was a remake of a Will Hay picture, Ask a Policeman (1939), which Guest himself had co-written. An autobiography, So You Want to be in Pictures, was published in 2001. His last professional work was as the director of several episodes of the Hammer House of Mystery and Suspense series in 1984 and 1985. Private life and honours Originally married to Pat Watson, the couple divorced after Guest fell in love with American actress Yolande Donlan who eventually became his wife in 1954; Donlan appeared in eight of his films during the 1950s.Ronald Bergan \\"Yolande Donlan obituary\\", The Guardian, 5 January 2015 After Guest retired in 1985, the couple lived together in retirement in California.

He coined the term \\"rhythm and blues\\", and was integral in signing and/or producing many of the biggest acts of the time, including Ray Charles, the Allman Brothers, Chris Connor, Aretha Franklin, Led Zeppelin, Wilson Pickett, Dire Straits, Dusty Springfield and Bob Dylan. Wexler was inducted to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1987 and in 2017 to the National Rhythm & Blues Hall of Fame. Early life Wexler was born in The Bronx, New York City, the son of a German Jewish father and a Polish Jewish mother; he grew up in the Washington Heights neighborhood of Upper Manhattan.\\"Jerry Wexler\\" by Richard Williams, The Guardian, 17 August 2008. \\"Born to a German-Jewish father who struggled to make a living from a window-cleaning business and a doting Russian-Jewish mother whose socialist inclinations led her to sell the Daily Worker on the streets of Harlem, he was brought up in the Washington Heights district of Manhattan\\".Kahn, Ashley. \\"Jerry Wexler: The Man Who Invented Rhythm & Blues: Donny Hathaway, Aretha Franklin producer, Atlantic Records co-chief and music business pioneer dies at age 91\\", Rolling Stone, August 15, 2008. Accessed August 17, 2008. \\"He was born Gerald Wexler in 1917 to a working class family, and grew up during the Depression in the upper Manhattan neighborhood of Washington Heights.\\" Despite graduating from George Washington High School at age 15, he dropped out of the City College of New York after two semesters.Italie, Hillel, via the Associated Press. \\"Record producer Jerry Wexler dies\\", The Kansas City Star, August 17, 2008. Accessed August 17, 2008. In 1935, Wexler enrolled at what is now Kansas State University, where he studied intermittently for several years. Following his service in the Army, Wexler became a serious student, and he graduated from Kansas State with a B.A. in journalism in 1946. Career During his time as an editor, reporter, and writer for Billboard Magazine, Wexler coined the term \\"rhythm and blues\\". In June 1949, at his suggestion, the magazine changed the name of the Race Records chart to Rhythm & Blues Records. Wexler wrote, \\"Race' was a common term then, a self-referral used by blacks...On the other hand, 'Race Records' didn't sit well...I came up with a handle I thought suited the music well ‚Äì 'rhythm and blues.'... [It was] a label more appropriate to more enlightened times.\\"Wexler, Jerry; Ritz, David (1993). Rhythm and the Blues: A Life in American Music. New York: Alfred A. Knopf. . Wexler became a partner in Atlantic Records in 1953. There followed classic recordings with Ray Charles, the Drifters and Ruth Brown. With Ahmet and Nesuhi Ertegun, he built Atlantic Records into a major force in the recording industry. In the 1960s, he recorded Wilson Pickett and Aretha Franklin, and oversaw production of Dusty Springfield's highly acclaimed Dusty in Memphis and Lulu's New Routes albums. He also cultivated a tight relationship with Stax Records, was an enthusiastic proponent of the then-developing Muscle Shoals Sound and launched the fortunes of Muscle Shoals Sound Studios and the Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section. In 1967 he was named Record Executive of the Year for turning Aretha Franklin's career around. His work in this decade put Atlantic at the forefront of soul music. In 1968, he and Ahmet Ertegun signed Led Zeppelin to Atlantic Records on the recommendation of singer Dusty Springfield and from what they knew of the band's guitarist, Jimmy Page, from his performances with the Yardbirds.Welch, Chris (1994) Led Zeppelin, London: Orion Books. , p. 31 With its strong catalog, Atlantic Records was purchased by Warner Bros. Records in 1968. In 1975, Wexler moved from Atlantic to its parent Warner Records. In 1979, Wexler produced Bob Dylan's controversial first \\"born again\\" album, Slow Train Coming at Muscle Shoals; a single from that album, \\"Gotta Serve Somebody\\", won a Grammy award in 1980. When Wexler agreed to produce, he was unaware of the nature of the material that awaited him. \\"Naturally, I wanted to do the album in Muscle Shoals - as Bob did - but we decided to prep it in L.A., where Bob lived\\", recalled Wexler. \\"That's when I learned what the songs were about: born-again Christians in the old corral... I like the irony of Bob coming to me, the Wandering Jew, to get the Jesus feel... [But] I had no idea he was on this born-again Christian trip until he started to evangelize me. I said, 'Bob, you're dealing with a sixty-two-year-old confirmed Jewish atheist. I'm hopeless. Let's just make an album. In 1983, Wexler recorded with UK pop star George Michael. The most famous outtake of these sessions would prove to be a rare early version of \\"Careless Whisper\\", recorded in Muscle Shoals. In 1987, Wexler was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. He retired from the music business in the late 1990s. For most of the 1990s, Wexler lived on David's Lane in East Hampton, New York, where he shared living space with a Chinese family who aided him with daily functions and kept him company. Portrayals In Ray, the biopic of Ray Charles, Jerry Wexler is portrayed by Richard Schiff. Wexler will be portrayed by Marc Maron in the movie Respect, the life story of Aretha Franklin, scheduled for release in January 2021 and by David Cross in season three of the television show Genius Tom Thurman produced and directed a documentary film about Wexler, Immaculate Funk (2000). The film takes its name from Wexler's own expression for the Atlantic sound.  Personal life  Wexler married three times. In 1941, he married Shirley Kampf; they had three children before divorcing: Lisa, Paul, and Anita (predeceased). His second wife was Renee Pappas. His third wife was playwright-novelist Jean Arnold. He died at his home in Sarasota, Florida, on August 15, 2008, from congestive heart failure. Asked by a documentary filmmaker several years before his death what he wanted on his tombstone, Wexler replied \\"Two words: 'More bass'.\\" See also *Muscle Shoals, Alabama *Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section *Muscle Shoals Sound Studios *FAME Studios *:Category:Albums produced by Jerry Wexler References External links  \\"Jerry Wexler\\" by Alex Halberstadt at Salon (5 September 2000) * Jerry Wexler Interview NAMM Oral History Library (1983) Category:1917 births Category:2008 deaths Category:American atheists Category:American military personnel of World War II Category:American music industry executives Category:Grammy Award winners Category:Jewish American military personnel Category:Jewish atheists Category:Kansas State University alumni Category:People from the Bronx Category:People from Washington Heights, Manhattan Category:Record producers from New York (state) Category:United States Army soldiers ","title":"Jerry Wexler"},{"id":"897626","text":"Plesiomonas shigelloides is a species of bacteria that was formerly classified in the family Vibrionaceae, but now most microbiologists agree that a better classification is in the order Enterobacterales (see box on the right). It is a Gram-negative, rod-shaped bacterium which has been isolated from freshwater, freshwater fish, and shellfish and from many types of animals including humans, cattle, goats, swine, cats, dogs, monkeys, vultures, snakes, and toads. P. shigelloides has been isolated from a wide variety of human clinical specimens including both intestinal (usually feces or rectal swabs) and extra- intestinal. It has been isolated from the feces of humans, both with and without diarrhea, and/or vomiting (gastroenteritis). Many literature reports state or imply that Plesiomonas shigelloides actually caused the diarrhea/gastroenteritis. However, isolation from the feces of a case with diarrhea should not lead to the conclusion that the strain of P. shigelloides actually caused the diarrhea in the case; i.e. a temporal association does not prove causation. However, some strains of P. shigelloides may cause diarrhea in some people under certain conditions. Its causal role in diarrhea deserves additional study with the use of standard causation criteria. P. shigelloides has been isolated from a wide variety of human extra-intestinal clinical specimens, often from those with an immune deficiency. Some Plesiomonas strains share antigens with Shigella sonnei, and cross-reactions with Shigella antisera may occur. Plesiomonas can be distinguished from Shigella in diarrheal stools by an oxidase test: Plesiomonas is oxidase positive and Shigella is oxidase negative. Plesiomonas is easily differentiated from Aeromonas sp. and other oxidase-positive organisms by standard biochemical tests. Human dose-response challenge data are published in Herrington et al. (1987). References Herrington, D.A., Tzipori, S., Robins-Browne, R.M., Tall, B.D. and Levine, M.M., 1987. In vitro and in vivo pathogenicity of Plesiomonas shigelloides.

The band underwent a change in style and themes after the departure of Olaf Thorsen in 2002. History =1990s= Labyrinth formed in 1991 with a lineup of Franco Rubulotta (Frank Andiver-drums), Luca Contini (Ken Taylor- keyboards), Andrea Bartoletti (bass guitar), Andrea Cantarelli (Anders Rain- lead guitar), Carlo Andrea Magnani (Olaf Thorsen-lead guitar), Fabio Tordiglione (Joe Terry-vocals). The band released their first demo \\"Midnight Resistance\\". The demo got enthusiastic reviews in major metal magazines in Italy and Germany and that gave them the chance to sign with Underground Symphony, a new indie record label. Andrea Bartoletti left the band and was replaced by Chris Breeze (Cristiano Bertocchi). \\"Piece of Time\\", their first EP, marked the direction the band was taking: pure melodic speed metal with a keyboards-background. In 1995, \\"No Limits\\" was released and the interest in the band grew among metal fans and independent labels. The popularity of the band increased not only in the Italy and in Europe, but also overseas where some labels (Teichiku Records in Japan) offered to distribute the album. The band was in the metal magazine Burrn!'s top ten charts for almost six months. Joe Terry (Fabio Tordiglione) left the band and later becoming the frontman with Rhapsody of Fire. In 1997, Frank Andiver (Franco Rubulotta) and Ken Taylor (Luca Contini) left the band (however they took part in the composing of \\"Return to Heaven Denied\\"); and Rob Tyrant (Roberto Tiranti), Mat Stancioiu (Mattia Stancioiu) and Andrew McPauls (Andrea De Paoli) were brought in as their replacements. All the while, some of the big metal labels showed an interest on the band's new demo and finally Metal Blade Records made an offer and the band joined the label. It took six months to record the second album Return To Heaven Denied and before its release the band took part in that summer's metal main event: \\"Gods of Metal\\", together with some of heavy metal's biggest acts such as Black Sabbath, Pantera, Helloween, Blind Guardian, etc. Return To Heaven Denied was a success among fans and metal magazines alike, and it gave a strong push not only to the career of the band, but also to the Italian metal scene as a whole. Shortly after the release of the new record the singer Rob Tyrant left the band, replaced by Morby from Domine who was with Labyrinth throughout the whole European tour as supporting act with Pegazus of the most popular bands HammerFall and Primal Fear. After a few months, it followed an Italian tour with Heimdall. Then, Rob Tyrant returned to the band. After a short break the band entered the recording studio to release the new Mini CD Timeless Crime, containing new and old tracks from the first demotape Midnight Resistance to LPs No Limits and Return to Heaven Denied. =2000s= After these festivals, the band entered the recording studio again to release the new full-length album Sons Of Thunder. As a showcase for the new album, the band played at important European festivals, like WACKEN 2000 and Rock Machina 2000 in Spain. At the end of August 2000, Sons Of Thunder went to No. 52 on the Japanese charts and at No. 26 on the Italian charts. The band then toured South America with Vision Divine. The band organized an Italian tour first, in February 2001, with supporting band Sigma (ex Love Machine), and then a European tour, supporting Helloween first and then with Nocturnal Rites supporting Iron Savior. The band organized, in March 2002, a tour called \\"Italian Attack\\". A festival in which Domine, White Skull, Skylark, Novembre, and Centurion appeared. Their participation in these tours help raise the popularity of Labyrinth. In May of that year, the band began writing new material. In the meantime, Olaf Thorsen left the band to join Vision Divine, whereas Mat Stancioiu and Andrew McPauls left Vision Divine to dedicate all their attention to Labyrinth. In July the first demo of the new Labyrinth album appeared. For the first time, the members decided to use their Italian names: Andrea Cantarelli, Roberto Tiranti, Andrea De Paoli, Cristiano Bertocchi, and Mattia Stancioiu. The clear and sharp recording of the new demo procured them three of the most important deals of their career: Century Media Records for Europe and Americas, V2 for Italy and King Records for Japan. In January, Labyrinth began recording the new self-titled album, with the band self-producing again. It was recorded at the Noise Factory in Milan, Italy, and it was mastered at House of Audio in Germany. On April 24, 2003 Labyrinth signed a record deal with Century Media Records. The release date for their next album was set for June 30, 2003. The release of Labyrinth originally set for June 30, was postponed in Italy to July 4. On August 9, 2003, Labyrinth performed at the 9th Agglutination Metal Festival in Chiaromonte, Italy. Other bands set to appear at the event included Vader, Virgin Steele and Elvenking. Roberto Tiranti took part in the musical \\"The Ten Commandments\\" until the beginning of the year 2004. The next step was finding another good guitarist for the live dates. The band found in Pier Gonella, Roberto and Andrea De Paoli. The first show with Pier was the IX Agglutination Metal Festival in Chiaromonte (PZ), where Labyrinth would have been the third band, before Vader and Virgin Steele. After the summer, the band began preparations for the live shows to support the new album. It was a tour out of the usual standard, without an estimated end: The Maze On Tour 2003/2004. From December 2003, with the tour, also began the work on the new album foreseen for Fall 2004, during which the band celebrated 10 years together. The new work was a prosecution of the way begun with Labyrinth, with songs of deep atmosphere and tracks like \\"Just Soldier\\", but with a deeper introspection. Taking part with good and dense ideas to the writing of the new tracks, Pier Gonella with the beginning of 2004 joined the band as sixth official member. Also in December, Rob Tyrant (Roberto Trianti) recorded guest vocals on the rock opera \\"Genius 'Episode II'\\" along with people such as Eric Martin (formerly of Mr. Big), Russell Allen (from Symphony X), Jeff Martin (of Racer X), Mark Boals (formerly of Yngwie Malmsteen), Daniel Gildenl√∂w (of Pain of Salvation), Liv Kristine (formerly of Theatre of Tragedy), and Edu Falaschi (of Angra). Labyrinth put the band to work one more time, with big support of Century Media, in Japan good sales with King Records and then in the month of May a tour in Asia called \\"Banzai Tour\\" in Tokyo and Osaka, Japan, Taipei, Taichung, Taiwan, and Beijing, China and also Hong Kong. After some shows in Italy, Labyrinth played in Slovakia at More Than Festival 2004 with bands like Lost Horizons, Destruction, and Freedom Call. On December 9, 2004, they performed a show in London at Underworld Cadmen together with Dream Evil. One week later Labyrinth signed a deal with the label Arise records. With Freeman, there was a new look with strength-jackets and more wish of freedom in the lyrics; both for Italian and Japanese releases, there is a normal version and one with a bonus DVD. On February 22, 2005, Labyrinth announced the dates of an Italian tour in support of their upcoming album, Freeman. The tour would consist of, seven total shows, ranging from March 25, 2005 through and including April 16, 2005. The follow-up to 2003's Labyrinth, Freeman was recorded at Elnor Studios and scheduled for release on March 4, 2005 by Arise Records. Freeman was released in March 2005, in which the band showed more aggressive riffs and melodic parts at the same time. The album, was released in 2005 through Arise Records. The Italian version of the album contained the exclusive bonus DVD with a Tokyo show (Banzai Tour 2004), \\"best of\\" London Cadmen Underworld (from November 13, 2004), the \\"L.Y.A.F.H.\\" and \\"Freeman\\" videos, pictures and discography. Later that month on March 21, 2005, Headrush, an Italian hard rock band featuring ex-Dokken guitarist Alex De Rosso and Labyrinth singer Roberto Tiranti, released their debut album in Europe via Frontiers Records (and in Japan via King Records). Also, in March 2005 singer Roberto Tiranti appeared on Secret Sphere album \\"Heart & Anger\\". That summer after the Lorca Rock Festival, Labyrinth played a tour in Italy (a total of 17 shows) and supported Dream Theater and Angra in Italy for three shows (June 21‚Äì23), in Italy (June 21, 2005 in Florence, on June 22, 2005 in Ascoli Piceno, and on June 23 in Padova) with Angra. Later, on August 14, 2005, Labyrinth took part in the Metalway Festival in Gernika-Bilbao with bands like Manowar, Saxon, Accept, Mot√∂rhead, W.A.S.P. and more. 2006 started with bad news, Cristiano Bertocchi left the band, to pursue a solo career. After few days of Mattia suggested Roberto to become the new bass player. They played only two shows with this new line up, one at Mesiano in Trento and another at the Evolution Festival, then spent the rest of the year writing and recording 6 Days to Nowhere. In December Heraldry released their album Delirium, which featured guest vocals by Roberto Tiranti. In late 2006, Labyrinth signed a record deal with Scarlet Records, to release 6 Days to Nowhere. Between February 26, and March 9, the album 6 Days To Nowhere was released worldwide. The album's mastering took place at the famous Abbey Road Studios in London. Following the album's release the band announced a tour of Europe (only one date in Sweden and the rest in Italy) and Japan, between October 27, 2007 and March 2, 2008. On November 3, 2007 Labyrinth appeared at the V√§xj√∂ Metal Festival III, in V√§xj√∂, Sweden. Also scheduled to appear were Jorn, Grave, Heed, Bloodbound, Engel and Pagan's Mind, among others. Pier Gonella handled the guitar duties, on the Necrodeath album \\"Draculea\\". While Pier performed on that album, Roberto Tiranti appeared on Ranfa's album Little Hard Blues. Tiranti appeared on the album's fifth track entitled \\"It Will Be Not This Blues\\". On January 22, 2008, it was announced that Andrea De Paoli would be making a guest appearance on the debut album of Expedition Delta, which is being released by ProgRock Records. In summer 2008 Pier Gonella left the band to dedicate himself totally to Necrodeath and his new heavy metal band Mastercastle. On September 11, 2009 Olaf reunited with Labyrinth to record Return to Heaven Denied Pt. II: \\"A Midnight Autumn's Dream\\", a follower of their successful album from 1998. In October 2009 was also announced the new bassist Sergio Pagnacco (with courtesy of Vanexa historical italian metal band)). Also, drummer Mattia Stancioiu left the band to be a full-time sound engineer and producer and be a part-time drummer. = 2010s = In 2011 they toured with Sonata Arctica. In 2014, Roberto Tiranti announced that he was leaving the band to embark on a solo career, but the new announced vocalist Mark Boals never joined the band. In 2016, the band announced they are working on a new album which is planned for release with record company Frontiers Music Srl in 2017. It was also announced the band's line-up reunion of founding members Olaf Thorsen and Andrea Cantarelli on guitars with Roberto Tiranti on lead vocals, along with John Macaluso (former Ark, Yngwie Malmsteen, James Labrie, Riot, Starbreaker, and TNT) on drums, Oleg Smirnoff (former Vision Divine, Eldritch, Death SS) on keyboards and Nik Mazzucconi on bass.

Specifically, given an algebra A over a ring or a field K, a K-derivation is a K-linear map that satisfies Leibniz's law: : D(ab) = a D(b) + D(a) b. More generally, if M is an A-bimodule, a K-linear map that satisfies the Leibniz law is also called a derivation. The collection of all K-derivations of A to itself is denoted by DerK(A). The collection of K-derivations of A into an A-module M is denoted by . Derivations occur in many different contexts in diverse areas of mathematics. The partial derivative with respect to a variable is an R-derivation on the algebra of real-valued differentiable functions on Rn. The Lie derivative with respect to a vector field is an R-derivation on the algebra of differentiable functions on a differentiable manifold; more generally it is a derivation on the tensor algebra of a manifold. It follows that the adjoint representation of a Lie algebra is a derivation on that algebra. The Pincherle derivative is an example of a derivation in abstract algebra. If the algebra A is noncommutative, then the commutator with respect to an element of the algebra A defines a linear endomorphism of A to itself, which is a derivation over K. An algebra A equipped with a distinguished derivation d forms a differential algebra, and is itself a significant object of study in areas such as differential Galois theory. Properties If A is a K-algebra, for K a ring, and D\\\\colon A\\\\to A is a K-derivation, then * If A has a unit 1, then D(1) = D(12) = 2D(1), so that D(1) = 0. Thus by K-linearity, D(k) = 0 for all k\\\\in K. * If A is commutative, D(x2) = xD(x) + D(x)x = 2xD(x), and D(xn) = nxn‚àí1D(x), by the Leibniz rule. * More generally, for any , it follows by induction that ::D(x_1x_2\\\\cdots x_n) = \\\\sum_i x_1\\\\cdots x_{i-1}D(x_i)x_{i+1}\\\\cdots x_n : which is \\\\sum_i D(x_i)\\\\prod_{j eq i}x_j if for all i,\\\\ D(x_i) commutes with x_1,x_2,\\\\cdots, x_{i-1}. * Dn is not a derivation, instead satisfying a higher-order Leibniz rule: ::D^n(uv) = \\\\sum_{k=0}^n \\\\binom{n}{k} \\\\cdot D^{n-k}(u)\\\\cdot D^{k}(v). :Moreover, if M is an A-bimodule, write :: \\\\operatorname{Der}_K(A,M) :for the set of K-derivations from A to M. * is a module over K. * DerK(A) is a Lie algebra with Lie bracket defined by the commutator: ::[D_1,D_2] = D_1\\\\circ D_2 - D_2\\\\circ D_1. :since it is readily verified that the commutator of two derivations is again a derivation. * There is an A-module \\\\Omega_{A/K} (called the K√§hler differentials) with a K-derivation d:A\\\\to \\\\Omega_{A/K} through which any derivation D:A\\\\to M factors. That is, for any derivation D there is a A-module map \\\\varphi with :: D: A\\\\stackrel{d}{\\\\longrightarrow} \\\\Omega_{A/K}\\\\stackrel{\\\\varphi}{\\\\longrightarrow} M : The correspondence D\\\\leftrightarrow \\\\varphi is an isomorphism of A-modules: :: \\\\operatorname{Der}_K(A,M)\\\\simeq \\\\operatorname{Hom}_{A}(\\\\Omega_{A/K},M) *If is a subring, then A inherits a k-algebra structure, so there is an inclusion ::\\\\operatorname{Der}_K(A,M)\\\\subset \\\\operatorname{Der}_k(A,M) , :since any K-derivation is a fortiori a k-derivation.  Graded derivations  Given a graded algebra A and a homogeneous linear map D of grade on A, D is a homogeneous derivation if :{D(ab)=D(a)b+\\\\varepsilon^{aD}aD(b)} for every homogeneous element a and every element b of A for a commutator factor . A graded derivation is sum of homogeneous derivations with the same Œµ. If , this definition reduces to the usual case. If , however, then :{D(ab)=D(a)b+(-1)^{a}aD(b)} for odd , and D is called an anti-derivation. Examples of anti-derivations include the exterior derivative and the interior product acting on differential forms.

Redgrave is considered to be the first member of the Redgrave acting dynasty. Early life Born George Ellsworthy Redgravehttps://archive.org/stream/playeraprofileof002609mbp/playeraprofileof002609mbp_djvu.txt in 122 Kennington Road, Kennington, a district of Lambeth in South London in 1873, he was the eldest son of George Augustus Redgrave (1851‚Äì81), a maker of the board game Bagatelle, and Zoe Beatrice Elsworthy (n√©e Pym, later Howard; 1856‚Äì1936). By 1897, he was professionally known as Roy Redgrave apparently in the belief that he was descended from Rob Roy. The Redgrave family originated in the Northamptonshire village of Crick. Redgrave also assumed the middle name \\"Elsworthy\\" from his mother, and his sister took the stage name Dolly Elsworthy. Redgrave was the eldest of five siblings including, Zoe Adelina \\"Dolly\\" Elsworthy (b. 1876), Cornelius (b. 1878), Christopher (b. 1879) and Harriet (b. 1880). Family and career His first wife was actress Ellen Maud Pratt, the daughter of prosperous Devon farmer, John Dew Pratt of Buckland Monachorum. Her stage name was Judith Kyrle. They were married in Littleham- cum-Exmouth, Devon on 1 September 1894. Their careers reached a high point at their joint debut at the Britannia Theatre, Hoxton in April 1900 with Roy billed as \\"The Dramatic Cock o' the North\\". They had three children, John Kyrle born in 1895, Robin Roy (father of Major-General Sir Roy Redgrave) born in 1897 and Nellie Maud born in 1898. About this time Redgrave fell in love with a young actress named Esther Mary Cooke (known on the stage as Ettie Carlisle), daughter of Victor Cooke, huntsman and riding master. Ellen discovered the affair and Ettie fled Britain for South Africa. Redgrave followed her to South Africa. Ettie married Clayton Parrett by special licence between 28 October and 10 November 1903, on a Sunday at St. George's Cathedral in Cape Town. Redgrave arrived two days later on the Tuesday. Ettie then left Clayton Parrett and went with Redgrave to Australia where she then bore him a son, Victor Redgrave Parrett, born 25 July 1906 in Australia. At some point after initial Australian theatre work, Redgrave left for England alone. According to the \\"History of Australian Theatre\\" archives, American actress Minnie Tittell Brune made her first appearance in Australia on 21 September 1904 at Her Majesty's Theatre, Sydney in the play Sunday, supported by Roy Redgrave. Roy toured with her on the J.C. Williamson circuit. According to Corin Redgrave, Ellen (Judith) pursued Roy to Australia, arriving in time to pay his unsettled hotel bills, but she was unable to persuade him to return home with her to his family. Ellen remarried Frederick John Nettlefold, a respectable landed gentleman, in Brighton, England in 1907. However Redgrave did return to Britain, appearing in repertory at the Grand Theatre, Brighton, where he met Daisy Bertha Mary Scudamore. She eventually adopted the stage name Margaret Scudamore. They married at Glasgow Register Office in 1907 while touring in the north and had one child, the actor Sir Michael Redgrave born on 20 March 1908, later to become the father of actors Vanessa, Corin and Lynn. Six months after Michael's birth, Redgrave left Daisy (Margaret) and returned to Australia again, this time permanently. William Anderson, a Melbourne producer, had just built the King's Theatre, and needed actors. His name appears in June 1909, when he performed in the play The Bank of England. The following year, Anderson, known for his fondness of the lurid and sensational, had Roy collaborate with him on a play about the just ended Dr. Crippen case. Crippen was hanged in November 1910. The play was called By Wireless Telegraphy, which was staged by Anderson at the King's Theatre, Melbourne, from 22 October 1910. Anderson was ruined financially by an expensive flop, and had to lease away his King's Theatre, and Redgrave turned his attention to the new and burgeoning film industry, under contract to Lincoln-Cass Films. Although he claimed he did not like motion picture acting he appeared in several silent films, beginning in 1911 with The Christian. Later he played the villain in Moondyne (1913) as well as six shorts, played the lead in The Hayseeds (1917), and co-starred in Robbery Under Arms (1920). Back in the UK, the forsaken Daisy had changed her name to Margaret and married Captain James Anderson, a wealthy tea planter. Remaining in Australia Redgrave remained in Australia until his death sometime in the 1920s, but exactly where he lived and when he died remained a mystery to his family in Britain until his granddaughter Lynn Redgrave visited Sydney with her then husband John Clark, and vowed to find him. Their search ended at the Sydney Opera House library, where, as she recounts in her play Shakespeare for My Father (page 48), they came up with Redgrave's obituary, learning that he had died on 25 May 1922, and was buried at South Head Cemetery. There they learned that he had been put in an unmarked grave by somebody called Minnie, who paid 15 shillings. (The idea that it may have been the religious Minnie Tittell Brune feeling sorry for him is enticing. More probably it was Minnie Hider, Esther's friend and confidante, who brought Victor up). They found the spot, and arranged for a headstone, asked his son Michael what it should say, and he said to put, simply, \\"Roy Redgrave, Actor\\". It was later discovered that Redgrave married Irish widow Mary Leresche in 1916. His marriage certificate makes reference to his previous marriage to Ellen (Judith) but not to any subsequent marriage to Daisy (Margaret Scudamore). Mary died in 1948.

It is loosely based on the British sitcom Robin's Nest, which was itself a spin-off of Man About the House, upon which Three's Company was based. Plot In Three's Company's final episodes, Vicky Bradford (Mary Cadorette) is introduced as a love interest of Jack Tripper (John Ritter), beginning with the episode titled \\"Cupid Works Overtime.\\" In the following two-part episode, \\"Friends and Lovers\\", Jack proposes marriage, but Vicky, afraid of marriage after witnessing her parents' tumultuous relationship and bitter divorce, declines the offer. Vicky instead convinces Jack to move in with her in the vacant apartment above his restaurant. Vicky's wealthy father James Bradford (Robert Mandan) buys the building from Jack's former boss, Frank Angelino. James does not approve of Jack and he constantly tries to disrupt his and Vicky's relationship. Other characters include E.Z. Taylor (Alan Campbell), Jack's eccentric assistant at the bistro, and Claudia Bradford (Jessica Walter), Vicky's mother and James' ex-wife.

Taylor =Recurring= * Jessica Walter as Claudia Bradford Production history Three's Company had been based on the sitcom Man About the House, which aired on ITV in the United Kingdom from 1973 to 1976. When the series concluded, producers Brian Cooke and Johnnie Mortimer devised two spin-offs. The first was George and Mildred, which ran from 1976 to 1979 and starred Brian Murphy and Yootha Joyce as their George and Mildred Roper characters. The second spin-off was Robin's Nest, which ran from 1977 to 1981 and featured Richard O'Sullivan as Robin Tripp (the basis of the Jack Tripper character), who runs the titular restaurant along with his live-in girlfriend and her antagonistic father. Three's Company's producers were eager to capitalize on these spin-offs. In 1979, they had spun off The Ropers, based on George and Mildred, but the show ran for only one and a half seasons. Executive producers Ted Bergmann and Don Taffner attempted to adapt the Robin's Nest series, but without John Ritter. A pilot for a series called Byrd's Nest was written with the same premise as Robin's Nest, with a young man living with his older girlfriend and her disapproving father, who owns the building in which they live. The series was planned as a spin-off from Three's Company and possibly a vehicle for Richard Kline, but ABC passed on the idea. As Three's Company entered its eighth season in September 1983, ratings took a dive in the face of stiff competition from the new NBC series The A-Team, and ABC approved the development of a new series to be called Three's a Crowd, starring Ritter. Development and casting of the new series occurred in secret as Three's Companys eighth season progressed. Ritter's cast members Richard Kline, Joyce DeWitt, Priscilla Barnes and Don Knotts were kept out of the loop. During a Christmas hiatus in late 1983, producers auditioned several female leads to play Jack's new love interest Vicky Bradford, and eventually decided upon Broadway actress Mary Cadorette. An embarrassing situation arose when DeWitt accidentally walked in on the auditions after visiting the studio to set up her dressing room at the end of the hiatus. Informed of the spin-off project and the looming cancellation of Three's Company, DeWitt was upset by the secrecy but soon reconciled with Ritter. She and Barnes found it difficult to tape the rest of the season, as both actresses learned that their characters would conclude with the series finale. Kline and Knotts were offered recurring roles on Three's a Crowd, but both declined the offer (Kline would make a guest appearance on the show in early 1985). Suzanne Somers reportedly lobbied to reprise her Three's Company character Chrissy Snow as Jack's love interest in the spin-off. =Transition= In transitioning from Three's Company to Three's a Crowd, series producers decided to follow the plot line of the British series. Season 8 of Three's Company drew to a close in a three-episode story arc. In the first of the three episodes, Janet meets wealthy art collector Phillip Dawson. In the second episode, she falls in love with him, while Jack meets and falls in love with stewardess Vicky Bradford. Her wealthy father, played by Robert Mandan, does not approve of the relationship. When first aired, the episode ended with the words \\"To be continued... next fall\\", and when rerun late in the summer, this was changed to \\"To be continued... next week.\\" The last episode of Three's Company aired as an hour-long special that kicked off the 1984‚Äì85 fall television season and set up the premise for Three's a Crowd. In the finale, Janet marries Phillip, Terri moves to Hawaii. and Jack and Vicky profess their love for one another, but Vicky, the child of a bitter divorce, turns down Jack's marriage proposal. They instead move in together in an apartment above Jack's Bistro. In the last scene, Jack and Vicky are spending their first romantic evening together in the new apartment, only to have Mr. Bradford accidentally barge in on them, explaining that he has bought the building. The title card for Three's Company then appears over the screen with the word \\"COMPANY\\" zooming out, being replaced with \\"A CROWD\\". Three's a Crowd employed most of the same writers, producers, and staff from Three's Company, but the new show's style was changed. While the Jack Tripper character was the lead role in Three's Company, the show featured an ensemble cast of three with some other series regulars. However, the new show was centered around Jack. Vicky, her parents and E.Z. played supporting roles. The new show also employed more slapstick comedy for Ritter. The events and characters of the previous show were not mentioned, except in a late-season episode in which Larry Dallas appears. =Ratings and cancellation= Three's a Crowd garnered moderate ratings, having to compete with The A-Team on NBC. When the 1984‚Äì85 television season finished, the show placed 39th out of 77 shows with a 14.5/22 rating/sharehttps://www.sitcomsonline.com/boards/showthread.php?t=330683. This put the show on the fence with ABC, as it had enough of an audience to warrant renewal but its ratings paled in comparison to those of Three's Companys and The A-Team, which finished sixth for the season. The network would commit to only a half-season of 13 episodes to see how the series would place, and Ritter reportedly said that he would not return to the show unless a full season was ordered. Finally, ABC decided instead to pick up Diff'rent Strokes, which had just been canceled by NBC.  Episodes  Reruns Daytime reruns aired on ABC from September 23, 1985 to January 3, 1986, followed by another prime-time run on USA Network. Some syndicated versions aired under the title Three's Company, Too, using an instrumental version of the theme song of Three's Company. Six episodes of the series were aired on TV Land in September 2006, and four episodes were aired on WGN America in October 2008. The series began airing on digital broadcast network Antenna TV in June 2011 (as Three's a Crowd with its \\"Side by Side\\" theme song).

Marshall and Renwick later reworked the concept as a 1986 film of the same name from ITC Entertainment, with almost completely different characters and plot, although one or two of the original actors returned in different roles. The British budget label Channel 5 Video released a compilation cassette of all six episodes edited together into one 137-minute chunk in 1987. In 2010, Network released both the complete, unedited series and the movie on a 2-DVD set (Region 2) entitled Whoops Apocalypse: The Complete Apocalypse. (Rights issues were simplified by the fact that both LWT and ITC Entertainment productions were by this time owned by Granada Television). In 1992 Fox Television produced a short-lived sitcom, Woops!, which may have been loosely inspired by Whoops Apocalypse, though the American series was set after the apocalypse rather than before it. Series The series details the weeks leading up to the Apocalypse. It features a chaotic and increasingly unstable global political situation in which nuclear alerts are accidentally triggered by malfunctioning Space Invaders machines. The naive and highly unpopular Republican U.S. President Johnny Cyclops (an obvious Ronald Reagan parody, played by Barry Morse) is advised by an insane right-wing fundamentalist security advisor, called The Deacon, who claims to have a direct hotline to God. (The Deacon was so named because of the previous role of the actor who played him (John Barron) as a Cathedral Dean in the sitcom All Gas and Gaiters; the writers claimed not to know at the time that Alexander Haig, Reagan's first Secretary of State, was known as The Vicar in the White House.) In the Eastern Hemisphere, things are similarly unstable. Soviet Premier Dubienkin (Richard Griffiths) is in fact a series of clones, which keep dying and being replaced. Meanwhile, the deposed Shah of Iran, Shah Massiq Rassim (Bruce Montague), led by his advisor Abdab (David Kelly) who is always blindfolded to avoid looking upon the Shah's magnificence, is shunted around the world in search of a refuge (spending most of the series in a cross channel ferry's toilet). The main danger is the Deacon's development of a new super-powerful American nuclear weapon. This is originally called the Johnny Cyclops Bomb; later, when the President vetoes the name, it is renamed the Quark Bomb (Formerly Known As The Johnny Cyclops Bomb After The President of the Same Name). The Deacon arranges for Lacrobat (John Cleese), a disguised international arms smuggler nicknamed The Devil (a parody of Carlos the Jackal), to steal a Quark Bomb and take it to Iran, to help the Shah in his counterrevolution. The Soviets get word of this (via Rassim's parrot) and decide to invade, gaining control over the world's oil supply. The Soviets have a new ally in British Prime Minister Kevin Pork (Peter Jones), a parody of left-wing Labour politicians Michael Foot and Peter Shore. Pork, who has gone insane and believes himself to be Superman, heads an especially left-wing government (a parody of Foot's Labour Party). The British Foreign Secretary is blackmailed by the Soviets to join the Warsaw Pact. This situation so unnerves the foreign secretary (Geoffrey Palmer, in a role based on David Owen) and the Chancellor of the Exchequer (Richard Davies) that they also lose their sanity, don Green Lantern and Hawkman costumes, and are locked up in a padded cell at 10 Downing St. The Soviets are also holding two elderly American tourists named Jonathan and Martha Hopper captive. They are constantly tortured by Commissar Alex Solzhenitsyn (\\"no relation\\", played by Alexei Sayle) in the belief they are secretly CIA spies. This turns out to be true, but the Hoppers are crushed by a helicopter in a bungled CIA rescue operation. This does not help Cyclops's nosediving popularity rating, which is just below that of Charles Manson. The Deacon stages an assassination attempt in order to help Cyclops' flagging popularity (a reference to the Reagan assassination attempt the year before). It is damaged further when the speeding ambulance carrying Cyclops to the hospital accidentally runs over his highly popular main opponent, Democratic Senator Jimmy Hennessy (a parody of Senator Teddy Kennedy). By the end of the series we're told Cyclops is now less popular than the Boston Strangler. (These developments are followed by a dramatic newsreader named Jay Garrick, and his topless female counterpart across the Atlantic.) Eventually the Quark Bomb is accidentally detonated in Israel when Lacrobat's attempt to prevent it being incinerated goes horribly wrong, destroying the country and killing most of the US army who were stationed there. Meanwhile, the Shah, who has temporarily been given sanctuary aboard a space shuttle, manages to crash it into the Moscow Kremlin. Believing it to be a bomb, the Russians launch their weapons at America. In the final scene Soviet missiles are on their way to obliterate the United States and President Cyclops has to decide whether to retaliate. The title sequence already showed the aftermath of the decision, Earth reduced to a nuclear wasteland. In a final twist, we discover that the woman we see in the title sequence selling buttons reading \\"WEAR YOUR MUSHROOM WITH PRIDE\\" is in fact the First Lady, who was hidden in a fallout shelter and is one of the few survivors of the war. Production =DC Comics references= The writers appear to be fans of DC Comics. As stated above, the delusional British PM and his ministers don DC superhero garb; his caped white whippet 'Krypto' is hurled to its doom from a 10 Downing Street window for its \\"fly around the block\\". Semi-generic Superman adventures and specific characters (e.g. Doctor Destiny) are frequently mentioned. (The best known example is probably, \\"Can't make Prime Minister's questions, Brainiac has escaped from the Phantom Zone\\"). An Iranian mullah is mentioned to have \\"dressed as Aquaman\\". Ed Bishop's character Jay Garrick has the same name as the Golden Age Flash. The elderly American farming couple held by the Soviets are named Jonathan and Martha, which are the names of Superman's Earth parents in current DC continuity. CIA agent Jedd Grodd's last name references Gorilla Grodd.

History =First appearances= The Eye was originally mentioned in the Fourth Doctor serial The Deadly Assassin (1976), where it was revealed as the source of power that sustained Gallifrey. According to the ancient records, the legendary Time Lord Rassilon captured and placed the Eye ‚Äì the nucleus of a black hole ‚Äì beneath the Time Lord's citadel on Gallifrey (the Panopticon). Rassilon placed the black hole's nucleus in an eternally dynamic equation against the mass of Gallifrey and so that as long as the Eye existed in this \\"balanced state\\", the power of the Time Lords would \\"neither flux nor wither\\". However, it remained there so long that it passed into legend. Until the Fourth Doctor and the renegade Time Lord known as the Master rediscovered it in The Deadly Assassin, the Time Lords had forgotten its location, some even believing it to be mythical or no longer in existence. As seen in The Deadly Assassin, the Eye was linked to two other Gallifreyan artifacts, the Sash of Rassilon and the Great Key of Rassilon. The Sash was essential for the wearer to control and manipulate the Eye safely without being sucked into its gravity well and the Great Key was an ebonite rod that could be used to drain energy from the Eye. The Great Key was later renamed the Rod of Rassilon in The Invasion of Time (1978) to distinguish it from the other Great Key, a component of the De-mat gun.To further confuse matters, The Trial of a Time Lord (1986) introduced what was simply called the Key of Rassilon, which permits access to the Matrix, the computer network which is the repository of all Time Lord knowledge. In The Deadly Assassin and the 1996 Doctor Who television movie, the Master tried to use the Eye to steal himself a new set of regenerations from the Doctor. =Omega and Rassilon= Prior to this, in the 1973 story The Three Doctors, another figure from Time Lord history was introduced. Omega was a solar engineer who, in trying to provide an energy source for the Time Lords' time travel experiments, harnessed the power of a supernova. However, this apparently killed Omega and created a black hole. Unknown to anybody for millennia, Omega was not dead, but merely trapped beyond the event horizon of the black hole in an anti-matter universe. The first connection between Omega and Rassilon was made by Alan Moore in his 1980 Doctor Who Monthly comic strip story Star Death (DWM #47). Star Death showed the proto-Time Lords trying to collapse the star Qqaba into a black hole and harness its \\"energy stream\\". Omega and Rassilon were both members of this project, and when sabotage sent Omega hurtling into the newly created black hole, he was presumed lost. Rassilon then took control of the project, and the power of the black hole. It was not made explicit, however, that this black hole was the same one that provided the Eye of Harmony. (Qqaba would also be mentioned in the 1998 novel The Infinity Doctors by Lance Parkin.) This connection appeared next in the 1988 serial Remembrance of the Daleks, where Omega's stellar manipulation device was dubbed the Hand of Omega and became the object of a struggle between two competing factions of Daleks. Although the televised story made no mention of Rassilon, the 1991 novelisation of the serial (though again of unclear canonicity) by the story's writer Ben Aaronovitch, drawing on elements of the so-called \\"Cartmel Masterplan\\", made the connection between the two Time Lords explicit. The story of Omega's supernova becoming the black hole that provided Rassilon with the Eye of Harmony became part of the fan-accepted mythology and was incorporated into the Virgin New Adventures novels. =The television movie= The 1996 television movie revealed a new function for the Eye. No longer just a power source for Gallifrey, in the movie an artifact referred to as the Eye of Harmony was part of the TARDIS and, for the first time, was stated to be the TARDIS's primary power source, located in the centre of the TARDIS' cloister room. It was also shown that leaving the TARDIS's Eye open for too long would result in space/time distortion as the space around the Eye was exposed to the gravitational effects of the singularity; the Earth is nearly destroyed in the process. The Eye of Harmony can be opened using human eyes, meaning the Master, despite possessing a human body, cannot open it as he has retained snake-like eyes. The Master is sucked into the Eye of Harmony and apparently killed when he fights the Doctor. However, having the Eye of Harmony on board the TARDIS contradicted the idea that the Eye itself was on Gallifrey. To reconcile this, fan speculation held that this was not the real Eye, but merely a name applied to a remote link to the actual Eye that powered the craft (possibly in the same way the Time Lords transmitted energy from Gallifrey to the TARDIS in The Three Doctors), or alternatively, the Eye had been somehow transferred to the TARDIS. The former conjecture became established fanon, and was taken up in the spin-off media and was eventually confirmed by the official BBC website.BBC ‚Äì Doctor Who ‚Äì The Classic Series ‚Äì Beginner's Guide ‚Äì The TARDIS The Past Doctor Adventures novel The Quantum Archangel by Craig Hinton offered another explanation by claiming that all TARDISes built after a certain point, including the Type 40 the Doctor uses, have a mathematically modelled duplicate of the Eye with all its attendant features, thus helping the TARDISes cope with the previously- discovered power problems inherent if they travel too far away from the original Eye. The television movie also reveals a link between the Eye of Harmony on board the TARDIS and the Doctor's own eyes. The Master uses the Eye to see what the Doctor is seeing at the same moment. The symbiosis between a Time Lord and his TARDIS has been hinted at before, such as in the sixth Doctor story \\"The Two Doctors\\" in which The Sontarans try to isolate the Doctor's symbiotic nuclei in an attempt to construct their own time machine. =Current status= In the episodes \\"Boom Town\\" and \\"Utopia\\", the TARDIS needed to 'refuel' by absorbing energy from a 'scar' left by a closed space/time rift in Cardiff, implying that it is not powered entirely by the Eye at this time. The former episode also revealed that the TARDIS console concealed the 'Heart of the TARDIS', a mysterious glowing energy source that the Doctor associated (in \\"The Parting of the Ways\\") with the energies of the time vortex. The Tenth Doctor makes an oblique reference to the Eye's creation in the episode \\"The Satan Pit\\" when he says: \\"My people practically invented black holes. Well... in fact they did.\\" The Master also mentions in \\"The Sound of Drums\\" that the rockets on Earth have \\"black hole manipulators\\", which suggests that the Time Lords have knowledge of the physics of black holes. In the episode \\"Hide\\", the Doctor is able to utilise a \\"subset of the Eye of Harmony\\" to access a pocket universe by running various cables from the TARDIS. In the episode \\"Journey to the Centre of the TARDIS\\", the Eye of Harmony is seen in the TARDIS (whose inner dimensions are said to be infinite). The Doctor describes it as an \\"exploding star in the act of becoming a black hole [...] suspended in a permanent state of decay.\\" It is revealed that one can only survive in the room housing the Eye of Harmony \\"for a minute or two\\", and that further exposure would liquefy the cells in the body and burn skin.  Scientific context  This 1976 explanation of Time Lord power followed closely from a period of extensive scientific exploration and validation relating to black holes in the scientific world, lasting from approximately 1964‚Äì1974, during which key discoveries related to the power, energy, and possible time-related properties of black holes was undertaken.

BƒÉile Felix is at a close distance to Oradea, a major city in western Romania. History Thermal springs were valued in the eighteenth century by the monk F√©lix Helcher of the Monastery of Klosterbruck (de) in Moravia, administrator of the V√°radszentm√°rton (today: S√¢nmartin, Romania) monastery. Between 1711-1721 the first treatment facilities were organized under the name of F√©lixf√ºrd≈ë (in Romanian: Baia lui Felix). F√©lix Helcher died in 1737.Monasteriologia regni Hungariae In 1885 a new spring, with a temperature of 49 ¬∞C, was found. The thermal springs were discovered around 1000, or around 1200, or according to other experts, only in 1700. The only fact agreed by all experts is the appearance of the first buildings in this resort: between the years 1711‚Äì1721. In 1920, the commune became part of Romania, in 1940, it was given back to Hungary. After World War II, again it become part of Romania. In 1948 Sanmartin monastery area was nationalized by the communist authorities. Several recreational bases, including the one belonged to Securitate, were built on the nationalized land. The Premonstatens Order claims it latter. On April 2, 2014, the HCCJ (Higher Court of Cassation and Justice) ordered the transfer of the filed case from Oradea Court to the Giurgiu District Court, where it is now.Dosar 19003/271/2011 Other requests of the Premonstratens Order on retrocession the BƒÉile Felix lands are in progress at HCCJ. Geography BƒÉile Felix and 1 Mai are two thermal spa resorts located in a hilly area with birch and oak tree woods, 8 km south of the municipality of Oradea (seat of Bihor County) and 22 km south-east of Bor≈ü (border checkpoint to Hungary). The resort lost its passenger railway service in 2014. Climate Summers are not excessively hot and winters are mild, with moderate precipitation (650 mm annually). Fauna and flora In the thermal waters of the Pe≈£a river and lake, having a constant temperature of 30-31¬∞C, live the snail Melanopsis parreyssi (tertiary relict) and the fish Scardinus racovitzae as well as a rare species of subtropical water lily - Nymphaea lotus thermalis - tertiary relict, a natural monument. Spa The resorts host many mineral springs with thermal (20-48¬∞C), sulphuric, calcic, sodic, rich in bicarbonate waters known since the beginning of the millennium. The soothing effect of the waters on articular and muscular pain and on various rheumatic neuralgias accounts for the fame of cures in the resort for the treatment of inflammatory rheumatic diseases (rheumatic polyarthritis, rheumatoid spondylitis, conditions after acute articular rheumatism), degenerative and articular rheumatic diseases, central and peripheral neurological disorders, gynecological diseases, post-traumatic conditions, endocrine disorders. The facilities of the two resorts offer treatment of rheumatism and neurological and gynecological diseases. The modern medical base has at its disposal various facilities for procedures involving electrotherapy, hydrotherapy, aerosols, massage, paraffin packing and other water treatments.

Caral is the most ancient city of the Americas and a well-studied site of the Norte Chico civilization. The city was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2009.UNESCO World Heritage Centre.  History  Caral was inhabited roughly between the 26th and 20th centuries BCE,Eurekalert.org, \\"Oldest evidence of city life in the Americas reported in Science, early urban planners emerge as power players\\" Public release date: 26-Apr-2001 American Association for the Advancement of Science enclosing an area of more than .NYtimes.com, \\"Archaeological Site in Peru Is Called Oldest City in Americas\\" Public release date: 27-Apr-2001 The New York Times Caral was described by its excavators as the oldest urban centre in the Americas, a claim that was later challenged as other ancient sites were found nearby, such as Bandurria, Peru. Accommodating more than 3,000 inhabitants, it is the best studied and one of the largest Norte Chico sites known. PeruCaral01.jpgThe Caral temples in the arid Supe Valley, some 20 km from the Pacific coast. Caral 1.JPG  Archaeological findings  Paul Kosok discovered Caral in 1948, but it received little attention at the time because it appeared to lack many typical artifacts that were sought at archaeological sites throughout the Andes. In 1975, the Peruvian architect Carlos Williams made a detailed record of most of the archaeological sites of the valley of Supe, among which he recorded Caral, from which he made some observations about the development of architecture in the Andes. Ruth Shady further explored the 4,000- to 4,600-year-old city in the Peruvian desert, with its elaborate complex of temples, an amphitheatre and ordinary houses.Shady, R. Haas, J. Creamer, W. (2001). Dating Caral, a Pre-ceramic Site in the Supe Valley on the Central Coast of Peru. Science. 292:723-726. ncbi.nlm.nih.gov The urban complex is spread out over and contains plazas and residential buildings. Caral was a thriving metropolis at roughly the same time that Egypt's great pyramids were being built. Caral is the largest recorded site in the Andean region with dates older than 2000 BCE and appears to be the model for the urban design adopted by Andean civilisations that rose and fell over the span of four millennia. It is believed that Caral may answer questions about the origins of the Andean civilisations and the development of the first cities. Among the artefacts found at Caral are a knotted textile piece that the excavators have labelled a quipu. They write that the artefact is evidence that the quipu record keeping system, a method involving knots tied in rope that was brought to perfection by the Inca Empire, was older than any archaeologist had previously guessed. Evidence has emerged that the quipu may also have recorded logographic information in the same way writing does. Gary Urton has suggested that the quipus used a binary system which could record phonological or logographic data. =Main temple= The main temple complex () is long, wide and high. The date of its construction is unknown. =Peaceful society= No trace of warfare has been found at Caral: no battlements, no weapons, no mutilated bodies. Shady's findings suggest it was a gentle society, built on commerce and pleasure. In one of the temples, they uncovered 32 flutes made of condor and pelican bones and 37 cornetts of deer and llama bones. One find revealed the remains of a baby, wrapped and buried with a necklace made of stone beads. =Scope of site= Caral spawned 19 other temple complexes scattered across the area of the Supe Valley. The date of 2627 BCE is based on carbon dating reed and woven carrying bags that were found in situ. These bags were used to carry the stones that were used for the construction of the temples. The material is an excellent candidate for high precision dating. The site may date even earlier as samples from the oldest parts of the excavation have yet to be dated. The town had a population of approximately 3000 people. However, the 19 other sites in the area (posted at Caral), allow for a possible total population of 20,000 people for the Supe Valley. All of these sites share similarities with Caral. They had small platforms or stone circles. Shady believes that Caral was the focus of this civilisation, which itself was part of an even vaster complex, trading with the coastal communities and the regions further inland ‚Äì as far as the Amazon, if the depiction of monkeys is any indication. Panorama of Caral Site 360¬∞ Panorama of Caral =Geoglyph= In 2000, Marco Machacuay (the chief of excavations at the time) and his colleague, Roc√≠o Arambur√∫, discovered a large shape etched on the ground in circular stone lines near Caral. This image, known as a geoglyph, is located on the desert floor just west of the main site at Caral. When traced out, the lines form the design of a human face with long, streaming hair and a gaping mouth. This geoglyph is similar to the screaming, bleeding figures found etched onto the stone walls at a site called Cerro Sech√≠n, in the Casma Valley to the north. It is unclear what exactly this figure means, but it is believed to have been constructed around the same time as Caral and to have been associated with a nearby ceremonial site known as Chupacigarro.Atwood, Roger. \\"A Monumental Feud.\\" Archaeology.

In the 2002 Queen's Birthday and Golden Jubilee Honours, Ball was appointed an Officer of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services as a cartoonist. Life and work Ball was born in Feilding in 1939; his father was All Black rugby player Nelson Ball. He grew up in New Zealand before spending some years in Australia and South Africa, where he attended Parktown Boys' High School and finished his education. He played for the Junior All Blacks in 1959 as a first five-eights. As a young man he worked for the Dominion newspaper in Wellington and the Manawatu Times before becoming a freelance cartoonist and moving to Scotland, where he found work with publishers DC Thomson, of Dundee. He developed his character Stanley and had it published in the influential English humour-magazine Punch. Stanley the Palaeolithic Hero featured a caveman who wore glasses and struggled with the Neolithic environment. It became the longest-running strip in Punch's history, and other English and non-English speaking countries syndicated it. Ball continued to contribute to Punch after returning with his family to New Zealand. Ball's early cartoons often had political overtones (his mid-70s UK strips included All the King's Comrades, and he described himself in the introduction to The Sisterhood (1993) as a socialist. Stanley often expresses left-wing attitudes. In 2002 Ball was awarded the New Zealand Order of Merit. Tributes paid to him included these: Footrot Flats After 1975 Ball wrote several comics in New Zealand (for instance 'Nature Calls'), but it was in 1976 that he first published the strip Footrot Flats in Wellington's afternoon newspaper, The Evening Post. It rapidly led to the demise of his other strips including Stanley, which he was still writing for Punch. The strip follows the adventures of a working sheep- dog called (if anything) \\"Dog\\" or \\"The Dog\\" or \\"@*&#!\\", his owner Wal Footrot and the other characters, human and animal, that they encounter or associate with. Ball expresses Dog's thoughts in thought-bubbles, though he clearly remains \\"just a dog\\" (rather than the heavily anthropomorphised creatures sometimes found in other comics or animation). Dog also has alter-egos including \\"The Grey Ghost\\" and \\"The Iron Paw\\". Ball's Footrot Flats has appeared in syndication in international newspapers, and in over 40 published books. Footrot Flats inspired a stage musical, a theme-park and New Zealand's first feature-length animated film, Footrot Flats: The Dog's Tale (1986). Footrot Flats characters include Wal, Dog, Cooch, Cheeky Hobson, Aunt Dolly, Horse, Pongo, Rangi, Charlie, Major, Jess and the Murphy family of Irish and Hunk and Spit. Footrot Flats features several remarkable traits: its expansive created-universe, complete with ancillary characters, things and places; the fact that the characters slowly but perceptibly age and mature throughout the twenty-year run of the comic; and the gradual encroachment of political themes over the years (particularly environmentalism and gentle parodies of feminism). Ball said he wanted his cartoons to have an impact. \\"The heart of a cartoon is the idea, an artist can create a painting, hang it on the wall and be satisfied with what he has achieved even if no-one else sees it. In cartooning, you must get a human reaction to the idea. The task of the cartoonist is to translate his idea into a drawing that will have impact\\". Death Ball lived with his wife Pam on a rural property in Gisborne, New Zealand. In an interview on Radio New Zealand National on 27 January 2016, Pam said that Murray's health had been poor for the last six years and that he was suffering from dementia. Longtime friend and collaborator Tom Scott said that on Sunday, 12 March 2017, he had been advised that Ball had died. He is survived by his wife and children. Bibliography In addition to his cartoon collections, Ball wrote and illustrated eight books: * Fifteen Men on a Dead Man's Chest, a satirical look at New Zealand rugby * Migod! It's Bruce the Barbarian * The People Makers (1970) * The Sisterhood (1993), a comical, but rather irate, masculist book, which caused some uproar at the time of publication * The Flowering of Adam Budd * Quentin Hankey: Traitor * Tarzan, Gene Kelly And Me (2001) ‚Äì approximately, an autobiography. * Fred the (Quite) Brave Mouse Ball also wrote a large-format illustrated novel whose verse parodied the Australian bush-ballad as popularised by Banjo Paterson and Henry Lawson. Titled The Ballad of Footrot Flats, it was published in 1996. Originally intended as a second film script, this work was the first new Footrot material which Ball had published since 1994. It was the last of the Footrot series. Interests Murray Ball and Charles M. Schulz each admired the other's work. One Footrot Flats strip shows Dog laughing at a Snoopy cartoon. Schulz wrote the introduction to the only Footrot Flats published in the United States (it appeared as Footrot Flats there, but as Footrot Flats 4 in Australasia.)

Statement Suppose H is a subgroup of G, which is finitely generated with generating set S, that is, G = \\\\scriptstyle \\\\langle S\\\\rangle. Let R be a right transversal of H in G. In other words, R is (the image of) a section of the quotient map G \\\\to H\\\\backslash G, where H\\\\backslash G denotes the set of right cosets of H in G. We make the definition that given g‚ààG, \\\\overline{g} is the chosen representative in the transversal R of the coset Hg, that is, :g\\\\in H\\\\overline{g}. Then H is generated by the set :\\\\\\\\{rs(\\\\overline{rs})^{-1}r\\\\in R, s\\\\in S\\\\\\\\}  Example  Let us establish the evident fact that the group Z3 = Z/3Z is indeed cyclic. Via Cayley's theorem, Z3 is a subgroup of the symmetric group S3. Now, : \\\\mathbb{Z}_3=\\\\\\\\{ e, (1\\\\ 2\\\\ 3), (1\\\\ 3\\\\ 2) \\\\\\\\} : S_3= \\\\\\\\{ e, (1\\\\ 2), (1\\\\ 3), (2\\\\ 3), (1\\\\ 2\\\\ 3), (1\\\\ 3\\\\ 2) \\\\\\\\} where e is the identity permutation. Note S3 = \\\\scriptstyle\\\\langle{ s1=(1 2), s2 = (1 2 3) }\\\\scriptstyle\\\\rangle. Z3 has just two cosets, Z3 and S3 \\\\ Z3, so we select the transversal { t1 = e, t2=(1 2) }, and we have : \\\\begin{matrix} t_1s_1 = (1\\\\ 2),&\\\\quad\\\\text{so}\\\\quad&\\\\overline{t_1s_1} = (1\\\\ 2)\\\\\\\\\\\\ t_1s_2 = (1\\\\ 2\\\\ 3) ,&\\\\quad\\\\text{so}\\\\quad& \\\\overline{t_1s_2} = e\\\\\\\\\\\\ t_2s_1 = e ,&\\\\quad\\\\text{so}\\\\quad& \\\\overline{t_2s_1} = e\\\\\\\\\\\\ t_2s_2 = (2\\\\ 3) ,&\\\\quad\\\\text{so}\\\\quad& \\\\overline{t_2s_2} = (1\\\\ 2). \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{matrix} Finally, : t_1s_1\\\\overline{t_1s_1}^{-1} = e : t_1s_2\\\\overline{t_1s_2}^{-1} = (1\\\\ 2\\\\ 3) : t_2s_1\\\\overline{t_2s_1}^{-1} = e : t_2s_2\\\\overline{t_2s_2}^{-1} = (1\\\\ 2\\\\ 3). Thus, by Schreier's subgroup lemma, { e, (1 2 3) } generates Z3, but having the identity in the generating set is redundant, so we can remove it to obtain another generating set for Z3, { (1 2 3) } (as expected).

She co-founded the fashion house Zambesi with her husband, Neville Findlay, in 1979.  Career  Findlay was born in Athens, Greece. In 1951 the Red Cross relocated her family to Dunedin, New Zealand. Her mother taught her and her sisters how to sew, she never received any formal training in fashion design. At 21 she moved to Auckland and got a job working at a clothing company. Through this experience she learned how to use industrial machines and the production behind clothes. In 1976, encouraged by her sister, Margi Robertson, she opened Tart boutique store in Parnell Auckland. She selected labels to sell based on her own taste and included New Zealand designers such as Marilyn Sainty. She sold only a few garments in the store of her own design. A second store, Cachet, was opened in Takapuna in 1978. In 1979, her husband left his job as a design engineer and they formed their label Zambesi. That same year, they opened their first store at 31 Lorne Street in Auckland, followed by a second store in Queen's Arcade in 1981. By 1986, these two central Auckland stores were merged to create their flagship store on Vulcan Lane. This store remained open until 2012, at which time they shifted to Britomart. The label first gained international acclaim in 1991 when they were first invited to show at Australia Fashion week in Sydney. This was the first year the New Zealand designers were invited to show at the Fashion week.

It was created by VEB Polytechnik and contained a number of games, including a Pac-Man clone. A total of about 2,000 units of the cabinet were manufactured.  Hardware  Poly Play on display at the Computerspielemuseum Berlin, September 2013 Poly Play ran on a U880, a clone of the Zilog Z80 CPU, which was clocked at 2.457600 MHz and a custom sound chip. Its display ran at a resolution of 512*256 at 50 Hz and supported a palette of ten colours, though it could also use coloured overlays. The machine's coin slot was designed for 50 Pfennig, but it was flawed - the pressure sensor could be deceived by pressing a 1-Pfennig coin very sharply into the top of the slot. However, this was largely tolerated because the machine was not a capitalistic commercial venture, but a state- owned product found predominantly in FDGB holiday homes, youth hostels and non-profit clubs. The machine ran with a deactivated coin slot in many youth clubs. However, the free play often caused large crowds to form around it, which incited their reactivation. A Poly Play machine was on display in the Museum of Computing in Swindon, England in 2004. From 2005, the same machine was part of the touring video game show Game On and was exhibited in multiple museums, such as the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago and the Science Museum in London.

Solondz's work has received critical acclaim for its commentary on the \\"dark underbelly of middle class American suburbia,\\" a reflection of his own background in New Jersey. His work includes Welcome to the Dollhouse (1995), Happiness (1998), Storytelling (2001), Palindromes (2004), Life During Wartime (2009), Dark Horse (2011), and Wiener-Dog (2016). Biography Solondz was born in Newark, New Jersey. He wrote several screenplays while working as a delivery boy for the Writers Guild of America. Solondz earned his undergraduate degree in English from Yale and attended New York University's Master of Fine Arts program in film and television, but did not complete a degree. During the early 1990s, Solondz worked as a teacher of English as a second language to Russian immigrants in New York City and described the experience as positive. Solondz is an atheist. In The A.V. Club's article \\"Is There a God?\\", he answered the question \\"Well, me, I'm an atheist, so I don't really believe there is. But I suppose I could be proven wrong.\\" Early films Solondz's short film Schatt's Last Shot was made in 1985. The title character is a high schooler who wants to get into Stanford University, but his gym teacher hates him. The teacher fails him because he cannot make a shot in basketball. He has no luck with the girl of his dreams, but he wishes he was more like the coach, whom he challenges to a game of one-on-one. In 1989 Solondz wrote and directed Fear, Anxiety & Depression, an episodic comedy about fledgling playwright Ira (played by Solondz) and his frustrating interactions with the opposite sex. The film contains several musical interludes, including three songs written for the film. Stanley Tucci appears in one of his early roles as an old, disliked acquaintance of Ira, who takes up playwriting on a whim and becomes the toast of Off-Broadway. Feature films =Welcome to the Dollhouse= The frustrations of his first feature led Solondz to swear off further involvement with the industry. More than five years later, an attorney friend urged Solondz to give filmmaking another go, and promised partial finance for any project Solondz came up with. The end result was 1995's Welcome to the Dollhouse, which went on to win the Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival. The dark comedy follows the travails of Dawn Wiener, a bespectacled, toothy, and shy 7th-grade girl who is mercilessly teased at school and treated to alternating contempt and neglect at home. It was distinct from most earlier films about adolescent abuse due to its complex characterization. It gave a balanced and sometimes sympathetic portrayal of the bully antagonist Brandon, and its depiction of Dawn, the ostensible protagonist and victim of the story, showed her as deeply flawed and sometimes cruel and selfish herself. The film was a major success among critics, and a moderate success at the box office. It was a festival hit, with screenings all over the world. =Happiness= Solondz's next piece was Happiness (1998), a highly controversial film due to the themes explored in it, which range from rape, pedophilia, suicide, and murder]to a bizarre sexual phone caller. After the original distributor October Films dropped it, the film was distributed by Good Machine Releasing. The movie received numerous awards, including International Critics' Prize at the Cannes Film Festival, and yielded strong critical praise for Solondz. =Storytelling and Palindromes= In 2001, Solondz released Storytelling, which premiered at the 2001 Cannes Film Festival. It is a film separated into two parts, entitled \\"Fiction\\" and \\"Nonfiction.\\" The two stories share two thematic elements, but deal with each in an autonomous manner. Solondz used this format because he wanted to \\"find a fresh structure, a fresh form, and a different way of tackling what may be identical geographical material.\\"Interview at Salon.com, 1/30/2002 When Solondz initially presented the film to the MPAA, he was told that if he wished to receive a rating other than NC-17, he would have to remove a scene of explicit sex involving a white female and a black male. However, a clause in Solondz's contract allowed him to cover part of the actors with a bright red box. \\"For me it's a great victory to have a big red box, the first red box in any studio feature [...] it's right in your face: You're not allowed to see this in our country.\\" Solondz did, however, remove a portion of the film (which has variously been reported as either a subplot of the second story, or a third story entirely) which contained a sex scene involving two male actors (one of whom was James Van Der Beek).Interview in The Guardian, 4/15/2005 Solondz's next film, Palindromes (2004), raised the eyebrows of many pundits and reviewers due to its themes of child molestation, statutory rape and abortion. The film was financed largely by the filmmaker. Like all of Solondz's previous films, Palindromes is set in suburban New Jersey. It was released unrated in the US. =Life During Wartime= Life During Wartime (formerly known as Forgiveness) was produced by John Hart and Evamere Entertainment and released in 2009. Solondz said the film is a companion piece to Happiness and Welcome to the Dollhouse.Carl Swanson, \\"Somewhat Happily Ever After: Todd Solondz introduces forgiveness to his latest grim comedy, Life During Wartime,\\" New York July 11, 2010: \\"'The first scene of this movie, it's shot exactly as if you're watching Happiness again. . . . But then I can subvert it and take it someplace else.'\\" Life During Wartime has characters in common with the two earlier films, but played by different actors and with loose continuity. Information about the characters in the film, and their differences from those of its predecessor Happiness, first emerged in August 2009. The film features Ally Sheedy, Ren√©e Taylor, Paul Reubens, Ciar√°n Hinds, Shirley Henderson, Michael Lerner, Michael Kenneth Williams, Charlotte Rampling, Allison Janney, Rich Pecci and Chris Marquette. The film debuted at the Telluride Film Festival in September 2009; it was nominated for the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival in August‚ÄìSeptember 2009, and it won the Osella award there for Best Screenplay.Venice Film Festival 66th edition awards =Dark Horse= In July 2010 Solondz completed the script of his next film, Dark Horse, which was filmed in the fall of 2010. To Solondz's surprise, the Creative Artists Agency appreciated the script, the first time for a movie of his. Solondz commented that he realized this is because \\"there's no rape, there's no child molestation, there's no masturbation, and then I thought, 'omg, why didn't I think of this years ago?'\\"Exclusive: Todd Solondz's Next Picture 'Dark Horse' Shoots This Fall 7/12/2010Simone, \\"Dark Horse: il prossimo film di Todd Solondz,\\" badtaste.it, July 12, 2010, retrieved July 15, 2010: \\"ho realizzato che non ci sono stupri, molestie ai bambini, non c'√® masturbazione, e ho pensato 'oddio, perch√® non li ho fatto anni fa?'.\\" On September 5, 2011, Dark Horse was presented at the Venice Film Festival. On October 14, 2011, Dark Horse made its European premiere at the BFI London Film Festival. The film received a mixed reception. On April 23, 2012, Dark Horse was announced as the Closing Night selection for Maryland Film Festival 2012. =Wiener-Dog= Wiener-Dog premiered at Sundance 2016. The film tells the story of a dog, as she travels from home to home. Amazon purchased the film at the festival. Starring an ensemble cast led by Ellen Burstyn, Kieran Culkin, Julie Delpy, Danny DeVito, Greta Gerwig, Tracy Letts, and Zosia Mamet, the film serves as a spin-off from Solondz‚Äôs 1995 film Welcome to the Dollhouse, which also features the character of Dawn Wiener. It was released in the US on June 24, 2016 to positive reviews. Academic work On December 19, 2009, Solondz joined as adjunct professor the New York University's Tisch School of the Arts; he alternates semesters between New York's main campus of the school and the grad film sister program at the Tisch Asia campus in Singapore.Todd Solondz Joins NYU Grad Film Faculty He teaches a course titled Directing and Writing the Feature. In May 2019, Solondz spent a week as the filmmaker in residence at the Centre for Film and Screen at the University of Cambridge. Theatre work In 2018, Solondz premiered his debut play, titled Emma and Max. Awards In 2007, Solondz was honored with the Filmmaker on the Edge Award at the Provincetown International Film Festival.

Cooper creates five clothing ranges - Trelise Cooper, Cooper by Trelise, COOP, Board Room and Trelise Cooper Kids, all of which she shows at New Zealand Fashion Week. Customers include Liv Tyler, Miley Cyrus, Lindsay Lohan, Stevie Nicks, Suri Cruise, Julia Roberts, and The Pussycat Dolls. She also produces Trelise Cooper Interiors, a fabric range made in association with textiles house Charles Parsons. Cooper's signature fragrance 'Trelise' was launched in late 2009. It was designed by perfumer Yves Dombrowsky and has been described as an uplifting, positive scent. In March 2009, she became the first New Zealand designer to stage a fashion show on board the Queen Mary 2 cruise ship. Cooper is a patron of the Breast Cancer Research Trust, an advocate for domestic violence awareness and supports Habitat for Humanity. At 2009's New Zealand Fashion Week Cooper initiated an onsite house build to promote this charity. She is also an environmental supporter, producing eco bags for supermarket chain Progressive Enterprises. She is involved with the UN-sponsored organisation MARITAGE International, which connects young women in developed and developing countries, and also mentors young people in New Zealand. In December 2005, Cooper was involved in an intellectual property dispute with fellow New Zealand fashion designer Tamsin Cooper, objecting to Tamsin registering her name as a trademark. In July 2007, Cooper agreed to drop the suit and let Tamsin Cooper operate under her own name. As of 2016, Cooper has 10 boutiques around the world, and her ranges are stocked in more than 200 stores in Australasia, Asia, Europe, America and the Middle East. =Recognition= The Trelise Cooper Kids Auckland flagship store won the supreme award at the 2007 New Zealand Retail Interior Design Awards. In 2004, Cooper was named a Member of the New Zealand Order of Merit. In the 2014 New Year Honours, she was elevated to Dame Companion in the same Order. In 2015, Cooper announced that it will be her final year as a manager. In 2015 her collections were included into the New Zealand Fashion Museum. =Controversies= In 2011 she and at least 10 of her models were accused of creating an Asian look by stretching the models' eyes. In 2014 Trelise Cooper sparked controversy when she ordered models to wear Native American feathered headdresses which suppose to be a '70's bohemian vibe. Personal life She has a husband, Jack, and a stepdaughter, Nadia Cooper. Nadia was charged with smuggling of Methamphetamine into one of the Mount Eden Prisons, as well as its distribution in 2008.

When the sets of the collection are mutually disjoint, each element of the transversal corresponds to exactly one member of C (the set it is a member of). If the original sets are not disjoint, there are two possibilities for the definition of a transversal: * One variation is that there is a bijection f from the transversal to C such that x is an element of f(x) for each x in the transversal. In this case, the transversal is also called a system of distinct representatives (SDR). * The other, less commonly used, does not require a one-to-one relation between the elements of the transversal and the sets of C. In this situation, the members of the system of representatives are not necessarily distinct. In computer science, computing transversals is useful in several application domains, with the input family of sets often being described as a hypergraph. Existence and number A fundamental question in the study of SDR is whether or not an SDR exists. Hall's marriage theorem gives necessary and sufficient conditions for a finite collection sets, some possibly overlapping, to have a transversal. The condition is that, for every integer k, every collection of k sets must contain in common at least k different elements. The following refinement by H. J. Ryser gives lower bounds on the number of such SDRs. Theorem. Let S1, S2, ..., Sm be a collection of sets such that S_{i_1} \\\\cup S_{i_2} \\\\cup \\\\dots \\\\cup S_{i_k} contains at least k elements for k = 1,2,...,m and for all k-combinations {i_1, i_2, \\\\ldots, i_k} of the integers 1,2,...,m and suppose that each of these sets contains at least t elements. If t ‚â§ m then the collection has at least t ! SDRs, and if t > m then the collection has at least t ! / (t - m)! SDRs.  Relation to matching and covering  One can construct a bipartite graph in which the vertices on one side are the sets, the vertices on the other side are the elements, and the edges connect a set to the elements it contains. Then, a transversal is equivalent to a perfect matching in this graph. One can construct a hypergraph in which the vertices are the elements, and the hyperedges are the sets. Then, a transversal is equivalent to a vertex cover in a hypergraph. Examples In group theory, given a subgroup H of a group G, a right (respectively left) transversal is a set containing exactly one element from each right (respectively left) coset of H. In this case, the \\"sets\\" (cosets) are mutually disjoint, i.e. the cosets form a partition of the group. As a particular case of the previous example, given a direct product of groups G = H \\\\times K, then H is a transversal for the cosets of K. In general, since any equivalence relation on an arbitrary set gives rise to a partition, picking any representative from each equivalence class results in a transversal. Another instance of a partition-based transversal occurs when one considers the equivalence relation known as the (set-theoretic) kernel of a function, defined for a function f with domain X as the partition of the domain \\\\operatorname{ker} f := \\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\, \\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\, y \\\\in X \\\\mid f(x)=f(y) \\\\,\\\\right\\\\\\\\} \\\\mid x \\\\in X \\\\,\\\\right\\\\\\\\}. which partitions the domain of f into equivalence classes such that all elements in a class map via f to the same value. If f is injective, there is only one transversal of \\\\operatorname{ker} f. For a not-necessarily-injective f, fixing a transversal T of \\\\operatorname{ker} f induces a one-to-one correspondence between T and the image of f, henceforth denoted by \\\\operatorname{Im}f. Consequently, a function g: (\\\\operatorname{Im} f) \\\\to T is well defined by the property that for all z in \\\\operatorname{Im} f, g(z)=x where x is the unique element in T such that f(x)=z; furthermore, g can be extended (not necessarily in a unique manner) so that it is defined on the whole codomain of f by picking arbitrary values for g(z) when z is outside the image of f. It is a simple calculation to verify that g thus defined has the property that f\\\\circ g \\\\circ f = f, which is the proof (when the domain and codomain of f are the same set) that the full transformation semigroup is a regular semigroup. g acts as a (not necessarily unique) quasi-inverse for f; within semigroup theory this is simply called an inverse. Note however that for an arbitrary g with the aforementioned property the \\"dual\\" equation g \\\\circ f \\\\circ g= g may not hold. However if we denote by h= g \\\\circ f \\\\circ g, then f is a quasi-inverse of h, i.e. h \\\\circ f \\\\circ h = h.  Common Transversals  A common transversal of the collections A and B (where A = B = n) is a set that is a transversal of both A and B. The collections A and B have a common transversal if and only if, for all I, J \\\\subset \\\\\\\\{1,...,n\\\\\\\\}, :(\\\\bigcup_{i \\\\in I}A_i) \\\\cap (\\\\bigcup_{j \\\\in J}B_j) \\\\geq I+J-n  Generalizations  A partial transversal is a set containing at most one element from each member of the collection, or (in the stricter form of the concept) a set with an injection from the set to C. The transversals of a finite collection C of finite sets form the basis sets of a matroid, the transversal matroid of C. The independent sets of the transversal matroid are the partial transversals of C.. An independent transversal' (also called a rainbow-independent set or independent system of representatives) is a transversal which is also an independent set of a given graph. To explain the difference in figurative terms, consider a faculty with m departments, where the faculty dean wants to construct a committee of m members, one member per department. Such a committee is a transversal. But now, suppose that some faculty members dislike each other and do not agree to sit in the committee together. In this case, the committee must be an independent transversal, where the underlying graph describes the \\"dislike\\" relations. Another generalization of the concept of a transversal would be a set that just has a non-empty intersection with each member of C. An example of the latter would be a Bernstein set, which is defined as a set that has a non-empty intersection with each set of C, but contains no set of C, where C is the collection of all perfect sets of a topological Polish space. As another example, let C consist of all the lines of a projective plane, then a blocking set in this plane is a set of points which intersects each line but contains no line. Category theory In the language of category theory, a transversal of a collection of mutually disjoint sets is a section of the quotient map induced by the collection. Computational complexity The computational complexity of computing all transversals of an input family of sets has been studied, in particular in the framework of enumeration algorithms.

These models are usually designed to examine the comparative statics and dynamics of aggregate quantities such as the total amount of goods and services produced, total income earned, the level of employment of productive resources, and the level of prices. Macroeconomic models may be logical, mathematical, and/or computational; the different types of macroeconomic models serve different purposes and have different advantages and disadvantages.Blanchard, Olivier (2017), ‚ÄúThe need for different classes of macroeconomic models‚Äù, blog post, Jan. 12, 2017, Peterson Institute for International Economics. Macroeconomic models may be used to clarify and illustrate basic theoretical principles; they may be used to test, compare, and quantify different macroeconomic theories; they may be used to produce \\"what if\\" scenarios (usually to predict the effects of changes in monetary, fiscal, or other macroeconomic policies); and they may be used to generate economic forecasts. Thus, macroeconomic models are widely used in academia in teaching and research, and are also widely used by international organizations, national governments and larger corporations, as well as by economic consultants and think tanks. Types =Simple theoretical models= Simple textbook descriptions of the macroeconomy involving a small number of equations or diagrams are often called ‚Äòmodels‚Äô. Examples include the IS-LM model and Mundell‚ÄìFleming model of Keynesian macroeconomics, and the Solow model of neoclassical growth theory. These models share several features. They are based on a few equations involving a few variables, which can often be explained with simple diagrams.Blanchard, Olivier (2000), Macroeconomics, 2nd ed., Chap. 3.3, p. 47. Prentice Hall, . Many of these models are static, but some are dynamic, describing the economy over many time periods. The variables that appear in these models often represent macroeconomic aggregates (such as GDP or total employment) rather than individual choice variables, and while the equations relating these variables are intended to describe economic decisions, they are not usually derived directly by aggregating models of individual choices. They are simple enough to be used as illustrations of theoretical points in introductory explanations of macroeconomic ideas; but therefore quantitative application to forecasting, testing, or policy evaluation is usually impossible without substantially augmenting the structure of the model. =Empirical forecasting models= In the 1940s and 1950s, as governments began accumulating national income and product accounting data, economists set out to construct quantitative models to describe the dynamics observed in the data. These models estimated the relations between different macroeconomic variables using (mostly linear) time series analysis. Like the simpler theoretical models, these empirical models described relations between aggregate quantities, but many addressed a much finer level of detail (for example, studying the relations between output, employment, investment, and other variables in many different industries). Thus, these models grew to include hundreds or thousands of equations describing the evolution of hundreds or thousands of prices and quantities over time, making computers essential for their solution. While the choice of which variables to include in each equation was partly guided by economic theory (for example, including past income as a determinant of consumption, as suggested by the theory of adaptive expectations), variable inclusion was mostly determined on purely empirical grounds. Dutch economist Jan Tinbergen developed the first comprehensive national model, which he built for the Netherlands in 1936. He later applied the same modeling structure to the economies of the United States and the United Kingdom. The first global macroeconomic model, Wharton Econometric Forecasting Associates' LINK project, was initiated by Lawrence Klein. The model was cited in 1980 when Klein, like Tinbergen before him, won the Nobel Prize. Large-scale empirical models of this type, including the Wharton model, are still in use today, especially for forecasting purposes. The Lucas critique of empirical forecasting models Econometric studies in the first part of the 20th century showed a negative correlation between inflation and unemployment called the Phillips curve. Empirical macroeconomic forecasting models, being based on roughly the same data, had similar implications: they suggested that unemployment could be permanently lowered by permanently increasing inflation. However, in 1968, Milton Friedman and Edmund Phelps argued that this apparent tradeoff was illusory. They claimed that the historical relation between inflation and unemployment was due to the fact that past inflationary episodes had been largely unexpected. They argued that if monetary authorities permanently raised the inflation rate, workers and firms would eventually come to understand this, at which point the economy would return to its previous, higher level of unemployment, but now with higher inflation too. The stagflation of the 1970s appeared to bear out their prediction.Blanchard, Olivier (2000), op. cit., Ch. 28, p. 540. In 1976, Robert Lucas, Jr., published an influential paper arguing that the failure of the Phillips curve in the 1970s was just one example of a general problem with empirical forecasting models. He pointed out that such models are derived from observed relationships between various macroeconomic quantities over time, and that these relations differ depending on what macroeconomic policy regime is in place. In the context of the Phillips curve, this means that the relation between inflation and unemployment observed in an economy where inflation has usually been low in the past would differ from the relation observed in an economy where inflation has been high.Blanchard, Olivier (2000), op. cit., Ch. 28, p. 542. Furthermore, this means one cannot predict the effects of a new policy regime using an empirical forecasting model based on data from previous periods when that policy regime was not in place. Lucas argued that economists would remain unable to predict the effects of new policies unless they built models based on economic fundamentals (like preferences, technology, and budget constraints) that should be unaffected by policy changes. =Dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models= Partly as a response to the Lucas critique, economists of the 1980s and 1990s began to construct microfoundedEdmund S. Phelps, ed., (1970), Microeconomic Foundations of Employment and Inflation Theory. New York, Norton and Co. . macroeconomic models based on rational choice, which have come to be called dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models. These models begin by specifying the set of agents active in the economy, such as households, firms, and governments in one or more countries, as well as the preferences, technology, and budget constraint of each one. Each agent is assumed to make an optimal choice, taking into account prices and the strategies of other agents, both in the current period and in the future. Summing up the decisions of the different types of agents, it is possible to find the prices that equate supply with demand in every market. Thus these models embody a type of equilibrium self-consistency: agents choose optimally given the prices, while prices must be consistent with agents‚Äô supplies and demands. DSGE models often assume that all agents of a given type are identical (i.e. there is a ‚Äòrepresentative household‚Äô and a ‚Äòrepresentative firm‚Äô) and can perform perfect calculations that forecast the future correctly on average (which is called rational expectations). However, these are only simplifying assumptions, and are not essential for the DSGE methodology; many DSGE studies aim for greater realism by considering heterogeneous agents or various types of adaptive expectations.George W. Evans and Seppo Honkapohja (2001), Learning and Expectations in Macroeconomics. Princeton University Press, . Compared with empirical forecasting models, DSGE models typically have fewer variables and equations, mainly because DSGE models are harder to solve, even with the help of computers.DeJong, D. N. with C. Dave (2007), Structural Macroeconometrics. Princeton University Press, . Simple theoretical DSGE models, involving only a few variables, have been used to analyze the forces that drive business cycles; this empirical work has given rise to two main competing frameworks called the real business cycle modelThomas F. Cooley (1995), Frontiers of Business Cycle Research. Princeton University Press.Andrew Abel and Ben Bernanke (1995), Macroeconomics, 2nd ed., Ch. 11.1, pp. 355-362. Addison-Wesley, . and the New Keynesian DSGE model. More elaborate DSGE models are used to predict the effects of changes in economic policy and evaluate their impact on social welfare. However, economic forecasting is still largely based on more traditional empirical models, which are still widely believed to achieve greater accuracy in predicting the impact of economic disturbances over time. DSGE versus CGE models A closely related methodology that pre-dates DSGE modeling is computable general equilibrium (CGE) modeling. Like DSGE models, CGE models are often microfounded on assumptions about preferences, technology, and budget constraints. However, CGE models focus mostly on long-run relationships, making them most suited to studying the long-run impact of permanent policies like the tax system or the openness of the economy to international trade. DSGE models instead emphasize the dynamics of the economy over time (often at a quarterly frequency), making them suited for studying business cycles and the cyclical effects of monetary and fiscal policy. =Agent-based computational macroeconomic models= Another modeling methodology which has developed at the same time as DSGE models is Agent-based computational economics (ACE), which is a variety of Agent-based modeling. Like the DSGE methodology, ACE seeks to break down aggregate macroeconomic relationships into microeconomic decisions of individual agents. ACE models also begin by defining the set of agents that make up the economy, and specify the types of interactions individual agents can have with each other or with the market as a whole. Instead of defining the preferences of those agents, ACE models often jump directly to specifying their strategies. Or sometimes, preferences are specified, together with an initial strategy and a learning rule whereby the strategy is adjusted according to its past success. Given these strategies, the interaction of large numbers of individual agents (who may be very heterogeneous) can be simulated on a computer, and then the aggregate, macroeconomic relationships that arise from those individual actions can be studied. Strengths and weaknesses of DSGE and ACE models DSGE and ACE models have different advantages and disadvantages due to their different underlying structures. DSGE models may exaggerate individual rationality and foresight, and understate the importance of heterogeneity, since the rational expectations, representative agent case remains the simplest and thus the most common type of DSGE model to solve. Also, unlike ACE models, it may be difficult to study local interactions between individual agents in DSGE models, which instead focus mostly on the way agents interact through aggregate prices. On the other hand, ACE models may exaggerate errors in individual decision-making, since the strategies assumed in ACE models may be very far from optimal choices unless the modeler is very careful. A related issue is that ACE models which start from strategies instead of preferences may remain vulnerable to the Lucas critique: a changed policy regime should generally give rise to changed strategies.

Traversing the Pisgah National Forest and the Cherokee National Forest in the Blue Ridge Mountains, the river's watershed is home to some of the highest mountains in the Appalachians, including Mount Mitchell, the highest point in the eastern United States. The river is a tributary of the French Broad River, and is impounded by Nolichucky Dam near Greeneville, Tennessee. Hydrography The Nolichucky River rises as the confluence of the North Toe River and the Cane River near the community of Huntdale, North Carolina. The stream succeeds the North Toe as the boundary between Yancey County and Mitchell County, North Carolina. Trending roughly westward, it flows along the northern base of Flattop Mountain. The gorge is especially steep on its north side. Geologically, the area is predominantly underlain by metamorphic rock of Precambrian age. The Nolichucky, approaching Erwin, Tennessee from the east, as seen from the Appalachian Trail just south of Erwin The river then enters Unicoi County, Tennessee, as it drops through a whitewater gorge, flowing between the ranges of the Bald Mountains (to the south) and the Unaka Mountains (to the north). Turning northwest, the stream is bridged by the Appalachian Trail, and then, just beyond this, by U.S. Highway 19W southwest of Erwin, Tennessee. Near Erwin, two tributary streams, South Indian Creek and North Indian Creek, join the Nolichucky River. Turning more to the north, the stream is paralleled for several miles by State Route 81, (which is also concurrent with Tennessee State Route 107 for several miles) crossing into Washington County. The river cuts between several mountains at this point, including Rich Mountain to the south and Buffalo Mountain to the north. Shortly after entering Washington County, the river makes a horseshoe bend near Embreeville, where it is bridged by Tennessee 81 and Tennessee 107 for the first time. At the northeastern end of Embreeville Mountain, the stream emerges from a large gap, and, turning west-southwest, is bridged by Tennessee 81 again. Here, it exits the Blue Ridge Mountains and enters the Ridge and Valley province, which is underlain primarily by sedimentary rock of the Lower Paleozoic Era. The river then continues west-southwest for several miles, paralleled by State Route 107. The river leaves the roadside near Mt. Carmel. From there it flows northwest over a winding course to Davy Crockett Birthplace State Park near the Washington County-Greene County line. Many tributary creeks join the river in Washington and Greene Counties. At the county line one of the larger tributaries, Big Limestone Creek, joins the river. State Route 351 crosses the river west of Crockett's birthplace. The Nolichucky at Davy Crockett Birthplace State Park From Crockett's birthplace the river flows southwestward, following the trends of the Ridge and Valley province's underlying geology. Bridged by Tennessee 107 again just east of Tusculum, the stream continues southwestward, later bridged by State Route 350 just above an impoundment caused by Nolichucky Dam. This dam was constructed as a hydroelectric project by the former Tennessee Electric Power Company in 1912. The dam was sold to the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) in 1939. The TVA continued to operate the dam for electrical power purposes until the 1970s. The degree of siltation of the reservoir, called Davy Crockett Lake, had made continued efforts to operate the facility for hydroelectric purposes impracticable. The agency retired the dam as a power source but continues to maintain it and to use it for flood control and recreational purposes. Just west of the dam, the river crosses State Route 70 and State Route 107 for a third and final time. Continuing almost due west, the river is bridged by U.S. Highway 321. Just before reaching the Greene County-Cocke County line, the river is bridged by State Route 340. Just past this point, the river becomes the Greene County-Cocke County line. A few miles below this point it is bridged by Knob Creek Road, a Cocke County road. South of Interstate 81, Greene County, Cocke County, and Hamblen County come to a point at a bend in river, where Lick Creek joins the river. From this point on, the meandering stream forms the Hamblen County-Cocke County line. The confluence of the Nolichucky with the French Broad River occurs in the upstream portion of the Douglas Lake impoundment, caused by Douglas Dam, a World War II-era TVA project located downstream along the French Broad. The mouth of the Nolichucky lies near the point where Hamblen, Cocke, and Jefferson County meet. Near the mouth is the Rankin Wildlife Management Area, a reserve operated by the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency. History While the origins of the name-place have long been debated and remain unclear, it is believed to be derived from the name of the Cherokee village Na‚Äôna-tlu gun‚Äôyi, or \\"Spruce- Tree Place,\\" that once stood near modern Jonesborough, Tennessee. Others argue that, according to local lore, it actually means \\"Rushing Water(s)\\", \\"Dangerous Water(s)\\", or \\"Black Swirling Water\\". Remnants of a railroad bridge near Erwin destroyed by the flood of May 1901; the flood was the river's largest on record During the 1770s, European frontiersmen established the \\"Nolichucky settlements\\" along the river in modern Greene County, Tennessee, in what was then part of Cherokee territory. These settlements were aligned with the Watauga settlements in what is now Elizabethton, Tennessee. As hostilities intensified in the mid-1770s between the settlers and a faction of the Cherokee, known as the \\"Chickamaugas,\\" who were opposed to the settlements, John Sevier, at the time a young militia officer, began overseeing the construction of Fort Lee. After an invasion was launched by Chickamauga leader Dragging Canoe in July 1776, Sevier abandoned the unfinished fort and fled to the Watauga settlements. Sevier would later acquire the nickname \\"Nolichucky Jack,\\" or \\"Chucky Jack,\\" for his exploits along the river and in its vicinity.Jen Stoecker and Carroll Van West, \\".\\" National Register of Historic Places Multiple Property inventory form, 2001. Famed frontiersman Davy Crockett was born along the river near Limestone, Tennessee, in 1786. The site is now the focus of Davy Crockett Birthplace State Park. The turn of the century brought trains hauling passengers (until 1955) and mostly coal on the Clinchfield Railroad (now operated by CSX), which still runs alongside the river through the gorge with bridged crossings at Unaka Springs (Erwin, Tennessee) and Poplar, North Carolina. At least one sunken railcar sits at the bottom of the river near the entrance to the Lost Cove Settlement, a civil-war era ghost town just upriver (and uphill) from the once-disputed Tennessee-North Carolina border. Whitewater rafting Between Poplar, North Carolina, and Unaka Springs, Tennessee, the Nolichucky River Gorge provides one of the more scenic and technical whitewater trips in the Southern United States, due in large part to its constant (and often rapid) fluctuations.USGS 03465500 Nolichucky River at Embreeville, TN, U.S. Geological Survey National Water Information System. Accessed: 3 June 2015. The naturally flowing Nolichucky River is a popular whitewater rafting and canoeing destination having stretches of both whitewater areas and calm water.

Greasy Cove in > Unicoi County: Authentic Folklore. p. 26. Inversely, a lack of adequate rainfall throughout the summer considerably increases the difficulty of navigating the pre-existing aspects of the rapids, which already tend towards being both technically difficult and challenging for rafters. These unusually dry conditions and concomitant low water levels reveal a vast diversity of hitherto unseen features. These hazards are ordinarily submerged during summers with normal seasonal rainfall patterns, and the associated lower water levels Seasonal droughts can make rafting trips inadvisable or simply impassable (nothing's impossible), prompting local rafting companies in Unicoi County to sometimes divert whitewater river trips to the Watauga River running through Elizabethton, Tennessee in Carter County. The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) regulates flow of the Watauga River and guarantees a minimum release schedule accommodating whitewater rafting companies during the summer season with the regular release of deep, impounded reservoir waters from behind both the Watauga Dam and the Wilbur Dam.Nolichucky: High water temporarily strands campers; rafting company expects boon in business.

Early life and career  Eastman was born in Oberlin, Ohio and moved to Cleveland at age 7. In her biography of her friend and mentor, William Howard Brett, Eastman wrote about an early interaction she had with him that would shape her career. Visiting the Cleveland library to acquire a book she needed for school, Eastman was told by an assistant that the book had been checked out and was unavailable. Brett, who was then head librarian, happened to pass by and overheard this exchange, and immediately offered to have someone go purchase another copy of the book for Eastman to check out.Eastman, 1940, p.19 Following high school Eastman became a teacher, but soon decided to pursue library work instead.Cramer, 1972, p. 139 Eastman started working at the Cleveland Public Library in 1892 as an apprentice, and in 1894 took charge of the West Side Branch Library, where she established The Open Shelf, a newsletter for library patrons highlighting new releases.\\"Ohio Memories\\" Eastman left for a better position in the Dayton Library System in 1895 but returned quickly when Brett offered her the position of vice- Librarian.Ohio Memories In that position, Eastman helped implement Brett's revolutionary and highly successful open shelf system, whereby patrons could choose their own titles from library shelves rather than having to ask library staff to retrieve books from restricted stacks.

Front entrance to the Cleveland Public Library's central location on Superior Avenue Plans for the new library began in 1912, but political and financial questions (and World War I) delayed the beginning of construction until 1923, after a series of successful bond initiatives spearheaded by Eastman.Cramer, 1972, p. 142 The library opened to the public in May 1925 with a grand public event, featuring a main address by former British Prime Minister David Lloyd George.Cramer, 1972, p.143 The new building was, at the time, the third largest library in the country, boasting six floors and a main reading room that could seat 200.Cramer, 1972, p.144 = Special services = Eastman helped devise special centers that would serve patrons‚Äô needs for specific sorts of information. The unique Travel Section was established in 1926 and featured not only travel pamphlets, but also \\"selected volumes on the history, geography, and society of the major countries of the world.\\"Cramer, 1972, p. 164 In 1928, the Eastman established the Business Information Bureau.Cramer, 1972, p.160 This space served not only as a research facility for Cleveland's businesspeople, but also as a vocational resource center. In addition to creating special collections and services, Eastman took steps to extend the reach of the library, establishing in 1926 a service to distribute books to hospitalized readers.Cramer, 1972, p.159 = Services for blind patrons = Eastman's attempts to improve services for blind patrons began in 1903 when she instituted Braille classes as part of the Library's offering.Cramer, 1972, p. 155 Her attempts to build the library's Braille collection were frustrated by the high price of the books and the difficulty of transporting them, but by 1928 the Library had a collection of six thousand Braille texts.Cramer, 1972, p.156 When Eastman retired, the special service was distributing books to thirty thousand blind patrons across northern Ohio.Cramer, 1972, p. 156 In addition to Braille texts, the Cleveland Library was trailblazing in its use of books recorded on phonograph, initially conceived as a solution for blind patrons who were unable to read Braille.Cramer, 1972, p.158 = Great Depression = The Cleveland Library suffered financial cuts during the 1930s, even as public demand for library services soared. Wages were severely cut and funds for new books dried up. The financial situation got so bad that in 1932 a sign had to be placed in the new book section reading, \\"No New Books for Display this Week Because of Curtailed Funds. Have You Read These Older Titles?\\"Cramer, 1972, p.166 Nonetheless, library patronage soared as unemployed and underemployed Clevelanders came to the library for a variety of purposes. Eastman told the Chicago Daily Tribune that \\"many of the unemployed patronizing the library call for reference works which will be of benefit to them in their vocation. They are also calling for books and magazines of general culture, finding that since they have a great deal of time and can now enjoy the books they never had time to read before.\\"\\"Jobless Turn to Books . . .,\\" 1931 Eastman was forced to take extreme cost-cutting measures to keep the library open, aided by widespread public support of the library and appreciation of its services.Cramer, 1972, p.170  Retirement and legacy  Eastman retired from the library in 1938 at age 71, citing a desire to spend more time outdoors. The Plain Dealer summed up the library's condition at the time of her retirement: \\"She leaves the library the third largest in the United States, with 28 branches, 108 stations, 30 school libraries and ten county libraries administered under the system. Also with a million books on its shelves, a circulation of over eight million a year, and the good will of the entire population of Cleveland, each man, woman and child having been sold the idea that the Public Library is his own private library, to serve him according to his needs\\".\\"Miss Eastman Resigns,\\" 1938 Following her retirement, both a branch libraryEastman Branch of the Cleveland Public Library. and a reading garden at the Main Library were named in her honor.\\"Riverside Cemetery\\" In 1954 she was named Honorary Member of the American Library Association. American Library Association, Honorary Membership. http://www.ala.org/awardsgrants/awards/176/all_years Eastman died in 1963 at age 96. Footnotes References *Associated Press. (1937, August 22).

It is located primarily in Lushan county-level city in Jiujiang Prefecture, although the northern portions are found in Lianxi District which was formerly known as Lushan District and until 2016 covered the majority of the Mount Lu. The oval- shaped mountains are about 25 km long and 10 km wide, and neighbors Jiujiang city and the Yangtze River to the north, Nanchang city to the south, and Poyang Lake to the east. Its highest point is Dahanyang Peak (), reaching 1,474 m above sea level, and is one of the hundreds of steep peaks that towers above a sea of clouds that encompass the mountains for almost 200 days out of the year. Mount Lu is known for its grandeur, steepness, and beauty, and is part of Lushan National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1996, and a prominent tourist attraction, especially during the summer months when the weather is cooler. Lushan was a summer resort for Western missionaries in China. Absalom Sydenstricker, the father of Pearl Buck, was one of the first five missionaries to acquire property in the Kuling Estate on the mountain. The development of Kuling was instigated by the Reverend Edward Little and Dr. Edgerton H. Hart.\\"The History of Lushan & Kuling\\" by Stanley Crawford The four principal founders of the China's Nurses Association and its first president, Caroline Maddock Hart; met in Kuling to form this association.\\"Wuhu Missionaries\\" by Cathleen Green and Stanley Crawford Attractions and Features Popular attractions in Mount Lu include the Immortal Caverns (), Meilu Outhouse (), Five Old Man Peaks (), White Deer Cavern Academy (), Three Tiled Springs (), Luling Lake (), Lushan Hot Springs (), Botanical Gardens (), the Bamboo Temple (), Guanyin Bridge (), Peach Blossom Garden (), Catholic Church of Mount Lu (), and many more. * Huiyuan founded Pure Land Buddhism here on the northwest slope in 402. Donglin Temple is also located here. * Lushan National Park is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and Lushan Quaternary Glaciation National Geopark is a member of UNESCO Global Geoparks Network. * The Lushan Botanical Gardens features tens of thousands of plant species. * Below the Five Old Men Peak is the White Deer Grotto Academy, named after the poet Li Bo () (not to be confused with the famous poet Li Bai), who raised white deer there. It is one of the most famous higher learning institutions in ancient China. * West is the Flower Path which provided inspiration to Bai Juyi, a famous poet who lived during the Tang Dynasty. * Between the Yangtze River and Lake Poyang lie the Greater and Lesser Tianchi Lakes, the Jingxiu Valley, and Lulin Lake. On the north bank of the latter is the Lushan Museum, which features pottery and bronzes dating from various periods of ancient China, as well as calligraphy from the Tang Dynasty and paintings from the Ming and Qing dynasties. * At the centre (between three peaks), and at an altitude of over 1 kilometer above sea level, is the town of Guling, which is linked by a mountain highway to neighboring spots in the region. * World- famous Lushan Clouds and Mist Tea () is grown in the mountains. Political significance During the Long March, in early 1935, a battle took place in this area between communist and republican forces, in which Hu Yaobang, later General Secretary of the Communist Party of China, was seriously injured. Mount Lu was once dubbed the xiadu (\\"summer capital\\") of the Republic of China. Chiang Kai-shek, China's leader at the time, would frequently spend his summers here. In June 1937, Zhou Enlai, then a major leader in the Communist Party, met with Chiang on the mountain to discuss a united front against the Japanese invasion. In July 1937, Chiang Kai-shek announced his intention for a full mobilization for war against Japan from Mount Lu. In 1946, following the war, the U.S. special diplomatic mission led by General George C. Marshall met with Chiang Kai-Shek to discuss the role of post-World War II China. Mao Zedong convened three large conferences of senior party officials at Mount Lu, in 1959, 1961, and 1970. The 1959 conference became known as the Lushan Conference. The meeting saw the purge of decorated Chinese Civil War and Korean War general Peng Dehuai, who was critical of Mao's Great Leap Forward policies. The 1970 Lushan Conference took place during the Cultural Revolution, and marked the increasing antagonism between those loyal to Mao and those loyal to his chosen successor Lin Biao.

The Allies consisted of British Imperial Forces, including a Greek contingent, with American and French corps. The battle opened with initial success by the German and Italian forces but the massive supply interdiction efforts led to the decisive defeat of the Axis. Over 250,000 German and Italian troops were taken as prisoners of war, including most of the Afrika Korps. Background =Western Desert= The first two years of the war in North Africa were characterized by chronic supply shortages and transport problems. The North African coast has few natural harbors and the British base at Alexandria on the Nile delta was some by road from the main Italian port at Tripoli in Libya. Smaller ports at Benghazi and Tobruk were and west of Alexandria on the Litoranea Balbo (Via Balbia) running along a narrow corridor along the coast. Control of the central Mediterranean was contested by the British and Italian navies, which were equally matched and exerted a reciprocal constraint supply through Alexandria, Tripoli, Benghazi and Tobruk, although the British could supply Egypt via the long route through the Atlantic around the Cape of Good Hope and by the Indian Ocean into the Red Sea. The chronic difficulty in the supply of military forces in the desert led to several indecisive victories by both sides and long fruitless advances along the coast. The Italian invasion of Egypt by the 10th Army in 1940, advanced into Egypt and more than in a straight line from Tripoli, from Benghazi and from Tobruk. The Western Desert Force (WDF) fought a delaying action as it fell back to Mersa Matruh (Matruh), then began Operation Compass, a raid and counter-attack into Libya. The 10th Army was destroyed and the WDF occupied El Agheila, some from Alexandria. With the arrival of the German Afrika Korps, the Axis counter-attacked in Operation Sonnenblume and in April 1941 reached the limit of their supply capacity at the Egyptian border but failed to recapture Tobruk. In November 1941 the British Eighth Army recovered, helped by the short supply distance from Alexandria to the front line and launched Operation Crusader, relieving the Siege of Tobruk and again reached El Agheila. The Eighth Army was soon pushed back to Gazala west of Tobruk and at the Battle of Gazala in May 1942, the Axis pushed them all the way back to El Alamein, only from Alexandria. In 1942, the Royal Navy and Italian Navy were still disputing the Mediterranean but the British hold on Malta, and intelligence from Ultra, allowed the Royal Air Force to sink more Italian supply ships. Large quantities of supplies became available to the British from the United States and the supply situation of the Eighth Army eventually resolved. With the Eighth Army no longer constrained, the Axis were driven westwards from Egypt following the Second Battle of El Alamein in November 1942. =Operation Torch= American troops land on an Algerian beach during Operation Torch. In July 1942, the Allies discussed relatively small-scale amphibious operations to land in northern France during 1942 (Operation Sledgehammer, which was the forerunner of Operation Roundup, the main landings in 1943), but agreed that these operations were impractical and should be deferred.Playfair, p. 111. Instead it was agreed that landings would be made to secure the Vichy territories in North Africa (Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia) and then to thrust east to take the Axis forces in the Western Desert in their rear.Playfair, p. 114. An Allied occupation of the whole of the North African coast would open the Mediterranean to Allied shipping, releasing the huge capacity required to maintain supplies around the circuitous route via the Cape of Good Hope. On 8 November, Operation Torch landed Allied forces in Algeria (at Oran and Algiers) and Morocco (at Casablanca) with the intention that once Vichy forces in Algeria had capitulated, an advance would be made to Tunis some to the east. Prelude =Allied plans= Because of the nearness of Sicily to Tunisia, the Allies expected that the Axis would move to occupy the country as soon as they heard of the Torch landings.Playfair, pp. 151‚Äì152. To forestall this, it would be necessary to occupy Tunisia as quickly as possible after the landings were made. However, there was a limit to how far east the Torch landings could be made because of the increasing proximity of Axis airfields in Sicily and Sardinia which at the end of October held 298 German and 574 Italian aircraft.Playfair, p. 116. Algiers was accordingly chosen for the most easterly landings. This would ensure the success of the initial landings in spite of uncertainty as to how the incumbent French forces would react. Once Algiers was secured, a small force, the Eastern Task Force, would be projected as quickly as possible into Tunisia in a race to occupy Tunis, some distant along poor roads in difficult terrain during the winter rainy season, before the Axis could organise.Playfair, pp. 117‚Äì118. However, planners had to assume the worst case regarding the extent of Vichy opposition at Algiers and the invasion convoys were assault-loaded with a preponderance of infantry to meet heavy ground opposition. This meant that at Algiers the disembarkation of mobile forces for an advance to Tunisia would necessarily be delayed.Hinsley, pp. 472‚Äì473 Plans were thus a compromise and the Allies realised that an attempt to reach Bizerte and Tunis overland before the Axis could establish themselves represented a gamble which depended on the ability of the navy and air force to delay the Axis build-up.Playfair, p. 239. The Allies, although they had provided for the possibility of strong Vichy opposition to their landings both in terms of infantry and air force allocations, seriously underestimated the Axis appetite for and speed of intervention in Tunisia.Hinsley, p. 487 Italian Semovente 75/18 Once operations had commenced and despite clear intelligence reports regarding the Axis reaction, the Allies were slow to respond and it was not until nearly two weeks after the landings that air and naval plans were made to interdict Axis sea transport to Tunis.Hinsley, p. 493 At the end of November, naval Force K was reformed in Malta with three cruisers and four destroyers and Force Q formed in B√¥ne with three cruisers and two destroyers. No Axis ships sailing to Tunis were sunk in November but the Allied naval forces had some success in early December sinking seven Axis transports. However, this came too late to affect the fighting on land because the armoured elements of 10th Panzer Division had already arrived. To counter the surface threat, Axis convoys were switched to daylight when they could be protected by air cover. Night convoys resumed on completion of the extension of Axis minefields which severely restricted the activities of Force K and Force Q.Hinsley, pp. 495‚Äì496 =Tunisia= Sketch map of Tunisia during the 1942‚Äì1943 campaign Tunisia is rectangular, with its northern and much of its eastern boundary on the Mediterranean coast. Most of the inland western border with Algeria is astride the eastern line of the Atlas Mountains which run from the Atlantic coast of Morocco, east to Tunis. This portion of the border is easily defensible at the small number of passes through the two north‚Äìsouth lines of the mountains. In the south a lower range of mountains limit the approaches to a narrow gap, facing Libya to the east, between the Matmata Hills and the coast. The French had earlier constructed a wide and deep series of defensive works known as the Mareth Line along the plain, to defend against an Italian invasion from Libya. Only in the north was the terrain favourable to attack; here the Atlas Mountains stopped near the eastern coast, leaving a large area on the north-west coast unprotected. Defensive lines in the north could deal with approaching forces, while the Mareth Line made the south secure. In between, there were only a few easily defended passes through the Atlas Mountains. Tunisia has two big deep water ports at Tunis and Bizerte, only a few hundred miles from Italian supply bases in Sicily. Ships could deliver supplies at night, safe from RAF patrols and return the next night, while Libya was a full-day trip, making supply operations vulnerable to daylight air attacks. In Hitler's view, Tunisia could be held indefinitely, upsetting Allied plans in Europe. Run for Tunis Tunisia campaign operations 25 November to 10 December 1942 By 10 November, French opposition to the Torch landings had ceased, creating a military vacuum in Tunisia. The First Army (Lieutenant-General Kenneth Anderson) was immediately ordered to send the 36th Infantry Brigade Group, which had been the floating reserve for the Algiers landing, eastward by sea to occupy the Algerian ports of Bougie, Philippeville, and B√¥ne and the airfield at Djedjelli, preliminary to advancing into Tunisia. The Combined Chiefs of Staff had decided that with the forces available, Torch would not include landings close to Tunisia. Anderson needed to get his limited force east quickly, before the Axis could reinforce Tunisia, but the Allies had only two brigade groups and some additional armour and artillery for the attack. The French governor in Tunisia, Admiral Esteva, was afraid to support the Allies or oppose the Axis. He did not close airfields to either side; the Germans moved first and by 9 November, there were reports of 40 German aircraft arriving at Tunis and by 10 November, aerial reconnaissance reported 100 aircraft.Playfair, p. 152. Two days later, an airlift began that carried over 15,000 men and of supplies and ships brought 176 tanks, 131 artillery pieces, 1,152 vehicles and of supplies. By the end of the month, three German divisions, including the 10th Panzer Division, and two Italian infantry divisions had arrived. Walther Nehring took command of the new XC Corps on 12 November and arrived on 17 November. The French military commander in Tunisia, General Barr√©, moved troops into the western mountains of Tunisia and formed a defensive line from Tebersouk through Majaz al Bab (Medjez el Bab).Watson (2007), p. 60 There were two roads eastwards into Tunisia from Algeria. The Allied plan was to advance along the two roads and take Bizerte and Tunis. On 11 November, the British 36th Infantry Brigade had landed unopposed at Bougie but supply shortages delayed their arrival at Djedjelli until 13 November. B√¥ne airfield was occupied following a parachute drop by 3rd Parachute Battalion and this was followed by 6 Commando seizing the port on 12 November. Advanced guards of the 36th Infantry Brigade reached Tebarka on 15 November and Djebel Abiod on 18 November, where they met Axis forces. Further south, on 15 November, a US parachute battalion made an unopposed drop at Youks-les- Bains, capturing the airfield and advanced to take the airfield at Gafsa on 17 November. On 19 November Nehring demanded passage for his forces across the bridge at Medjez and was refused by Barr√©. The Germans attacked twice and were repulsed, but the French defensive success was costly, and lacking armour and artillery, the French had to withdraw. Some Vichy French forces, such as Barr√©'s, joined the Allies. But the attitude of Vichy forces remained uncertain until on 22 November, when the \\"Darlan Deal\\" placed French North Africa on the Allied side. This allowed US and British forces that had been securing Algeria to go to the front. By this time, the Axis had deployed a corps in Tunisia and outnumbered the Allies there in almost all ways. US crew of an M3 Lee tank at Souk el Arba, 23 November 1942 Two Allied brigade groups advanced toward Djebel Abiod and B√©ja respectively. The Luftwaffe, happy to have local air superiority while Allied planes had to fly from relatively distant bases in Algeria, harassed them all the way.Ford (1999), p. 17 On 17 November, the same day Nehring arrived, the leading elements of the British 36th Brigade on the northern road met a mixed force of 17 tanks and 400 paratroops with self-propelled guns at Djebel Abiod. The German paratroopers, with Luftwaffe and Italian fire support from the 1st Mountain Infantry Division Superga, knocked out 11 tanks but their advance was halted while the fight at Djebel Abiod continued for nine days.Ford (1999), pp. 19‚Äì22 On 22 November, tanks from the Italian 50th Brigade forced US paratroopers to abandon Gafsa. The two Allied columns concentrated at Djebel Abiod and B√©ja, preparing for an assault on 24 November. The 36th Brigade was to advance from Djebel Abiod toward Mateur and 11th Brigade was to move down the valley of the River Merjerda to take Majaz al Bab (shown on Allied maps as Medjez el Bab or just Medjez) and then to Tebourba, Djedeida and Tunis. Blade Force, an armoured regimental group made up of 37mm gun Stuart light tanks and 75mm M3 GMC self propelled guns, was to strike across country on minor roads in the gap between the two infantry brigades towards Sidi Nsir and make flanking attacks on Terbourba and Djedeida.Ford (1999), p. 23 Crusader III tanks in Tunisia, 31 December 1942 The northern attack did not take place because torrential rain had slowed the build-up. In the south 11th Brigade were halted by stiff resistance at Medjez. Blade Force passed through Sidi Nsir to reach the Chouigui Pass, north of Terbourba part of B Squadren Stuart's from Blade Force infiltrated behind Axis lines to the newly activated airbase at Djedeida in the afternoon and destroyed more than 20 Axis planes but lacking infantry support, withdrew to Chouigui. The understrength tank Squadrons and three M3 GMC French 75s were to hold the pass. A mixed unit of Mark III and Mark IV Panzers and a small Italian scouting Force, around 15 tanks all told. Frontal attacks by the GMC and Stuarts were ineffective losing 12 tanks, but allowed a rear attack by B Squadron firing into the weaker rear armour of the German tanks. The German commander, believing he had encountered a much stronger force, retreated. Ford (1999), pp. 23‚Äì25 Blade Force's attack caught Nehring by surprise and he decided to withdraw from Medjez and strengthen Djedeida, only from Tunis.Ford (1999), p.25 The 36th Brigade's delayed attack began on 26 November but they were ambushed with the leading battalion taking 149 casualties.Ford (1999), p.28 Further attacks were driven back from cleverly planned interlocking defences. 1 Commando landed west of Bizerte on 30 November to outflank the Jefna position, but failed and rejoined 36th Brigade by 3 December. The position remained in German hands until the last days of fighting in Tunisia the following spring.Ford (1999), p. 40 German paratrooper with rifle, pistol, stick grenade and machinegun belt in Tunisia, near the Algerian border Early on 26 November, as the Germans withdrew, 11 Brigade were able to enter Medjez unopposed and by late in the day had taken positions in and around Tebourba, which had also been evacuated by the Germans, preparatory to advancing on Djedeida. However, on 27 November the Germans attacked in strength. 11th Brigade tried to regain the initiative in the early hours of 28 November, attacking toward Djedeida airfield with the help of US armour, but failed.Ford (1999), pp. 37‚Äì38 On 29 November, Combat Command B of US 1st Armored Division had concentrated forward for an attack in conjunction with Blade Force planned for 2 December. They were forestalled by an Axis counter- attack, led by Major-General Wolfgang Fischer, whose 10th Panzer Division had just arrived in Tunisia.Watson (2007), pp. 62‚Äì63 By the evening of 2 December, Blade Force had been withdrawn, leaving 11th Brigade and Combat Command B to deal with the Axis attack. The attack threatened to cut off 11th Brigade and break through into the Allied rear, but desperate fighting over four days delayed the Axis advance and permitted a controlled withdrawal to the high ground on each side of the river west of Terbourba.Ford (1999), p. 50 The Allied force initially withdrew roughly to the high positions of Longstop Hill (Djebel el Ahmera) and Bou Aoukaz on each side of the river. Concern over the vulnerability to flanking attacks prompted a further withdrawal west. By the end of 10 December, Allied units held a defensive line just east of Medjez el Bab. Here, they started a build up for another attack and were ready by late December 1942. The slow build up had brought Allied force levels up to a total of 54,000 British, 73,800 American and 7,000 French troops. A hasty intelligence review showed about 125,000 combat and 70,000 service troops, mostly Italian, in front of them. The main attack began the afternoon of 22 December. Despite rain and insufficient air cover, progress was made up the lower ridges of the Longstop Hill that controlled the river corridor from Medjez to Tebourba and thence to Tunis. After three days of to-and-fro fighting, with ammunition running low and Axis forces now holding adjacent high ground, the Longstop position became untenable and the Allies were forced to withdraw to Medjez,Ford (1999), pp. 53‚Äì54 and by 26 December 1942 the Allies had withdrawn to the line they had set out from two weeks earlier, having suffered 20,743 casualties. =Aftermath= French politics General Charles de Gaulle and General Charles Mast saluting at Tunis, Tunisia, 1943 While the battles wound down, factionalism among the French again erupted. On 24 December, Fran√ßois Darlan was assassinated and Henri Giraud succeeded him as High Commissioner. To the frustration of the Free French, the US government had displayed considerable willingness to make a deal with Darlan and the Vichyists. Consequently, Darlan's death appeared to present an opportunity to bring together the French in North Africa and Charles de Gaulle's Free French. De Gaulle and Giraud met in late January but little progress was made in reconciling their differences or the constituencies they represented.Playfair, p. 266. It was not until June 1943 that the French Committee of National Liberation (CFLN) was formed under the joint chairmanship of Giraud and de Gaulle. De Gaulle quickly eclipsed Giraud, who openly disliked political responsibility and more or less willingly from then on deferred to the Leader of the Free French. Command changes Nehring, considered by most to be an excellent commander, had continually infuriated his superiors with outspoken critiques. He was \\"replaced\\" when the command was renamed the 5th Panzer Army and Colonel-General Hans-J√ºrgen von Arnim arrived in Tunis unannounced on 8 December, to assume command. The Army consisted of the composite Infantry Division von Broich/von Manteuffel in the Bizerte area, the 10th Panzer Division in the centre before Tunis and the 1st Mountain Infantry Division \\"Superga\\" on the southern flank, but Hitler had told Arnim that the army would grow to three mechanised and three motorised divisions.Watson (2007), p. 64 The Allies had tried to prevent the Axis build up with substantial air and sea forces but Tunis and Bizerte were only from the ports and airfields of western Sicily, from Palermo and from Naples, making it very difficult to intercept Axis transports which had the benefit of substantial air cover. From mid-November 1942 to January 1943, 243,000 men and of supplies and equipment arrived in Tunisia by sea and air. German reinforcements; a Sd.Kfz. 8 half-track and a tractor pull transport from a Messerschmitt Me 323 Gigant. General Eisenhower transferred further units from Morocco and Algeria eastward into Tunisia. In the north, the British First Army, over the next three months, received three more British divisions, the 1st, 4th, and 46th Infantry Divisions, joining the 6th Armoured and 78th Infantry Divisions. By late March the British IX Corps HQ (Lieutenant-General John Crocker) had arrived to join the British V Corps (Lieutenant-General Charles Allfrey) in commanding the expanded army. On their right flank, the basis of a two-division French XIX Corps (General Alphonse Juin) was assembling.Playfair, pp. 258‚Äì259. In the south was the US II Corps (Major General Lloyd Fredendall), consisting of the 1st and 34th Infantry Divisions and the 1st Armored Division (although the 34th Division was attached to the British IX Corps to the north). Giraud refused to have the French XIX Corps under the command of the British First Army and so they, along with the US II Corps, remained under command of Allied Force Headquarters (AFHQ). New forward airfields were built to improve air support. The Americans also began bases in Algeria and Tunisia, to form a large forward base at Maknassy, on the eastern edge of the Atlas Mountains, well placed to cut off the Panzerarmee in the south from Tunis and the Fifth Panzer Army in the north. Kasserine =Prelude= A German Tiger tank on the move, in Tunisia January 1943 During the first half of January, Anderson had with mixed results kept constant pressure through limited attacks and reconnaissance in strength. Arnim did the same and on 18 January, launched Unternehmen Eilbote I (Operation Courier I).Watson (2007), p. 67 Elements of the 10th Panzer and 334th Infantry divisions attacked from Pont du Fahs to create more space in front of the Superga Division and forestall an Allied thrust east to the coast at Enfidaville, to cut Rommel's line of communication.Playfair, pp. 278‚Äì279. The westward thrust against the right wing of the British V Corps at Bou Arada had little success but further south his attack against French positions around the \\"hinge\\" of the Western and Eastern Dorsals succeeded, advancing south to Ousseltia and south-west to Robaa. The poorly equipped defenders resisted well but were overwhelmed and the equivalent of seven infantry battalions were cut off in the mountains.Playfair, p. 279 Anderson sent the 36th Brigade to Robaa and requested Lloyd Fredendall to send Combat Command B from 1st Armored Division to Ousseltia, to come under Juin's orders on arrival. Fierce fighting lasted until 23 January but the front was stabilised. Italian General Giovanni Messe The obvious lack of Allied co-ordination led Eisenhower to change the command structure. On 21 January Anderson was made responsible for the co- ordination of the whole front, and on 24 January his responsibilities were extended to include \\"the employment of American troops\\". That night, Juin accepted the command of Anderson, confirmed by Giraud the next day but with forces spread over a front and poor communication (Anderson motored over in four days to speak to the corps commanders) the practical difficulties remained. Eisenhower appointed an air support commander, Brigadier General Laurence S. Kuter, for the whole front on 21 January. Erwin Rommel had made plans for forces retreating through Libya to dig-in in front of the defunct French fortifications of the Mareth Line. The Axis forces would control the two natural entrances into Tunisia in the north and south, with only the easily defensible mountain passes between them. In January, those parts of the German-Italian Panzer Army on the Mareth defences were renamed First Italian Army (General Giovanni Messe), separate from the units (including the remains of the Afrika Korps) he had facing the Western Dorsale. On 23 January 1943, the Eighth Army took Tripoli, by which point the army retreating through Libya was already well on its way to the Mareth position. Part of the II US Corps crossed into Tunisia through passes in the Atlas Mountains from Algeria, controlling the interior of the triangle formed by the mountains. Their position raised the possibility of a thrust eastwards towards Sfax on the coast, to cut off the First Italian Army at Mareth from Arnim's forces to the north around Tunis. Rommel could not allow this and formed a plan for a spoiling attack. =Battle of Sidi Bou Zid= 8th Army operations, 30 January to 10 April 1943 On 30 January 1943, the German 21st Panzer and three Italian divisions from the 5th Panzer Army met elements of the French forces near Fa√Ød, the main pass from the eastern arm of the mountains into the coastal plains. Fredendall did not respond to the French request to send reinforcements in the form of tanks from 1st Armored Division and after desperate resistance, the under-equipped French defenders were overrun.Watson (2007), p. 68 Several counterattacks were organised, including a belated attack by Combat Command B of the US 1st Armored Division but all of these were beaten off with ease by Arnim's forces which by this time had created strong defensive positions. After three days, the Allied forces had been forced to pull back and were withdrawn into the interior plains to make a new forward defensive line at the small town of Sbeitla. In Operation Fr√ºhlingswind (spring wind), Arnim ordered four armoured battle groups forward on 14 February in the area of Sidi Bou Zid held by 34th Infantry Division's 168th Regimental Combat Team and 1st Armored Division's Combat Command A. The defenders' dispositions were poor, with concentrations dispersed so that they were unable to be mutually supportive. By 15 February, CCA had been severely damaged leaving the infantry units isolated on hilltops. Combat Command C was ordered across country to relieve Sidi Bou Zid but were repelled with heavy losses. By the evening of 15 February, three of the Axis battlegroups were able to head toward Sbeitla, to the northwest.Watson (2007), p.77 Pushing aside the remains of CCA and CCC, the battlegroups were confronted by Combat Command B in front of Sbeitla. With the help of air support, CCB held on through the day. However, the air support could not be sustained and the defenders of Sbeitla were obliged to withdraw and the town lay empty by midday on 17 February. To the south, in Operation Morgenluft (morning air), an Italian First Army battlegroup made up of the remains of the Afrika Korps under Karl B√ºlowius had advanced toward Gafsa at dusk on 15 February to find the town deserted, part of a withdrawal to shorten the Allied front to facilitate a reorganisation involving the withdrawal of French XIX Corps in order to re-equip. II US Corps withdrew to the line of Dernaia-Kasserine-Gap- Sbiba with XIX Corps on their left flank vacating the Eastern Dorsal to conform with them. By the afternoon of 17 February, Rommel's troops had occupied Feriana and Thelepte (roughly southwest of Kasserine) forcing the evacuation on the morning of 18 February of Thelepte airfield, the main air base in British First Army's southern sector.Playfair, p. 294 =Battle of Kasserine Pass= American troops moving through the Kasserine Pass After further discussion, the Comando Supremo issued orders on 19 February for Rommel to attack through the Kasserine and Sbiba passes toward Thala and Le Kef to threaten First Army's flank. Rommel's original proposal was for a limited but concentrated attack through Kasserine to confront II Corps' strength at T√©bessa and gain vital supplies from the US dumps there. Although he was to have 10th and 21st Panzer Divisions transferred to his command, Rommel was concerned that the new plan would dilute his force concentration and expose his flanks to threat.Watson (2007), pp. 80‚Äì81 On 19 February 1943, Rommel, having now been given formal control of the 10th and 21st Panzer Divisions, the Afrika Korps battlegroup as well as General Messe's forces on the Mareth defences (renamed Italian First Army),Watson (2007), p. 82 launched what would become the Battle of Kasserine Pass. Hoping to take the inexperienced defenders by surprise, he sent the light armour of the 3rd Reconnaissance Battalion racing into the pass. Colonel Alexander Stark's Stark Force, a brigade group made up of US and French units, was responsible for the defence of the pass. It had not had time to organise properly but was able to direct heavy artillery fire from the surrounding heights which brought the leading mechanised units of the Afrika Korps batlegroup to a halt.Watson (2007), p. 84 Before they could continue, infantry had to be sent up into the high ground seeking to eliminate the artillery threat. A battlegroup under Hans-Georg Hildebrand including tanks from 21st Panzer were advancing north from Sbeitla toward the Sbiba Gap. In front of the hills east of Sbiba they were brought to a halt by 1st Guards Brigade and 18th Regimental Combat Team which had strong field and anti-tank artillery support and were joined by two infantry regiments from 34th Infantry Division.Watson (2007), pp. 86‚Äì87 Germans fire an 88mm gun in Tunisia By the morning of 20 February, the bitter hand-to-hand fighting in the hills above Kasserine was continuing while the Afrika Korps Kampfgruppe and a battalion from the 131 Armoured Division Centauro and more artillery, prepared for another attack through the pass, once it had been joined by a 10th Panzer Division battle group from Sbeitla. The morning attack made slow progress but the intense pressure applied during the renewed attack that afternoon triggered a collapse in the Allied defences.Watson (2007), pp. 89‚Äì93 Having rolled through the Kasserine Pass on the afternoon of 20 February, units of the Centauro Division headed west toward T√©bessa, meeting little or no resistance. Following them came the von Broich battlegroup from 10th Panzer, which forked right onto the road to Thala where they were slowed by a regimental armoured group from 26th Armoured Brigade (Gore Force). Their tanks outgunned, Gore Force sustained heavy losses but bought time for Nick Force, a composite force from British 6th Armoured Division, based around 26th Armoured Brigade Group with extra infantry and artillery (which Anderson had ordered the previous day to leave the Kesra area to bolster the Thala defences) to prepare defensive positions further up the road. Meanwhile, Fredendall had sent 1st Armored Division's CCB to meet the threat to T√©bessa.Watson (2007), p. 102 carriers of the Grenadier Guards, advance over difficult terrain near the Kasserine Pass, 24 February 1943. By 1pm on 21 February, Battlegroup von Broich was in contact with the dug-in 26th Armoured Brigade Group on the Thala road and making slow progress. Rommel took direct control of the attack and forced the defences by 4pm.Watson (2007), p. 103 However, 26th Brigade Group were able to withdraw in reasonable order to the next, final, defensive line in front of Thala. Fighting at this position started at 7pm and continued at close quarters for three hours with neither side able to gain a decisive advantage. Nick Force had taken a heavy beating and did not expect to be able to hold out the next day. However, during the night a further 48 artillery pieces from US 9th Infantry Division arrived after a trip from Morocco on poor roads and in bad weather. On the morning of 22 February, as Broich prepared to launch his attack, his front was hit by a devastating artillery barrage. Surprisingly, Rommel told Broich to regroup and assume a defensive posture, so surrendering the initiative.Watson (2007), p. 104 The 21st Panzer battlegroup at Sbiba was making no progress. Further south, the Afrika Korps battlegroup on the road to T√©bessa had been halted on 21 February by CCB's armour and artillery dug in on the slopes of Djebel Hamra.Watson (2007), p. 105 An attempt to outflank them during the night of 21 February was a costly failure. A further attack early on 23 February was again beaten back.Watson (2007), pp. 106‚Äì107 In a dispirited meeting on 22 February with Kesselring, Rommel argued that faced with stiffening defences and the news that the Eighth Army's lead elements had finally reached Medenine, only a few kilometres from the Mareth Line, he should call off the attack and withdraw to support the Mareth defences, hoping that the Kasserine attack had caused enough damage to deter any offensive action from the west. Kesselring was keen for the offensive to continue but finally agreed that evening, and Comando Supremo formally terminated the operation.Watson (2007), pp. 109‚Äì110 The Axis forces from Kasserine reached the Mareth line on 25 February. =Aftermath= Action then abated for a time and both sides studied the results of recent battles. Rommel remained convinced that US forces posed little threat, while the British and Commonwealth troops were his equal. He held this opinion for far too long, and it would prove very costly. The Americans likewise studied the battle and relieved several senior commanders while issuing several \\"lessons learned\\" publications to improve future performance. Most important, on 6 March 1943 command of the II US Corps passed from Fredendall to George S. Patton, with Omar Bradley as assistant Corps Commander. Commanders were reminded that large units should be kept concentrated to ensure mass on the battlefield, rather than widely dispersed as Fredendall had deployed them. This had the intended side effect of improving the fire control of the already-strong US artillery. Close air support had also been weak (although this had been hampered by the generally poor weather conditions). General Alexander, Deputy Commander in Chief Allied Forces in North Africa, discussing operations for Tunisia with the Supreme Commander, General Eisenhower At the Casablanca Conference, it had been decided to appoint General Sir Harold Alexander as Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Allied forces in French North Africa. This came into effect on 20 February and at the same time, in order better to co-ordinate the activities of his two armies in Tunisia, Eisenhower at AFHQ brought First and Eighth Armies under a new headquarters, 18th Army Group, which Alexander was to command.Playfair, p. 303 Shortly after taking up his new appointment, Alexander reported to London, and was critical of Anderson although this was later felt to be a little unfair. Once he had been given control of the whole front at the end of January, Anderson's aim had been to reorganise the front into consolidated national sectors and create reserves with which to regain the initiative, the same priorities articulated in Alexander's orders dated 20 February.Playfair, p. 305. On 21 February, Alexander declared his objective to destroy all enemy forces in Tunisia by first advancing Eighth Army north of Gab√®s, while the First Army mounted attacks to draw off reserves which would otherwise be used against the Eighth Army. The armies would gain airfields for the Allied air forces. The co-ordinated land, sea and air power of the Allies would draw a net round the Axis forces in Tunisia by 30 April, to meet the timetable set at the Casablanca Conference to allow Sicily to be invaded during the favourable weather of August.Playfair, pp. 315‚Äì316 Hans-J√ºrgen von Arnim (right) Commander-in-Chief of Army Group Africa The Casablanca Conference had agreed to reorganise the air forces in the Mediterranean to integrate them more closely; Air Chief Marshal Sir Arthur Tedder was made commander of Mediterranean Air Command, responsible for all Allied air activity in the Mediterranean and Major General Carl Spaatz became commander of the Northwest African Air Forces under Tedder, with responsibility for all air operations in Tunisia.Playfair, p. 271 By 23 February, Air Marshal Sir Arthur Coningham had succeeded Kuter at the Allied Air Support Command, which became Northwest African Tactical Air Force under Spaatz, with the Desert Air Force supporting Eighth Army, under its operational control. Coningham found that the air organisation in Tunisia was that of the Western Desert in 1941 when he had first assumed command of the Desert Air Force. The lessons of the Desert Campaign had not been used in planning for Torch, which constrained the ability of the air arm, already short of aircraft and supplies, to provide tactical support to the army during the Run for Tunis. Coningham unified the British and American operational commands and trained them in new operational practices.Playfair, pp. 307‚Äì311 The Axis also created a combined command for their two armies. Hitler and the German General Staff (OKH) believed that Arnim should assume command but Kesselring argued for Rommel. Rommel was appointed to command the new Army Group Africa on 23 February.Watson (2007), pp. 110‚Äì111 Southern front =Battle of Medenine= A Universal Carrier escorts a large contingent of Italian prisoners, captured at El Hamma, 28 March 1943 The Eighth Army had been consolidating in front of the Mareth defences since 17 February, and launched probes westward on 26 February. On 6 March 1943, three German armoured divisions, two light divisions and nine Italian divisions launched Operation Capri, an attack southward in the direction of Medenine, the northernmost British strong point. The Axis attack was repulsed with massed artillery fire; 55 Axis tanks were knocked out. With the failure of Capri, Rommel decided that the only way to save the Axis armies would be to abandon the campaign, and on 9 March he travelled to Italy for discussions with Comando Supremo in Rome. Finding no support for his ideas, he travelled on 10 March to see Hitler at his headquarters in Ukraine, to try to convince him to abandon Tunisia and return the Axis armies to Europe. Hitler refused and Rommel was placed, in strict secrecy, on sick leave. Arnim became commander of Army Group Africa.Watson (2007), pp. 121, 123 =Battle of the Mareth Line= Indian Medical Service troops evacuate an injured soldier during an attack on the Mareth Line. Montgomery launched Operation Pugilist against the Mareth Line on the night of 19/20 March 1943. XXX Corps of the Eighth Army commenced Operation Pugilist along with the 50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division. They penetrated the Italian-held lineYoung Italians in the Battle of Mareth and established a small bridgehead west of Zarat on 20/21 March. The terrain and rain however prevented the deployment of tanks, aircraft and anti-tank guns, which left the infantry isolated. A determined counter-attack by 15th Panzer Division and the 136th Armoured Division Giovani Fascisti on 22 March, recaptured much of the bridgehead. XXX Corps prepared a new attack towards Tallouf, in which the 4th Indian Infantry Division (Major- General Francis Tuker) was to make a night attack on around the inland end of the line. This would coincide with the wide left hook manoeuvre Montgomery was planning with a new operation called \\"Supercharge II\\". On 26 March, X Corps (Lieutenant-General Brian Horrocks) drove around the Matmata Hills, capturing the Tebaga Gap and the town of El Hamma at the northern extreme of the line in \\"Operation Supercharge II\\", making the Mareth Line untenable. The following day anti-tank guns from German and Italian units checked the advance of X Corps, to gain time for a withdrawal. In the next 48 hours the Axis defenders pulled out of the Mareth Line, establishing a new defensive position to the north-west at Wadi Akarit near Gab√®s. =Gab√®s= Gurkhas of the 4th Indian Infantry Division advance up a steep slope, 16 March 1943. The reorganised US II Corps advanced from the passes again and got behind the Axis lines; the 10th Panzer Division counter-attacked at the Battle of El Guettar on 23 March. The German tanks rolling up lead units of the US forces ran into a minefield, and US artillery and anti-tank units opened fire. The 10th Panzer Division rapidly lost 30 tanks and retreated out of the minefield. A second attack supported by infantry in the late afternoon was also repulsed, and the 10th Panzer Division retired to Gab√®s. The US II Corps was unable to exploit the German failure and each attack was stopped by the 10th Panzer Division or 21st Panzer Division counter-attacks up the road from Gab√®s; co-ordination of Allied air and ground forces remained unsatisfactory. The Eighth Army and the US II Corps attacked for the next week and on 28 March, the Eighth Army captured El Hamma, forcing the Axis to abandon Gab√®s and retreat north towards the Fifth Panzer Army. The hills in front of the US forces were abandoned, allowing them to join the British forces in Gab√®s later that day. The 2nd New Zealand Division and 1st Armoured Division pursued the Germans northwards into defensive positions in the hills west of Enfidaville, which were held until the end of the campaign. Northern sector German Panzer Mk III tanks advance through a Tunisian town On 26 February, Arnim, in the mistaken belief that the Kasserine battles had forced the Allies to weaken the north to reinforce the south, launched Unternehmen Ochsenkopf (Operation Ox Head) against V Corps, across a wide front and commanded by General Weber.Playfair, p. 326. The main attacks were by Corps Weber which had the 334th Infantry Division, newly arrived elements of the Hermann G√∂ring Division and the part of the 10th Panzer Division not involved in Unternehmen Fr√ºhlingswind (Operation Spring Wind). Weber's force was to advance in three groups: a central group moving west toward Medjez el Bab; a second to the north advancing south-west, on the route from Mateur to B√©ja (which was some west of Medjez) and the third group pushing west south of Medjez. The northern flank of Weber's corps was to be protected by the Manteuffel Division advancing west (Operation Ausladung) and forcing the Allies out of their advanced positions opposite Green Hill and the Axis-held Jefna Station.Playfair, p. 306. The aim of Unternehmen Ausladung was to gain control of the vital town of Djebel Abiod. This attack by the Manteuffel Division made good progress across the French-held, lightly defended hills between Cap Serrat and the railway town of Sedjenane. Costly counter-attacks on February 27 and 2 March by part of the 139th Infantry Brigade, 46th Infantry Division), No. 1 Commando and supporting artillery delayed the Axis advance. Withdrawals of French battalions in the Medjez area to join XIX Corps, left little opposition to the German occupation of the high ground dominating the town, which was left in a dangerous salient. As a result, Sedjenane was abandoned by the British on 4 March and the 139th Infantry Brigade was pushed slowly back over the next three weeks some toward Djebel Abiod. =Operation Ochsenkopf= 4.5 inch medium gun firing on targets spotted by the RAF The main offensive, Ochsenkopf led to fierce fighting - Kampfgruppe Lang attacking in the northern sector were held up by a small force of artillery and a battalion of the Hampshire Regiment for a whole day at Sidi Nsir and Hampshire Farm before they could be overcome. This delay was critical and as a result the British force was able to prepare a significant killing field at Hunts Gap (an area between Medjez and about north-east of B√©ja).Perrett (2012) pp 139-40 In the Southern attack Kampfgruppe Audorff made some progress west toward Medjez el Bab but a British ad hoc force, Y Division was able to repel the Southern attack; particularly after two Churchill tanks shot up an entire German transport column at a place called 'Steamroller' Farm.Rolf (2001) pp 152-53 The final attack by Lang's battered force was stopped at Hunt's Gap by the 128th Infantry Brigade of the 46th Infantry Division with substantial artillery, RAF air cover and two squadrons of Churchill tanks from the North Irish Horse under command.Playfair, p. 327. Fighting lasted until 5 March and in terrible weather conditions the operation was called off by Arnim.Watson p 113 The failure had cost the Axis grievous losses in infantry as well as tanks, particularly the loss of many of the heavy Tiger Tanks. Ochsenkopf was to be the last major Axis offensive by the 5th Panzer Army.Windrow p 23 On 25 March, Alexander ordered a counter-attack on the V Corps front and on 28 March, Anderson attacked with the 46th Infantry Division, with the 138th Infantry Brigade, 128th Infantry Brigade in reserve and reinforced by the 36th Infantry Brigade, 1st Parachute Brigade and French units including a tabor of specialist mountain Goumiers, the artillery of two divisions plus more from army resources. In four days, it succeeded in recapturing all lost ground and took 850 German and Italian prisoners. On 7 April, Anderson tasked the 78th Infantry Division with clearing the B√©ja- Medjez road. Supported by artillery and close air support, they methodically advanced through difficult mountain terrain over the next ten days, clearing a front wide. The 4th Infantry Division joined the fighting, taking position on the left of the 78th Division and pushing toward Sidi Nsir. Allied victory =Allied plans= Tunisia Campaign operations, 20 April to 13 May 1943 The salient at Medjez had been relieved and lateral roads in the V Corps area cleared so that Anderson was able to turn his full attention to the orders he had received on 12 April from Alexander to prepare the large-scale attack, scheduled for 22 April, to gain Tunis. By this stage, Allied aircraft had been moved forward to airfields in Tunisia to prevent the aerial supply of Axis troops in North Africa (Operation Flax) and large numbers of German transport aircraft were shot down between Sicily and Tunis. British destroyers operating from Malta prevented marine supply, reinforcement or evacuation of Tunisia by sea (Operation Retribution). Admiral Cunningham, Eisenhower's Naval Task Force commander, issued Nelsonian orders to his ships: \\"Sink, burn, capture, destroy. Let nothing pass\\" but very few Axis ships even attempted passage. By 18 April, after attacks by Eighth Army from the south and flanking attacks by IX Corps and French XIX Corps, the Axis forces had been pushed into a defensive line on the north-east coast of Tunis, attempting to protect their supply lines but with little hope of continuing the battle for long. Alexander planned that while II US Corps would attack on the north towards Bizerte, First Army would attack towards Tunis while Eighth Army attacked north from Enfidaville. Anderson would co-ordinate the actions of First Army and II US Corps, issuing the appropriate orders to achieve this. Anderson's plan was for the main attack to be in the centre of the V Corps front at Medjez, confronting main Axis defences. However, IX Corps on the right would first attack north-east with, by speed of movement, the intention of getting in behind the Medjez position and disrupting their armoured reserves. II US Corps would make a double thrust: one to capture the high ground on V Corps' left flank and a second toward Bizerte. French XIX Corps would be held back until IX Corps and Eighth Army had drawn in the opposition and then advance toward Pont du Fahs. =Battle= Hawker Hurricanes Mark IIDs on a Tunisian airfield, preparing for a ground attack mission, April 1943. The Allied forces had reorganised and during the night of 19/20 April, the Eighth Army captured Enfidaville against the Italian 16th Motorised Division Pistoia, which counter-attacked several times over the next three days and was repulsed and the action at Takrouna also took place. The northward advance of Eighth Army had \\"pinched out\\" US II Corps' eastward facing front line, allowing the corps to be withdrawn and switched to the northern end of the Allied front. Arnim knew that an Allied offensive was imminent and launched a spoiling attack on the night of 20/21 April, between Medjez and Goubellat on the IX Corps front. The Hermann G√∂ring Division supported by tanks from 10th Panzer Division penetrated up to at some points but could not force a general withdrawal and eventually returned to their lines. No serious disruption was caused to Allied plans, except that the first attack of the offensive, by IX Corps, was delayed by four hours from 4:00 a.m. on 22 April. The 4th Indian Infantry Division. It was to an officer of this Division that General Von Arnim surrendered. On the morning of 22 April, the 46th Division attacked on the IX Corps front, creating a gap for the 6th Armoured Division to pass through by nightfall, followed by 1st Armoured Division, striking east for the next two days but not quick enough to forestall the creation of a strong anti-tank screen which halted their progress. The battle had drawn the Axis reserves of armour south, away from the central front. Seeing that no further progress was likely, Anderson withdrew the 6th Armoured Division and most of the 46th Infantry Division into army reserve. The V Corps attack began on the evening of 22 April and the US II Corps launched their offensive in the early hours of 23 April in the Battle of Hill 609, in which the hill was captured, which opened the way to Bizerte. In grim hand-to hand fighting against the Hermann G√∂ring Division, 334th Infantry and 15th Panzer Divisions, it took V Corps with the 1st, 4th and 78th Infantry Divisions, supported by army tanks and heavy artillery concentrations, eight days to penetrate and capture most of the Axis defensive positions. The fighting was mutually costly but in the Battle of Longstop Hill, Longstop was captured, which opened the way to Tunis and Anderson felt a breakthrough was imminent. On 30 April, after a failed attempt by the 169th Infantry Brigade of the recently arrived 56th (London) Infantry Division, which had just arrived over 3,300 miles from Syria, it had become clear to both Montgomery and Alexander that an Eighth Army attack north from Enfidaville, into strongly-held and difficult terrain, would not succeed. General Alexander gave Montgomery a holding task and transferred the British 7th Armoured Division, the 4th Indian Infantry Division and the 201st Guards Motor Brigade from the Eighth Army to the First Army, joining the British 1st Armoured Division which had been transferred before the main offensive.Mead, p. 44 German troops surrender to British crew of a Stuart tank near Frendj, 6 May 1943. The redeployments were complete by the night of 5 May; Anderson had arranged for a dummy concentration of tanks near Bou Arada on the IX Corps front, to deflect attention from the arrival of the 7th Armoured Division in the Medjez sector and achieved a considerable measure of surprise as to the size of the armoured force when the attack began. The final assault was launched at 3:30 a.m. on 6 May by IX Corps, commanded by Lieutenant-General Brian Horrocks who had taken over from Lieutenant-General John Crocker, who had been wounded. V Corps, under Lieutenant-General Charles Walter Allfrey, had made a preliminary attack on 5 May, to capture high ground and secure the left flank of IX Corps. The 4th British and 4th Indian Divisions, concentrated on a narrow front and supported by heavy artillery concentrations, broke a hole in the defences for the 6th and 7th Armoured divisions to pass through. On 7 May, British armour entered Tunis and American infantry from II Corps, which had continued its advance in the north, entered Bizerte. = Axis surrender = US troops with abandoned German equipment including an M3 halftrack May 1943 Six days after the fall of Tunis and Bizerte, the last Axis resistance in Africa ended with the surrender of over 230,000 Germans who became prisoners of war (POWs).Playfair, p.460 Major General Lucian Truscott, commander of the US 3rd Infantry Division and Major General Ernest N. Harmon, commander of the US 1st Armored Division, reported that German resistance in the American sector ceased on 6 May and German troops started surrendering en masse. On 8 May, the 334th Division surrendered to the British forces between Mateur and Tebourba. At 10:00 a.m. on 9 May, the US II Corps, under Major General Omar Bradley, cornered Major-General Gustav von Vaerst and what remained of the 5th Panzer Army, which surrendered before noon. At least 12,000 Germans surrendered in Major-General Fritz Krause's sector (of the initial batch of 25,000 prisoners, fewer than 400 were Italian). Around 22,000 Germans in the mountainous Zaghouan sector also ceased fighting on 11 May and surrendered with their equipment to the Free French. British and Commonwealth forces reported 150,000 Axis POWs taken in the German-held sector from 5 May ‚Äì 12 June. Major-General Count Theodor von Sponeck, commander of the 90th Light Division, had surrendered unconditionally to the 2nd New Zealand Division, after threatening to fight till the last round. Arnim surrendered to the Royal Sussex Regiment.I Was There! - How Von Arnim Surrendered at Last, The War Illustrated, June 11, 1943. Messe, commander of the 1st Army, held the line north of Takrouna and on 12 May, cabled Comando Supremo vowing to fight on; at 7:55 p.m. that evening, after the German collapse, Mussolini ordered Messe to surrender. Next day, the 1st Army was still holding opposite Enfidaville but the remaining 80,000 men were surrounded; the RAF and artillery continued their bombardment and around noon, the 1st Army surrendered to the Eighth Army. Messe along with Kurt Freiherr von Liebenstein formally surrendered to British and New Zealand forces under General Bernard Freyberg. Aftermath =Analysis= Churchill tank moves through Tunis during the liberation, 8 May 1943 In 1966, the British Official Historian I. S. O. Playfair wrote that The Axis gamble had only slowed the inevitable and the US defeat at Kasserine may have been paradoxically advantageous. With North Africa in Allied hands, plans quickly turned to the invasion of Sicily and Italy. Joseph Goebbels wrote that it was on the same scale as the defeat in the Battle of Stalingrad; Tunisgrad was coined for the defeat. A Victory March was held in Tunis on May 20, 1943, in which units of the First and Eighth Armies and representative detachments of the American and French forces marched past, with bands playing and generals Eisenhower, Alexander and Giraud taking the salute. =Casualties= Allied Allied casualties of 76,020 include the losses incurred by the First Army from 8 November 1942 and the Eighth Army from 9 February 1943. British and Commonwealth casualties amounted to 38,360 men; 6,233 were killed, 21,528 were wounded and 10,599 reported missing. The Free French suffered 19,439 casualties; 2,156 killed, 10,276 wounded and 7,007 missing. American casualties amounted to 18,221 men; 2,715 killed, 8,978 wounded and 6,528 missing. From 22 to 30 November 1942, the RAF flew 1,710 sorties and lost at least 45 aircraft. The USAAF flew 180 sorties and lost at least 7 aeroplanes. From 1 to 12 December, the RAF flew 2,225 sorties and lost a minimum of 37 aircraft. The USAAF flew 523 sorties and lost another 17 aircraft. From 13 to 26 December, the RAF flew 1,940 sorties for a loss of at least 20 aeroplanes while the USAAF conducted 720 sorties for a loss of 16 aircraft. From 27 December 1942 to 17 January 1943 the RAF flew 3,160 sorties and lost 38 aircraft while the USAAF flew an estimated 3,200 sorties and lost 36 aeroplanes. From 18 January to 13 February the RAF flew 5,000 sorties, excluding those against shipping, for the loss of 34 aircraft while the USAAF flew an estimated 6,250 sorties for the loss of 85. During the remainder of February to 28 March, 156 allied planes were lost. Between 29 March and 21 April, 203 Allied aircraft were destroyed. From 22 April to the end of the campaign, 45 bombers and 110 fighters were lost; 12 bombers and 47 fighters of the RAF, the USAAF losing 32 bombers and 63 fighters, while the French lost 1 bomber. Axis The Axis armies suffered casualties of 290,000 to 362,000 men; the losses are uncertain but it is estimated that the German army suffered 8,500 men killed during the campaign and the Italians 3,700 men killed; another 40,000 to 50,000 Axis soldiers were wounded. In the British official history, Playfair wrote that the Allies took 238,243 unwounded prisoners; 101,784 German, 89,442 Italian and 47,017 others. In 2004, Rick Atkinson wrote that a quarter of a million prisoners is a reasonable estimate. Playfair wrote that G. F. Howe, the American official historian, recorded the capture of 275,000 Axis soldiers, an 18th Army Group calculation of 244,500 prisoners (including 157,000 Germans), that Rommel estimated 130,000 Germans were taken prisoner and Arnim estimated 100,000 German and 200,000 Italian prisoners of war. The Luftwaffe lost 2,422+ aircraft in the Mediterranean theatre from November 1942 ‚Äì May 1943 (41 percent of the ). At least 1,045 aircraft were destroyed; from 22 to 30 November 1942, the flew 1,084 sorties losing 63 aircraft, including 21 destroyed on the ground. The recorded the loss of four. From 1 to 12 December, the flew 1,000 sorties and lost 37 aircraft, including nine on the ground, while the Italians recorded the loss of ten more. From 13 to 26 December, the flew 1,030 sorties and lost 17 aircraft, while the Italians lost three. From 27 December 1942 to 17 January 1943, the lost 47 aeroplanes; losses are unknown. From 18 January to 13 February, the lost another 100 aircraft but Italian losses are unknown. From 14 February to 28 March, 136 German aeroplanes were lost and the lost 22 more. From 29 March to 21 April, 270 aeroplanes were destroyed and 46 \\"operational aircraft and almost their entire remaining air transport fleet\\" was lost. From 22 April until the end, the lost 273 aircraft; 42 bombers, 166 fighters, 52 transport aircraft, 13 observation aircraft and the Italians recorded the loss of 17 aeroplanes; 600+ aircraft were captured by the Allies.

A typical industrial robot is built with fixed length segments that are connected either at joints whose angles can be controlled, or along linear slides whose length can be controlled. If each angle and slide distance is known, the position and orientation of the end of the robot arm relative to the base can be computed with the simple trigonometry in robot control. Going the other way -- calculating the angles and slides needed to achieve a desired position and orientation -- is much harder. The mathematical procedure for doing this is called an arm solution. For some robot designs, such as the Stanford arm, SCARA robot or cartesian coordinate robots, this can be done in closed form. Other robot designs require an iterative solution.

Many of the Chairmen of the Council of Economic Advisers have been NBER Research Associates, including the former NBER President and Harvard Professor, Martin Feldstein. The NBER's current President and CEO is Professor James M. Poterba of MIT. History The NBER was founded in 1920. Its first staff economist, director of research, and one of its founders was American economist Wesley Mitchell. He was succeeded by Malcolm C. Rorty in 1922. The Russian American economist Simon Kuznets, and student of Mitchell, was working at the NBER when the U.S. government recruited him to oversee the production of the first official estimates of national income, published in 1934. In the early 1940s, Kuznets' work on national income became the basis of official measurements of GNP and other related indices of economic activity. The NBER is currently located in Cambridge, Massachusetts with a branch office in New York City. Research The NBER's research activities are mostly identified by 20 research programs on different subjects and 14 working groups. The research programs are: Aging, Asset Pricing, Behavioral/Macro, Capital Markets and the Economy, Children, Corporate Finance, Development of the American Economy, Economics of Education, Economic Fluctuations and Growth, Energy and the Environment, Health Care, Health Economics, Industrial Organization, International Finance and Macroeconomics, International Trade and Investment, Labor Studies, Law and Economics, Monetary Economics, Political Economy, Productivity, and Public Economics. From this research come the NBER's Working Papers. = Sources of Inequality Research =  Can Universal Screening Increase the Representation of Low Income and Minority Students in Gifted Education?  The NBER or the National Bureau of Economic Research is a nonprofit organization, that focuses on examining in great detail economic growth of occurring problems in the U.S. In the article ‚ÄúCan Universal Screening Increase the Representation of Low Income and Minority Students in Gifted Education‚Äù by the National Bureau of Economic research, authors David Card and Laura Giuliano believe that low income and minority families are under represented in schools' gifted education courses. The authors address one occurring problem with theses tests: whether or not these minority students are overlooked by the system. Teacher and parent referrals would be acknowledged by comprehensive screening programs being introduced into school districts today. The screening tests that school districts are beginning to implement test students on a variety of characteristics to see whether or not they would qualify and succeed in gifted education programs. One issue that the new screening tests would fix compared to the older referrals is that non- English speaking students are overlooked because of a lack of parental referrals due to language barriers. When these tests were implemented on a small scale the statistics showed an increase in Hispanic students by 130 percent, and the number of black students increased by 80 percent. These statistics indicate that there are little to no consequences for minorities when these tests that are being implemented. In conclusion the authors suggest that the issues found in gifted educational programs can be fixed by comprehensive screenings.  Early Life Environment and Racial Inequality in Education and Earnings in the United States  One of the major research themes in the National Bureau of Economic research is sources of inequality. Kenneth Y. Chay, Jonathan Guryan, and Bhashkar Mazumder conducted a study in which they analyzed the substantial gaps in test scores on the AFQT and NAEP tests among black-white cohorts. The National Bureau of Economic Research published an article titled ‚ÄúEarly Life Environment and Racial Inequality in Education and Earnings in The United States‚Äù to eliminate any possible biases in Chay, Guryan and Mazumders‚Äô previous analysis and address the primary caveats. The National Bureau of Economic Research uses the term \\"gains\\" to reflect improvement in racial convergence. Prior studies have concluded black gains in AFQT and NAEP scores in the early 1980s, black gains in college enrollment in the mid-1980s, and black gains in earnings throughout the 1990s. It is concluded that black gains were centered among cohorts of blacks born in the South during the 1960s and 70s; therefore, not only is the study geographically exclusive, but data is also inconsistent with the contemporary causes in the 1980s and 1990s. These results would rather be indicating that black gains in the 1990s were influenced by the Civil Rights and War on Poverty periods (25‚Äì30 years before the 1990s). With response to the education gap, new findings show that the cross-cohort gains in college enrollment only pertained to blacks born in the South (there were no relative gains for black in the North). New findings also show that gains in relative earnings are limited to blacks born in the 1965 to 1972 cohorts (ages 28‚Äì35 in 2002) and show no gains for other age groups. To conclude, the findings of this updated study indicate that racial gains are due primarily in part to birth date and birthplace.  Racial Inequality in the 21st Century  The National Bureau of Economic Research analyzed the hindrances in quality of education of black and Hispanic students compared to the education of white students, the causes for black students to fall behind in the classroom faster that white students, as well as the attempts to fix these gaps in education between races. The most common factors contributing to racial gaps are thought to be ‚Äúdiscrimination, culture, and genetics,‚Äù among others. The first study in the article concluded that the best way to eliminate racial inequality in the future, specifically with income inequality, would be to provide black and white students with the same skills. The next study indicates that white children show a higher level of education than black students as young as two years old. Possible explanations for this are that the older children are tested differently than younger children, which could have more to do with what the child has observed throughout the years than what they are innately capable of, that there are racial differences in the rates in which children develop, and that genes and environmental influences also come into play. The third study demonstrates that the inherent deviation in education in children before they enter school depends on their parental environment. Similarly, the fourth study concludes that intervention programs before children enter schools still need a lot of work and are beneficial in some ways, but ultimately do not close the gap in education between black and white students. The fifth study looks at children from kindergarten to 12th grade, finding that there is an education gap present, but it isn‚Äôt clear where it is most present. However, the next study about exclusively high school students shows that eighth grade test scores specifically play a key role in the growing gap between high school students and their graduation rates. The seventh study analyzes the effect of intervention programs on students once they have entered school, and indicates that improvement within schools and teaching alone can positively affect the achievement of black students and make them more comparable to that of white students. The entire NBER article ultimately concludes that we still do not know how to close the achievement gap because of the present color line, but there are certainly ways to increase individual student achievement that may eventually make schools more productive overall.  Public Universities, Equal Opportunity, and the Legacy of Jim Crow: Evidence from North Carolina  This study is a part of the NBER Working Paper Series, meaning it does not undergo the same peer and NBER board review as their regular research. Using data from the University of North Carolina system, which encompasses all public colleges in the state, the study looks at racial inequality at the collegiate level in regards to enrollment, completion, and various achievements, and the causation of such inequity. The study also mentions historically black colleges in North Carolina, and briefly questions whether they remain a positive contribution in contemporary America, arguing that they were a reaction to Jim Crow laws and tend to isolate African-American students from other racial groups. Controlling for test scores, majors, and other scholastic factors, the study looks at administrative data from North Carolina K12 public schools of eighth graders both in 1999 and 2004, categorized both by race and socioeconomic standing. It then tracks these students through their expected graduation dates of both high school and college, given they continued to a North Carolina university, and they examined whatever racial stratification occurred within those time periods based on enrollment and graduation rates at each university. The study found that African-Americans in the North Carolina public school system are greatly disadvantaged. In one group, controlling for gender, the study found that, of the 2004 eighth graders, African-American students were 4.6% less likely to attend a North Carolina university than their white peers, and ‚Äú5.5 percentage points less likely to enroll and graduate within four years.‚Äù However, when controlling for parental higher education and eighth grade tests scores, the study found that African-American students of the aforementioned grouping are more likely to attend and graduate within four years from a North Carolina university, which the study attributes to the abundance of historically black colleges in the state.

Recession markers The NBER is well known for its start and end dates of US recessions. The NBER uses a broader definition of a recession than commonly appears in the media. A definition of a recession commonly used in the media is two consecutive quarters of a shrinking gross domestic product (GDP). In contrast, the NBER defines a recession as \\"a significant decline in economic activity spread across the economy, lasting more than a few months, normally visible in real GDP, real income, employment, industrial production, and wholesale-retail sales.\\" Business cycle dates are determined by the NBER dating committee under contract with the Department of Commerce. Typically, these dates correspond to peaks and troughs in real GDP, although not always so. The NBER prefers this method for a variety of reasons. First, they feel by measuring a wide range of economic factors, rather than just GDP, a more accurate assessment of the health of an economy can be gained. For instance, the NBER considers not only the product-side estimates like GDP, but also income-side estimates such as the gross domestic income (GDI). Second, since the NBER wishes to measure the duration of economic expansion and recession at a fine grain, they place emphasis on monthly‚Äîrather than quarterly‚Äîeconomic indicators. Finally, by using a looser definition, they can take into account the depth of decline in economic activity. For example, the NBER may declare not a recession simply because of two quarters of very slight negative growth, but rather an economic stagnation. However, they do not precisely define what is meant by \\"a significant decline\\", but rather determine if one has existed on a case by case basis after examining their catalogued factors which have no defined grade scale or weighting factors. The subjectivity of the determination has led to criticism and accusations committee members can \\"play politics\\" in their determinations. Though not listed by the NBER, another factor in favor of this alternate definition is that a long term economic contraction may not always have two consecutive quarters of negative growth, as was the case in the recession following the bursting of the dot-com bubble. For example, a repeated sequence of quarters with significant negative growth followed by a quarter of no or slight positive growth would not meet the traditional definition of a recession, even though the nation would be undergoing continuous economic decline. Announcement of end of 2007‚Äì2009 recession In September 2010, after a conference call with its Business Cycle Dating Committee, the NBER declared that the Great Recession in the United States had officially ended in 2009 and lasted from December 2007 to June 2009. In response, a number of newspapers wrote that the majority of Americans did not believe the recession was over, mainly because they were still struggling and because the country still faced high unemployment. However, the NBER release had noted that \\"In determining that a trough occurred in June 2009, the committee did not conclude that economic conditions since that month have been favorable or that the economy has returned to operating at normal capacity. Rather, the committee determined only that the recession ended and a recovery began in that month. A recession is a period of falling economic activity spread across the economy, lasting more than a few months, normally visible in real GDP, real income, employment, industrial production, and wholesale-retail sales. The trough marks the end of the declining phase and the start of the rising phase of the business cycle.\\" References External links * Official website Category:Research institutes in the United States Category:Economic research institutes Category:Political and economic think tanks in the United States Category:Non-profit organizations based in Massachusetts Category:Organizations established in 1920 Category:1920 establishments in the United States Category:1920 in economics ","title":"National Bureau of Economic Research"},{"id":"897779","text":"John Edvin Vikstr√∂m, (born October 1, 1931 in Kronoby, Finland), Archbishop emeritus of Finland, was born to parents Edvin and Hilma Vikstr√∂m.

Archbishop of Turku and Finland 1982‚Äì1998  As the 53rd successor of St. Henry, Vikstr√∂m's era was far reaching. During his term as the Archbishop of the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland the Church has carried out many reforms. The Church has been given a new Bible translation and a new hymnbook, the ordained ministry has been opened to women, church law has been reformed and liturgical reform has been undertaken. The Church of Finland has also been active ecumenically. Archbishop emeritus John Vikstr√∂m continues to be a popular speaker in academia and business. John Vikstr√∂m has also publicly embraced the idea of a basic income as a solution to social exclusion: :\\"In this way, even working a little would be possible and would make sense. The system would not push people into idleness and divide citizens into winners and losers as cruelly as is the case now. I look at the question from the point of view of human dignity. A basic income paid to everyone would be less humiliating than the present benefit system can sometimes become. Basic income would send every citizen the following encouraging and motivating message: 'You are important. You are not a burden, but a resource. You are important by being a human being for others. Whatever work you do, in whatever situations, whether or not you are paid to do it, you still contribute to building our society.'\\" The archbishop has placed the chairmanship of the Church's Social-Ethical Forum as his priority. The forum's aim is to resolve problems in the status of the elderly and poor in Finland. An acclaimed author of numerous books and papers, his correspondence with J√∂rn Donner was voted as Book of the Year in 2002.

Named after the Gheorghe Asachi Technical University of Ia»ôi, the team was founded in 1945. Its home stadium was the Stadionul Emil Alexandrescu, where it played in blue and white until being dissolved in 2010. In the same year, a successor club was formed under the name of ACSMU Politehnica Ia»ôi and currently competes in the first division. History The club was established as Sportul Studen»õesc Ia»ôi by a group of students on 27 April 1945, and first received the name of Politehnica one month later (Asocia»õia SportivƒÉ Politehnica Ia»ôi). It alternated between Romania's second and first leagues. They played in the Liga I for 28 seasons during the periods: 1960‚Äì61, 1962‚Äì1967 (under the name CSMS Ia»ôi), 1968‚Äì1972, 1973‚Äì1981, 1982‚Äì1990, 1995‚Äì96, and 2004‚Äì2010. =Recent history= 2004‚Äì05 season Politehnica started the 2004‚Äì05 season by winning only two points in eight rounds. After manager Vasile Simiona»ô was replaced with Ionu»õ Popa, Politehnica won the following fixture away against Steaua Bucure»ôti, Adrian Cristea scoring the only goal of the match. The team gradually lifted itself from the bottom of the table, finally finishing 9th with 38 points. In the Romanian Cup they were eliminated in the first round (sixteen-finals) by UTA Arad with 1‚Äì0. 2005‚Äì06 season The 2005‚Äì06 season was a relatively good one for the Ia»ôi-based team, whose objective was to avoid relegation. They narrowly lost both matches against the future champions Steaua and the away match with runners-up Rapid Bucure»ôti, all with the score of 1‚Äì0, after three penalty kicks. They also lost 2‚Äì0 against Dinamo Bucure»ôti at home. However, they drew away against a weakened Dinamo team, after a second-half goal by Daniel Rednic. Politehnica Ia»ôi eventually finished 10th with 39 points. In the Romanian Cup they reached the quarter-finals, eliminating Unirea Dej (2‚Äì0) and FC Vaslui (2‚Äì1 AET) in the progress. They were eliminated by Rapid after a last-minute goal and after the referee disallowed a controversial goal scored in the second half by Politehnica. During the season Politehnica experienced major financial problems, which resulted in the impossibility to buy better players for the team and difficulties encountered in receiving the club license necessary for playing in the 2006/07 season in Liga I. The license was finally obtained after the efforts made by chairman and mayor of Ia»ôi Gheorghe Nichita. 2006‚Äì07 season Politehnica Ia»ôi started the season with the same financial problems, resulting in only four players joining the team in the pre-season break and many salaries and debts paid late. In addition, the conflict between Gheorghe Nichita and Ia»ôi prefect Radu PrisƒÉcaru concerning public funding of the club and interference by the press spiced up the atmosphere. Despite all odds, Politehnica kept itself between the top six teams after the first 12 matches and was unbeaten for eight consecutive matches (seven in Liga I and one cup match), drawing at home with Steaua (1‚Äì1), Rapid and FCU Politehnica Timi»ôoara (0‚Äì0). A negative run followed with one point in seven league matches and was followed by a 4‚Äì0 away victory against local rivals CeahlƒÉul Piatra Neam»õ. Politehnica finally finished 13th with 40 points. The team qualified for the second time in a row in the quarter-finals of the Romanian Cup, disposing of Universitatea Cluj (2‚Äì1) and Farul Constan»õa (1‚Äì0), however, they were eliminated by Poli Timi»ôoara, score 1‚Äì2. 2009‚Äì10 season The club relegated from the Liga I at the end of the season. =Dissolution= After it relegated in 2010, the club became bankrupt because of debts that were accumulated during the years. The football tradition in Ia»ôi has been continued by Politehnica Ia»ôi (2010), which regard themselves as the continuation of the original team. In 2018, they earned the right to use the logo and name of FC Politehnica.

A cartesian coordinate robot (also called linear robot) is an industrial robot whose three principal axes of control are linear (i.e. they move in a straight line rather than rotate) and are at right angles to each other. The three sliding joints correspond to moving the wrist up-down, in-out, back-forth. Among other advantages, this mechanical arrangement simplifies the Robot control arm solution. It has high reliability and precision when operating in three-dimensional space. As a robot coordinate system, it is also effective for horizontal travel and for stacking bins. Cartesian coordinate robots with the horizontal member supported at both ends are sometimes called Gantry robots; mechanically, they resemble gantry cranes, although the latter are not generally robots. Gantry robots are often quite large. Applications A popular application for this type of robot is a computer numerical control machine (CNC machine) and 3D printing. The simplest application is used in milling and drawing machines where a pen or router translates across an x-y plane while a tool is raised and lowered onto a surface to create a precise design. Pick and place machines and plotters are also based on the principal of the cartesian coordinate robot. Industrial gantry type cartesian robot is applied on CNC lathes production line for continuous parts loading and unloading. It performs 3-axis (X, Y, and Z) linear movement in high speed performance to save numbers of operators. In addition, the robot is able to handle heavy loads of pick and place parts feeding procedure with high positioning accuracy. Some special requirements might be low noise and customized supply table, which is made according to number of storage. Since handling is usually above the CNC, overhead gantry is also a common term to describe this type of robotic arm. Overhead design is suitable for most automation system.

Bawls Guarana was created by Hoby Buppert, who formed a business plan for selling a coffee alternative while in business school. Buppert started selling Bawls Guarana in Florida in 1996 under his company Hobarama. After a computer gaming website praised the soft drink in a 1998 product review, Bawls Guarana became popular with computer game players, who wanted caffeine to give them energy while playing. This enabled Buppert to start sponsoring gaming events like LAN parties and video game leagues. Bawls Guarana is now manufactured by Solvi Acquisition. Headquartered in Twinsburg, Ohio, Bawls Guarana beverages are available at supermarkets, convenience stores and electronic retailers across the United States.  History  Entrepreneur Hoby Buppert, who had graduated from the Cornell University School of Hotel Administration in 1995, developed a business plan for Bawls Guarana as an independent study. Buppert realized that there was a potential market for highly caffeinated soft drinks, seeing their popularity in Europe at the time. He wanted a caffeine alternative to coffee that was light and not as sweet as other caffeinated soft drinks at the time. After research, the entrepreneur formed his drink idea around guarana, which naturally produced caffeine. The soda's name came from Buppert's vision to have a bold, memorable name for the soft drink. Buppert has also stated that the name is an acronym for \\"Brazilian American Wildlife Society\\". Buppert started the company Hobarama in Florida in 1996, and began to sell Bawls in November of that year at a Miami nightclub. He perceived Florida to be a good base of operations, based on his younger target market's familiarity with guarana-based soft drinks from Latin America. In his first year, Buppert reported revenues of $400,000. In the summer of 1998, a website dedicated to PC games posted a positive review of the drink, sparking interest in Buppert's product with gamers. To capitalize on this, Buppert's company began sponsoring LAN parties. Bawls Guarana also became the beverage sponsor of the Cyberathlete Professional League. In 2002, CompUSA started to carry Bawls Guarana in its retail stores. To further attract video game players, Buppert struck an agreement with Interplay Entertainment to feature Bawls Guarana in-game as product placement in 2002's Run Like Hell, as well as 2004's Fallout: Brotherhood of Steel. Hobarama started to expand their target audience to BMX racers and paintball players. In 2004, Bawls Guarana became a sponsor of the National Professional Paintball League. By 2005, Hobarama had sold 20 million bottles of Bawls Guarana that year. The following year, Hobarama began sponsoring events in the fashion industry, as well as marketing to the military through the Bawls \\"military pack\\" of bottles. Hobarama also announced in 2006 a new sponsorship agreement with the National Professional Paintball League, making Bawls Guarana the league's official energy drink. In 2008, GameFly announced a partnership with Bawls Guarana to give discounts for each other's products and services. Every year the Bawls Team goes to Dallas, Texas to be the official drink sponsor for QuakeCon, one of the largest BYOC (Bring Your Own Computer) Events in North America. In 2009, Buppert left Hobarama. In 2010, amidst financial issues, a restructuring plan for Hobarama was put into place. In 2012, Bawls Guarana announced that they had purchased energy drink brands Crunk Energy Drink and Strut & Rut.  Products  Bawls' soft drink products come in a variety of flavors, including root beer, original, orange, ginger, cherry, and cherry cola. The company also offers a drink named Guarana Zero, which contains zero calories; this is a notable variance from their original guarana product, which contains 130 calories in a 10-ounce bottle and 190 calories in a 16-ounce can.  Packaging  Bawls Guarana is bottled in blue 10-ounce glass bottles with a bumpy texture. According to Buppert, the bumps around the bottle were meant to represent \\"bouncing balls inside the bottle punching their way out\\". The drink is also packaged in 16-ounce cans. Buppert states that the introduction of cans in 2006 happened through their relationship with the paintball community, who had issues with glass bottles. In an effort to create a unique design reminiscent of the bottles, foaming ink is applied to each can to create a tactile, bumpy pattern. To achieve the effect, can manufacturer Crown Holdings spot-applied the ink, which at the time was new technology developed by INX International Ink. The cans were introduced in May 2006 at a paintball tournament, and were at first not intended for distribution. After positive reception however, the cans were test-marketed in the summer of that year with three distributors in the Midwestern United States, and then expanded to 70% of the product's distributors by August 2006.

Born in Indianapolis, Indiana, United States, the self-taught Vinnegar established his reputation in Los Angeles, California, during the 1950s and 1960s. His trademark was the rhythmic \\"walking\\" bass line, a steady series of ascending or descending notes, and it brought him the nickname \\"The Walker\\". Besides his jazz work, he also appeared on a number of soundtracks and pop albums, notably Van Morrison's 1972 album, Saint Dominic's Preview. Music career He recorded extensively as both a leader and sideman. He came to public attention in the 1950s as a result of recording with Lee Konitz, Andr√© Previn, Stan Getz, Shorty Rogers, Chet Baker, Shelly Manne, Joe Castro and Serge Chaloff. He played bass on Previn and Manne's My Fair Lady album, one of the most successful jazz records ever produced. He also performed on another of jazz's biggest hit albums, Eddie Harris and Les McCann's Swiss Movement, released in 1969. Vinnegar also performed at the Lighthouse in Hermosa Beach, California, and Diggers in East Los Angeles in the late 1950s, with drummer and pianist Don Joham along with other musicians. He moved to Portland, Oregon in 1986. In 1995, the Oregon State Legislature honored him by proclaiming May 1 Leroy Vinnegar Day. Vinnegar died of a heart attack, at the age of 71, on August 3, 1999, in a hospital in Portland. Discography =As leader= * Leroy Walks! (Contemporary, 1958) * Leroy Walks Again!!

He is perhaps best known for his 1970 KATU report on the attempt by the Oregon Highway Division to dispose of a dead, beached whale by exploding it (beaches open to motor vehicles are considered state highways in Oregon). He worked for more than 30 years as a television news reporter, host and anchor, from 1967‚Äì1972 and 1978‚Äì2004. He had a talk radio show on KEX 1190 AM from 2003 to 2014, and subsequently has worked as a media consultant. Education Born in 1947, Linnman grew up in Portland and attended Wilson High School. He graduated from Portland State University, studying journalism. Career He began his broadcast career in 1967, when he was hired by Portland's ABC affiliate, KATU. His initial stint working at KATU lasted through 1972 and included various jobs, among them news assignment editor, sports director and investigative reporter. He left the station in January 1973, to join the staff of then-new City Commissioner Mildred Schwab, as an executive assistant. At the time, he had not intended to return to broadcast journalism, he told The Oregonian in a 1978 interview. In January 1978, he was hired by KGW, Portland's NBC affiliate station, to become the new co-host of a local magazine program named Evening, which had been airing every weeknight in the early evening since 1975. The Evening program was replaced in September 1979 by PM Magazine, a nationally syndicated program with a similar format and local hosts at each affiliate station, and Linnman also served as one of its regular co-hosts while at KGW. At the end of 1983, Linnman left KGW to return to KATU, to host a new daily one-hour afternoon local features program, Two at Four, scheduled to debut in January 1984. He remained with KATU for the next 20 years. In September 1987, Linnman returned to news broadcasting, when KATU made him the anchor of its 6:30 p.m. weekday newscast. In 2003, Linnman began hosting a morning talk show on Portland radio station KEX. In August 2004, he left KATU in order to focus exclusively on his KEX radio show, which continued until 2014. Since 2014, he has worked as a media consultant. Published works *Oregon Golf: The Oregon Coast, Southern Oregon, Portland & Environs, Central Oregon.

The other three treasures are the or Sword of Light, the or Spear of Lugh and the or The Dagda's Cauldron. Some Scottish chroniclers, such as John of Fordun and Hector Boece from the thirteenth century, treat the the same as the Stone of Scone in Scotland. According to this account the left Tara in AD 500 when the High King of Ireland Murtagh MacEirc loaned it to his great-uncle, Fergus (later known as Fergus the Great) for the latter's coronation in Scotland. Fergus's sub-kingdom, Dalriada, had by this time expanded to include the north-east part of Ulster and parts of western Scotland. Not long after Fergus's coronation in Scotland, he and his inner circle were caught in a freak storm off the County Antrim coast in which all perished. The stone remained in Scotland which is why Murtagh MacEirc is recorded in history as the last Irish King to be crowned on it. However, historian William Forbes Skene commented: \\"It is somewhat remarkable that while the Scottish legend brings the stone at Scone from Ireland, the Irish legend brings the stone at Tara from Scotland.\\" The , recording a tradition from early Irish literature and echoing ancient legends, reports that Lia F√°il would roar in the presence of a false king pretending to hold dominion in Ireland.Book of Leister pp. 9‚Äì13. According to one version of Gaelic Myth surrounding the stone, a myth more associated with the Stone of Scone, the sacred stone arrived by ship belonging to the Iberian Danaan into the ancient port of Carrickfergus about 580 BC. On board was Eochaidh, son of a High King and a descendant of √ârim√≥n, Princess Tea Tephi and the scribe Simon Brauch. Princess Tea also had in her possession an ancient harp, whose origins some believe lie in the House of David. The stone was delivered to the Hill of Tara by the three. Scota later married High King Eochaidh, both had previously met each other in Jerusalem. Eochaidh recovered the ancient stone in Jerusalem before the invasion of the Babylonians. It is said all future Irish High Kings/British Monarchs inaugurated by the stone have tried to prove lineage back to the Royal Sage and his wife, Tea Tephi, the original bearers of the stone. Eochaidh's resting place is said to be in the Neolithic passage tomb, Cairn T at Loughcrew. Mythical powers The was thought to be magical: when the rightful High King of Ireland put his feet on it, the stone was said to roar in joy. The stone is also credited with the power to rejuvenate the king and also to endow him with a long reign. According to , C√∫chulainn split it with his sword when it failed to cry out under his prot√©g√©, Lugaid Riab nDerg ‚Äî from then on it never cried out again, except under Conn of the Hundred Battles and according to legend, at the coronation of Brian Boru in 1002.

The term (\\"the Fianna, warriors, or army of Ireland\\"; sometimes rendered \\"the soldiers of destiny\\") has been used as a sobriquet for the Irish Volunteers; on the cap badge of the Irish Army; in the opening line of the Irish-language version of , the Irish national anthem; and as the name of the political party, one of the main parties in Ireland.  Vandalism  Sometime in June 2012, the stone was vandalised. The stone was damaged in 11 places by a hammer.

History In 1970 Rick Loomis invented a game called Nuclear Destruction, a play-by-mail game, for which he moderated multiplayer games. Nuclear Destruction is widely considered to be the first commercial play-by- mail (PBM) game. He soon had more than 200 players in multiple games, and asked fellow soldier Steve MacGregor to write a computer program to moderate the games; they began renting time on a computer near Fort Shafter, using the name Flying Buffalo devised by Loomis. After leaving the military in 1972, Loomis and MacGregor incorporated their PBM company as Flying Buffalo, Inc., or FBI. Loomis and MacGregor pooled their savings to purchase a Raytheon 704 minicomputer to run PBM turns. In 1976 the company started running a space exploration/conquest PBM game titled Starweb. Flying Buffalo has also published games outside of PBM. Loomis acquired Nuclear War and began publishing it in 1972; it soon became one of Flying Buffalo's best sellers. In 1975 they published Tunnels & Trolls, a fantasy role playing game generally similar to Dungeons & Dragons. Later products included background materials for fantasy role playing games, which became the \\"Catalyst\\" series. They also produce a range of unusual dice, such as a set to determine which toppings to order on pizza, and currently hold the printing rights to the Ace of Aces and Lost Worlds flip book systems. The company also ran a gaming store at various locations in Tempe, Arizona until 1985. In 1992, the fiction book Mage's Blood and Old Bones: A Tunnels & Trolls Shared World Anthology was published by Flying Buffalo.http://www.torontopubliclibrary.ca/detail.jsp?Entt=RDM2262407&R;=2262407 Following the dissolution of TSR in 1997, Flying Buffalo remains the oldest pen-and-paper role-playing game publisher in the world.

It is a toxic, corrosive, colorless gas, with a density of about 13 g/L (roughly 11 times heavier than air.Gas chart (dead link 3 September 2019)) It is one of the densest known gases under standard conditions. WF6 is commonly used by the semiconductor industry to form tungsten films, through the process of chemical vapor deposition. This layer is used in a low-resistivity metallic \\"interconnect\\". It is one of seventeen known binary hexafluorides. Properties The WF6 molecule is octahedral with the symmetry point group of Oh. The W‚ÄìF bond distances are . p. 4-93.

The vapor pressure of WF6 between can be described by the equation :, where the P = vapor pressure (bar), T = temperature (¬∞C).Cady, G.H.; Hargreaves, G.B, ‚ÄúVapour Pressures of Some Fluorides And Oxyfluorides of Molybdenum, Tungsten, Rhenium, and Osmium,‚Äù Journal of the Chemical Society, APR 1961, pp. 1568-& DOI: 10.1039/jr9610001568http://webbook.nist.gov/cgi/cbook.cgi?ID=C7783826&Mask;=4&Type;=ANTOINE&Plot;=on Synthesis Tungsten hexafluoride is commonly produced by the exothermic reaction of fluorine gas with tungsten powder at a temperature between : :W + 3 F2 ‚Üí WF6 The gaseous product is separated from WOF4, a common impurity, by distillation. In a variation on the direct fluorination, the metal is placed in a heated reactor, slightly pressurized to , with a constant flow of WF6 infused with a small amount of fluorine gas. The fluorine gas in the above method can be substituted by , or . An alternative procedure for producing tungsten fluoride is to react tungsten trioxide (WO3) with HF, BrF3 or SF4. Tungsten fluoride can also be obtained by conversion of tungsten hexachloride: :WCl6 \\\\+ 6 HF ‚Üí WF6 \\\\+ 6 HCl or :WCl6 \\\\+ 2 AsF3 ‚Üí WF6 \\\\+ 2 AsCl3 or :WCl6 \\\\+ 3 SbF5 ‚Üí WF6 \\\\+ 3 SbF3Cl2 Reactions On contact with water, tungsten hexafluoride gives hydrogen fluoride (HF) and tungsten oxyfluorides, eventually forming tungsten trioxide: :WF6 \\\\+ 3 H2O ‚Üí WO3 \\\\+ 6 HF Unlike some other metal fluorides, WF6 is not a useful fluorinating agent nor is it a powerful oxidant. It can be reduced to the yellow WF4. Applications in semiconductor industry The dominant application of tungsten fluoride is in semiconductor industry, where it is widely used for depositing tungsten metal in a chemical vapor deposition process. The expansion of the industry in the 1980s and 1990s resulted in the increase of WF6 consumption, which remains at around 200 tonnes per year worldwide. Tungsten metal is attractive because of its relatively high thermal and chemical stability, as well as low resistivity (5.6 ¬µŒ©¬∑cm) and electromigration. WF6 is favored over related compounds, such as WCl6 or WBr6, because of its higher vapor pressure resulting in higher deposition rates. Since 1967, two WF6 deposition routes have been developed and employed, thermal decomposition and hydrogen reduction. The required WF6 gas purity is rather high and varies between 99.98% and 99.9995% depending on the application. WF6 molecules have to be split up in the CVD process. The decomposition is usually facilitated by mixing WF6 with hydrogen, silane, germane, diborane, phosphine, and related hydrogen-containing gases. =Silicon= WF6 reacts upon contact with a silicon substrate. The WF6 decomposition on silicon is temperature-dependent: :2 WF6 \\\\+ 3 Si ‚Üí 2 W + 3 SiF4 below 400 ¬∞C and :WF6 \\\\+ 3 Si ‚Üí W + 3 SiF2 above 400 ¬∞C. This dependence is crucial, as twice as much silicon is being consumed at higher temperatures. The deposition occurs selectively on pure Si only, but not on silicon oxide or nitride, thus the reaction is highly sensitive to contamination or substrate pre-treatment. The decomposition reaction is fast, but saturates when the tungsten layer thickness reaches 10‚Äì15 micrometers. The saturation occurs because the tungsten layer stops diffusion of WF6 molecules to the Si substrate which is the only catalyst of molecular decomposition in this process. If the deposition occurs not in an inert but in an oxygen containing atmosphere (air) then instead of tungsten, a tungsten oxide layer is produced. =Hydrogen= The deposition process occurs at temperatures between 300 and 800 ¬∞C and results in formation of hydrofluoric acid vapors: :WF6 \\\\+ 3 H2 ‚Üí W + 6 HF The crystallinity of the produced tungsten layers can be controlled by altering the WF6/H2 ratio and the substrate temperature: low ratios and temperatures result in (100) oriented tungsten crystallites whereas higher values favor the (111) orientation. Formation of HF is a drawback, as the HF vapor is very aggressive and etches away most materials. Also, the deposited tungsten shows poor adhesion to the silicon dioxide which is the main passivation material in semiconductor electronics. Therefore, SiO2 has to be covered with an extra buffer layer prior to the tungsten deposition. On the other hand, etching by HF may be beneficial to remove unwanted impurity layers. =Silane and germane= The characteristic features of tungsten deposition from the WF6/SiH4 are high speed, good adhesion and layer smoothness. The drawbacks are explosion hazard and high sensitivity of the deposition rate and morphology to the process parameters, such as mixing ratio, substrate temperature, etc. Therefore, silane is commonly used to create a thin tungsten nucleation layer. It is then switched to hydrogen, that slows down the deposition and cleans up the layer. Deposition from WF6/GeH4 mixture is similar to that of WF6/SiH4, but the tungsten layer becomes contaminated with relatively (compared to Si) heavy germanium up to concentrations of 10‚Äì15%. This increases tungsten resistance from about 5 to 200 ¬µŒ©¬∑cm. Other applications WF6 can be used for the production of tungsten carbide. As a heavy gas, WF6 can be used as a buffer to control gas reactions. For example, it slows down the chemistry of the Ar/O2/H2 flame and reduces the flame temperature. Safety Tungsten hexafluoride is an extremely corrosive compound that attacks any tissue.

The valley is oriented in a north-westerly direction from Lillehammer and the lake of Mj√∏sa, extending toward Romsdalen. The river of Gudbrandsdalsl√•gen (L√•gen) flows through the valley, starting from Lesjaskogsvatnet and ending at Mj√∏sa. The Otta river flowing through Otta valley is a major tributary to L√•gen. The valleys of the tributary rivers such as Otta and Gausa (Gausdal) are usually regarded as part of Gudbrandsdalen. The total area of the valley is calculated from the areas of the related municipalities. Gudbrandsdalen is the main valley in a web of smaller valleys. On the western (right hand) side there are long adjacent valleys: Ottadalen stretches 100 km from Otta village, Gausdal some 50 km from Lillehammer and Heidal some 40 km from Sjoa. Gudbrandsdalen runs between the major mountain ranges of Norway including Jotunheimen and Dovrefjell-Rondane. Together with Glomma river and √òsterdalen, L√•gen and Gudbrandsdalen forms Norway's largest drainage system covering major parts of East Norway. Gudbrandsdalen is home to Dovre Line and the European route E6, and is the main land transport corridor through South Norway, from Oslo and central eastern lowlands to Trondheim and M√∏re og Romsdal. The valley is divided into three parts: Norddalen (Northern valley; the municipalities of Lesja, Dovre, Skj√•k, Lom, V√•g√• and Sel), Midtdalen (middle valley; the municipalities of Nord-Fron, S√∏r-Fron and Ringebu), and S√∏rdalen (Southern valley; the municipalities of √òyer, Gausdal and Lillehammer). The valley has two district courts, north and south. Until 2016 the valley was also a police district.http://www.nettavisen.no/politikk/direkte-slik-blir- politireformen/3422793443.html The Gudbrandsdalen district covers about 60% of the former Oppland county. The main character in Henrik Ibsen's play Peer Gynt was inspired by a real or legendary person living in the valley in the 18th or 17th century.Meyer, Michael. 1974. Ibsen: A Biography. Abridged edition. Pelican Biographies ser. Harmondsworth: Penguin. . Ibsen travelled through the valley in 1862 and collected local stories, legends and poems.√òstvedt, Einar (1967).

Etymology  Olaf II speaking to peasants at the thing, Hundorp. Halfdan Egedius, 1899. The name Gudbrandsdalen means 'the valley/dale of Gudbrand'. Gudbrand (Old Norse Gu√∞brandr) is an old male name compounded of gu√∞, 'god' and brandr, 'sword'. The name may be derived from a chief (hersir) called Gudbrand. According to Snorri Sturluson the district was also referred to as i Dalom (\\"in the valleys\\") because of the many valleys.Gudbrandsdalen. Oslo: Gyldendal, 1974. . Dale-Gudbrand settled in Hundorp, S√∏r-Fron. At the time of Halfdan the Black there was a \\"chief Gudbrand north in Gubrandsdalen\\" (Gudbrand herse nord i Dalom). Later Eric Bloodaxe had an opponent called Dale-Gudbrand. According to the sage Olaf II of Norway met one Dale-Gudbrand, supposedly the last Dale-Gudbrand, in 1021. Historians believe there was a regional centre at Hundorp during the Viking era and that the name Gudbrand was used for many generations by the ruling family. Burial mounds (tumulus) at Hundorp suggest that powerful men are buried there.  Geography  Gudbrand Valley includes the most arid area in Norway. At Skj√•k the average annual precipitation is only 278 mm. Gudbrand Valley sits in the rain shadow of the mountains West (including Jotunheimen), North and East of the valley. The valley is less incised than the valleys of western Norway. Farming is mostly confined to the relatively narrow valleys. Gudbrandsdalen and adjacent valleys are surrounded by wide uplands and mountain plateaus traditional used as seter or summer farms. Otta town at the confluence of Otta and L√•gen rivers, Rondane summits above. Patchwork farmland created by draining the shallow lake at Lesja east of the church. A 1799 hand-drawn map of the valley. The previous lake at Lesja visible. In July 1789 the Storofsen flood disaster occurred and Gudbrandsdalsl√•gen overflooded. This is the largest flood recorded in Norway and the valley was particularly affected. 61 people perished. About 3000 houses were totally damaged and some thousand livestock drowned. All bridges disappeared. L√•gen rose up to 7 meters above its normal level and covered most of the valley floor. A number of farmers abandoned their damaged farms and settled in M√•lselv, Troms county. The second largest flood occurred in the summer of 1995 and again the valley floor was largely covered by water. After Storofsen the valley floor upstream from Sel church changed into bogs and shallow lakes because stone and gravel changed the flow of L√•gen. From around 1910 drainage efforts left some 500 hectares dry farmland on what is still known as the Sel bogs. The toxic cicuta virosa thrived on those bogs before they were drained and are known in Norwegian as selsnepe (literally Sel turnip). The valley floor in Lesja (between Domb√•s and Lora) were originally covered by a shallow lake. Drainage efforts from 1860 abolished the lake and left some 1000 hectares farmland. The central part of the valley is covered by the Losna lake, some 50‚Äì60 meters deep.  Geology  The valley of Gudbrandsdalen is of considerable antiquity considering the overall development of the relief of Norway. The valley runs across the height axis of the southern Scandinavian Mountains ‚Äîa characteristic that could be indicating that the valley formed before the tectonic uplift of Norway. The valley is one of several valleys of southern Norway that existed already as part of the ancient Paleic relief but had at the time gentler slopes. Gudbrandsdalen formed and developed originally as a valley of fluvial origin. Only millions of year later was the valley re-shaped by glaciers during the Quaternary period. As the Fennoscandian Ice Sheet melted and retreated during the end of the last ice age a large but ephemeral ice-dammed lake formed in the valley.  History  The Gudbrand Valley was shaped by the recent ice age and rivers from the present glacial areas in Jotunheimen and Dovre. Bones and teeth from mammoths and musk oxen, living in the area at that time, are found in the valley. Several traces of hunters from the Stone Age are found in the valley (and in the mountain areas around). There is a rock carving of elks in the northern part of Lillehammer.https://kulturminnesok.no/minne/?queryString=https://data.kulturminne.no/askeladden/lokalitet/20978 Gudbrandsdalen has always hosted the main road between Trondheim and the central eastern lowlands. In Old Norse known as √æj√≥√∞vegr (tjodvei), \\"people's road\\" or \\"everybody's road\\". = Legendary history = The Battle of Kringen, depicted by Georg Nielsen Str√∏mdal (1856‚Äì1914) Raum the Old was the father of Dale-Gudbrand, and he settled in Hundorp. The Gudbrand Valley is mentioned extensively in the Heimskringla (Chronicle of the Kings of Norway) by Snorri Sturluson. The account of King Olaf's (A.D. 1015‚Äì1021) conversion of Dale- Gudbrand to Christianity is popularly recognized. According to the saga Gudbrand built a church there \\"in the valleys\\", possibly at Haave farm near Hundorp where archaeological evidence indicates what may have been the first church in the valley. In 1206, the heir to the Norwegian throne, H√•kon H√•konsson, was saved by birkebeiners with a ski-run from Lillehammer to Rena. Until the Black Plague settlement expanded and new farms were established at outskirts. Farms with names -gard, -rud, -hus, and -li are mostly from this expansion period. During the High Middle Ages about 40 churches existed, most built in wood except for instances masonry churches in Easter Gausdal and Follebu. Hamar episcopal see was established in 1152 and its jurisdiction included Gudbrandsdalen. Garmo Stave Church and Ringebu Stave Church are examples of ancient wooden churches. F√•vang Stave Church and V√•g√• Church include parts from older churches. The Black Plague reduced the population in Gudbrandsdal by 50 to 70% during 1349 to 1350. Saksum, Brekkom, Sk√•bo, Venabygd and other districts were left largely deserted for centuries. Inhabitants from marginal areas presumably relocated to the main valley and other areas with vacant land. A large number of clergy also perished during the plague and churches fell into disrepair. During the 1600s the population again reached the same level as in 1300. During the 1500s the area had about 6000 inhabitants. No census was taken before 1665 and population figures are based on estimates. This resulted in a temporary improvement for the lower classes as crofters became scarce and the poor were able to rent the better farms. = Older history = During the Reformation in 1537, the Church of Norway was subordinated to the lendmenn or sheriffs. Church property was appropriated by the Crown and the King became the biggest landowner in the Gudbrand Valley. The Battle of Kringen took place in 1612, near Otta, Norway, and the local \\"Gudbrandsd√∏ls\\" defeated a Scottish mercenary army. The legends of this battle live on to this day, including the story of how the peasant girl Prillar-Guri lured the Scots into an ambush by playing the traditional ram's horn. The 1665 census indicates a population of 13,000. German Ju-52 shot down at Domb√•s, April 1940 In 1670 to 1725, most of the royal property was sold off to pay for war debts, first to established property holders, but increasingly to peasant proprietors. A freeholders' era began and a new \\"upper class\\" of landholders was formed. Storofsa happened in 1789, and is the greatest flood recorded in the Gudbrand Valley; several farms were devastated, and many people died. = Modern history = In 1827, the city of Lillehammer is established. The paddle steamer Skibladner on Mj√∏sa and Hovedbanen (the first railroad in Norway) connected the Gudbrand Valley to Christiania in 1856. The Hamar-Selbanen railway was completed to Tretten in 1894. Hamar- Selbanen changed its name to the Dovre Line 1921, and the new main railway between Oslo and Trondheim, was completed through the Gudbrand Valley. The outdoor museum of Maihaugen, exhibiting historical architecture from all parts of the Gudbrand Valley, opened at Lillehammer in 1904. From around 1865 the population declined substantially because of emigration to North-America. Until 1946 the majority of inhabitants worked in farming. There was severe fighting in the valley at Tretten and Kvam, as well as in Domb√•s, during World War II. The Battle of Domb√•s was an attempt to stop the German advance. British troops engaged German troops in land battles for the first time in World War 2 after many months of Phoney War.Dirk Levsen: Mikrogeschichte als Besatzungsgeschichte.

Cianjur () is a town and district in the West Java province of Indonesia, and is the capital of Cianjur Regency. The district of Cianjur is located along one of the main roads between Jakarta (120 km to the northwest) and Bandung (60 km to the east). The population was 165,062 according to the latest official estimate for mid 2018. Because of its location, some of Cianjur's residents commute to work either in Bandung or in Jakarta. The road on which Cianjur is located used to be the main (extremely busy) road from Jakarta to Bandung but was in effect replaced as the main road link between these two main cities when the Jakarta-Bandung tollroad was fully completed in 2005. However, due to its low traffic, Cianjur return as one of alternative routes for travellers from Jakarta and Bandung. History Cianjur was founded in 1677, with the first head of the town being R. A. Wiratanudatar I, entitled Dalem Cikundul, as the descendant from the old Sundanese kingdom of Pajajaran. More than 75 people were killed in the earthquake of 2 September 2009.

Transportation After being dormant for about 2 years, the train called Siliwangi between Sukabumi and Cianjur was reactivated on 8 February 2014. It is faster than the buses which are usually trapped in traffic jams, but the cost of a train ticket is double that of using buses.

Biography Chapayev was born into a poor peasant family in a village called Budayka, now part of Cheboksary to Mordvin (Erzya) father and Chuvash mother. During World War I, he fought as a non-commissioned officer and was awarded the Cross of St. George three times. In September 1917, he joined the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (Bolsheviks). In December was elected commander of the 138 Infantry Regiment by a vote of the regiment's soldiers. He later commanded the 2nd Nikolaev Division and the 25th Rifle Division. On September 5, 1919, the divisional headquarters near Lbishchensk (now renamed Chapayev in his honour) were ambushed by White Army forces. According to official sources, Chapayev tried to escape by swimming across the Ural River, but was never again seen alive. \\"In 1919, a wounded Chapayev was shot and drowned in the Ural river\\". His body was never recovered, but the town where he died was later renamed Chapaev, and a museum was established in 1927. Private life In 1908 Chapayev became acquainted with Pelageya Metelina, who was 18. Although his father didn't approve of their relations, Vasily Ivanovich married her. They lived together for 6 years, and had three children, one of which was Klavdia Chapayeva. Though there was no official divorce, in 1917 Chapayev started living with the widow of his deceased fellow-soldier Petr Kishkertsev. Curiously enough, her name was also Pelageya. Chapayev adopted both of her children. Currently the only relative that remains is his great- great-grand daughter Vasilisa Chapayeva, with her parents Yevgenia Chapayeva and Viktor Pecherin. In Russian culture Chapayev on a 1948 Soviet Union postage stamp After the Soviet Union had been established, Chapayev was immortalized by Soviet propaganda as a hero of the Russian Civil War. In 1923, a Russian writer, Dmitriy Furmanov, who served as a commissar in Chapayev's division wrote a popular novel entitled Chapaev. Later, in 1934, it was made into a film Chapayev by the Vasilyev brothers. The movie became highly popular in the Soviet Union. The German actor and singer Ernst Busch also recorded the song Tschapajews Tod, which talks about his death in the Ural. More recently, he became one of the central characters in the novel Chapayev and Void by modern Russian writer Viktor Pelevin. In November 1998, Red Comrades Save the Galaxy, a point-and-click graphic adventure game was developed by S.K.I.F. and published by Buka Entertainment (now 1C Company). The game's protagonist Vasily Ivanovich Chapaev, is inspired by Chapayev. Chapayev, along with his aide Petka, became a recurring character in popular Russian jokes.

Cornetti are sold as part of the Heartbrand product line, known internationally by different names, including Algida in Italy, Wall's in the UK, HB in the Republic of Ireland, Frigo in Spain, and Kwality Wall's in India. Several variations of the product exist, ranging from milk-based ice cream to vegetable fat-based dessert.  Manufacturing For a long time, the idea of selling frozen ice-cream cones had been impractical, as the ice cream would soak into the cone during the manufacturing process and make it soggy and unpalatable when served. In 1959, Spica, an Italian ice-cream manufacturer based in Naples, overcame this problem by insulating the inside of the waffle cone from the ice cream with a coating of oil, sugar, and chocolate. They are sold in many different sizes throughout Europe in sizes ranging from 28-ml Miniatures to 260-ml King Cones, though the 90-ml and 125-ml sizes tend to be the most popular. Varieties The product is available in a variety of flavours, including Strawberry, Mint Chocolate, Nut, Lemon, Whippy (yogurt flavour with a chewy chocolate), Valentine's Day flavours, and Cornetto Soft (soft ice cream that comes in chocolate chip, cookie dough, vanilla, chocolate, and double chocolate). Cornetto Soft is sold on the street by vendors and is made on the spot with an ice cream dispenser, but the other flavours are premade and factory packaged. Also, Cornetto Enigma is made, which consists of cookies and cream, raspberry and double chocolate flavours. Unilever introduced a Cornetto chocolate confectionery into the UK market in 2013, following a licensing deal with Kinnerton Confectionery. Advertising campaigns =‚ÄôO sole mio campaign= The brand was marketed in the United Kingdom, Ireland, and Brazil by successful advertising campaigns which placed the Neapolitan song \\"O Sole Mio\\" into a variety of stereotypical Italian locations and situations, with its lyrics changed to: :Just one Cornetto, :give it to me, :delicious ice-cream, of Italy, :creamy vanilla and choco dream, :Give me Cornetto, :from Wall's ice cream.

The theme resurfaced in 2006, this time sung by pedestrians, drivers, office workers, and marathon runners in Central London. In the Philippines, the \\"\\" () campaign was launched in 2008, relying on humour and focused on the product's affordability, with skits that centre on things one cannot afford with 20 pesos and suggests that the audience should buy a Cornetto instead. \\"\\" () and \\"\\" () were used as slogans for the campaign.

She also donated her papers related to their long friendship along with more than 1000 volumes and many documents connected to Pasolini to the archives of the Fondazione Cineteca di Bologna, thus creating the Centro Studi Archivio Pier Paolo Pasolini. This Centro, strongly wanted by Betti, owns also thousands of photograph and all the works of Pasolini: poetry, literature, cinema and journalism. After her death in 2004 her brother Sergio Trombetti has donated all the personal documents of her career to the Centro that has absorbed them under the name Fondo Laura Betti.
