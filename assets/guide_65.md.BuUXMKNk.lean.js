Story also visible outside paywall at this link. She has since joined the Chertoff Group. Earlier in the Trump administration, Ricardel served as a Special Assistant to the President and Associate Director in the Office of Presidential Personnel, and Under Secretary of Commerce for Export Administration. In years prior to that, she served as a foreign policy advisor to U.S. Senator Bob Dole and held positions in the U.S. Department of Defense during the Presidency of George W. Bush. Early life and education Born Mira P. Radielovic in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Ricardel is of Croatian descent. Her father, Peter Radielovich, came from Breza, Bosnia and Herzegovina. He was 16 years old when he survived the Bleiburg repatriations. After briefly attending Zagreb University, he left Yugoslavia in 1954. After two years in Heidelberg, where he met and married his wife, he arrived in the United States in 1956. Ricardel grew up in Pasadena, California, and at home spoke the Croatian language. Her family belonged to the Croatian Catholic Church and attended Mass in Arcadia, California. Ricardel received her Bachelor of Science (B.S.) in Foreign Service from Georgetown University, graduating in 1982. While at Georgetown, she was a member of the Delta Phi Epsilon professional foreign service sorority.Twelfth Line, Alpha Chapter Sisters List, accessed May 19, 2018 She then did doctoral coursework at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, but did not complete her degree.  Career  Politically, Ricardel has characterized herself as a \\"Reagan Republican\\". Her public service began in 1986, working at the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency as a congressional affairs specialist and later as a deputy director for congressional affairs. She served at the agency until 1989. =Aide to Dole= From 1989 to 1996, Ricardel worked as a legislative assistant to Senate Republican leader Bob Dole, drafting legislation and specializing in foreign affairs and defense policy. She made appearances in public, and her work with Dole earned her a portrayal in the nationally- circulated Weekly Standard in 1995. During the Bosnian War between 1992 and 1995, her personal knowledge of the languages and cultures involved was credited with improving Dole's understanding of the conflict. One official said, \\"She knows the issues, so he knows the issues.\\" Ricardel's Croatian heritage brought forth accusations that she was influencing Dole to take an anti-Serbian policy stance. But in fact Dole had a long record of warning about the actions and character of Serbia leader Slobodan Milosevic. Ricardel said of Dole in 1999, \\"He's been out there for a decade saying we need to get involved. And no one's been paying attention. Or they pay attention for a while and manage the problem, but they don't solve it.\\" Then known as Mira Baratta, in a defense-related meeting in 2001 Ricardel served as an advisor on defense and foreign policy on Dole's 1996 presidential campaign, when he won the Republican nomination but lost the general election to Bill Clinton. = Freedom House = Ricardel served as a vice president for programming with the nonprofit organization Freedom House from 1997 to 1998 and as an independent consultant from 1998 to 2000. During some of this time she lived in New York City and was a close neighbor of Monica Lewinsky. = George W. Bush administration = From 2001 to 2003, Ricardel was Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs for Eurasia and was responsible for coalition building between the U.S. and governments in the Caucasus, Central Asian, and Balkans regions. From 2003 to 2005, Ricardel was the acting Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs. She was the primary adviser to the U.S. Secretary of Defense regarding Europe, Eurasia, NATO, nuclear forces, missile defense, and arms control. The Washington Post reported that \\"She developed a reputation as a Russia hawk and was seen as a tough bureaucratic player with a strong personality\\". One former colleague later said, \\"She‚Äôs a very tough woman, very smart, does not suffer fools well. And if you happen to be the fool, she will let you know\\". =Private sector= After leaving the Defense Department, Ricardel spent one year as Vice President of International Business Development for Teachscape, a company that creates educational training and support. From 2006 to 2015, Ricardel was employed by the Boeing Company as Vice President, Strategic Missile & Defense Systems, as well as Vice President of International Business Development, Network and Space Systems. During her time with Boeing she was a resident of Alexandria, Virginia. In 2015, Ricardel joined Federal Budget IQ as a consultant. Despite the orientation of its work, that of an involved governmental research firm, she was not considered a registered lobbyist. =Donald Trump administration= Transition Ricardel was part of Donald Trump's presidential transition team as a Department of Defense advisor. Ricardel was looked at for positions in the new administration in the Defense and State Departments, but was twice blocked based upon past bureaucratic run-ins, in the first instance by Secretary of Defense James Mattis and in the second by Department of State Chief of Staff Margaret Peterlin. Ricardel had blocked some nominees wanted by Mattis because of potential Democratic ties or having supported Hillary Clinton in the past, instead preferring \\"Republican loyalists.\\" Under Secretary of Commerce for Export Administration Under Secretary Ricardel (front, right of center) at the USA Partnership Pavilion ribbon cutting at the Singapore Airshow in February 2018 On March 30, 2017, President Trump announced his intent to nominate Ricardel for Under Secretary of Commerce for Export Administration in the U.S. Department of Commerce. On April 28, 2017, Ricardel's nomination was received in the Senate and referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs. The committee approved her nomination and she was confirmed by the entire U.S Senate on August 3, 2017, by voice vote. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross made a statement congratulating Ricardel on her new position: \\"Since coming on board [at the Commerce Department], she has helped keep sensitive technologies out of the hands of those who would do us harm, while also working to ensure that imports do not threaten to impair our national security.\\" Deputy National Security Advisor On April 23, 2018, Ricardel was named as the next Deputy National Security Advisor by the new National Security Advisor, John R. Bolton. The position did not require Senate confirmation and she took office in May. One of Ricardel's first actions was to push for the elimination of the position of White House cybersecurity chief, which was done on May 15, 2018. White House officials quoted Alexander Hamilton in Federalist No. 70 in defending the move, which was criticized by many within the cybersecurity community. In July 2018, reported difficulties between Ricardel and NSC staffer Jennifer Arangio was one of the factors that led to Arangio's dismissal. Despite past conflicts, the White House said that Ricardel was working effectively with the Mattis-led Defense Department. However, subsequent reports in September 2018 indicated that the Mattis- Ricardel embattlement was still in place, while other reports said that the conflict between the two had been overblown. Ricardel continued to be portrayed in the media as a tough bureaucratic opponent. On November 13, 2018, First Lady Melania Trump publicly called for Ricardel's firing, an unusual move. The unpleasantries between them reportedly originated with a dispute over personnel presence on the plane for the First Lady's visit to Africa, and subsequent alleged negative leaking on the part of Ricardel against the First Lady. Bolton still supported Ricardel, but it was not enough, as by this point, few other officials supported her. Bloomberg News reported that Ricardel \\"had caused friction\\" and was \\"widely disliked among other White House staff,\\" while Politico, quoting anonymous administration officials, gave a similar assessment. The following day, the White House announced Ricardel would leave her position and \\"transition to a new role\\" within the administration. In a public statement Ricardel said it had been \\"an honor\\" to serve in the White House.https://news.yahoo.com/trump-aide-ousted-first-lady- says-honor-225435848--politics.html Subsequent developments By mid- November, Ricardel had reportedly been offered nearly a dozen other positions within the Trump administration, including the post of United States Ambassador to Estonia, which she refused. In January 2019, Fox News reported that she was \\"under active consideration for a top job at the Pentagon\\"; that did not happen. She has since joined the Chertoff Group, a security consulting firm founded by Michael Chertoff.  Memberships, awards, and honors  In July 2005, Ricardel was awarded the Department of Defense Medal for Distinguished Public Service. Ricardel was a member of the Council on Foreign Relations as of May 2017.  Personal life  While at the Fletcher School, she met Robert Baratta, who has been involved in aspects of Virginia politics and the federal government.Our Team, Partner, Capital Results, accessed May 19, 2018 They married and she became known as Mira Baratta. After her marriage to Baratta ended, she married Vincent Ricardel, a photographer. She became known as Mira Ricardel. Her husband is Senior Advisor to the Chairman of the National Endowment for the Humanities.

Logistics Drug distribution has special safety and security considerations. Some drugs require cold chain management in their distribution. The industry uses track and trace technology, though the timings for implementation and the information required vary across different countries, with varying laws and standards. Regulation Because governments regulate access to drugs, governments control drug distribution and the drug supply chain more than trade for other goods. Distribution begins with the pharmaceutical industry manufacturing drugs. From there, intermediaries in the public sector, private sector, and non-governmental organizations acquire drugs to provide them to other intermediaries. Eventually, the drugs reach different classes of consumers who use them. Good distribution practice (GDP) is a quality warranty system, which includes requirements for purchase, receiving, storage and export of drugs intended for human consumption. It regulates the division and movement of pharmaceutical products from the premises of the manufacturer of medicinal products, or another central point, to the end user thereof, or to an intermediate point by means of various transport methods, via various storage and/or health establishments. =Argentina= In 2011, Argentina introduced a catalogue of drugs covered but its national drug traceability scheme, listing more than 3,000 drugs that require the placing of unique serial numbers and tamper-evident features on the secondary packaging. The drugs listed are recorded in real time in a central database managed by the National Administration of Drugs, Foods, Medical Devices of Argentina (ANMAT), Regulation 3683, which uses Global Location Numbers (GLNs) to identify the various actors in the supply chain. The purpose of this program is to actively limit the use of illegal drugs. =Brazil= The 2009 Brazilian Federal Law 11.903 and subsequent regulations of the National Agency for Sanitary Surveillance in Brazil (ANVISA) require that a 2D data matrix code be put on all secondary packaging. Under these provisions, manufacturers will be required to maintain a database of all transactions from manufacturing to dispensing, while distributors must report serialized transaction data to the manufacturer and keep a database of suppliers, medicine recipients, and packing companies. Data Element ‚Äì National Number, Expiration Date, Batch/Lot Number, Serial Number =China= In 2008, China‚Äôs State Food and Drug Administration (CFDA) made serialization mandatory for over 275 therapeutic classes of individual saleable product units by December 2015. The CFDA does not follow an international standard. Manufacturers may only register their products and obtain their serial numbers by applying to the China Product Identification, Authentication and Tracking System (PIATS). They must also implement a quality control system with an electronic drug-monitoring system, a standardized documentation system, and bar codes to ensure pharmaceutical traceability. Companies importing drugs into China must designate a local pharmaceutical company or wholesaler as their electronic monitoring agent in the country. In addition to legislative reforms, China has increased enforcement efforts at the provincial and local levels. In 2013, the Chinese government coordinated joint special enforcement campaigns targeting counterfeit drugs.. China regulations are currently on hold. =Europe = In Europe GDP is based on the Commission Directive (EU) 2017/1572 of 15 September 2017 supplementing Directive 2001/83/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards the principles and guidelines of good manufacturing practice for medicinal products for human use. In 2016, the European Medicines Agency adopted the Falsified Medicines Directive (FMD), which requires all pharmaceutical products sold in the EU to feature obligatory ‚Äúsafety features.‚Äù This directive is scheduled to launch in the first quarter of 2019. By February 9, 2019, all pharmaceutical companies will be required to connect their internal systems to the EU data repository, which contains the product master data and batch information. This will allow pharmacists and consumers to authenticate their medicines. = United States = In the US, Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) Regulations are based on the Code of Federal Regulations 21 CFR 210/211, and USP 1079. The US Drug Supply and Chain Security Act (DSCSA), was enacted by Congress on November 26, 2013 and outlines requirements to build electronic systems that identify and trace prescription drugs distributed in the US. By November 27th 2023, full electronic track & trace capability will be required for all partners in the supply chain. Illegal drugs An illegal drug trade operates to distribute illegal drugs. The trade of illegal drugs overlaps with trade in contraband of all sorts. Illegal drug distribution does not overlap in obvious ways with the legal trade of legal drugs.

Landy is Professor of Psychology and Neural Science at New York University. He is known for his research on visual perception and movement planning.  Biography  Landy attended college at Columbia University and earned a B.S. in 1974 in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. Subsequently, Landy went to the University of Michigan where he received a M.S. in 1976 and a Ph.D in 1981 in Computer and Communication Sciences. His doctoral research (conducted under the supervision of John Henry Holland) used neural network models of visual learning. After receiving his doctorate, he began working at New York University, where he subsequently became a faculty member in 1984.  Research  Landy's research uses computational models to describe the human visual system, including perception of texture, orientation, stereopsis, and motion. He also researches decision-making and motor planning. Landy is best known for his work on cue combination.

Helium is commercially produced as a byproduct of natural gas extraction. Until the mid-1990s, the United States Bureau of Mines operated a large scale helium storage facility to support government requirements for helium. The Helium Privatization Act of 1996 and subsequent increased demand for helium has led to market volatility and the entrance of significant new producers. Intermittent shortages or price increases have motivated helium users to find new ways to save on helium consumption. A lack of helium supply can affect researchers and industrial users of helium, and may lead to loss of research materials and equipment. Perspectives on helium stocking and conservation As early as 1982 there were discussions from multiple points of view about the possibility of helium shortage. One such point of discussion was to examine the usefulness of helium storage in the United States from an economic perspective. The maximisation of welfare resulting from this finite natural resource was the focal point of people of this school of thought. This economic approach is represented by the present value criterion. According to this criterion, a resource is ideally sold at the moment that the profit plus compounded interest is expected to be higher than it will be at any point in the foreseeable future, thus ensuring maximal economic value. On the other hand, there were people who advocated a more conservationist approach in the belief that the present value criterion resulted in too rapid use of the resource and too little consideration of the needs of future generations. Some scientists suggested that helium ought to be separated from as many sources as would be energetically ideal. Discussions continue. The occurrence of a worldwide helium shortage in 2006-7 made such concerns more pressing. This shortage caused price spikes and a complete cut- off of supply for some prospective buyers. Some equipment can become useless or permanently damaged without an adequate helium supply. For example, an uninterrupted supply of liquid helium is necessary for a vast number of university researchers, hospitals, pharmaceutical companies and high-tech industries.American Physical Society, American Chemical Society, Materials Research Society (2016). ‚ÄúResponding to the U.S. Research Community‚Äôs Liquid Helium Crisis‚Äù. https://www.aps.org/policy/reports/popa- reports/upload/HeliumReport.pdf Without liquid helium, all magnetic resonance imaging machines would become inoperable and there is currently no equivalent diagnostic technology to replace them As a consequence, helium shortages are a very serious matter for certain groups. However, helium has a much wider range of applications. It has been used in other research laboratories, lighter-than-air craft, rockets, welding under inert conditions, producing breathing mixtures for deep-sea diving, respiratory therapy, and in cryogenics. Aside from laboratory applications and cryogenics, not all these uses exploit the unique properties of helium, which is therefore replaceable. One consequence of fears of helium shortages are attempts to improve production volume. It is profitable for natural gas manufacturers to recover helium from sources containing more than 0.3 percent. Part of the strategy of the 2013 Helium Stewardship Act, currently implemented by the United States Department of Energy through its Advanced Manufacturing Office of Isotopes within the Office of Nuclear Physics in the United States Department of Energy Office of Science, was to improve the economics of recovering helium beyond that threshold by making advances in the membrane technology used in the production process. The average price of liquid helium in North America in 2013 was around $6 per liter and represents the lower end of the price range; Europe with around $10 per liter is in the middle, whereas Latin America and Asia expends the highest band range of $13‚Äì15 per liter.Lvovsky, Y., Stautner, E. W., Zhang, T. (2013). ‚ÄúNovel technologies and configurations of superconducting magnets for MRI‚Äù. Supercond. Sci. Technol. 26 093001 Special situation of researchers Several research organisations have released statements on the scarcity and conservation of helium.American Physical Society (1995). ‚ÄúNational Policy‚Äù. https://www.aps.org/policy/statements/95_3.cfm Among these are the American Physical Society, counting approximately 53,000 members, the Materials Research Society, an international organisation with 16,000 members, and the American Chemical Society, the world‚Äôs largest scientific society with some 158,000 members. These organisations released policy recommendations as early as 1995 and as late as 2016 urging the United States government to store and conserve helium because of the natural limits to the helium supply and the unique nature of the element. For researchers, helium is irreplaceable because it is essential for producing very low temperatures. In recent years, concerns about high prices and the occurrence of a shortage in 2006-7 have also contributed to calls for helium conservation and measures to lower the price of helium for researchers from these organisations. Not only the level of prices imposes hardships on researchers, but also their volatility. As researchers often work with essentially fixed budgets, sudden rises in the price of helium lead to a lack of sufficient funds for their research projects.Zhang, S. (2013). ‚ÄúUnited States extends life of helium reserve‚Äù. Nature News. An example from the United States of America clearly demonstrates the effect on researchers‚Äô budgets: while in the mid-2000s individual investigator awards from the National Science Foundation‚Äôs Division of Materials Research were approximately $130,000 annually, and a typical low- temperature researcher spent up to $15,000 of their grant annually on liquid helium, in 2015 the typical Division of Materials Research grant for an individual investigator has only barely increased to $140,000 per year while researchers now have to spend upwards of $40,000‚Äîmore than one quarter of their grant‚Äîon liquid helium. Currently, liquid helium can represent upwards of 30% of the cost of some low-temperature research projects. In response, research organisations have allocated funds for grants for small scale liquefiers for research purposes. According to estimates from the Division of Materials Research, there are potentially hundreds of research groups for which it would be economically viable to purchase such a system, but who do not have the necessary funds, as only a small fraction can be assisted by such grant programs. High prices have caused research organisations to issue recommendations to both the United States government and researchers on how to conserve helium by reducing consumption. In the wake of high prices, more researchers have invested in gas-capture systems to reduce their helium consumption. Such systems can pay for themselves within three years. Another measure that has been taken to ensure helium supply for researchers in the United States is the partnering of the American Physical Society and the American Chemical Society with the Defence Logistics Agency of the Department of Defense to create the Liquid Helium Purchasing Program, which provides more affordable and reliable liquid helium to program members. By combining customers‚Äô needs, the Defence Logistics Agency substantially increases its purchasing power when negotiating contracts and price. The program also partners with multiple liquid helium suppliers so that its customers are not tied to a single vendor. The program enrollees achieved more reliable delivery and average savings of 15 percent. According to these research organisations, adverse effects of the high price of helium on research are already beginning to be seen: scientists are abandoning areas of research that require liquid helium, professors are having to cut hiring of graduate students, and institutions are moving away from hiring new faculty in areas of research that require the use of liquid helium.  Development of the helium industry In 1914, helium was mooted in Britain and the United States as a replacement for hydrogen in barrage balloons and aircraft. The first major development in helium production was the Helium Conservation Act of March 3, 1925. It established a production and sales program under the control of a centralized entity, the United States Bureau of Mines. Around this time, it was discovered that helium enabled divers to stay under water longer and ascend in a shorter time, presenting another application for helium. In reaction to depleting helium sources, the Helium Act of March 3, 1927 was established to prohibit the sale of helium to foreign countries and for non-governmental domestic use. By 1937, a number of factors collided to move the United States government to revise its helium policy and create the Helium Act of September 1, 1937. New uses for helium were appearing and the U.S. Army and Navy did not require anywhere near the national output. A final impetus was given by the Hindenburg disaster, which may have been prevented had the Germans had access to helium. The act authorized the sale of helium gas not needed by the U.S. government. This ultimately led to an expansion in helium usage in many scientific and commercial industries as the Bureau of Mines also supplied helium to private entities. The passage of this act also allowed non-hostile foreign governments to purchase helium for their own commercial use. When Nazi Germany applied for 18 million cubic feet of helium for public airship travel, this sparked a debate in the U.S., leading to a refusal. Throughout the Second World War, government demand still significantly outweighed private use and the supply was sufficient to meet government needs (230 million cubic feet in 1942). By the end of the war, demand for helium had dropped precipitously and the operation of most production plants ceased. This led the Bureau of Mines to begin a helium conservation program in January 1945 by injecting surplus helium into the Cliffside Gas Field. Creation of the US National Helium Reserve From 1917 to 1962, the Bureau of Mines was the primary producer of helium and it remained the sole purifier of helium until 1963. Leading up to the early 1960s, there was a rapid growth in government demand in the United States for helium. It was fuelled by the military, especially for aerospace applications such as liquid fuel rockets for defense and space exploration. The amount of stored helium was very small before 1962 and the amount of available helium was essentially determined by the production of natural gas, from which it is separated as a side product, rather than by market forces. This situation changed in the early 1960s with the creation of the United States National Helium Reserve. At this time, the Bureau of Mines negotiated long-term contracts with four private companies for the first time to purchase and store large amounts of helium and it established an underground reservoir in the Cliffside Field near Amarillo, Texas. The original purpose of this reserve was to store helium in the 1960s for government use in the 1970s. To ensure that the revenue from future sales would amortize the cost, the Secretary of the Interior raised the price of high purity helium from $12 per thousand cubic feet to $35. This price jump was an incentive for private companies to enter the market and sell helium at lower prices. By 1970, it also became evident that the projected increase in government demand did not occur and that the helium stored in the Cliffside Field would last for decades. The combination of lower-than-projected demand and private competition resulted in sustained losses for the National Helium Reserve. In reaction, the government cancelled its contracts in 1973. As a consequence, the industrial capacity utilization rate for helium production dropped from 104% in 1966 to 41.7% in 1974. The helium companies involved in the operation sued the United States government for breach of contract. The owners of the land containing the natural gas from which helium was separated as a side- product sued the government for the value of the helium, as they were unable to sell it to third parties. In the 1970s the Bureau of Mines changed its policy to allow private companies to store helium in the Cliffside Field. This had a profound impact on the industry. Prior to this decision, roughly two billion cubic feet of helium were separated from natural gas annually and 0.6 billion cubic feet were sold. Three years after the decision, 0.88 billion cubic feet were sold, 0.54 were stored, and 0.98 were separated and vented. At the same time, roughly 4.74 billion cubic feet were not separated from natural gas. Helium Privatization Act In the 1990s there was a rapid growth in demand due to the development of the electronics and magnetic resonance imaging industries. This growth continued at a slower pace until the 2010s, with the exception of 2008-2009. National Helium Reserve sales led to fluctuations in both pricing and supply. In this context, the Helium Privatization Act was passed in the United States in 1996. The Bureau of Land Management was given responsibility for operating the National Helium Reserve and charged with recouping the taxpayers‚Äô investment by selling its crude helium to private vendors. More recent legislation aimed at fully privatising the helium market requires that the Bureau of Land Management sell off the vast majority of the reserve during the next several years and cease its operations by 2021. After problems with the helium supply in 2012-2013, the United States Congress acted to extend the life of the reserve. New producers While formerly most of the helium production technologies were in the United States, additional producing countries slowly appeared, and Qatar, Canada, Algeria and Russia are producers of the gas.Nuttall, W. J., Clarke, R., Glowacki, B., (2012). ‚ÄúThe Future of Helium as a Natural Resource‚Äù, Routledge. In 2015, this new production resulted in a surplus of supply over demand. The United States, which has historically been an exporter of helium, will soon become an importer for the first time in its history. Since 2013 the world's largest helium hub is no longer located in the United States of America but in Qatar, which produces 1.3 billion cubic feet of helium per year from a single project and meets 25% of the global demand. One challenge related to bringing new helium sources onto the market is that it usually requires venture capital financing. Another challenge is that the current selling price of U.S. Cliffside helium is too low to encourage more new producers to enter the field.

The manuscript score and parts of the quartet are at the National Library of Australia.Catalogue entry The whole quartet is dedicated to \\"Henri Verbrugghen and the members of his string quartet\\". The second movement has a specific dedication to David Nichols (violist), the third to Jenny Cullen (second violin) and the fourth to Henry Verbruggen (first violin). In the manuscript only initials are present: D.E.N., J.C. and H.V. Though the first movement lacks any special dedication, it can be reasonably assumed there should be one to the cellist (James Messeas), the cello having indeed a prominent role in this movement: it sets forth the principal theme.  Structure  The quartet is in four movements.Stiles Music Publications :I. Allegro (C minor) :II. Adagio ma non troppo (A-flat major) :III. Scherzo. Presto (F major) :IV. Finale. Allegro con spirito (C minor) The first movement opens with a slow introduction (this is the first of Hill's quartets to have one). After a brief pause its theme is repeated with pizzicato \\"answers\\" in the first violin. Following is a sonata form. The first subject, a resolute ascending and descending theme in C minor, is stated by the cello and repeated then by the viola. The second subject is a much more quiet idea in the parallel key of E-flat major played by the violins. The exposition concludes with the main theme heard again in the cello part. It is linked to a rather modest development section in which this theme investigates different tonalities before coming to an abrupt stop. The introductory material is repeated in a more tense form and with some cello shrieks. At the end of this section the violin pizzicato's appear again leading straight to a shortened recapitulation of both subjects (the second in C major this time). The concluding cello theme goes on into the coda combining the two themes. The slow movement is in a ternary ABA form. Its first theme, set by the viola, is in A-flat major, with two characteristic syncopations at the head. After several variations it comes to B-flat major providing a dominant for the E-flat major second theme notable for its triplets. It changes keys and, again through B-flat major, returns to the first theme in A-flat major appearing with a modified accompaniment. The first idea of the Scherzo is a dance-like tune in F major. It consists of an 8-bar statement, an 8-bar contrasting section (based on the previous) and an 8-bar concluding restatement, that is loosely entwined with the further section: after 8 additional bars serving as a transition (with a first violin passage) the theme is heard a tone higher, in G major. Another transitory section arrives and brings the \\"right\\" tonality, allowing the theme to be stated another time, in an altered way. All of this is repeated directly from the contrasting section. The trio is in B-flat major. Its composition is as perspicuous as that of the outer sections. It is also in a ternary form with a repetition. Following the trio the first section is repeated without any additions of alternations. After a brief introduction the first violin states the C minor principal theme of the last movement. It is written in a sonata rondo form lacking a proper development section. The first theme is temperate, rather smooth than impulsive. The first subject, however, is much broader and includes a full version of the theme, a transitory section developing the material and another statement of the theme (again in C minor). After some bridging bars the gloomy and desperate second subject (in F minor) is heard. Although attempting to change the mode to the major, it ends in minor. The music proceeds to a repetition of the whole first subject, by which the second appearance of the main theme is in G minor. Its complaints are answered by the resolution of the second subject (in C minor). In the coda the essential figures of the principal theme are heard once more. The final chord ends the quartet strongly and mercilessly.  Editions  * Alfred Hill. String Quartet No.4 in C minor.

Developed mainly in the 19th century, it illustrates the coexistence of agricultural and industrial pursuits in a single village area, mixing worker housing, former farm properties, and a small mill complex. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992. Description and history Curtisville is located in Glastonbury's northwest corner, between Main Street to the east and the Connecticut River to the west. It is divided by Salmon Brook, a tributary of the river, and has two nearly discontiguous segments along Pratt Street and Naubuc Avenue north of the brook, and Naubuc Avenue and Parker Terrace to its south. Most of the buildings in the district are residences, dating from the late 18th to early 20th centuries. The largest number were built as worker housing in the 19th century, and are in vernacular forms with Federal and Greek Revival styling. There are some late examples of houses built for area tobacco farmers as well, including an early 20th-century Foursquare house on Pratt Street. Other distinctive houses are an Italianate villa built by a member of the Welles family who operated the mill, and a Gothic Revival cottage built for a mill supervisor. Off Parker Terrace is a small complex with several brick mill buildings, the major ones built around 1870. The Curtisville area was one of the first parts of Glastonbury to be settled by English colonists, who had been using its riverfront meadows since the 17th century. Early land use in the area divided the area into narrow strips fronting on the river, with houses located on the terrace facing what is now Main Street. Salmon Brook was recognized as a source of water power in the colonial period, but its industrial development did not begin until the 1840s, when Oswin Welles began the manufacture of wooden wares and cigars. Brothers Frederick and Joseph Curtis established a major silver plating factory on the south bank of the brook around that time. Their endeavour was underfinanced and failed around 1860. The property was taken over by Thomas Vail, who manufactured rifles and single-shot pistols during the American Civil War. The property returned to silver plating when his business failed after the war ended. Tobacco continued to be a mainstay of agriculture in the area, and there was regular ferry and barge service at a wharf at the end of Pratt Street.

Life  Lucy Gwendolen Williams was born in Cheshire to the Reverend Henry Lewis Williams, the vicar of Bleasely and his wife Katherine. During the 1890s she studied at the Wimbledon College of Arts under the tutelage of Alfred Drury, later moving to the Royal Academy where she was taught by Professor √âdouard Lant√©ri. Although she also painted watercolours and reliefs, her main work was in bronze or marble, consisting of statuettes, busts and children's heads. Williams interests included gardening and Theosophy and she was a Fellow of the Brighton and Hove Theosophical Society. She died in Buxton in 1955.  Career  During her career, which spanned over 40 years, Williams was primarily based in London although she spent a period of 8 or 9 years in Rome from 1910 and may also have worked in New York for some time. In 1893, whilst still a student at Wimbledon College, some of her work was exhibited at the Royal Academy and she was to continue exhibiting here until 1935. Her work was also shown at the Royal Scottish Academy, the Paris salon and in Rome and New York. She also had a solo show at the Brook Street Gallery in London in 1935. Williams awards included silver medals at the National Eisteddfod of Wales and the Franco-British exhibition and a bronze Santiago medal. Her private patrons included Queen Alexandra of Denmark, Queen Margherita of Italy while examples of her work in Britain include two bronze statuettes in Leeds and one in Liverpool. A typical piece, entitled 'The Queen of Dreams' is held by the Victoria and Albert Museum in London and reflects the influence of Alfred Drury. The piece is made of the zinc alloy, Spelter, which was often used as a cheaper alternative to bronze. The National Museum of Wales in Cardiff holds three pieces, The Chase, The Stick and Jeanette, whilst further examples are held by the National Library of Wales in Aberystwyth. In 1926 Williams was commissioned to create a bronze bust of Robert Owen which is on display at the museum dedicated to his life in Newtown, Powys.

Danilo Montaldi was born in Cremona in 1929. His father was a working class anarchist who was jailed for two years during the fascist regime. Following his release from prison he was placed under close surveillance by the fascist authorities and was unable to regain his position with the Italian railways, thus Montaldi's mother became the sole earner supporting the family. In 1944 Danilo Montaldi joined the Fronte della Giovent√π and participated in the Italian resistance movement. Following the overthrow of fascism, Montaldi was briefly a member of the Italian Communist Party, but left owing to their reformism and dogmatism. During the 1950s Montaldi developed links with a diverse range of individuals and organisations involved in far-left politics, such as Socialisme ou Barbarie (Socialism or Barbarity) in France and others in Germany, England and the United States. He also published his material in a broad range of journals such as Discussioni, Nuovi Argomenti, Ragionamenti, Opinione, and Passato e Presente. Between 1960 and 1964 Montaldi worked as a commissioning editor for the Milan publishing house founded by Giangiacomo Feltrinelli, of whom he was a close collaborator in those years. At the same time he began to publish his own books, most importantly Autobiografie della leggera (1961), which has since become a classic of its kind and remains in print to this day. The book collects the life stories of people at the very margins of society, dissidents, partisans, small-time criminals, prostitutes, as well as others, and narrates these in their own words and particular vernacular. During that same period he also opened an art-gallery in Cremona, exhibiting contemporary international artists, and was involved in the making of several documentaries, one of which he directed himself, La Mat√†na de Po (1959).Montaldi, Nikolas, La Mat√†na de Po, Kurumuny, 2018, https://kurumuny.it/fotogrammi/101-la-matana-de-po- nikolas-montaldi.html While continuing his collaboration with publishers such as Feltrinelli and Einaudi, over the next decade he focused primarily on his own research and publications, moving away also from political activism, until his premature death in 1975.

He was the Secretary for the Civil Service from 1990 to 1993. Biography Wiggham was born in 1937 and was graduated from the Oxford University in Modern Languages in 1961. From 1956 to 1958, he served in the military in Cyprus. He moved to Hong Kong in 1961 to learn Chinese. Besides that he spoke also French and German. He joined the Hong Kong government and worked in the Urban Services Department and New Territories Administration before he was Deputy Director of Commerce in 1970. He subsequently served as Principal Assistant Financial Secretary, Deputy Secretary for the New Territories. In the late 1970s, Wiggham was the head of the Home Affairs Information Branch in charge of overt propaganda for the colony. He was also the first chairman of the secret body called the Standing Committee On Pressure Groups (SCOPG) set up in 1978 which was responsible for coordinating government surveillance of any protest or campaigning group and of mounting counter-attacks. He was member of the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group dealing with the implementation of the Sino-British Joint Declaration over Hong Kong's sovereignty after 1997. He was appointed Secretary for General Duties in 1986. After the Tiananmen massacre in 1989, Wiggham publicly asked for major changes to draft Basic Law of Hong Kong. He requested the Chinese authorities to delay the promulgation of the Basic Law scheduled in 1990 and not to station the People's Liberation Army in future Hong Kong in August. However his suggestions were not adopted. In 1990, he was appointed Secretary for the Civil Service and official member of the Executive Council of Hong Kong. As Hong Kong's pro-democracy leader Martin Lee called out the British for the betrayal as it handed Hong Kong over to China and refused to introduce a democratic system in Hong Kong, Wiggham defended London by saying that it would be counterproductive to develop democratic institutions that China might dismantle. He was made Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1991. In 1993, Wiggham was appointed to the new position of the Hong Kong Commissioner for Economic and Trade Affairs, USA. His $12 million mansion in Washington however caused controversy in the Legislative Council of Hong Kong.

First proposed by United States Senator Bill Cassidy, the test was used throughout 2017 to frame political debate over health care reform, and Cassidy's use of it in September 2017 prompted comedian and late- night talk show host Jimmy Kimmel to publicly attack a Senate health care bill co-sponsored by Cassidy. The resulting public debate contributed to the failure of the Senate bill. Kimmel described the test as measuring whether, as a result of health care reform, a family would \\"be denied medical care, emergency or otherwise, because they can't afford it.\\" Background =Political efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act= The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, commonly called the \\"Affordable Care Act (ACA)\\" or \\"Obamacare\\", was enacted by the 111th United States Congress and signed into law by President Barack Obama in 2010. From 2011 to 2017, numerous attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act were made by Republicans opposed to the law, although none were successful before President Obama left office on January 20, 2017. On March 6, 2017, House Republicans announced a proposed replacement for the Affordable Care Act, the American Health Care Act (AHCA). The bill was withdrawn on March 24, 2017, after it was certain that the House would fail to garner enough votes to pass it. The result was in-fighting within the Republican Party.Chait, Jonathan. \\"Republicans Tearing Each Other to Pieces Over Trumpcare Debacle.\\" NYMag. April 6, 2017. April 6, 2017. However, deliberations on the American Health Care Act continued. =Birth of Jimmy Kimmel's son= William (\\"Billy\\") John Kimmel, the son of comedian and late-night talk show host Jimmy Kimmel, was born on April 21, 2017. The infant was born with a rare congenital heart defect, tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) with pulmonary atresia, which was first detected by a nurse who noticed his purplish appearance when he was three hours old. He underwent successful surgery at three days old. Kimmel's show, Jimmy Kimmel Live!, was cancelled during the entire week of April 24 without public explanation so Kimmel could spend time with his family. Creation of the Jimmy Kimmel test Jimmy Kimmel returned to the air on May 1, 2017. Kimmel chose to focus on his son's birth and health condition in his first episode back, inviting cardiac surgeon Dr. Mehmet Oz onto his show to explain his son's condition. During the show's opening monologue, Kimmel referenced Congress' efforts to repeal parts of the 2010 Affordable Care Act, and the possibility that repeal would lead to individuals with pre-existing medical conditions losing their health insurance: Kimmel's monologue received substantial attention in the news and on social media. Within 24 hours, video of the monologue was viewed over 14 million times and received over 230,000 reactions on Facebook. The video was retweeted by former President Obama and former Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. On May 4, the House of Representatives passed the AHCA (which would repeal portions of the ACA), sending the bill to the Senate. On Friday, May 5, United States Senator Bill Cassidy told CNN that he would decide whether he would support the AHCA based on whether it would \\"pass the Jimmy Kimmel test\\", which he described as measuring whether a child born with a pre-existing health condition would continue to receive health care regardless of cost. Following Cassidy's comments, Kimmel invited Cassidy onto his show to discuss the Senate version of the bill. Cassidy appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live! via satellite on May 8, 2017. While interviewing Cassidy, Kimmel attempted to establish a clearer definition of the \\"Jimmy Kimmel test\\". Cassidy responded that Kimmel was on the \\"right track\\", and then shifted the discussion to how to pay for insurance coverage. Use in political discourse The \\"Jimmy Kimmel test\\" was regularly mentioned by pundits and observers in 2017 during national conversation on health care. CNN analyst Chris Cillizza described the Jimmy Kimmel test as becoming \\"the health care fight's measuring stick.\\" In June 2017, the test was used to quickly frame debate over the Senate version of an Affordable Care Act repeal bill. Shortly after the bill was unveiled to the public by Senate leadership, reporters asked Cassidy if he believed the Senate repeal bill would pass the Jimmy Kimmel test. Cassidy replied that he believed that it would, but that he needed to read the full text of the bill. Multiple attempts to pass a Senate repeal bill in June and July 2017 failed. Senate Republicans faced a September 30, 2017 deadline in order to pass an Affordable Care Act repeal using reconciliation, a process that would permit the Senate to pass legislation with only 51 votes. On September 13, Cassidy and Sen. Lindsey Graham jointly proposed a new repeal bill, referred to as the Cassidy-Graham bill. The Cassidy-Graham proposal would create a waiver system allowing states to opt out of Affordable Care Act requirements, which could result in patients with pre-existing conditions being charged higher insurance premiums in those states. Discussion of the Cassidy-Graham bill quickly focused on whether the bill would pass the \\"Jimmy Kimmel test\\", with journalist and conservative commentator Jennifer Rubin writing on September 18 that Cassidy's bill \\"flunks his own Jimmy Kimmel test\\". Kimmel retweeted Rubin's editorial, which prompted Cassidy to publicly declare his belief that the Cassidy-Graham bill would \\"absolutely\\" pass the Jimmy Kimmel test. Cassidy's claim sparked a public debate between Kimmel and Cassidy over whether the Cassidy-Graham bill passed the Jimmy Kimmel test. On September 19, national news outlets reported that Jimmy Kimmel was preparing to comment on the Cassidy-Graham bill. During Jimmy Kimmel Live! later that evening, Kimmel openly attacked the Cassidy-Graham bill, and told his viewers that Cassidy \\"lied to [Kimmel's] face\\" when Cassidy promised Kimmel he wouldn't support a bill that could pass the Jimmy Kimmel test. In his monologue, Kimmel also joked that the Cassidy-Graham bill would pass a different Jimmy Kimmel test, in which your child could afford health care only if the father was named Jimmy Kimmel. Cassidy responded on September 20 during interviews with MSNBC and CNN, insisting the Cassidy-Graham bill would pass the Jimmy Kimmel test and claiming that Kimmel didn't understand the bill. Graham also attacked Kimmel, calling Kimmel's monologue \\"absolute garbage\\" and claiming that it was \\"inappropriate\\" for Kimmel to call Cassidy a liar. Kimmel responded in another on-air monologue on the evening of September 20, demonstrating his understanding of the bill by describing projected consequences such as a $243 billion reduction in federal funding, the total elimination of federal funding after 2026, and the removal of obligations by health insurers to pay for essential health benefits. On September 21, President Donald Trump defended the Cassidy-Graham bill and its impact on individuals with pre-existing health conditions, which was seen as a sign of the influence the Kimmel-Cassidy dispute was having on the healthcare debate. Vanity Fair described Trump's tweets as defending a \\"bill that failed the Jimmy Kimmel test.\\" Senator John McCain announced on September 22 that he would vote against the Cassidy-Graham bill, a move which was labeled likely to kill the bill and Republicans' ACA repeal efforts. CNN analyst Bill Carter noted that Cassidy had dragged Kimmel into the debate by creating the \\"Jimmy Kimmel test\\", and said that if McCain's action does kill Republicans' repeal effort, Kimmel's opposition should be acknowledged as a legitimate factor in their failure. In a nationwide poll conducted from September 22-25, 2017, voters were asked if they trusted Jimmy Kimmel or Republicans in Congress more on health care; 47% of respondents chose Kimmel while only 34% chose Republicans.

History =Prior to the 20th century= Between the fifth and ninth centuries AD, Slovaks controlled the eastern part of what is now considered Lower Austria, where many ethnic Slovaks still remain. From the 1880s the 1890s, around 230,000 Czechs and Slovaks emigrated to Austria proper, mainly for construction work and other menial labor jobs in the larger cities, particularly Vienna. At the turn of the century, an estimated 70,000 Slovak speakers in Austria, the vast majority being concentrated in Vienna and Marchfeld. Over the next 14 years, this number was decimated to 20,000. =Modern history= After the foundation of Czechoslovak Republic in 1918, many Slovaks emigrated back to the Slovakia region. In the 1923 census, only 5,000 Slovacophones declared their language. In 1976, as part of the Treaties of St. German and Brno and the Austrian Ethnic Groups Act, Slovaks were recognized as an autochthonous ethnicity, and freedom to use the Slovak language officially was permitted.

From 1947 until his retirement in 1974, he was the Bishop of Santorini and the Bishop of Syros. In addition, he was at various times the apostolic administrator of the Archdiocese of Athens, the Diocese of Crete, and the Apostolic Vicariate of Salonica. He died in 1980, aged 81.  Biography  Xenopoulos was born on 23 August 1898 in Syros, Greece. He joined the Society of Jesus and was ordained to the priesthood on 31 July 1926. On 22 February 1947, Xenopulos was appointed Bishop of Syros and Bishop of Santorini by Pope Pius XII. His episcopal consecration took place on 20 July 1947, with the Archbishop of Naxos, Tinos, Andros and Mykonos, Giovanni Francesco Filippucci, as principal consecrator, and Archbishop Antonios Grigorios Voutsinos, AA, and Bishop George Calavassy serving as co- consecrators. From 1950 to 1953, he was apostolic administrator of the Archdiocese of Athens and the Apostolic Vicariate of Salonica (now Thessaloniki). In 1952, he was additionally appointed apostolic administrator of the Diocese of Crete, a position he held until his death. From 1963 to 1965, Xenopulos participated in all four sessions of the Second Vatican Council. He was noted for addressing the concept of opening Communion under both kinds (e.g. bread and wine; the wine had previously been restricted to priests). Regarding the reception of wine through a common chalice, he raised concerns about health and women's lipstick, saying: > \\"Today the faithful, especially men, can be seen not to come forward to kiss > a sacred relic because, among other things, they fear their lips will be > colored by the red marks left by women on the glass of the reliquary. What > will happen now when so many hundreds and thousands of dyed lips of women or > perhaps hundreds of lips of men which are not proper and pure and sometimes > are infected with base sicknesses are applied to the rims of the chalice? > The result will be that many of the faithful will abstain from Communion.\\" Yves Congar, the French Dominican theologian, took notice of Xenopulos at the Council, writing in his book My Journey of the Council about Xenopulos, \\"the name is Greek, but his pronunciation of Latin was typically and entirely Italian.\\" During his tenure as bishop, Xenopulos consecrated a number of bishops. He was principal consecrator of Archbishop of Athens Marios Makrionitis in 1953, of Archbishop of Naxos, Tinos, Andros and Mykonos Io√°nnis Perr√≠s in 1961, and Bishop of Syros and Santorini Frangiskos Papamanolis, OFM Cap, in 1974. He was co-consecrator of Archbishop Marcus Sigala in 1947, Bishop Hyakinthos Gad in 1958, Archbishop Venediktos Printesis in 1959, Archbishop Antonios Varthalitis, AA, in 1962, and Archbishop Nikolaos Foskolos in 1973.

The title was revived in 1879 for a monthly magazine. A companion weekly, The Federal Australian ran from 1881; both failed in 1886, largely due to mismanagement. History The Victorian Review began as a weekly magazine for the voluntary militia and public servants, largely modelled on the Army and Navy Gazette. Although a Melbourne-based publication, it included much of direct interest to the South Australian militia. It shared offices with Melbourne Punch, and editor of both papers was James Smith (1820‚Äì1910). Rather than being operated by steam, the press was powered by water pressure from the Yan Yean reservoir. The first issue appeared in late December 1860, and the last issue for which a published notice is evident was that of March 1861, though newsagents' advertisements continued to mention the title into 1862. The title was revived as a monthly magazine in November 1879 by H. Mortimer Franklyn, an American huckster of dubious editorial and journalistic ability but considerable panache. He persuaded Herbert J. Henty (1834‚Äì1902), brother and attorney of wealthy Henry Henty (1833‚Äì1912) into bankrolling the enterprise. Contributors to the first number included Franklyn, Dr. Hearn, Murray Smith, David Blair, W. Jardine Smith, Marcus Clarke, James Hingston and James Smith (editor of the earlier \\"Review\\"). It also published serialized fiction by R. E. Francillon and others. The magazine published essays emanating from the Melbourne Shakespeare Society. Herbert J. Henty and H. Mortimer Franklyn lost a great deal of money (mostly Henry Henty's) in the enterprise. With its demise, The Adelaide University Shakespeare Society, which had also used the Review to publish many of its research papers, began its own occasional publication University Shakespeare Journal.

He was married to Linda Vance Mullendore and they had four children.E.C. Mullendore III - Find a Grave Gene Mullendore handed over management of the ranch to his son in 1960 because of his failing eyesight. E.C. ran up $12 million in debts on the ranch, in part due to their extravagant lifestyle. His wife moved to Tulsa, Oklahoma with their children and planned to divorce E.C.

Despite extensive investigation, no one was charged with the murder.E.C.

There was speculation of Mafia involvement in the death, reportedly because of debts that E.C. might have owed to them. E.C. had a $15 million life insurance policy on him, with his wife as the beneficiary. The family agreed to a $8 million settlement in 1971 after Linda Mullendore filed a lawsuit against the insurance company.In the Matter of Kathleen Boren Mullendore and Katsy Mullendore Mecom, Executrix of the Estate Of Eugene C.

Mullendore III? The Paris News September 28, 1980 According to private investigator Gary Glanz, in 2010 Chub Anderson told Glanz that he had killed E.C. in a fight after Anderson had helped deputies serve divorce papers on E.C. Anderson said that ranch hand Lonnie Joe Brown, his brother-in-law, had helped him stage the murder to look like intruders had killed E.C., including shooting Anderson in the arm. Chub Anderson died later that year.Four years after suspect's death, E.C.

It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1999. The building has been renovated into office space, and is known as the Firehouse Professional Building. History Before construction of this fire station, Muskegon's main fire station was located in the City Hall on Jefferson Street for nearly 50 years. In 1929, Muskegon commissioned architect Leo J. Heenan of Pontiac, Michigan to design this building, with the assistance of the local firm of VanderWest and Child. The station was constructed in 1929-30, and opened on October 9, 1930. The fire station was in use from when it opened until 2007, when the city constructed a replacement building. The city sold the building in 2012 to a developer, who renovated the building into office space. Description The Muskegon Central Fire Station is a two-story Art Deco building containing 28,000 square feet of space. It is constructed of blonde colored brick and Indiana limestone, and features five large entrance bays, each 11 feet wide, intended for fire trucks. The bays are separated by brick piers with limestone capitals. Decorative limestone panels are located above each entrance, depicting various fire-fighting symbols. The building has a flat roof, penetrated by a massive chimney. On the interior, the walls are finished with enameled brick and the floors with terrazzo. Oak wainscoting is located in some rooms and hallways. When it opened as a fire station, the building was touted as an innovative advance in fire-fighting, with an emphasis on easy access in the interior and flow-through mobility.

Representing the Soviet Union, he won bronze at the 1962 European Championships and placed fifth at the 1964 Summer Olympics. Biography Bakarinov was born in Moscow on 8 May 1938. During the early 1960s he was one of many top Soviet hammer throwers, together with Vasily Rudenkov, Romuald Klim, Yuriy Nikulin, Gennadiy Kondrashov, Anatoliy Samotsvetov and Aleksey Baltovskiy; he was ranked in the world's top 10 for five consecutive years from 1960 to 1964, but faced strong competition for spots on the national team. In 1962 he threw 66.57 m at the European Championships in Belgrade, winning bronze behind Hungary's Gyula Zsiv√≥tzky (who set a new European record of 69.64 m) and Baltovskiy. Bakarinov's best throw that year, 68.90 m, ranked him third on the world year list and first in the Soviet Union. Bakarinov won the Soviet championship once, in an upset in 1964; the favorites, Kondrashov and Klim, surprisingly only placed fifth and sixth. Bakarinov's winning throw, 69.55 m, was a new Soviet record and secured him a place on the Soviet team for the Olympics in Tokyo; his national record was, however, short-lived, as Klim broke it at a secondary tryout meeting two weeks later. Bakarinov placed fifth in the Olympic final, with a best throw of 66.72 m; Klim won with 69.74 m, breaking the Soviet record again. Bakarinov's results dropped slightly after 1964, though he remained in the world's top 20 on season bests for three more years; in 1965 he won bronze behind Zsiv√≥tzky and Kondrashov at the Universiade in Budapest. Bakarinov was short for a thrower, only 169 cm (5 ft in) tall, but had good speed and technique. After his throwing career he remained active in the sport as a coach, and served as the national team's throwing events coach for both the Soviet Union and Russia; he was replaced with Aleksey Malyukov in 2007 after disappointing performances from Russian throwers at the World Championships in Osaka and other major meets. Throwers personally coached by Bakarinov include Aleksey Zagorniy and Igor Astapkovich.

The main cascade, which is just under 20 metres high, falls into the Hirschbach stream in an ice age cirque in the valley of Simonsw√§lder Tal, where it empties into the Zweribach, a tributary of the Wild Gutach. Another smaller waterfall lies 300 metres upstream.  General  The Black Forest is well known for its numerous waterfalls. The reason for that is its high relief energy which is characterised by large changes in height over short distances which, is the topographical situation in the Simonsw√§lder Tal. On the western side of the valley which drops 300‚Äì700 metres, the heavy ice age glaciation has given rise to cirque walls. The Hirschbach and Zweribach streams which initially flow through gently rolling highlands descend steeply into these cirques, which are over 300 metres, in a series of cascades, of which only the Zweribach Waterfalls are nationally well known. The upper Hirschbach Fall drops over a small valley step formed by glacial activity in the high valley of the Gschwandersdobel on the southwestern corner of the protected Bannwald forest and nature reserve of Zweribach at a height of about 905 metres. It has a drop of just under five metres. The lower Hirschbach Fall, the main cascade, lies at a height of about 850 metres and drops just under 20 metres in four steps into the rugged cirque of Gro√ü-Kar. The Hirschbach Falls are only accessible on foot, either from the Simonswald village of Wildgutach or from the plateau of the Platte. Rock path between the Hirschbach Fall and the Zweribach Waterfalls  Tourism  The lower Hirschbach Fall is the goal of numerous walks from the Simonsw√§lder valley, the Hexenloch Mill or from St. M√§rgen, usually as part of a hike to the nearby Zweribach Waterfalls. Direct access is via the car park at the Zweribach Bridge / Hirschwinkelweg. From there, the waterfalls are well signposted: first the path runs steadily uphill, turns right after a left turn, heads past the Bruggerhof farm to the former farmstead of the burnt out Brunnenhof, of which the remains of the wall and chapel have survived. At this point, there is a campsite with a refuge hut. Above a fork in the path, keep to the left (the right branch leads to the Zweribach Waterfalls). The route then follows a narrow rock path, an overgrown scree slope and steps and walkways secured with ropes and railings, before reaching the waterfalls after walking for 600 metres steadily through the Bannwald forest. The marked trail then leads uphill in serpentines to a wide forest path between St. M√§rgen and Platte. The path continues, sometimes diverging to the right, and accompanying the Hirschbach valley on its orographically right-hand side to reach the upper fall.

Since 2001, Voss has taught at Stanford. Career  Voss's early research focused on both the Spanish colonization of the Americas, as well as gender and sexuality studies. In her work on the Spanish-colonial military settlement of El Presidio de San Francisco, Voss showed how the regulation of sex was an important part of Spanish colonization. In 2008, Voss was a recipient of the Ruth Benedict Prize, for her book, The Archaeology of Ethnogenesis: Race and Sexuality in Colonial San Francisco.

She also the Director of Archaeology for a multidisciplinary study, the Chinese Railroad Workers of North America Project. In her work on Chinatowns, Voss has critiqued a tendency toward Orientalism in previous scholarship, in which Chinese immigrants are seen as always engaged in the a conflict between a 'traditional' East and a 'modern' West. Questioning the stereotype of Chinatowns as insular and traditional, she has argued that this assumption has limited conclusions about these communities to questions of assimilation and acculturation. For Voss, the boundaries between Chinatowns and their surrounding communities have always been fluid, with close interactions between Chinese and non-Chinese residents. Voss has also argued for a transpacific archaeology which traces the global connections between Chinatowns in the Americas, other Overseas Chinese communities, and China.  Politics  In the wake of the 2016 U.S Presidential election, Voss established 'Archaeologists for a Just Future', a Facebook-based advocacy group \\"dedicated to activism that fights against specific threats to cultural resources, diversity, and civil liberties\\". The group currently has over 4700 members.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. It has been renovated, and currently houses 297 Clay Condominiums. History A Muskegon chapter of the YMCA first formed in 1890. However, the Panic of 1893 forced the group into insolvency, and it closed in 1897. However, in 1916, a group of civic leaders met with some local young men to re-organize a YMCA chapter. In 1918, the group moved into the city's old armory, and in 1923 the group moved into the newer and larger armory. In 1925, a fund-raising drive was launched with a goal of raising $70,000 to fund a new YMCA building. Muskegon residents wound up pledging $350,000 in donations. The Muskegon YMCA engaged the architectural firms of Foeller, Schoeber and Stevenson of Green Bay, Wisconsin and Edwin E. Vallentine of Muskegon, who worked cooperatively to design this building. Construction began in 1926, and the building opened in 1927. The building was heavily used, and by 1929, an addition was necessary. To meet the need, the building was mortgaged and a new $30,000 dormitory section was constructed. The onset of the Great Depression damaged the YMCA's ability to repay the loan, but at the same time emphasized the need in the community for the Y's services. The debt was retired in 1941, and the YMCA continued to utilize the building until the late 1970s, when the size of the Clay Avenue facility was no longer adequate. The organization constructed a new facility on the Muskegon waterfront and moved out of this building. The facility remained vacant until 1981, when plans were made to rehabilitate the structure. Description The Muskegon YMCA Building is a four-story building constructed of blond brick with limestone trim. The building exterior displays a collection of Art Deco styling overlaid with Late Gothic Revival ornamentation. The front facade is seven bays wide with balanced massing and window openings. The main entryway is in the center bay, framed by Gothic-inspired side piers and capped with a limestone block bearing the name of the building. The bays to each side contain rounded arch windows. A molded limestone bandcourse runs across the top of the first floor. The second and third floors are connected visually by limestone bandcourses and brick piers. The fourth floor is separated from the third by a limestone bandcourse. One side of the building also faces the street. This facade is visually tied to the main one through the use of similar rounded arch window assemblies at the first floor level and the use of limestone bandcourses The other side and rear facades are much simpler.

The film stars Charlotte Vega, Bill Milner, and Eugene Simon. It was shot on location at Loftus Hall in 2016 and premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival 2017.https://thefilmstage.com/reviews/tiff-review-the-lodgers-is-beautiful- gothic-horror-that-doesnt-resonate/ Synopsis 1920, rural Ireland. Anglo- Irish twins Rachel (Charlotte Vega) and Edward (Bill Milner) share an isolated existence in their crumbling family estate. Each nighttime, the property becomes the domain of sinister watery presences (\\"the lodgers\\") which enforce three rules upon the twins: they must be in bed by midnight; they may not permit an outsider past the threshold; if one attempts to escape, the life of the other is placed in jeopardy. They are reminded of these rules by way of a nursery rhyme: \\"Girl child, boy child, listen well. Be in bed by midnight's bell. Never let a stranger through your door. Never leave each other all alone. Good sister, good brother be, follow well these cautions three. Long as your blood be ours alone, we'll see you ever from below.\\"O'Malley, Brian. The Lodgers. Epic Pictures Group, 2017. A curse lies upon their family‚Äîa \\"stain\\" that is passed on from one generation to the next: each generation bears incestuous twins, breeding the next generation before taking their own lives by drowning. When Rachel and Edward's eighteenth birthday comes, Rachel wishes to leave with Edward, and in doing so hopefully leave the family curse behind. Edward, out of trauma due to witnessing his parents' suicide and the legacy they left him and his sister, has become a recluse and refuses to leave. Tensions rise when troubled war veteran Sean (Eugene Simon) returns to the nearby village. He is immediately drawn to the mysterious Rachel, who in turn sees in Sean a chance for freedom and so begins to break the rules set out by the lodgers. The consequences pull Rachel into a deadly confrontation with her brother‚Äîand with the curse that haunts them. Cast *Charlotte Vega as Rachel * David Bradley as Bermingham * Bill Milner as Edward * Eugene Simon as Sean * Moe Dunford as Dessie * Roisin Murphy as Kay * Deirdre O'Kane as Maura Release The Lodgers was chosen as part of the official selection for the Contemporary World Cinema category at the Toronto International Film Festival. This was the film's world premiere. The Lodgers was screened during the opening weekend of the festival on September 8 and 9. The director, writer, producer, and three lead cast were in attendance. It was released on March 9 in Italy where it made $258,508 on its opening weekend. Reception =Critical response= Noel Murray of The Los Angeles Times wrote, \\"An oppressively heavy gothic atmosphere squeezes most of the shocks out of the Irish ghost story The Lodgers. But for viewers who take it more as a moody, metaphorical historical drama than as an out-and-out horror film, there's a lot in this lush-looking, sensitively acted picture to recommend\\". On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 55% based on 42 reviews, with a weighted average rating of 5.68/10. The website's critics consensus reads, \\"Like many real-life long-term visitors, The Lodgers starts out with a modicum of mystery and excitement, but eventually overstays its welcome.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 52 out of 100, based on 8 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Jonathan Barken from Dread Central wrote: \\"Delicately crafted, The Lodgers is a richly woven tapestry of classically inspired gothic horror. Smart, scary, and undeniably beautiful, it will no doubt be considered one of the pinnacles of its genre.\\" Chris Alexander from ComingSoon.net wrote: \\"There hasn‚Äôt been a more effective, disturbing and sensorially pleasing film of this kind since Alejandro Amenabar‚Äôs The Others and, like that masterpiece, O‚ÄôMalley‚Äôs artful, lurid and meticulously orchestrated exercise in atmosphere, pretty misery and dread seeps deep under your skin. And it stays there. For keeps.\\" Justin Lowe from The Hollywood Reporter wrote: \\"finely attuned, atmospheric filmmaking more likely to catch the attention of art house aficionados than dedicated horror fans.\\" Noel Murray from Los Angeles Times wrote: \\"Until its suspenseful final 15 minutes, The Lodgers is frustratingly stingy with the scares, mostly limiting the spooky stuff to creaky noises and the recurring image of water dripping upward...(the film) isn't especially frightening, but as the story of people weighed down by their legacies, it is genuinely haunting.\\" Manohla Dargis from The New York Times said about the film: \\"Working with an uneven cast and an undercooked story, Mr. O‚ÄôMalley hits the horror beats just fine (slam, creak, squeak) without putting a sinister spin on the assorted strange doings. For all the genre exertions, none of this feels the least bit spooky, including the digital ghouls that float in and the cobwebs that look as if they originated in a spray can.\\" Katie Rife from The A.V. Club stated: \\"as a ghost story, The Lodgers is about as original as ‚Äúit was a dark and stormy night,‚Äù moldy old tropes can still have their charms.

While its own distinct brand, NXT UK is considered part of NXT, where Barthel also appears. Before coming to WWE, Barthel wrestled primarily in his native Germany under the ring name Axel Dieter Jr, most notably for Westside Xtreme Wrestling (wXw). He also wrestled in the United Kingdom for Progress Wrestling. In wXw, Dieter was a two-time World Tag Team Champion and a one- time Unified World Wrestling Champion.  Professional wrestling career  = Westside Xtreme Wrestling (2009‚Äì2017, 2018) = Dieter made his debut for Westside Xtreme Wrestling (wXw) in January 2009, losing to Dan Marshall. Dieter's next match in wXw wouldn't be until July 2012, when he and Da Mack defeated Walter and Michael Isotov. Dieter and Da Mack would go on to form a regular team, dubbing themselves Hot And Spicy. On 16 November 2013, they defeated The Autsiders (Walter and Robert Dreissker) to win the wXw World Tag Team Championship. Dieter and Da Mack made 7 successful defences of the championship, defeating the likes of The Sumerian Death Squad (Tommy End and Michael Dante), Forever Hooligans (Rocky Romero and Alex Koslov) and Kazuki Hashimoto and Ryuichi Kawakami. They eventually lost the championships to Matt Striker and Trent on 15 March 2014, but won the championships back in a rematch one day later. On 6 April 2014, Dieter received his first opportunity at the wXw Shotgun Championship, losing to Axel Tischer. After over a combined year as wXw World Tag Team Champions, Dieter and Da Mack were defeated by French Flavour (Lucas Di Leo and Peter Fischer) on 18 October 2014, bringing their reign to an end. On 22 November, he unsuccessfully challenged Walter for the wXw Unified World Wrestling Championship.

In late 2016, Dieter joined Ringkampf, and on 10 December, he defeated Marty Scurll to win the wXw Unified World Wrestling Title. Dieter held the championship until March 2017, when he was defeated by Jurn Simmons. In April, Dieter announced that he would be leaving wXw to pursue further opportunities outside of Germany. On 30 April, wXw held a farewell show for Dieter, titled \\"wXw Die Matte Ist Heilig: Farewell To Axel Dieter Jr\\".

The most powerful of these ancient kingdoms was Buganda, mainly inhabited by Baganda people: British invaders gave political power to its African customary chiefs, who gathered in a Council (Lukiko) and presided over by the king (Kabaka). They were also given land in order to gain their fidelity. However, the spread of schools caused a generation of young educated people to appear, working in the colonial administration but removed from real local power. Some of them, led by Baganda publicist Z.K. Sentongo, founded the Young Baganda Association to protest against customary chiefs‚Äô power: they are symptomatic of generational conflict in colonial Uganda. = Other claims = They also claimed for the end of Indian‚Äôs privilege on cotton ginning (many Indians had emigrated to Uganda during the construction of Mombasa-Lake Victoria railway) and for a better educational system, since they considered missionaries didn‚Äôt give them good enough an education.  Radicalisation and disappearance  Around 1921, their claims become harder both toward Indian and the chiefs.

The theme of the song is the fragility of happiness. The lyrics begin: \\"Tristeza n√£o tem fim. Felicidade sim\\" (\\"Sadness has no ending. Happiness does\\"). The lyrics compare happiness to a drop of dew, a feather floating in the wind, and the poor escaping their reality in the fantasies of Carnaval, emphasizing the transitory nature of each. The final stanzas reference the \\"namorada\\" (girlfriend/sweetheart) of the character singing the song, without touching directly on the theme of impermanence and loss. In the context of the film, however, these stanzas describe Orfeu's search for Euridice after her death (\\"√â como esta noite, passando, passando, em busca da madrugada...\\" (\\"It's like tonight, passing, passing, in search of dawn...\\"). Jobim and Vin√≠cius collaborated on several songs for the 1956 stage play, Orfeu da Concei√ß√£o, but French producer Sacha Gordine wanted new material for the film version. According to author Ruy Castro, \\"The duo wrote three songs, mostly over the telephone, given that Vinic√≠us was now working for the Itamaraty in Montevideo: 'A felicidade,' 'Frevo,' and 'O nosso amor.'\\" Agostinho dos Santos sings \\"A felicidade\\" during the opening credits of the movie, accompanied by Roberto Menescal on guitar. The film won the Palme d'Or at the 1959 Cannes Film Festival and the 1960 Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, bringing worldwide attention to Jobim, Moraes, and the bossa nova movement.

Marshall then served at Fort Vancouver, from January 1, 1867, to April, 1867, and at Fort Dalles, Oregon, from April, 1867 as a Member of Court of Inquiry and Court Martial, until September, 1867. From then he was awaiting orders, to December 3, 1867 when he went on leave of absence, to January, 1868 and was then awaiting orders, to November 23, 1868, when he resigned from the U.S. Army.  Later life  Following his resignation from the Army, Marshall took up farming in San Bernardino County, California in the vicinity of Cucamonga. He died at the age of 67, on October 8, 1891, at Monrovia, California.George Washington Cullum, Edward Singleton Holden, Biographical Register of the Officers and Graduates of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, N.Y., Supplement, Vol. IV: 1890‚Äì1900, H.

George Thomas Palmer (1836‚Äì1908)https://www.bonhams.com/auctions/11932/lot/85/ and Anna Frances Blair. His father, a former student at Peterhouse, Cambridge University.Alumni Cantabrigienses: A Biographical List of All Known Students ..., Volume 2 edited by John Venn was vicar of Linwood in Lincolnshire from 1861 to 1869 who in 1863 is recorded as a member of the Lincoln Diocesan Architectural SocietyReports and papers of the architectural and archaeological societies By Associated Architectural Societies, 1863, p.vi and later became an honorary canon of Rochester Cathedral (1890 to 1908) in Kent.Rasen Horse Artist, Market Rasen Mail, 27 October 2006' His older brother Charles Jasper was also an ordained minister. Lynwood Palmer's childhood was spent in London where his father took the living at St.James, Notting Hill Gate and from 1875 at St Mary's, Stoke Newington.He was educated at King's College School, and was destined by his father for a career in Law or in the Foreign Office. Palmer was not interested in such a course preferring horses and art at which he showed aptitude. Early career In 1884, aged 17, Palmer left school without his parents blessing and emigrated to Canada where he worked with horses on cattle ranches, as a hansom cab master and show jumper. His involvement in horse shows in Toronto, and from 1892 in New York provided him with contacts and developed his skill in sketching horses. According to Lyllyan Baldwin (1933)The author was Palmer's secretary. : \\"The first public success in his artistic career was perhaps that which came through the illustrations of an American catalogue of a sale of horses. The drawings received great praise and resulted in a number of commissions\\".Baldwin, Lyllyan, Lynwood Palmer ‚Äì Painter of Horses, Apollo, Vol.17, No:101, May 1933, pp.175‚Äì6 Palmer spent some years in the 1890s supplementing his artistic income in employment as a cab master. At this time Palmer showed great interest in carriage driving which lead to commissions from Alfred Vanderbilt and Ambrose Clark and an increasing number of commissions for private clients and periodicals that included The American Carriage Monthly (1893)American carriage Monthly, 25 March 1893. Although he had no formal training he developed an affinity for drawing and painting horses of all types from hunting horses to carriage horses and race horses. He remained in North America for 11 years and found there several patrons who admired his style of painting and purchased his works, including Marshall Field I (1834‚Äì1906), the American entrepreneur and founder of Marshall Field and Company, the Chicago-based department stores.Toledo Club Newsletter, September 2011, p.19 The Toledo Club Art Collection: \\"his list of wealthy American clients included the Vanderbilts and Marshall Field\\" In 1895 Palmer returned to Europe with a nucleus of work to his credit, mostly from anglophile Americans A short stay followed with a relative in Co. Offaly where he garnered new contacts and future patrons that included T. K. Laidlaw before he and his wife Lydia returned to England where they eventually settled in 1911 at the 16th Century White House at Sutton near Heston, Middlesex. A confident, well dressed man he was at home with all types of horses and self possessed enough to move smoothly between his aristocratic clientele. He prospered attributing his success to clients that included: the Earl of Derby, Lord Lonsdale, the Duke of Portland and most importantly Edward VII for whom he painted his Derby Stakes winner Minoru in 1909. It established him as a major painter of racehorses, a relatively small field that included his friend Alfred Munnings, Emile Adam, Lionel Edwards and Raoul Millais. Palmer created a niche for himself and his style and subject matter rarely deviated for the remainder of his career. Knowledge of Horses Palmer had a deserved reputation for his ability to treat lame horses, no doubt learnt as a result of his training as a cab master. In 1911 the Home Secretary, Reginald Mckenna, concerned at the injury rate of police horses on city cobbles asked Palmer to provide advice on the treatment of horses hooves.Lynwood Palmer, Feet And Shoeing In My Opinion by W.E. Lyon, 1928 Subsequently, some trainers would seek Palmer's advice. In his latter years he frequented Hounslow Barracks, the regimental mess of the 17/21 Lancers where his advice was sought and given.Letter to The British Racehorse 1977 Palmer was also a judge at the International Horse Show at Olympia in 1921 but had been involved in its organisation since its inception in 1907. He designed a series of publicity postcards in pre war years. As an asthmatic Palmer was deemed not fit for military service during World War I, offering his skills for the service of the nation by managing a 750 horse stud for the Royal Mail. Racehorse paintings Palmer's notoriety as an equine artist is largely based on his paintings of racehorses for an aristocratic, wealthy clientele that were united by wealth and interests. Palmer and Munnings became the preferred choice of this set when it came to painting their equine champions. Most of the commissions were for racehorses on the flat although Palmer painted seven winners of The Grand National. Palmer painted winners of all the English and Irish classics and many Group winners beside. These included champion horses such as: the Earl Of Derby's Swynford, winner of the Eclipse Stakes and the St Leger, Tranquil, a success in the fillies classic, the 1,000 Guineas in 1923 and Hyperion, painted in 1933 after the colt won both the Derby and St Leger, Aboyeur, winner of the Suffragette Derby in 1913, Royal Lancer, owned by Earl Lonsdale and winner of the St Leger in 1922, Lord Woolavington's Derby winner Coronach, the undefeated The Tetrarch owned by Sir Hugh McCalmont and voted by the British National Horseracing Museum as the best English trained two-year old of the 20th Century, Gainsborough who in 1918 won the English Triple Crown and the Ascot Gold Cup for Lady Douglas, the first woman to own a classics winner and the filly Golden Corn, winner of the July Cup in 1923 and owned by Marshall Field III grandson of Palmer's early patron. The style is always the same with non-specific, featureless backgrounds so that the eye always focuses on the horse. Carriage driving paintings Palmer had a passion for carriage driving and was frequently seen driving his \\"beautifully maintained\\" coach and Four-in-hand. Some of his earliest paintings are of carriage driving in the United States and Canada. One of Palmer's first major commissions for August Belmont II , now at The Schwarz Gallery in Philadelphia features a four-in- hand horse carriage being driven along Ocean Drive, Newport, Rhode Island. Another major client Alfred Vanderbilt had moved to England by 1904 where he purchased fifty trotting horses, together with a team of carrige greys and two carriages which he based near Palmer at Kingsbury. Palmer painted at least four commissions for Vanderbilt before the latter returned to the United States in 1914.Hugh McCausland Lynwood Palmer as a painter of the Road The Horse, Michaelmas 1943 p.10-13 Other carriage themed paintings for Ambrose Clark and Lady Warwick were commissioned. One of his most important patrons of the post War years was Lord Woolavington, a collector of English sporting paintings for whom Palmer produced two paintings of carriage horses (and several racehorses besides). Technique Lynwood Palmer possessed a retentive visual memory for the appearance of a horse. Invariably he made sketches from life, out of doors, if possible. He worked quickly and quietly trying to capture the character of the horse. In 1927 he explained his work as follows: :\\"The secret of painting race-horses lies in quickness. Their movements are so alert, they are so full of nervous energy, that the artist has to have a hand like a streak of lightning to catch the pose while it lasts\\". His paintings of race horses, nearly all on commission, are in oil on canvas. The background is usually non -specific and the horse is centre stage. Palmer's knowledge of the anatomy of a horse was based on practical knowledge but he had studied George Stubbs Anatomy of a Horse in detail according to one of his pupils.Fountain, Robert & Kennedy, Neil, Lynwood Palmer, 1868‚Äì1941, Equestrian Artist, Whip and Horseman, Chapter 11 on Technique His use of colour was limited and he did not block applying colours directly to the canvas to produce the iridescent sheen which are a feature of his paintings. Palmer's figures are often one dimensional.Algernon Talmage an impressionist painter of the period is responsible for some of the figures in these paintings. In 1925 Lynwood Palmer was painted by Algernon Talmage R.A. seated astride a carriage. The painting is in private hands. He was primarily interested in making a true likeness of the horse against a harmonious background. He did not show any interest in wider fields staying firmly in the English tradition of earlier racehorse artists such as: Harry Hall, John Frederick Herring Sr. and his son John Frederick Herring Jr. Once his style was established it did not change. His success as an artist was largely derived through his ability to infuse into his expert draughtsmanship his thorough and first-hand understanding of the characteristics of the animals he was painting. Personal life and character He was \\"always elegantly dressed, and with impeccable manners, he was hugely popular, especially, it was rumoured, with the wives of some of his patrons\\". His appearance was that of a sporting gentlemen of an earlier epoch. Palmer was quiet, gentlemanly, thoughtful, amusing and respectful. He received a serious injury when kicked by one of his equine subjects close to the heart, which affected him considerably in his later years. In 1895 whilst residing in the United States he met and married Lydia Frohawk of Dereham, Norfolk, the daughter of a local landowner. Her brother was Frederick William Frohawk (1861‚Äì1946),an established zoological artist and lepidopterist. The marriage lasted until his death at Heston on 22 June 1941, his wife dying in 1942 In his will Palmer left personal possessions including his riding crop and glasses to his housekeeper Mary Cox, which items were sold at auction by Sotheby's on 1 November 2006. His long standing friend Hugh McCausland was left the bulk of his estate. Palmer's studio later became a dance hall and his house was demolished in 1964.http://hestonresidentsassociation.org/lynwood-palmer-and- the-master-robert , Heston Residents Association, Lynwood Palmer and the Master Robert Public House.

It was bought by the public, following threats to the beauty spots of Beachy Head and the surrounding farmland, which led to a public campaign and Act of Parliament in 1926. It is currently owned and managed, on behalf of the public, by Eastbourne Borough Council.http://www.eastbourne.gov.uk/_resources/assets/inline/full/0/206994.pdf Land Use 1,199 hectares (2,963 acres) is farmed, while 490 hectares (1,211 acres) is open public access land, including the land around the internationally famed Beachy Head beauty spot and Belle Tout Lighthouse. The farmland is divided into four farms: Bullock Down Farm, Chalk Farm, Black Robin Farm and Cornish Farm. The farmers pay rent to the people of Eastbourne through Eastbourne Borough Council.http://www.eastbourne.gov.uk/residents/leisure-and-events/parks/trees- and-downland/downland/downland-working-farms-proposal/?entryid108=253357 Chalk Farm includes a hotel and learning disabilities centre. The Centre provides: \\"realistic training and work experience within the setting of a fully functioning hotel... for adults with learning disabilities, when they leave full-time education [and] for adults with learning disabilities of any working age.\\" The ultimate aim of the centre is \\"to help students to increase their independent living skills as well as their ability to enter the real job market\\". The hotel was once a Priory, reportedly connected with The Benedictine Abbey of Grestein and once owned by Robert de Norton, the first Norman Lord of Pevensey and half-brother of William the Conqueror. 1926 Act of Parliament The Eastbourne Corporation Act of 1926 was passed in both Houses of Parliament. The new law empowered the local authority in the area of the Eastbourne Downland Estate, to increase local taxation to fund a compulsory purchase of the land comprising the Estate. The purchase was completed in 1929, with tax money being transferred to two major local aristocratic landowning families for the land, sold at market rates. The amount paid was ¬£91,291, 1s, 7d.http://www.eastbourne.gov.uk/residents/leisure-and-events/parks/trees-and- downland/downland/downs/ =Select Committee Hearing= Here are notable extracts from the detailed minutes of evidence given before a Select Committee of the House of Lords in 1926: Mr J Abady, Learned Counsel for Eastbourne Corporation, giving evidence: \\"The Corporation's desire, and I do not know that anybody questions it, is to preserve that beauty spot, to preserve it in its existing condition without being fenced in or ploughed up or built upon or dealt with in any way which would affect the general amenities. I do not think there is any question about that. The land in question consists of 4,100 acres. We want to ensure that the character of the land is preserved as it is at present.\\" Examination of the Mayor, Alderman Charles Knight, before the same Select Committee: \\"It is the deliberate intention of the Corporation, in promoting this clause, to secure the public the free and open use of the Downs in perpetuity?\\" The Mayor replied: \\"Absolutely.\\" 2017 protests In 2017, hundreds of concerned Eastbourne residents campaigned and marched for the continued public ownership of the Estate. Public pressure led to a policy change by Eastbourne Borough Council, cancelling the planned sale of the 4 farms within the Estate. =Lobbying against the sale= On 30 January 2017, Dr Tony Whitbread, Chair of the South Downs Network, an \\"independent, voluntary network of conservation, environmental and community organisations with an interest in the South Downs\\", published an open letter on the Network's behalf, addressed to David Tutt of Eastbourne Borough Council: \\"We... urge you to stop the proposed sale... comprising three-quarters of the Eastbourne Downland Estate. This land is an invaluable public asset for the people of Eastbourne, for the local area and visitors from further afield. It has great value for its rich natural capital, its biodiversity and cultural heritage, to public amenity and the town‚Äôs drinking water supply. It is vital that ownership and management rest with... the democratic, publicly accountable local authority for Eastbourne... complying with the words and spirit of the 1926 Eastbourne Corporation Act. We strongly recommend that the Council rethinks its policy, looks more closely at the range of ecosystem services that the Eastbourne Downland generates and sets out a renewed vision for its Downs in harmony with its people. This should respect the fact that the land is held in trust by the Council on behalf of the people of Eastbourne. If you take this approach we will be more than happy to work with you, in partnership, to maximise the benefits from public land ownership; you can be assured that this would be a most popular move, applauded by the people of Eastbourne.\\" =U-turn on sale of Estate farms= A new policy announcement was made at the start of March 2017, with the sale of the Downland Estate said to be \\"off the table\\". =Responses to March 2017 announcement= Margaret Paren, the Chair of the South Downs National Park Authority said on 7 March 2017: \\"We believe that this is a good decision for the farmers, for the environment, for the people of Eastbourne and for the National Park. The SDNPA will seek to work in partnership with... stakeholders to improve Eastbourne‚Äôs gateway to the National Park and to create an internationally respected exemplar of chalk grassland restoration. This marks the beginning of an exciting new chapter for this precious downland.\\" Caroline Ansell MP said on 8 March 2017: \\"The argument around protection of the land had not been won and the consultation with local people was deeply flawed.\\" Conservation projects and standards =Sites of Special Scientific Interest= There are several designated Sites of Special Scientific Interest within the Eastbourne Downland Estate.http://www.eastbourne.gov.uk/residents/leisure-and-events/parks/trees- and-downland/downland/management/ They include Willingdon Down, designated in 1986. =Drinking Water= The chalk aquifer underneath the Downland Estate is part of a larger natural water supply, that provides drinking water for 700,000 in the region. The Eastbourne Downland Estate falls into a government- designated Nitrate Vulnerable Zone.http://www.eastbourne.gov.uk/residents/leisure-and-events/parks/trees- and-downland/downland/downland-working-farms-proposal/?entryid108=253578 =National Park= On 12 November 2009, the South Downs National Park was created, including the Eastbourne Downland Estate. The Park is managed by the South Downs National Park Authority. =Heritage Coast= The Countryside Commission (predecessor to Natural England), designated the coastal part of the Estate the country's first ever stretch of Heritage Coast. This designation is for coast that \\"is of particular natural beauty or importance and is managed to preserve this largely undeveloped beauty\\". =Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty= The Eastbourne Downland Estate was included in the Sussex Downs Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB), designated by the Countryside Commission on 22 June 1965. =Marine Conservation Zone= The area west of Beachy Head was designated as an inshore marine conservation zone on 21 November 2013, titled Beachy Head West. There have been calls from wildlife groups, politicians and local fishermen to create a Beachy Head East zone. Natural England and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee has identified this area as being at high risk of damage and degradation due to the presence of sensitive habitats and species. =Plant Important Area= The Estate is home to several designated Plant Important Areas, in recognition of the variety and ecological value of plant life in the area. At a marine level, these include areas with rich populations of algae. =Countryside Stewardship Agreements= As part of the Rural Development Programme for England, which replaced the Countryside Stewardship Scheme in 2014, funds are transferred from central government to help maintain and improve the Estate. =Regionally Important Geomorphological Site= The Estate is also a Regionally Important Geological Site (RIGS), a designation given for its value to Earth Science and earth heritage. Archaeological sites The estate contains 32 separately designated Scheduled Ancient Monuments (SAMs). The four farms contain a large proportion of those SAMs including the most important of all: the Combe Hill Neolithic Causewayed Camp, as well as the much-researched Bullock Down prehistoric field system, the Eastdean Down field system, and many prehistoric burial barrows. =Neolithic era= Remains of flint flakes, hand tools and metal making have been found and studied on the areas now known as Bullock Down and Cornish Farms. Flints were selected to make Neolithic axes between 8500 and 4000BCE. There was a flint mine on Wilmington Hill.http://www.beachyheadramblers.com/Beachy%20Head%20Landform_Part1.pdf There are three ‚Äòsettlement‚Äô sites and a causewayed enclosure at Combe Hill (identified by Musson in 1950). Most of the sites are artefacts find-spots and although one cremation site (Drewett 1982) and two inhumations (Ray 1909) are recorded.Prehistoric and medieval environment of Old Town, Eastbourne, Sussex Archaeology Collections 147 (2007), accessed on 12 May 2017 =Roman era: Beachy Head Lady= A skeleton was discovered during archaeological work in 1953. It has been dated as belonging to a person who lived in the Roman era, in approximately 245 AD. During a 2014 heritage project, it was further discovered that the skeleton had genetic heritage from sub-Saharan Africa. Jo Seaman, heritage officer at Eastbourne Borough Council was quoted as reporting: \\"We know this lady was around 30 years old [when she died], grew up in the vicinity of what is now East Sussex, ate a good diet of fish and vegetables, her bones were without disease and her teeth were in good condition.\\" Management As of 2016, the management of the Eastbourne Downland Estate is the overall responsibility of Eastbourne Borough Council. The Council delegate day-to-day responsibility to Strutt & Parker (part of Christie's group), who act as land management agents, and to the four working farmers for various processes of land management work. =The Downland Management Plan and the Eastbourne Downland Forum= Eastbourne Borough Council publish an Eastbourne Downland Management Plan periodically, intended as a summary of goals and strategies for land management of the Estate. According to the Eastbourne Downland Management Plan 2015-22, Appendix A, authored by Eastbourne Borough Council on 8 May 2015, the management of the Estate is also \\"influenced\\" by the Eastbourne Downland Forum. The Forum was created in the 1990s, as a means for stakeholders to meet and advise on management of the Estate.Eastbourne Downland Management Plan 2015-22, Eastbourne Borough Council (2015), accessed on 12 May 2017 Neither minutes of its meetings, nor records of those in attendance, are published. There is no record of the Eastbourne Downland Forum influencing the Downland management, or even issuing a recommendation or guidance. =Downland Ranger Service= For most of the 20th Century frontline Estate management was delegated to a Downland Ranger Service. British Path√© News filmed the Downland Ranger for an international newsreel in 1949. In the item, Constable Henry Poole and his horse Thomas are shown to leave a stable at a Downs Police Station operated by Eastbourne County Borough Police. He is depicted later, variously: warning children not to sit on the edge of cliffs at Beachy Head; rounding up cattle; saving the lives of a ewe and a pigeon; putting out a small fire; receiving a note from a shepherd. In the late 1990s, \\"practical management of the land [was] carried out by the Council's Downland Ranger Service and by various contractors who [were] supervised by the Ranger Service. The Council also [had] an Arboriculturist Officer to supervise the management of the 250 acres of deciduous woodland mostly on the Eastbourne Downland eastern escarpment.\\" The Downland Ranger Service was closed in 2008 by Eastbourne Borough Council. The Council argued that the South Downs National Park Authority would serve as a replacement. The Authority was not founded until 2009 and replacement Eastbourne Downland Ranger posts were not created, as of 2016.

Located at 126 East 23rd Street, in Manhattan, the organization was founded by Jane Cunningham Croly in Manhattan in November 1889, incorporated in 1919, and dissolved on 8 March 1980. History The Woman's Press Club of New York City was founded by Croly on November 19, 1889, in New York City, with 40 women from the city's papers. The mission of the club, according to its constitution, was to gain advantages for women arising from unity, fellowship, and co-operation with those engaged in similar pursuits. To be mutually helpful is the requirement among its members. The organization focused on civic projects, journalism scholarships, lectures, literary activities, and social activities for its membership. The Women's Press Club was incorporated in New York in 1919, with Kate M. Bostwick, Julia Linthicum, Cynthia M. Westover, Haryot H. Cahoon and Anna Warren Story trustees. The organization disbanded in 1980. The minutes, reports, press books, scrapbooks, correspondence, lists, financial records, and printed materials of the Woman's Press Club of New York City are held by Columbia University Libraries. Membership Not all of the club members belonged to the metropolitan press, but all of them had attained some recognition in the field of literature, or a similar profession, which entitled them to membership. Croly, the founder, served as president until her death in 1901. Sara Jane Lippincott was the club's first vice-president. Beginning with 40 women in 1889, membership increased to over 100 by 1893. Prominent members in the early years of the club were Eliza Archard Conner, of the American Press Association, Eleanor Maria Easterbrook Ames (pseud. Eleanor Kirk), who published a sheet entitled Eleanor Kirk's Ideas, Miss E. G. Gordon of the New York World, Florence Finch Kelly of The San Francisco Examiner, Annie Kershaw DeMontaigue (pseud. Countess Annie de Montaigu), Elita Proctor Otis, Kate M. Bostwick of the Brooklyn Eagle, Hester Martha Poole, Mrs. Jennie Holtzmeyer Posenfeld, wife of Sydney Rosenfeld, Mary Foot Seymour, editor of The Business Woman's Journal, Miriam Leslie, Eliza J. Nicholson of the New Orleans Picayune, and Emma Beckwith, Brooklyn's former candidate for mayor. The executive committee was composed of Bostwick, Connor, Florence Carpenter Ives, and Calrica La Favre. Members wore a purple and gold circlet. Meetings A Valentine's menu at Hotel Astor in 1906 The regular meetings of the club occurred on the second and last Saturdays of each month, except during the months of July, August, and September. The first of these meetings was for business, and the second for social and literary purposes. The rooms were open, however, at any time for the use of the club members, such as for a social chat, or to prepare an article for the press. Headquarters The club was located at 126 East 23rd Street, in Manhattan. Tables and light camp chairs necessary for the regular meetings were the first things furnished. Then members contributed furniture, china, and silver. The suite consisted of four apartments and a bathroom. The walls of the large front room, which served as parlor, were of terra cotta with a frieze having in it a tracery of deeper tones. The ceiling was of cream white with tints of dull pink and green, and the floor of parquetry in dark and light woods. A cherry mantel with tiling of tawny brown was on one side of the room, and against the opposite wall was the president's chair with a long oak table in front of it. This chair was of the Gothic style, in black walnut with leather upholstering, and was purchased with a US$50 check sent for the purpose by Leslie. Over it hung an etching by Kruseman Van Etten, sent by Otis. The table was the gift of the executive committee. The Dagestan rug which lay in front of the table was sent by another member, a pupil of St. Gondins, who also contributed some hand-painted china. Next to the chimney was a bookcase and tea tables. In the large back room the walls were grayish blue, with a frieze of old gold and gilt, while the mantel was of oak with olive tiling. A large Japanese screen was the gift of Croly, and the china cups and saucers in the cupboard were contributions from various members. A Persian cup and two Dresden cups and saucers were from Mrs. Fleming, wife of a prominent New York physician, while the antique chair nearby was the gift of Kate Bostwick. A solid silver tea urn was purchased by the club.

Rumors surrounded the killing of Ball-Bey as to whether he was unarmed when shot by police, and crowds gathered in the street to express anger at the killing. The demonstrators eventually turned violent as the day wore on, and civil unrest lasted into the night. The St. Louis Circuit Attorney's office conducted a subsequent investigation and determined that the evidence did not support criminal charges against the two officers involved. Shooting On the morning of August 19, 2015, at least 15 police officers and ATF agentsJoel Currier, St. Louis police officers won't be prosecuted in shooting of Mansur Ball-Bey last year, St. Louis Post-Dispatch (June 3, 2016). arrived at Ball-Bey's aunt's home in the Fountain Park neighborhood of St. Louis to execute a search warrant. As police prepared to enter the home, Ball- Bey and one other man ran from the house. Police said that Ball-Bey had pointed a handgun with extended ammunition magazine at them, prompting them to open fire. After police fired their weapons, Ball-Bey was struck in the back and killed. Police said that crack cocaine were recovered from the scene. Police also said that they recovered two stolen firearms at the scene, specifically .40-caliber handguns. No usable DNA evidence was recovered from the guns, which is not unusual. However, social media postings by Ball-Bey showed me holding a gun matching the guns found on the scene. Ball-Bey had no criminal history, but \\"photos found on his cellphone and YouTube videos show him wearing T-shirts naming a gang in St. Louis.\\" One witness, an off-duty officer \\"said he saw Ball-Bey running with a gun in his hand and his arm extended before the witness ducked behind a parked truck. The witness said he could hear the shooting but could not see it but reported seeing Ball-Bey toss a gun near a trash bin afterward.\\" The gun was loaded. Ball-Bey's family disputed the police claim, claiming that the gun had been planted on Ball-Bey by police. The family's attorney claimed Ball-Bey was running from police when shot, explaining the bullet wound to the back. In contrast, the attorney for the two officers stated that \\"My client fired in defense of his partner ... when (Ball-Bey) turns toward (one officer) with a gun that has an extended clip with a 30-round magazine, the policemen have no choice but to pull the trigger.\\" Protest and civil unrest in immediate aftermath In the afternoon of the same day, angry residents took to the streets of Fountain Park to express outrage at the killing of Ball-Bey. Police responded with riot officers, and protests soon took a turn for the worse as protesters began throwing bricks, rocks and bottles at the police, who responded with tear gas. According to police, over the course of the night, bricks and bottles were thrown at officers, and police responded with tear gas to disperse crowds. The police chief reported nine arrests, the torching of one car, and several reports of attempted robbery. St. Louis Alderman Antonio French reported that the disordered was partially fueled by misinformation, including false reports that Ball-Bey was 13 years old. The day following the shooting, about 200 people attended a vigil in St. Louis in protest of the killing; unlike the events of the previous night, the vigil was peaceful. =Lawsuit over police response to protests= In 2017, the American Civil Liberties Union of Missouri (ACLU) filed a lawsuit over the police handling of protests following the shooting of Ball-Bey. The ACLU of Missouri alleges that the police deployed tear gas indiscriminately and without warning.Sarah Fenske, ACLU Sues St. Louis Over Treatment of Mansur Ball-Bey Protesters, Riverfront Times (September 29, 2017).ACLU sues St. Louis police over handling of 2015 protest, Associated Press (September 29, 2017). Investigation A few days after the shooting, St. Louis Circuit Attorney Jennifer Joyce announced that her office would conduct an investigation. In June 2016, the circuit attorney office's report was made public, and Joyce announced that no charges would be filed against the two officers who shot Ball-Bey. Joyce said that more than two dozen people were interviewed during the investigation. She stated that eyewitness accounts and other evidence showed that it could not be proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the officers did not act in self-defense. Joyce did, however, concluded that \\"there were several factors in the execution of this search warrant that we believe need to be reviewed and addressed\\" by the St. Louis police department. Specifically, Joyce criticized the lack of any surveillance conducted on the rear of the building before beginning the search.

Aaron asks Ethan to get him some more in time for his visit later, but Ethan tells him he cannot. He also reveals that Jason is the only dealer on the wing.

Jason Jason, played by Samuel Edward-Cook, made his first appearance on 23 February 2017. Jason is an inmate at HMP Hotten, who subjects Aaron Dingle (Danny Miller) to homophobic abuse. Edward-Cook accepted the role as he knew it would be challenging. He said, \\"it wasn't too daunting or out of my comfort zone as characters like Jason are attractive because they're so removed from me as a person. It was a really exciting opportunity.\\" The actor was aware that his character was going to be hated, and found support from the cast and crew during his \\"heavier scenes\\" where Jason was violent and homophobic. Edward-Cook called Jason a \\"twisted, angry young man\\" and thought it was left to the viewers to guess the reason why. However, he added that if Jason returned, it would be good to explore his backstory. Lindsay branded Jason a \\"vicious top dog\\" and \\"an unsavoury character who has certainly stirred up a reaction among fans.\\" Jason meets Aaron Dingle on his first day at HMP Hotten. Jason is impressed that Aaron belongs to the Dingle family and asks about his uncle Cain Dingle (Jeff Hordley). Jason targets a gay inmate and shouts homophobic abuse at him, but Aaron stands up for him.

She found the filming schedule to be \\"quite terrifying\\". She said she enjoyed playing Nell, adding \\"It's always fun to play someone who is quite different from you in real life, and Nell is very much that. I'm much more grounded and more confident than her!\\" Nell was introduced as a new friend for Jai Sharma (Chris Bisson). When Jai meets Nell at Narcotics Anonymous, she reminds him of his deceased girlfriend Holly Barton (Sophie Powles) and becomes determined to help her.

When Nell notices Jai's daughter, Eliza (Kyrena Robinson), has been left alone in Megan Macey's (Gaynor Faye) car, she takes Eliza and tries to find Jai at the factory. Nell later tells Jai that her own daughter, Rosie, was taken away by Social Services and did not want the same thing to happen to Eliza, showing a photo of her. Jai and Nell start dating and Nell lives in his house. Jai starts to wonder if they are moving too fast and suggests that she moves out, but changes his mind after he sees her cutting herself. Nell plans to meet the social worker, however she gets the news that Rosie has died following a heart condition, devastating her. She later attends the funeral but cannot face Rosie's adoptive parents. She then tells Jai that she is pregnant with his baby, after he helps her get a job in photography and rebuild her life. Jai goes to a department store and discovers that Nell was lying about Rosie existing after finding out that the photo was of a baby model in picture frames. Jai then goes through Nell's drawers and discovers articles of Holly and a book about a girl called Rosie. He confronts Nell at the village hall, where Nell reveals that she is not pregnant and tries to make Jai see that they can work as a couple but he pushes her on into a table and reveals to Megan and Jai that she has lied to all of them. Nell is given a hostile response and goes to Moira's house, making her report Jai for assault. Nell overdoses on heroin to make sure she can stay with Moira. However, Jai arrives and tells Moira that Nell has lied about being drug addict and targets people who have lost a loved one to drug addiction to have an effect on their lives.

The venue closed in 2014, and Time Out described the venue as \\"semi-legendary\\", in its round-up of Brighton's live music scene that year. In 2015, Gigwise included the club in their list of the UK's Greatest Lost Venues. History The Blind Tiger Club was located at 52-54 Grand Parade, opposite the University of Brighton Faculty of Arts and close to the Royal Pavilion. The premises had been licensed for drinking and entertainment since they were originally built in the mid-1800s. From its creation and for most of the 20th Century the premises traded as 'The Norfolk Arms'. In the 1990s, the venue was renamed 'Hector's House' after the children's television show Hector's House which screened on the BBC from 1965 to 1970. As 'Hector's House', the performance of live music and DJs became more important to the licensed premises, with the space gaining a reputation as \\"a showcase for up and coming bands\\" and one of Brighton's key small live music venues, regularly taking part in The Great Escape Festival and other annual arts events. Closure The Blind Tiger Club closed in May 2014, following the March issuing of a Noise Abatement Notice issued under the Environmental Protection Act 1990. Its popularity as a community venue led to national news coverage and a public petition, signed by over 15,000 people. Legacy Outcry over the closure of the venue fed into national concerns which were building up by 2014, contributing to the creation that year of the Music Venue Trust in the UK. The Trust's aims are to reverse the closure of live music venues in the UK and support the industries around them.

Vol.24 His first tutor was Quanwei Chanbo. He followed monk Xijue to the Ashoka temple of Mingzhou where Xijue and Wenyi preached. He then traveled to the southern city of Fuzhou in search of the solution of his doubts on the subject of Zen. In Fuzhou, Wenyi's knowledge gained him much popularity. However, he was not content with himself and thought that he had not detached himself from the secular world. His departure from Fuzhou eventually led him to Linchuan. The tradition of Zen Buddhism holds that it was during this particular trip, Wenyi acquired great insight(È†ìÊÇü). Knowing that Wenyi is an accomplished Zen philosopher, the king of Nan Tang which ruled over the Linchuan region appointed a temple under his guidance. He would remain in the kingdom of Nan Tang for the rest of his life, promulgating the way of Zen. Wenyi died in the year of 958.

One of the main principles of strategic competition is that the response of an organization regarding another one's introduction of a new product defines the impact of such in the market. This type of competition has proven itself useful when trying to explain a firm's executive compensation schemes, leading to time compensation. Within a market where strategic competition is present, investment provides a much bigger capability of taking advantage of future opportunities of growth which also implies obtaining a greater market share. If such interaction between rivals is efficiently used, even all actors of the industry in which strategic competition was applied may be compensated on their profits. This is implemented either by putting entry barriers to new competitors or to dissuading others from 'making space' for stronger ones. Also, the application of strategic competition may lead to outsourcing activities used by rival firms involved in the process.  Basic elements  Strategic competition consists of five basic elements: * To comprehend competitive interaction as a dynamic system. * To use such comprehension in order to forecast the effects that any intervention can produce in that system. * To dispose of many uncommitted resources that can be applied to different purposes. * To predict the risk and return with enough accuracy for justifying the use of these resources. * To possess the necessary will to set the actions that must be fulfilled towards such commitment. In order for strategic competition to be successful, the analysis of these elements require a constant update of the firm's environment, considering that this type of competition possesses a rapidly evolving nature. Despite this, the shift from natural to strategic competition is a long process that might require generations to be fully implemented by a certain market.  Models  According to economics professor Timothy Van Zandt, there exist two models of strategic competition: competition in quantities between firms producing perfect substitutes and competition between firms producing substitute goods by price.  Uses in other areas  Not only strategic competition is applied to the business area but also to other ones such as political science and international relations as well as a process to apply public policies. Even geopolitics and military, and many other areas that involve many actors that struggle for leadership or power, may use this approach. This happens because such kind of competition brings about distinctive outcomes linked to capital structure. For example, the current status of Syria have provided a fertile terrain for strategic competition of the many actors involved in the conflict. This element is likely to persist well beyond any formal resolution of the current situation there. Another example of this, is the growing economic and strategic competition between the USA and the People's Republic of China in the countries located in Southeast Asia.

It served during the Battle of Britain and defended the Suez Canal while batteries served in the Battle of Crete and the Siege of Tobruk. The regiment then fought through the North African and Italian campaigns. Origin This unit was formed as a consequence of the doubling in size of the TA after the Munich Crisis in late 1938. Formally, it was a duplicate of the newly converted 75th (Home Counties) (Cinque Ports) Anti-Aircraft Regiment, based on two batteries (234th and 235th) transferred from that regiment, together with a more experienced anti-aircraft (AA) battery (205th), which had served with several Kent units, most recently 55th (Kent) AA Rgt, and provided the regimental headquarters (RHQ) at Sittingbourne. Whether officially sanctioned or not, the new regiment used the same 'Cinque Ports' subtitle as its parent regiment raised in the ancient Cinque Ports of Kent. The new regiment came into existence on 1 April 1939 with the following organisation:Frederick, pp. 755, 777.Monthly Army List, May 1939.1st Cinque Ports Artillery (75th HAA Rgt) at Regiments.org. 89th (Cinque Ports) Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery * RHQ at Crown Quay, Sittingbourne * 205 (Kent) AA Battery at Sittingbourne * 234 (Kent) AA Battery at Deal * 235 (Kent) AA Battery at Margate The regiment formed part of 28th (Thames and Medway) AA Brigade at Chatham in 6th AA Division.89 HAA Rgt at RA 39‚Äì45AA Command 3 September 1939 at Patriot Files.Routledge, Table LX, p. 378. World War II =Mobilisation= In June 1939, a partial mobilisation of the TA was begun in a process known as 'couverture', whereby each AA unit did a month's tour of duty in rotation to man selected AA positions. On 24 August, ahead of the declaration of war, Anti-Aircraft Command was fully mobilised at its war stations.Routledge, pp. 65‚Äì6, 371. All batteries of 89th AA Regiment were reported as ready for action on 27 August, and the newly formed 306 AA Battery joined from 75th HAA Rgt on 30 August. War was declared against Germany on 3 September.89 HAA Rgt War Diary, 1939‚Äì40, The National Archives (TNA), Kew, file WO 166/2380. 306 AA Bty left for training in September, and 235 (Kent) Bty deployed to The Midlands as an independent battery in October, but both rejoined in February 1940. 306 AA Battery was then passed back to 75th HAA Rgt at the end of May. During the spring of 1940, batches of recruits were posted to the regiment from 210th AA Training Regiment at Oswestry. From 1 June 1940 those AA units like 89th armed with 3.7-inch guns were termed 'Heavy AA' (HAA) to distinguish them for the Light AA (LAA) units then being formed. The commanding officer (CO) was Lieutenant-Colonel John Morley Stebbings, TD, who as a young officer had won the Edward Medal by leading a rescue party into the ruins of the Uplees explosives factory near Faversham after the Great Explosion on 2 April 1916. He had subsequently won a Military Cross (MC) on the Western Front. Between the wars Stebbings had served with the 75th (Home Counties) (Cinque Ports) HAA Rgt and was its CO before the 89th HAA Rgt was separated from it.London Gazette, 22 January 1918.Sale of Stebbings' medals at auction 17 May 2016. Sale of Cpl Ashley's medals at auction 13 December 2007. =Battle of Britain= 205 and 235 Batteries carried out the regiment's first engagement early on the morning of 10 May, when their fire broke up a formation of Junkers Ju 88s flying over Kent. There were more engagements as the Battle of Britain got under way, with 205 Bty being sent with its guns to reinforce the AA defences of Southampton in June and Dover in July. Dover was attacked almost daily during August, and there were some raids over Maidstone and Chatham. =Egypt= On 15 September 1940, 89th HAA Rgt was relieved of operational duties and ordered to prepare to move overseas. At the end of November it moved into Butlin's Holiday Camp at Clacton-on-Sea to complete its mobilisation. The regiment then entrained for Glasgow where it embarked on HM Transport J5 (SS City of Canterbury) and sailed on 15 December 1940 bound for Egypt. It sailed with a strength of 49 officers and 1419 men including the attached Signal Section (Royal Corps of Signals), Workshop (Royal Army Ordnance Corps (RAOC)) and Transport (Royal Army Service Corps), which all came from 60th (City of London) HAA Rgt. After a close call on Christmas Day when the German surface raider Admiral Hipper intercepted its convoy, the regiment disembarked at Port Tewfik, Suez, on 16 February 1941. After a spell in a training camp, the regiment assumed responsibility for the air defence of Suez on 28 April, with Lt-Col Stebbings as AA Defence Commander (AADC).Monthly Army List.Farndale, pp. 119 and 168.89 HAA Rgt War Diary, December 1940‚ÄìFebruary 1941, TNA file WO 169/306.89 HAA Rgt and 234 HAA Bty War Diaries, December 1940‚ÄìFebruary 1941, TNA file WO 169/306.89 HAA Rgt and AADC Suez War Diary, 1941, TNA file WO 169/1583. Towards the end of January, the Luftwaffe had begun attacking the Suez Canal from Italian bases on Rhodes, dropping magnetic and acoustic mines that disrupted shipping in the canal. Most of the vital supplies and reinforcements for Middle East Command therefore had to be landed at Suez rather than passing through the canal.Playfair, Vol I, pp. 326‚Äì8.Playfair, Vol II, pp. 226‚Äì7. While RHQ of 89th HAA Rgt developed the AA defences of the port facilities at Suez, its own three batteries were dispersed. 205 Battery was transferred to British Troops Egypt in early April, ready to join 6th Division, which was being reformed (though it appears the battery never actually joined it before the division went to Syria).Joslen, p. 49. Later in the month 234 Bty was sent to Crete to bolster the defences after the British forces were evacuated from Greece, and 235 Bty went to reinforce the AA defences of Tobruk. =Battle of Crete= German paratroops and Junkers Ju 52 transport aircraft (one burning) over Crete, May 1941. 234 (Kent) Battery disembarked at Suda Bay in Crete on 24 April and was deployed in the Suda-Canea area to protect harbour installations alongside 151 (London) Bty from 51st (London) HAA Rgt, both under the command of RHQ 52nd (East Lancashire) LAA Rgt.Farndale, p. 177.Routledge, pp. 148‚Äì9.Playfair, Vol II, pp. 125‚Äì7. The British bases on Crete had been regularly dive-bombed in March and April, and the HAA guns at Suda had been reorganised for close defence against these tactics. The battery was in action immediately after unloading its guns on 25 April. On 14 May Left Troop of 234 Bty was moved to Suda Point, and the concentration of AA fire reduced shipping losses. In May the Luftwaffe began attacking the AA sites directly, and the gunners replied with multiple Vickers .50 machine guns and Lewis guns as well as scoring direct hits with their 3.7-inch guns. When the German airborne assault began at 06.00 on 20 May, the HAA guns took a heavy toll of the German transport aircraft and gliders coming in. Some of the paratroopers were specifically tasked with knocking out the AA defences but those briefed to take Left Troop found the positions empty and were wiped out. But Right Troop of 234 Bty at Canea was swamped by glider troops against whom their eight rifles and two Lewis guns were ineffective. The survivors were forced to surrender after close-quarters fighting with grenades and sub- machine guns. A party of Royal Marines recaptured the gun positions later that day and rescued 32 survivors, but the Germans had damaged the guns; other guns around Suda had burst barrels from excessive firing.Detailed accounts in 89 HAA Rgt War Diary (TNA file WO 169/1583) extensively quoted by Farndale, pp. 178‚Äì81.Routledge, pp. 150‚Äì51.Creforce at British & Commonwealth Orders of BattlePlayfair, Vol II, p 132. Although German casualties in men and aircraft had been heavy, their troop transports were able to use Maleme airfield the next day, followed by landings from the sea. On 26 May, the Allied forces were ordered to retreat, the remaining AA positions were ordered to destroy their equipment and move by small boats or cross-country for evacuation from the south coast of the island. Many could not be evacuated and became prisoners of war.Farndale, p. 183.Routledge, p. 151.Playfair, Vol II, pp. 142‚Äì3. The Royal Artillery historian describes 234 as a 'very gallant battery' who had 'defended their guns to the last and took a terrible toll of their attackers in those terrible few minutes'.Farndale, p. 180. Of 12 officers and 347 other ranks who landed in Crete, 234 (Kent) Battery's total casualties in the campaign were 57 killed in action and 187 missing, believed prisoners of war, many of them wounded (only 30 wounded members of the battery managed to get back to Egypt). One of those killed was Lt Hedley Stebbings, in whose memory a medical charity was later founded by his sister.Peter Stebbings Memorial Charity.Stebbings at King's College War Memorials. GHQ Middle East ordered the depleted battery's disbandment, which was carried out on 1 July. The survivors were posted to 16 Bty of 2nd HAA Rgt.GHQ ME 28 June 1941; copy in 580th (Lancashire) Army Troops Company, Royal Engineers, War Diary 1941, TNA file WO 169/1914. Lieutenant A.P. Corbett was awarded an MC and Serjeant E.A. Hooker a Military Medal (MM) for their service in Crete with 234 Bty. On one occasion Hooker had put his foot on a grenade thrown into his gun pit, 'risking the full force of the explosion, in order to save his detachment'.Corbett's citation at TNA file WO 373/27/290.Hooker's citation at TNA file WO 373/27/323. =Siege of Tobruk= Gunners cleaning a 3.7-inch anti-aircraft gun near Tobruk, 19 August 1941. Meanwhile, 235 (Kent) Bty under Major G.D. Boyd had also been detached from the regiment at Suez to replace 151 Bty in 51 HAA Rgt, which was operating with the Western Desert Force (WDF). General Erwin Rommel counter-attacked in Cyrenaica in April 1941, forcing the WDF back, and by 7 April 51 HAA Rgt was within the Tobruk perimeter. 235 Battery, together with eight static 3.7-inch guns brought by sea, arrived to reinforce the garrison just before the ring closed round the port on 11 July, beginning the Siege of Tobruk.Farndale, p. 160-2.Routledge, p. 130. In Tobruk, 51st HAA Rgt, including 235 Bty, came under the command of 4th AA Bde, which was a major element of the garrison.Farndale, p. 165.Routledge, p. 131; Table XX, p. 141. Including the static guns delivered by sea, there were a total of 24 3.7-inch HAA guns available to the garrison (although two were disabled early in the siege by premature bursts), and 152 and 235 Batteries each had an Italian 102mm gun that had been restored to working order by 51st HAA Rgt's workshop detachment. 152, 153 and 235 HAA Batteries, together with 51st HAA Rgt's workshops and signals, formed part of the Harbour Defended Area under the command of RHQ 13th LAA Regiment. Early in the siege, RHQ and 152 Bty of 51 HAA Rgt were attacked by Stukas and suffered serious casualties, after which they were evacuated by sea. 235 (Kent) and 153 (London) Btys however remained there throughout the 240-day siege under 4th AA Bde.Playfair, Vol II, Chapter VIII, p. 158.Farndale, p. 167.Farndale, p. 188. German bombs explode during one of the heaviest air raids on Tobruk. The photograph was taken from a trench adjoining an AA gun. The Official History records that the AA artillery in Tobruk was 'incessantly in action against attacks of all kinds, from all heights, but especially by dive-bombers'. The Royal Artillery historian notes that these Stuka attacks concentrated on gun positions, which was a serious threat to HAA sites, whose instruments could not cope with the rapid height changes. The gunners devised a tactic of opening fire with short Fuzes just before the dive started, to force the pilots to fly through a ring of bursts. The battery cooks, drivers and clerks then joined in, firing machine-guns and captured 20mm Breda guns. This aggressive method was known as 'Porcupine', and was so effective that the Luftwaffe changed to high-level bombing. Each mobile HAA troop established at least one alternative site and the guns were regularly switched between them, the empty sites being rigged up as dummies. The two available gun-laying (GL) radar sets had to be positioned away from the vulnerable gun sites and used for early warning to supplement the single RAF radar, and a ring of searchlights operated round the harbour at night. Harbour defence was by pre-arranged barrages by five of the six HAA troops, the sixth troop remaining on watch for other raiders. 4th AA Brigade recorded that there was a steady decline in numbers of aircraft attacking as the siege went on, with the attackers switching to high-level and night attacks. In the last two months of the siege, troops of HAA guns took it in turn to move out to the perimeter and take on ground targets under the control of 9th Australian Division. Their long-range harassing fire made up for the shortage of medium artillery. After Tobruk was relieved in November 1941, 51 HAA Rgt and 235 HAA Bty were withdrawn to Palestine for rest and reorganisation.Routledge, pp. 131‚Äì3, Table XXI, p. 142.Joslen, p. 487. 235 Bty's casualties by the end of August were 5 killed and 13 wounded, and a further 5 were killed in September and October. Lieutenant M.F. Felton was awarded the MC, Serjeant W. Pay and Lance-Bombardier E.L. Billinghurst the MM for their service with 235 Bty at Tobruk. Billinghurst, a gun layer, had refused medical assistance when wounded on 25 May and continued at his post, informing the gun No 1 of the line of attack of the enemy aircraft.Felton's citation at TNA file WO 373/18/408.Pay's citation at WO 373/20/318.Billinghurst's citation at TNA file WO 373/18/427. =Defence of Suez= While the Crete and Tobruk operations were going on, RHQ and 205 Bty (8 x 3.7-inch guns and 1 x Gun-Laying Mk I* radar set) had remained at Suez under 2nd AA Bde. RHQ 89th HAA Rgt provided the HQ for AADC Suez, which meant that a number of different AA units came under its command at various times. At the beginning these included a Gun Operations Room (GOR) established in May, a Troop of Bofors guns from 6 LAA Bty (left behind when 2nd LAA Rgt went to Tobruk), and 306 Searchlight Bty from 27th (London Electrical Engineers) Searchlight Rgt, replaced by 390 S/L Bty from the same regiment when 306 Bty went to Tobruk.Routledge, Table XIX, p. 141.2 LAA Rgt at RA 1939‚Äì45.27 S/L Rgt at RA 1939‚Äì45. 100 LAA Battery (52nd LAA Rgt) and 276 HAA Bty (88th HAA Rgt) (8 x 3.7-inch guns, 1 x GL Mk I set) arrived in July, and the LAA guns were deployed round Port Tewfik and Shallufa Airfield.52 LAA Rgt at RA 1939‚Äì45. Occasional bombing raids by Ju 88s flying from Greece against Suez began in July and became almost nightly in August and September. The targets were the Port Tewfik dock installations, the oil refinery, railway marshalling yards, Shallufa Airfield and shipping at the anchorage in the bay Playfair, Vol II, pp. 298-301. During September and October, the AA defences were strengthened so that, by the end of October, 89th HAA RHQ/AADC Suez had the following units under command:Routledge, Table XXII, p. 143. * 88th HAA Rgt (RHQ, 281 and 282 Btys) (16 x 3.7-inch, 1 x GL Mk I) * 205/89 HAA Bty (8 x 3.7-inch, 1 x GL Mk I) * 5 HAA Bty, Royal Australian Artillery (RAA), (8 x 3.7-inch) ‚Äì from Beirut, replacing 276 HAA Bty * 100/52 LAA Bty (12 x Bofors) * 9 LAA Bty, RAA (12 x Bofors) * 81/25 LAA Bty (12 x Bofors) * One Troop each of 1 and 38/13 and 41/115 LAA Btys (12 x Bofors) * 390/27 S/L Bty (less one Troop) (24 x S/Ls) * 135 'Z' Bty (64 x Z Battery rocket projectors) * 89 HAA Rgt Signals * Gun Operations Room 281 HAA and 41 LAA Btys left the area in November and were replaced by 5 HAA Bty, Royal Malta Artillery and 37/13 LAA Bty, and 16/2 HAA and 150/42 LAA Btys replaced the two Australian batteries in January.89 HAA Rgt and AADC Suez War Diary, 1942, TNA file WO 169/4808. There were five further Luftwaffe attacks on Suez during November.Playfair, Vol III, p. 17. Lt-Col Stebbings was promoted to Acting Brigadier in November 1941 and took command of 1st AA Bde (he was later captured at the Fall of Tobruk in June 1942). Lt-Col W.R. Brackett took over as CO of 89th HAA Rgt and AADC Suez. 231 HAA Bty, from 74th (City of Glasgow) HAA Rgt, officially replaced 234 (Kent) Bty in 89th HAA Rgt on 1 December.Litchfield, p. 290. Regimental morale was boosted in February when Prime Minister Winston Churchill, as Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports, accepted the appointment of Honorary Colonel of the regiment. By the end of February 1942, 89th HAA RHQ/AADC Suez had six 4-gun HAA sites manned by 205, 231 and 282 HAA Btys, 20 Bofors gun sites of 150 and 231 LAA Btys, four 3-inch 'Z' Battery sites of 135 Bty, and 15 S/L sites of 304 and 390 S/L Btys. The following month 26 HAA Bty (9th HAA Rgt) replaced 282/88 HAA Bty, and 5 HAA Bty, RMA, installed two new 4.5-inch guns. Also in March, 2nd AA Bde HQ moved to Cairo so that Suez AADC came under Canal AADC until 1st AA Bde HQ arrived to take over in May, and there was considerable shuffling of LAA and S/L sites. 235 (Kent) HAA Bty returned to the regiment from Palestine in April 1942, and relieved 26/9 HAA Bty in May; the regiment therefore had three batteries once more (205, 231 and 235) and was directly responsible for 9th AA Operations Room (AAOR), F Coast Bty and A Royal Marines HAA Bty. By the end of the summer it was concentrated on the western side of the Suez Canal entrance, while 61st (Middlesex) HAA Rgt arrived to take charge of all HAA batteries on the eastern side of the canal, and 41st LAA Rgt to take over all LAA and Z batteries under AADC Suez. During the summer, as Rommel's forces neared the Egyptian frontier, Luftwaffe reconnaissance flights and raids over Suez and the canal increased once more, but there was no concentrated bombing campaign against the vital bases.Playfair, Vol III, pp. 212, 337. By October, Eighth Army was preparing its counter-strike at El Alamein. In October, 89th HAA Rgt was transferred to 21st AA Bde from 1st AA Bde, which was being prepared for mobile operations under Eight Army. Shortly afterwards a new 106 AA Defence HQ arrived to take over the role of AADC Suez, and 89th HAA Rgt moved into camp for mobile training and anti-tank training before the end of the year. =Defence of Benghazi= By now, Eighth Army had broken through the Axis positions at the Second Battle of El Alamein and began its pursuit across Libya, AA units were leap-frogged forwards to cover the important objectives as they were taken. 1st AA Brigade and 51st (London) HAA Rgt moved up from Egypt to defend the captured port of Benghazi and the nearby airfields for the supporting fighters and bombers of the Desert Air Force. 89th HAA Regiment followed up on 21 January 1943 from an AA practice camp at Suez to relieve 51st (London) HAA Rgt in these positions on 29 January and remained there until the end of the North African Campaign in May 1943.Routledge, Table XXIV, p. 162.Routledge, pp. 157‚Äì8; Table XXV, p. 164.Joslen, p. 486.89 HAA Rgt War Diary, 1943, TNA file WO 169/9547. Lt-Col Brackett was appointed AADC Benghazi on 17 February There was an air raid on 18 February, when one attacker was shot down, but generally there was little enemy activity, the German and Italian air forces concentrating their efforts on the fighting fronts. 89th HAA Regiment was kept busy convoying supplies and carrying out a trial of the effectiveness of the 3.7-inch gun against concrete emplacements (a technique that later bore fruit in Italy). When US heavy bomber squadrons arrived at Benina airfield in February, 205 HAA Bty provided 4 guns and a GL set to provide cover. By mid-March 1943, 89th HAA RHQ/AADC Benghazi had the following units under command:Routledge, Table XXV, p. 164. * RHQ 89th HAA Rgt ** 205/89 HAA Bty ** 231/89 HAA Bty ** 235/89 HAA Bty ** 89th HAA Rgt Signal Section ** 89th HAA Rgt Workshop (the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers (REME) had taken this role over from the RAOC) ** 28/9 HAA Bty (later replaced by 280 Bty from 87th HAA Rgt, then by 312 Bty from 54th (City of London) HAA Rgt) ** 17 AAOR * RHQ 2nd LAA Rgt (later replaced by 13th LAA Rgt and 86th LAA Rgt, then by 61st LAA Rgt) ** Two Troops 6/2 LAA Bty ** 37/2 LAA Bty ** 155/2 LAA Bty ** 2nd LAA Rgt Signal Section ** 2nd LAA Rgt Workshop * C Troop 135 Z Bty * 390/27 S/L Bty * 7th Radio Repair Section After the end of the Tunisian Campaign in May 1943, the AA defences of North Africa could be scaled back, and 135 Z Battery returned to Suez in June. However, the build-up of the USAAF's IX Bomber Command at landing grounds around Benghazi still required protection, and guns were redeployed accordingly. On 15 August, 89th HAA Rgt was relieved at Benghazi and moved by stages back to Egypt, where Lt-Col C.S. Partridge took command. The batteries practised AA and ground shooting. Then on 18 September the regiment embarked at Alexandria for Italy. =Defence of Brindisi= The regiment disembarked at Taranto on 24 September 1943, two weeks after it had been captured in Operation Slapstick, and proceeded by rail to Brindisi Docks where the guns and transport arrived by sea. The guns were quickly deployed, 231 and 235 Btys round the docks with a GOR, 205 Bty detached at Grottaglie Airfield, and were ready for action by 30 September. Lt-Col Partridge became AADC Brindisi, under 8th AA Bde.Routledge, p. 289‚Äì92. A 3.7-inch gun in action in Italy By 22 October 1943, 89th HAA RHQ/AADC Brindisi had the following units under command in the Bridisi Gun Defence Area (GDA): * RHQ 89th HAA Rgt ** 231/89 HAA Bty ** 235/89 HAA Bty ** 89th HAA Rgt Signal Section ** 89th HAA Rgt Workshop ** 7th Radio Repair Section ** GOR * 234/75 LAA Bty * B and D Troops 568 Independent S/L Bty * 101 Coast Bty (at Monticelli) There were occasional engagements of reconnaissance overflights by Luftwaffe aircraft, but Brindisi was not bombed, unlike nearby Bari. HAA and LAA guns sited within sight of the sea were given a secondary coast defence role, and dual purpose coast defence guns were given a secondary AA role under the AADC.89 HAA Rgt War Diary, 1944, TNA file WO 170/1152. By March 1944, the deployment had become as follows: * RHQ 89th HAA Rgt ** 205/89 HAA Bty ** 231/89 HAA Bty ** 235/89 HAA Bty ** 89th HAA Rgt Signal Section ** 89th HAA Rgt Workshop ** 7th Radio Repair Section * 243/78 HAA Bty * 21 AAOR (later 51 AAOR from 25th AA Bde) * 61/31 LAA Bty * 92/34 LAA Bty (from 25th AA Bde) * 568 (Ind) S/L Bty (four Troops plus workshop) * 101 Coast Bty In July 1944, 25th AA Bde relieved 8th AA Bde and took responsibility for Brindisi, bringing with it 278 and 279 Btys of 87th HAA Rgt and 233 and 246 LAA Btys of 75th LAA Rgt. However, by now the air threat to the southern Italian cities had diminished and Allied Forces in Italy had an excess of AA units. Meanwhile, the ground forces were suffering a manpower shortage, so a number of AA regiments were disbanded and their personnel redistributed. 89th Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment was one of those chosen for disbandment, and the regiment was formally placed in suspended animation from 31 August 1944.Routledge, Table XLIV, p. 293. Postwar When the TA was reconstituted on 1 January 1947, the regiment was reformed at Ramsgate as 489 (Mobile) HAA Rgt. It came under the command of 53rd AA Brigade (the former 27th (Home Counties) AA Bde) based at Dover, part of 1 AA Group.Frederick, p. 1018.Litchfield, Appendix 5.Watson, TA 1947. In 1953, the regiment was officially given the subsidiary title 'Cinque Ports' after its parent 75th (Home Counties) (Cinque Ports) HAA Rgt raised in the ancient Cinque Ports of Kent. Anti-Aircraft Command was disbanded on 1 March 1955 and 489 (Cinque Ports) HAA Rgt was disbanded at the same time. Honorary Colonel Winston Churchill, Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports, was appointed Honorary Colonel of 89th (Cinque Ports) HAA Rgt on 20 February 1942.

Criminal traditions are transmitted from the older generation to the younger generation, such as social customs are in other forms of society. Studies of the criminal tradition involved Clifford R.

This theory stresses the value systems of different areas Also worth noting theory of ‚Äúdifferential association,‚Äù in which Edwin H.

Sutherland asserted that criminal behavior is learned and that it is learned in interaction with others who have already incorporated criminal values.Criminology Theory: Selected Classic Readings, by Frank P. Williams III, Marilyn D. McShane Research by Shaw and McKay on the concept of cultural transmission indicates that a criminal tradition or subculture does exist in areas of larger cities. According to their studies Criminal tradition arises and is maintained in areas of instability, and the values, norms, and behaviors of the participants in the criminal tradition are viewed as normal by these people.Hepburn J.

Population categories subject to criminal traditions  Traditions are not personified, so adolescents and boys are easier to obey than direct instructions from specific individuals. This is the power of tradition. The norms of the life of groups in which the will of their members manifest themselves take the form of tradition most often. In the tradition that there is no personification, adolescents find it easier to obey them than to a particular person. Against this background, the criminal traditions that are prevalent in youth criminal groups, especially in closed educational and correctional institutions are especially dangerous. In a criminal environment, there are two kinds of traditions:\\"Laws of the criminal world of youth (criminal subculture)\\" by Pirozhkov V. * They came to us from the criminal environment of the distant past and transformed into modern ones, taking into account the conditions of life of society and the relations dominating in it; * New traditions that have arisen and established in a criminal environment in modern conditions and have no analogues in the past. At the same time, there is a transformation of existing criminal traditions and the emergence of new ones. The reason for this is the changes in the social, economic, legal and other spheres.  World criminal tradition  On the criminal tradition in different countries of the world, there is a huge amount of work. There is an impressive number of works on the Russian criminal tradition, written in different languages. We can also highlight works by Jonny Steinberg on the numbers gangs of South Africa  Alternative opinions  There is also the view that it is impossible to consider all the traditions of the criminal environment as antisocial and harmful, including, for the reason that some of the traditions in the cells of the remand center, contribute to hygiene and the maintenance of sanitary norms.\\"Laws of the criminal world of youth (criminal subculture)\\" by Pirozhkov V.

The album is notable in being more optimistic in tone than its predecessor while also featuring slower and mid tempo songs such as the aforementioned \\"Spooky Action (At A Distance)\\" and the introspective \\"(Castle) Numbskull\\" as well as more observational and personal lyrics. Lubrano explained \\"This record is a lot more about people's relationships with each other on a personal level. I don't know the word I'm looking for. It was more about the way people relate to each other, rather than my personal past life experiences, or something like that....I guess there were a lot of little things that I wanted to touch upon for my own edification.\\" The band wrote and recorded the album over a span of a year and a half at Douglas' Hobo House and officially released it on November 5, 2013.

The Constant One, as a sentiment, is a statement on the cyclical nature of our humanity; as a commentary, it attempts to diffuse the fears and anxieties, the failures and disappointments that perpetually threaten to debilitate us. And the conclusion: it's all bullshit. The human condition is greater than the sum of its experiences.

History and size  The Schl√ºchtsee with bathhouse and raft In 1791, St. Blaise Abbey needed an ice pond for the nearby brewery in Rothaus and so the Schl√ºcht was impounded. A textile dyers' was soon added which ran until the 1920s. The meadows were used for bleaching and the lake water for dyeing. Bathing was not introduced until the 20th century and was during this time that the little wooden bathing hut was built. With the development of the lake around 1920 by Swiss nobleman, Ernest of Adelsheim, the value of conservation, especially water lilies, was established. This was continued by the former tenant of the Schl√ºchtsee farm, Erich Gold. Today the water lilies are separated from the bathing area by logs, and the bathing beach also has a kiosk. The area of the lake, which lies at a height of above sea level immediately north of the Schl√ºchtsee farm between Grafenhausen and Rothaus,Gutachten von 1990 zur geplanten Erweiterung des Naturschutzgebietes is about and it has a shoreline just under in length.

As a juvenile in 1987 she showed considerable promise, winning one race and finishing third in the Futurity Stakes. In the following year, she developed into a high-class middle distance performer, winning the Oaks d'Italia and dead-heating for Irish Oaks as well as finishing second in a strongly contested edition of the weight-for-age Geoffrey Freer Stakes. As a broodmare she had some success as a dam of National Hunt horses. Background Melodist was a bay mare with no white markings bred in Pennsylvania by Ziw Associates. As a yearling in July 1986 she was consigned to the Keeneland select sale and was bought for $1,100,000 by Sheikh Mohammed's Darley Stud. She was sent to Europe and entered training with Michael Stoute at his Freemason Lodge stable in Newmarket, Suffolk. She was sired by The Minstrel, a Canadian-bred horse who won The Derby in 1977. As a breeding stallion, The Minstrel sired Bakharoff, Minstrella, Opening Verse, L'Emigrant, Musical Bliss and Palace Music. Melodist was one of several good winners produced by her dam Native Nurse: the others included Love Sign and Fatih (Arcadia Handicap). Native Nurse was descended from the American broodmare Omayya, who was also the female-line ancestor of Americain. Racing career =1987: two-year-old season= Melodist began her racing career by finishing fifth in a maiden race over six furlongs and then ran second in a similar event over a furlong further. In September she started odds-on favourite against sixteen opponents for a maiden over one mile at Brighton Racecourse and won by four lengths. She was then moved up in class when she was sent to Ireland for the Futurity Stakes at the Curragh Racecourse and finished third behind the colts Demon Magic and Gold Discovery. =1988: three-year-old season= In 1988 Melodist was ridden in all four of her races by Walter Swinburn. She did not run as a three-year-old until 22 May when she was sent to Italy for the Oaks d'Italia over 2400 metres on soft ground at the San Siro racecourse in Milan. The finish of the race was dominated by overseas challengers as Melodist won by one and a half lengths from her fellow British raider Asl (previously second in the Musidora Stakes) with the French-trained Summer Trip a neck away in third. On 9 July Melodist was one of nine runners to contest the Irish Oaks over one and a half miles at the Curragh and started at odds of 11/1. The 2/9 favourite for the race was Diminuendo, ridden by Steve Cauthen, who had won The Oaks by four lengths. Both Melodist and Diminuendo were owned by Sheikh Mohammed and based at Newmarket, but whereas Melodist was trained by Stoute, the favourite was trained by Henry Cecil at Warren Place. The other fancied runners were Dancing Goddess (second in the Irish 1000 Guineas), Miss Boniface (Ribblesdale Stakes) and Silver Lane (Prix de la Grotte). Melodist tracked the leaders before overtaking Miss Boniface before going to the front a furlong and a half from the finish. She faced a strong late challenge from Diminuendo and after a sustained struggle the two fillies crossed the line together with the judge declaring a dead heat. Melodist was matched against older horse and male opposition when she was stepped up in distance for the Geoffrey Freer Stakes over one mile five and a half furlongs at Newbury Racecourse on 13 August. After being restrained at the rear of the six-runner field she took the lead in the straight but hung badly to the right in the closing stages and was beaten two lengths into second by the three-year-old colt Top Class. The leading older horses Ibn Bey and Moon Madness came home fourth and fifth. On her final appearance the filly was sent to France for the Prix Vermeille at Longchamp Racecourse on 11 September but ran poorly and finished last of the eight runners behind Indian Rose. Assessment In 1987 the independent Timeform organisation gave Melodist a rating of 92 p (the \\"p\\" indicating that she was expected to make more than usual progress) and commented that she would stay at least ten furlongs and was \\"likely to make up into a useful three-year-old\\". Breeding record After her retirement from racing Melodist became a broodmare for her owners stud.

In an emergency fall-back position with no human donor heart available, Boyd's doctor James D. Hardy used one of four chimpanzees he had acquired for just such an eventuality.

Hardy at the University of Mississippi Medical Center, who had previously performed the world's first lung transplant with a dead human donor, had also been impressed by the limited success of Keith Reemtsma in transplanting chimpanzee kidneys into human patients. Hardy acquired four chimpanzees for the possibility of a heart transplant. Dean of the Medical School Robert Marston and Hardy jointly established conditions for a heart transplant which included, that since a heart transplant was highly experimental, they could only consider a patient already close to death and who had no other hope of survival. On January 22, 1964, 68-year old Rush had been found unconscious by neighbors. His lower left leg was black with gangrene, his face was mottled with blood clots, and he only had a faint pulse. All these symptoms were likely caused by his heart's inability to pump enough blood. Rush was brought to the hospital in a coma. Mrs. J.H. Thompson, who was either his sister or stepsisterXenotransplantation: Law and Ethics, Sheila McLean, Laura Williamson, University of Glasgow, UK, Ashgate Publishing, 2005, page 50. was asked to sign the consent form which made no mention that an animal heart might be used. A 2012 article in the Baylor University Medical Center Proceedings stated, \\"Such was the medicolegal situation at that time that this 'informed' consent was not considered in any way inadequate.\\"A brief history of cross-species organ transplantation, Baylor University Medical Center Proceedings, David K. C. Cooper MD, PhD, 2012 Jan; 25(1): 49‚Äì57, section on \\"JAMES HARDY AND THE FIRST HEART XENOTRANSPLANT.\\" Hardy later stated that he had verbally discussed the procedure in detail with relatives including the possibility that a chimpanzee heart might be used, although in fact Mrs. Thompson was the only relative present.Xenotransplantation: Law and Ethics, Sheila McLean, Laura Williamson, University of Glasgow, UK, Ashgate Publishing, 2005, page 50.George J. Annas, 'Baby Fae: The \\"Anything Goes\\" School of Human Experimentation', Hastings Center Report, 15 (1), February 1985, pages 15-17. There was also a trauma victim in the hospital's ICU who was brain-dead and whose family had given permission for him to be a heart donor. However, the legal definition of death at the time required that the heartbeat stop, and this trauma victim's heart was still beating. The concept of brain death had not yet received widespread acceptance. On January 22, Hardy amputated the gangrenous portions of Rush's left leg. On January 23 at approximately 11:00 pm, Rush went into shock and his blood pressure fell to 60. Hardy took him into the operating room. Rush's heart stopped just before they attached him to the heart-lung machine. Hardy then polled the other four doctors regarding whether they should continue with the transplant knowing that they would now use a chimpanzee heart and would likely receive much public criticism. He asked each quietly, \\"Are you prepared to proceed?\\" The first doctor agreed, the next abstained, and the last two nodded their consent. The five doctors began the heart transplant using the largest of the four chimpanzees. Just after 2:00 am on Friday, January 24, 1964, Hardy completed the stitching to connect the chimpanzee heart into Rush's chest. He used a defibrillator to start the donor heart beating. The heart beat for 60 minutes (some sources say 90 minutes) and then could not be restarted. After the transplant attempt, the hospital's director of public information put out a guarded statement which included the phrase \\"the dimensions of the only available donor heart.\\" The Associated Press assumed the donor heart was that of a human being and widely distributed the story. The hospital was thereby put in the position of issuing a correction, which embarrassed both the hospital and Hardy. Hardy was further embarrassed at a medical convention two weeks later.\\"Substitute Heart Works for an Hour in Historic Surgery,\\" Utica Daily Press [New York], Dudley Lehew, Jackson, Miss. (AP), Saturday morning edition, Jan. 25, 1964, front page (bottom of page). He later wrote, \\"I had noted that when one loses his academic post, for whatever reason, he is not likely to get another one of comparable significance. I decided to wait until Shumway and his group transplanted a heart in man.\\" Rush at the time was either living in HattiesburgPaving the way for transplant history , University of Mississippi Medical Center, Jan. 27, 2014. or in the Laurel Trailer Park on the outskirts of Jackson, Mississippi. The operation started at approximately 11:00 pm on January 23, but the chimp heart was inserted in Boyd's body at approximately 2:00 am. on Jan. 24, 1964.Every Second Counts, McRae, page 125. Almost four years later, Christiaan Barnard at Groote Schuur hospital in South Africa performed the world's first human-to- human heart transplant on December 3, 1967. The patient Louis Washkansky did regain consciousness, and in fact, lived for 18 days before dying of pneumonia. The donor heart was from 25 year-old Denise Darvall who had been rendered brain dead after she and her mother had been struck by a drunk driver. Her father gave permission for the transplant.S Afr Med J, \\"A human cardiac transplant: an interim report of a successful operation performed at Groote Schuur Hospital, Cape Town\\", Barnard CN, 1967 Dec 30; 41(48): 1271‚Äì74.Louis Washkansky (1913 ‚Äì 1967) , Science Museum.Denise Darvall, South Africa History Online, last updated Aug. 12, 2016. Overlooked by history? Rush is sometimes overlooked by accounts of early transplant history. For example, a 2017 BBC retrospective article which covers Barnard's 1967 operation has a photo caption stating that Louis Washkansky was the first recipient of a heart transplant, when Rush was technically the first recipient of a heart transplant.The operation that took medicine into the media age, BBC, Dr Ayesha Nathoo (Centre for Medical History, University of Exeter), 3 December 2017. This article covers Christiaan Barnard's 1967 operation with patient Louis Washkansky, but completely overlooks James Hardy's 1964 transplant attempt with patient Boyd Rush. The 2013 book Organ Donation (GlobalViewpoints) includes James Hardy's 1963 lung transplant [with patient John Russell], but makes no mention of Hardy's 1964 heart transplant attempt with Rush as his patient.Organ Donation, GlobalViewpoints, edited by Margaret Haerens, Detroit, New York, San Francisco, New Haven, Conn., Waterville, Maine, London: Greenhaven Press, 2013, page 18.

She spent most of her career working for Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, New York. Haight was the second female president of the American Philological Association, and first woman to chair the Advisory Council of the American School of Classical Studies at Rome. She published eleven books in the field of Classics, as well as histories of Vassar and James Monroe Taylor. Her works focused on Latin Literature and the Greek novel, before she began the study of symbolism in Latin literature in her final publications. She was involved in Vassar's war efforts during World War I, and supporting foreign scholars during World War II, and was consistently interested in promoting women's education as a force for good in American society. Career Elizabeth Hazelton \\"Hazel\\" Haight was born in Auburn, to John White Haight and Helen M. Haight . Her father was one of the leading businessmen in Auburn during his lifetime. She began studying Classics at school in Auburn, and attributed her love of the subject to the influence of her mother, who had read and enjoyed Virgil in her own schooldays, and who had been a decisive factor in Haight's going to college. Haight matriculated at Vassar College in 1890, and was commencement speaker for her undergraduate class, graduating from Vassar with a degree in Classics in 1894. She also edited the yearbook for that year, and was awarded a retrospective membership to Phi Beta Kappa. During the course of her studies, some of her poems were published in The Miscellany News. After graduation, Haight taught at schools in the New York area, including Rye Seminary School in Rye (1894-1895), the Emma Willard School in Troy (1895-1900), and the Packer Collegiate Institute in Brooklyn (1900-1901). She received her AM, also from Vassar, in 1899, with a dissertation entitled \\"Conditional Sentences in the Iliad and the Odyssey\\". As she was teaching at the time, her MA was received in absentia. She then moved to Cornell University, where she studied with Charles E. Bennett, and received her PhD with a thesis entitled The Sea in Greek Poetry in 1909. Haight returned to Vassar to join its faculty in 1902, working at Vassar alongside studying for her PhD. She became an associate professor in 1910, and was promoted to professor in 1922, partly due to the strong written support of Grace Macurdy, another pioneering female classicist at Vassar. In her correspondence, Macurdy praised Haight for her \\"executive ability\\" and described her as a teacher \\"whose enthusiasm and genuine love for her subject infect her classes\\". Haight's association with Macurdy continued throughout her career, as both taught together at Vassar for the remainder of their careers, and became close friends. This association also included their shared efforts in the public campaign to resist the removal of Bert Hodge Hill from his position at the American School of Classical Studies at Athens in the 1920s. Haight became chair of the Latin department at Vasser in 1923, and remained in this position until her retirement in 1942. Haight was the first woman to chair the Advisory Council of the then American School of Classical Studies at Rome, and in 1931 received a summer appointment to lecture at the University of Chicago. She was also elected as president of the American Philological Association in 1934 ‚Äì the second woman to hold that post. Her presidential address was entitled \\"Prose Fiction in the Augustan Age\\". During the mid-1930s, many scholars were emigrating from Germany under Nazi rule; Haight organized a program of these visiting scholars to Vassar College. She had similarly been influential in Vasser's war efforts during the First World War, acting as chair of the Faculty Committee on War Activities, as she believed that both Vasser and women were essential to the fight to protect democracy in the United States. During her long residency at Vassar College, Haight opened and voluntarily curated the Vassar Classical Museum, buying objects and inscriptions for it. This appreciation for the contributions of archaeology to a classical education was described by the classicist Donald Lateiner as \\"ahead of its time\\". She also wrote a history of the college, along with James Monroe Taylor, its president from 1886 to 1914. Upon meeting Mussolini in Italy in 1935, Haight presented him with works written about Italy by Vassar faculty. She gave the convocation address at Vasser twice ‚Äì once upon her appointment to professor in 1922, and again in 1941. Her second address was called \\"Education for Service\\", and demonstrated her commitment to the education of Vasser women as part of empowering them, and preparing them to be \\"strong citizens of the republic and the world\\" rather than \\"privileged princesses\\". She retired in 1942, but continued to be an active part of Vasser's community, including giving a speech praising Vasser and arguing for the role of education in benefiting the state of the country at Founders' Day 1952. That same year, the Elizabeth Hazelton Haight Fund for Research in Classics was established by a group of Vasser alumni, honoring her work. Haight was remembered both through this fund and the testimony of her colleagues for her support of students and faculty at Vasser throughout her time at the college. Haight died November 15, 1964, in Beacon, Dutchess County and is buried in Fort Hill Cemetery. At the 1965 meeting of the American Philological Association, Lily Ross Taylor read a tribute to Haight that praised her \\"devotion to the Classics and the \\"great achievement\\" of her teaching. Her obituary in The New York Times said she was \\"regarded at Vassar as the last of her era of outstanding women who dedicated their lives to the college\\". Scholarship Haight published eleven books on classical subjects, as well as histories of Vassar and James Monroe Taylor. Her first book in the field of Classics, Italy Old and New, published in 1922, featured a collection of essays and photos that drew on her own travels to classical sites (including a visit to Ostia Antica, and a search for Horace's Villa at Licenza). The book was aimed at a lay audience (a common theme among her later publications), and made no use of notes or references. Nonetheless, Haight's classical knowledge informed the project throughout. Haight followed this work with research primarily on Latin literature ‚Äì a topic that Haight worried had been falling out of favour in Classics, with archaeology and history becoming more popular. These books, Horace and His Art of Enjoyment (1925), Apuleius and His Influence (1927), Romance in the Latin Elegiac Poets (1932) and The Roman Use of Anecdotes in Cicero, Livy and the Satirists (1940) were all aimed at popular rather than scholarly audiences, and drew on a wide range of sources, both scholarly and otherwise. The works were variously described as \\"enthusiastic\\", \\"charming\\", and \\"interesting\\". From her work on Apuleius, Haight moved on to consider work in less popular genres, such fiction beyond the novel (Essays in Ancient Fiction (1936)), and the Greek novel (Essays on the Greek Romances (1943)) ‚Äì the latter being a particularly unpopular genre for study at the time, as Haight herself noted. This work was followed by More Essays on Greek Romances (1945). Both books were criticised by reviewers, and were not particularly popular. However, her interest in this genre at a time when it was generally neglected by scholars has led to her work being described as \\"pioneering\\". Her two penultimate books, the last published when she was 80, took up the topic of symbolism ‚Äì first The Symbolism of the House Door (1950) and then Aspects of Symbolism in the Latin Anthology and in Classical and Renaissance Art (1952). Haight's final published book was a translation of Pseudo-Callisthenes' Life of Alexander, published in 1955. In addition, she published multiple articles in a range of classical journals.

The staff, all volunteers, are students at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. The magazine covers topics in modern science and engineering, with a particular focus on University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison faculty research and student achievements. Most articles are written to be mainly informative, yet the magazine occasionally publishes opinion articles and satire articles related to engineering topics or controversies centered around the University of Wisconsin-Madison. The Wisconsin Engineer is published four times a year seasonally and distributed in print across the University of Wisconsin-Madison campus. The magazine offers paid subscriptions and, more recently, posts the full content of articles on their website. The Magazine has remained relatively local in its coverage, allowing it to foster relationships with professional organizations such as the Wisconsin Society of Professional Engineers. While the magazine is operated by students, a faculty adviser from the College of Engineering typically gives recommendations to the leadership. Steven Zwickel, a professor at the University of Wisconsin- Madison's Engineering Professional Development department, is the current adviser to the magazine. He has been with the magazine for over 15 years and is considered the \\"collective memory\\" of the magazine. As of 2017, The Wisconsin Engineer is a member of the Wisconsin Undergraduate Journal Association.  History  This is the cover from the third printed magazine from January 1897. The first volume of the Wisconsin Engineer was published in June 1896, with the editors calling the magazine a \\"trial trip in the field of technical journalism.\\" The magazine contained articles by both students and faculty with a focus on engineering topics. The magazine ran over 160 pages long, containing a large index and multiple advertisements. The magazine was published five more times before it settled into a continuous seasonal publication schedule in 1902 (with short periods of monthly publication). In March 1923 The Wisconsin Engineer was first shown represented at a meeting of Engineering College Magazines Associated (ECMA), a group made up of the engineering magazines of several universities across the United States. In addition to providing a venue for discussion on technical writing, ECMA allowed for standardized advertising across the magazines. This was a large source of revenue for The Wisconsin Engineer until the eventual decline of ECMA's financial influence in the 1980s century. In the early 21st century ECMA faded into obscurity as fewer magazines were interested in membership and conferences stopped being held. In 1972, Howard Schwebke incorporated the Wisconsin Engineer Journal Association as a non-profit corporation to take advantage of tax benefits and to reduce the magazine's reliance on and responsibility to the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Despite this independence, the magazine has been reliant on funding from the university in a few cases. In 1989 the Engineering Professional Development department sponsored an issue for $900, and in 1991 and 1992 the College of Engineering contributed $4000 and $7000, respectively. In 1995, facing $12,000 of debt, the magazine was offered relief from the university with the condition that print publications cease. Steven Zwickel, the faculty adviser of the magazine, helped a team of students create a business plan and make the magazine solvent again. Jon Furniss, editor-in-chief from 1996 to 1998, was one of the members of the new leadership and was pivotal in restarting The Wisconsin Engineer in its current form. In addition to working on the solvency plan, Furniss advocated to grant college credit to magazine members and recruit younger students.\\"A Brief Guide to the Wisconsin Engineer Magazine\\". Interdepartmental Archives on Groupspaces. Last Modified January 23, 2013. In the 2010s The Wisconsin Engineer made pushes to revamp their website, in an attempt to adapt to the changing world of news publishing. The Wisconsin Engineer currently publishes four editions a year in print and online.  Organizational Structure  Unlike other student organizations on the University of Wisconsin-Madison campus, The Wisconsin Engineer is responsible for its finances and organization as a non-profit corporation. The editor-in-chief, of which there are often two, serves as the highest position within the organization. The editor-in-chief is responsible for the publication, distribution, and financial solvency of the magazine. They also oversee the departments and conduct meetings. The writing department is in charge of writing the magazine's articles. A staffer will typically conduct at least one interview for an article, except for satire and opinion articles. An article will undergo three rounds of editing, focusing on content and article structure. The writing department heads, also acting as the editors, brainstorm story ideas and guide the article process for staffers. The business department manages the finances of the magazine and secures funding. Much of a staffer's job involves securing advertisements in the magazine, while the department heads oversee the staffers and advise the editor-in- chief. The photography department is in charge of taking photos and videos for the magazine. Photographers typically work with their partners in writing, often attending interviews. The graphic design department handles page layout for the printed edition of the magazine. In addition to these main roles, there is a managing editor and a copy editor. The managing editor, typically a former editor-in-chief, offers advice to leadership, while the copy editor, separate from the writing department, makes final fixes before an article is sent to publish.

Mia is a transgender woman of Japanese American descent, born in the Poston War Relocation Center during World War II.  Personal life  Yamamoto was born in Poston, Arizona in a Japanese-American internment camp during World War II. Her mother was a registered nurse and her father was a lawyer. Her family's experiences in the camp, and her father's subsequent exclusion from the then Whites-only Los Angeles County Bar Association were early factors that shaped Yamamoto's view on the legal system and race relations. Having been born \\"doing time\\" due to her race, she developed a sensitivity to clients who found themselves facing convictions and harsh punishments that they otherwise might be able to avoid, had they been white. Yamamoto and her brothers joined Mexican gangs, who were unafraid to stand up to racial injustice. Due to its potential psychological benefits, Yamamoto saw the gang lifestyle as somewhat positive. Gangs offered her a home away from home, and years later she was as a voice for previous gang members by serving as their trial lawyer. Yamamoto knew from an early age that her body did not match her identity, but did not know how to express her inner turmoil. While struggling with her gender identity she decided to enlist in the Army, and served from 1966-68. She was awarded the National Defense Service medal, Army Commendation Medal, and Vietnam campaign medal. After the army, she attended UCLA's School of Law, where she co-founded the Asian Pacific Islander Law Student Association (APILSA). In 1984 she opened her own practice, and has practiced law since. The salary that she earned as a lawyer helped her afford therapy, which began her journey towards realizing she was a trans woman. However, she was only able to find negative representations of the transgender community. Yamamoto tried to find her way through her transition with the arts, learning to dance and play music. The challenges of transition led her to the realization that she should become an activist for the transgender community. She married Kimberlee Tellez on September 2, 2015.  Career  In practice since 1985, Yamamoto has represented thousands of clients in over 200 jury trials, accused of crimes such as murder, sex offences, assault, drug offenses, theft, white-collar crimes, and DUI. Yamamoto was appointed to serve on the California Judicial Council Task Forces on Jury Improvement and on Fairness and Access in the Courts by the Chief Justice of the California Supreme Court. Yamamoto served as President of the California Attorneys for Criminal Justice in 2001. In 1999 she presented a lecture for President Clinton's Initiative on \\"Race and Criminal Justice\\" at George Washington University. She has been a guest for several panels, classes, and demonstrations for the American Bar Association, Los Angeles County Bar Association International Bridges to Justice, for which she trained criminal defense attorneys in the Republic of China. She has also been a commentator for print, radio and television news features. Awards and honors Yamamoto is the recipient of the Rainbow Key Award by the City of West Hollywood, the Liberty Award by Lambda Legal, and the Harvey Milk Legacy Award by Christopher Street West/LA Pride. She has also been honored by API Equality and the Los Angeles County Human Relations Commission for her advocacy on behalf of the LGBT community. She has received honors from the Criminal Courts Bar Association, National Lawyers Guild, and the Women Lawyers Association of Los Angeles.

Varying sources report 186 to 278 fatalities and several more injuries. It still is the worst train accident involving passenger trains in German history. Annette Schneider-Solis: Das schwerste Zugungl√ºck in Deutschland. In: Die Welt, 21 December 2009, retrieved 13 May 2017.  Background  The Berlin‚ÄìMagdeburg railway was equipped with Indusi train protection system at the time. Christmas Day 1939 fell on a Monday, which many families and soldiers used as a long weekend. Because of the Second World War, spare locomotives or coaches for relief trains were not available, so the existing trains were overcrowded. Express train D 10 (23:15 from Berlin Potsdamer Bahnhof to Cologne) had left Berlin on time, but due to excessive dwelling time and the blackout (most lights at stations were turned off) it was quickly delayed to up to 30 minutes. The following D 180 was scheduled to run from Berlin Potsdamer Bahnhof (departure 23:45) to Neunkirchen (Saar). It was pulled by a DRG Class 01 steam locomotive (no. 01 158), whose Indusi equipment was taken out for repairs. Due to the ongoing locomotive shortage it was put into service nevertheless. D 180 had fewer stops than the preceding express, so it quickly caught up with D 10 and was running one block behind it.  Accident  One station before Genthin, the D 180 passed Belicke block post signal at danger. The locomotive was not equipped with the Indusi system, which would have stopped the train. The driver later stated that all signals were showing a \\"green\\" aspect, which was denied by the signalman at Belicke. Speculation regarding the misinterpretation of the signals included difficult signal-sighting at night or driver error. After the train passed the signal at danger, the signalman at Belicke immediately warned the next signal box down the line at Genthin Ost (Genthin East). The signalman there tried to stop the D 180 by waving an emergency red lamp. This was seen by the driver of the preceding D 10, who made an emergency brake application and the train came to a stand at Genthin station at 00:51. Instead of then putting his signals to danger, the signalman at Genthin East continued to use the red lamp to try to warn the driver of D 180, but he did not notice it, presumably because he 'read through' to the next signal which was displaying the green aspect intended for the D 10. At 00:55 D 180 crashed into the rear of the stationary D 10 at approximately .  Aftermath  Memorial in the forecourt of Genthin station mentioning 278 deaths. The rear four coaches of the D 10 were partly destroyed and telescoped. The locomotives and six coaches of D 180 derailed. Official figures of Deutsche Reichsbahn report 186 fatalities and 106 injured. Other sources, including the memorial, claim 278 deaths and 453 injuries. Together with the 1948 BASF tank car explosion in Ludwigshafen, where 207 died and around 4.000 were injured, this is the worst railway accident in Germany. Emergency services on site proved difficult, as lights were not allowed to be used, because of the blackout. A special permission was needed to install floodlights. Many firemen were drafted for military services and were unavailable; in addition, temperatures sank to in the night and many injured froze to death. The driver and fireman of D 180 survived. The driver was later sentenced to prison for three years and six months. Locomotive 01 158, which pulled the D 180, was repaired and rejoined service in 1941. It is preserved today as 01 1531 in Bahnbetriebswerk Arnstadt railway museum in Arnstadt, Thuringia. Das Eisenbahnmuseum Arnstadt: Steam locomotive 01 1531. Retrieved 13 May 2017.

Which can be translated into: \\"In the meantime, the famous knight Jan Persijn secretly went out of the city, captured Kennemer vehicles loaded with provisions and after that set several enemy villages on fire\\". This led the besiegers to leave the siege and return to their homes. They were chased and defeated by the Haarlemmers.

The Coralville Union Ecclesiastical Society was formed to build a new church. The simple brick structure with a gable roof was built about 1885 to serve as a multi- denominational church on the main floor and as a town hall on the lower level. Any orthodox church, which excluded the Unitarians or Universalists, could use the building. In addition to the town's administration, the lower level could be used for a variety of social functions, excluding dancing. The town purchased the building in 1921 for $2,500, and it was used as a school, a meeting house for the Evangelical Free Church, and as the town's administrative center. It was renovated for the later purpose in 1953. After its use as a town hall the building was converted into a museum. The building stood in the way of economic development, and in order to preserve it, the city of Coralville moved it from Second Avenue to Fifth Street in 2014. It now sits across the street from the historic Coralville Public School (1876). Both buildings flank the entrance to a mixed use development known as Old Town.

The team's home matches are played throughout Hong Kong. History Kwong Wah were formed in 1936 by a group of coworkers at CLP Group. Among them, there were local and foreign players including future star Hau Yung Seng. The year after their formation, they won the 1937‚Äì38 Hong Kong Junior Shield as well as promotion into the Hong Kong Second Division. The club reached the Hong Kong First Division in 1947. For two for their first three seasons in the top flight, Kwong Wah finished at the bottom of the table but because there was no relegation during that time, they remained. In the early 1950s, Kwong Wah were sponsored by Shanghai businessmen including Xu Wenkui. They signed a number of Shanghai-based players to help the squad such as Zhang Jinhai, Wu Qixiang, Chen Mingzhe, Luo Shoufu, and Yan Shixin. During their 18-year stay in the First Division, their highest table finish was fourth place achieved during the 1963‚Äì64 season. The club won one trophy over that run, capturing the 1962‚Äì63 Hong Kong Senior Shield. Alas, a last place finish in the 1965‚Äì66 doomed the club for relegation. Kwong Wah would spend the next seven seasons in the Second Division until a runners up finish during the 1972‚Äì73 season helped the club to achieve promotion back into the First Division. They were led at that time by former Criminal Investigation Department director Yan Hung who purchased star keeper Ho Yung Hing the following season to strengthen the squad. Their stay lasted four seasons until the club finished second bottom of the table in 1976‚Äì77 and were relegated once again. In 1990‚Äì91, the club finished second bottom in the Second Division and were relegated to the Hong Kong Third A Division. Due to a merger of the two Third Division leagues by the Hong Kong Football Association, Kwong Wah began the 2012‚Äì13 season in the Hong Kong Fourth Division. Thanks to a third- place finish, they were able to gain promotion back into the Third Division after just one season. The club finished 10th in the 2016‚Äì17 season, narrowly escaping relegation to the Third Division based on winning the head to head tiebreaker against Kwok Keung.

The class gives a broad indication of an amplifier's characteristics and performance. The classes are related to the time period that the active amplifier device is passing current, expressed as a fraction of the period of a signal waveform applied to the input. A class A amplifier is conducting through all the period of the signal; Class B only for one-half the input period, class C for much less than half the input period. A Class D amplifier operates its output device in a switching manner; the fraction of the time that the device is conducting is adjusted so a pulse width modulation output is obtained from the stage. Additional letter classes are defined for special purpose amplifiers, with additional active elements or particular power supply improvements; sometimes a new letter symbol is used by a manufacturer to promote its proprietary design.  Power amplifier classes  Power amplifier circuits (output stages) are classified as A, B, AB and C for linear designs‚Äîand class D and E for switching designs. The classes are based on the proportion of each input cycle (conduction angle) during which an amplifying device passes current. The image of the conduction angle derives from amplifying a sinusoidal signal. If the device is always on, the conducting angle is 360¬∞. If it is on for only half of each cycle, the angle is 180¬∞. The angle of flow is closely related to the amplifier power efficiency. In the illustrations below, a bipolar junction transistor is shown as the amplifying device. However the same attributes are found with MOSFETs or vacuum tubes. = Class A = Class-A amplifier In a Class A amplifier, 100% of the input signal is used (conduction angle Œò = 360¬∞). The active element remains conductingRCA Receiving Tube Manual, RC-14 (1940) p 12 all of the time. Amplifying devices operating in class A conduct over the entire range of the input cycle. A class-A amplifier is distinguished by the output stage devices being biased for class A operation. Subclass A2 is sometimes used to refer to vacuum-tube class-A stages that drive the grid slightly positive on signal peaks for slightly more power than normal class A (A1; where the grid is always negativeARRL Handbook, 1968; page 65). This, however, incurs higher signal distortion.  Advantages of class-A amplifiers  * Class-A designs can be simpler than other classes insofar as class -AB and -B designs require two connected devices in the circuit (push‚Äìpull output), each to handle one half of the waveform whereas class A can use a single device (single-ended). * The amplifying element is biased so the device is always conducting, the quiescent (small-signal) collector current (for transistors; drain current for FETs or anode/plate current for vacuum tubes) is close to the most linear portion of its transconductance curve. * Because the device is never 'off' there is no \\"turn on\\" time, no problems with charge storage, and generally better high frequency performance and feedback loop stability (and usually fewer high-order harmonics). * The point where the device comes closest to being 'off' is not at 'zero signal', so the problems of crossover distortion associated with class-AB and -B designs is avoided. * Best for low signal levels of radio receivers due to low distortion.  Disadvantage of class-A amplifiers  * Class-A amplifiers are inefficient. A maximum theoretical efficiency of 25% is obtainable using usual configurations, but 50% is the maximum for a transformer or inductively coupled configuration.[whites.sdsmt.edu/classes/ee322/class_notes/322Lecture18.pdf EE 332 Class Notes Lecture 18: Common Emitter Amplifier. Maximum Efficiency of Class A Amplifiers. Transformer Coupled Loads.http://www.n5dux.com/ham/files/pdf/NorCal%2040A%20-%20PPTs/322Lecture18.pdf] In a power amplifier, this not only wastes power and limits operation with batteries, but increases operating costs and requires higher-rated output devices. Inefficiency comes from the standing current, which must be roughly half the maximum output current, and a large part of the power supply voltage is present across the output device at low signal levels. If high output power is needed from a class-A circuit, the power supply and accompanying heat becomes significant. For every watt delivered to the load, the amplifier itself, at best, uses an extra watt. For high power amplifiers this means very large and expensive power supplies and heat sinks. * Because the output devices are in full operation at all times (unlike a Class A/B amplifier), they will not have as long a life unless the amplifier is specifically over- designed to take this into account, adding to the cost of maintaining or designing the amplifier. Class-A power amplifier designs have largely been superseded by more efficient designs, though their simplicity makes them popular with some hobbyists. There is a market for expensive high fidelity class-A amps considered a \\"cult item\\" among audiophilesJerry Del Colliano (20 February 2012), Pass Labs XA30.5 Class-A Stereo Amp Reviewed, Home Theater Review, Luxury Publishing Group Inc. mainly for their absence of crossover distortion and reduced odd-harmonic and high-order harmonic distortion. Class A power amps are also used in some \\"boutique\\" guitar amplifiers due to their unique tonal quality and for reproducing vintage tones.  Single-ended and triode class-A amplifiers  Some hobbyists who prefer class-A amplifiers also prefer the use of thermionic valve (tube) designs instead of transistors, for several reasons: * Single-ended output stages have an asymmetrical transfer function, meaning that even-order harmonics in the created distortion tend to not cancel out (as they do in push‚Äìpull output stages). For tubes, or FETs, most distortion is second-order harmonics, from the square law transfer characteristic, which to some produces a \\"warmer\\" and more pleasant sound.Ask the Doctors: Tube vs. Solid-State HarmonicsVolume cranked up in amp debate * For those who prefer low distortion figures, the use of tubes with class A (generating little odd-harmonic distortion, as mentioned above) together with symmetrical circuits (such as push‚Äìpull output stages, or balanced low-level stages) results in the cancellation of most of the even distortion harmonics, hence the removal of most of the distortion. * Historically, valve amplifiers were often used as a class-A power amplifier simply because valves are large and expensive; many class-A designs use only a single device. Transistors are much less expensive than tubes so more elaborate designs that use more parts are still less expensive to manufacture than tube designs. A classic application for a pair of class-A devices is the long-tailed pair, which is exceptionally linear, and forms the basis of many more complex circuits, including many audio amplifiers and almost all op-amps. Class-A amplifiers may be used in output stages of op-amps (although the accuracy of the bias in low cost op-amps such as the 741 may result in class A or class AB or class B performance, varying from device to device or with temperature). They are sometimes used as medium-power, low-efficiency, and high-cost audio power amplifiers. The power consumption is unrelated to the output power. At idle (no input), the power consumption is essentially the same as at high output volume. The result is low efficiency and high heat dissipation. = Class B = Ideal class-B (push‚Äìpull) amplifier. In practice, distortion occurs near the crossover point. In a class-B amplifier, the active device conducts for 180 degrees of the cycle. This would cause intolerable distortion if there were only one device, so two devices are usually used, especially at audio frequencies. Each conducts for one half (180¬∞) of the signal cycle, and the device currents are combined so that the load current is continuous.Circuit Cellar - Amplifier classes from a to h At radio frequency, if the coupling to the load is via a tuned circuit, a single device operating in class B can be used because the stored energy in the tuned circuit supplies the \\"missing\\" half of the waveform. Devices operating in Class B are used in linear amplifiers, so called because the radio frequency output power is proportional to the square of the input excitation voltage. This characteristic prevents distortion of amplitude-modulated or frequency-modulated signals passing through the amplifier. Such amplifiers have an efficiency around 60%.Larry Wolfgang, Charles Hutchinson (ed), The ARRL Handbook for Radio Amateurs, Sixty-Eighth Edition (1991), American Radio Relay League, 1990, , pages 3-17, 5-6, When Class-B amplifiers amplify the signal with two active devices, each operates over one half of the cycle. Efficiency is much improved over class-A amplifiers. Class-B amplifiers are also favoured in battery-operated devices, such as transistor radios. Class B has a maximum theoretical efficiency of œÄ/4 (‚âà 78.5%). A practical circuit using class-B elements is the push‚Äìpull stage, such as the very simplified complementary pair arrangement shown at right. Complementary devices are each used for amplifying the opposite halves of the input signal, which is then recombined at the output. This arrangement gives good efficiency, but usually suffers from the drawback that there is a small mismatch in the cross-over region at the \\"joins\\" between the two halves of the signal, as one output device has to take over supplying power exactly as the other finishes. This is called crossover distortion. An improvement is to bias the devices so they are not completely off when they are not in use. This approach is called class AB operation. = Class AB = Ideal class-AB amplifier In a class-AB amplifier, the conduction angle is intermediate between class A and B; each one of the two active elements conducts more than half of the time. Class AB is widely considered a good compromise for amplifiers, since much of the time the music signal is quiet enough that the signal stays in the \\"class-A\\" region, where it is amplified with good fidelity, and by definition if passing out of this region, is large enough that the distortion products typical of class B are relatively small. The crossover distortion can be reduced further by using negative feedback. In class-AB operation, each device operates the same way as in class B over half the waveform, but also conducts a small amount on the other half. As a result, the region where both devices simultaneously are nearly off (the \\"dead zone\\") is reduced. The result is that when the waveforms from the two devices are combined, the crossover is greatly minimised or eliminated altogether. The exact choice of quiescent current (the standing current through both devices when there is no signal) makes a large difference to the level of distortion (and to the risk of thermal runaway, which may damage the devices). Often, bias voltage applied to set this quiescent current must be adjusted with the temperature of the output transistors. (For example, in the circuit shown at right, the diodes would be mounted physically close to the output transistors, and specified to have a matched temperature coefficient.) Another approach (often used with thermally tracking bias voltages) is to include small value resistors in series with the emitters. Class AB sacrifices some efficiency over class B in favor of linearity, thus is less efficient (below 78.5% for full-amplitude sine waves in transistor amplifiers, typically; much less is common in class-AB vacuum-tube amplifiers). It is typically much more efficient than class A. = Suffix numbers for vacuum tube amplifiers = A vacuum tube amplifier design will sometimes have an additional suffix number for the class, for example, class B1. A suffix 1 indicates that grid current does not flow during any part of the input waveform, where a suffix 2 indicates grid current flows for part of the input waveform. This distinction affects the design of the driver stages for the amplifier. Suffix numbers are not used for semiconductor amplifiers. Douglas Self, Audio Engineering Explained, CRC Press, 2012, , page 271 = Class C = Class-C amplifier In a class-C amplifier, less than 50% of the input signal is used (conduction angle Œò < 180¬∞). Distortion is high and practical use requires a tuned circuit as load. Efficiency can reach 80% in radio-frequency applications. The usual application for class-C amplifiers is in RF transmitters operating at a single fixed carrier frequency, where the distortion is controlled by a tuned load on the amplifier. The input signal is used to switch the active device, causing pulses of current to flow through a tuned circuit forming part of the load. The class-C amplifier has two modes of operation: tuned and untuned.A.P. Malvino, Electronic Principles (2nd Ed.1979. ) p.299. The diagram shows a waveform from a simple class-C circuit without the tuned load. This is called untuned operation, and the analysis of the waveforms shows the massive distortion that appears in the signal. When the proper load (e.g., an inductive-capacitive filter plus a load resistor) is used, two things happen. The first is that the output's bias level is clamped with the average output voltage equal to the supply voltage. This is why tuned operation is sometimes called a clamper. This restores the waveform to its proper shape, despite the amplifier having only a one-polarity supply. This is directly related to the second phenomenon: the waveform on the center frequency becomes less distorted. The residual distortion is dependent upon the bandwidth of the tuned load, with the center frequency seeing very little distortion, but greater attenuation the farther from the tuned frequency that the signal gets. The tuned circuit resonates at one frequency, the fixed carrier frequency, and so the unwanted frequencies are suppressed, and the wanted full signal (sine wave) is extracted by the tuned load. The signal bandwidth of the amplifier is limited by the Q-factor of the tuned circuit but this is not a serious limitation. Any residual harmonics can be removed using a further filter. In practical class-C amplifiers a tuned load is invariably used. In one common arrangement the resistor shown in the circuit above is replaced with a parallel-tuned circuit consisting of an inductor and capacitor in parallel, whose components are chosen to resonate at the frequency of the input signal. Power can be coupled to a load by transformer action with a secondary coil wound on the inductor. The average voltage at the collector is then equal to the supply voltage, and the signal voltage appearing across the tuned circuit varies from near zero to near twice the supply voltage during the RF cycle. The input circuit is biased so that the active element (e.g., transistor) conducts for only a fraction of the RF cycle, usually one third (120 degrees) or less.Electronic and Radio Engineering, R.P.Terman, McGraw Hill, 1964 The active element conducts only while the collector voltage is passing through its minimum. By this means, power dissipation in the active device is minimised, and efficiency increased. Ideally, the active element would pass only an instantaneous current pulse while the voltage across it is zero: it then dissipates no power and 100% efficiency is achieved. However practical devices have a limit to the peak current they can pass, and the pulse must therefore be widened, to around 120 degrees, to obtain a reasonable amount of power, and the efficiency is then 60‚Äì70%. = Class D = Block diagram of a basic switching or PWM (class-D) amplifier. Boss Audio class-D mono amplifier with a low-pass filter for powering subwoofers Class-D amplifiers use some form of pulse-width modulation to control the output devices. The conduction angle of each device is no longer related directly to the input signal but instead varies in pulse width. In the class-D amplifier the active devices (transistors) function as electronic switches instead of linear gain devices; they are either on or off. The analog signal is converted to a stream of pulses that represents the signal by pulse-width modulation, pulse-density modulation, delta-sigma modulation or a related modulation technique before being applied to the amplifier. The time average power value of the pulses is directly proportional to the analog signal, so after amplification the signal can be converted back to an analog signal by a passive low-pass filter. The purpose of the output filter is to smooth the pulse stream to an analog signal, removing the high frequency spectral components of the pulses. The frequency of the output pulses is typically ten or more times the highest frequency in the input signal to amplify, so that the filter can adequately reduce the unwanted harmonics and accurately reproduce the input. The main advantage of a class-D amplifier is power efficiency. Because the output pulses have a fixed amplitude, the switching elements (usually MOSFETs, but vacuum tubes, and at one time bipolar transistors, were used) are switched either completely on or completely off, rather than operated in linear mode. A MOSFET operates with the lowest resistance when fully on and thus (excluding when fully off) has the lowest power dissipation when in that condition. Compared to an equivalent class-AB device, a class-D amplifier's lower losses permit the use of a smaller heat sink for the MOSFETs while also reducing the amount of input power required, allowing for a lower-capacity power supply design. Therefore, class-D amplifiers are typically smaller than an equivalent class-AB amplifier. Another advantage of the class-D amplifier is that it can operate from a digital signal source without requiring a digital-to-analog converter (DAC) to convert the signal to analog form first. If the signal source is in digital form, such as in a digital media player or computer sound card, the digital circuitry can convert the binary digital signal directly to a pulse-width modulation signal that is applied to the amplifier, simplifying the circuitry considerably. Class-D amplifiers are widely used to control motors‚Äîbut are now also used as power amplifiers, with extra circuitry that converts analogue to a much higher frequency pulse width modulated signal. Switching power supplies have even been modified into crude class-D amplifiers (though typically these only reproduce low-frequencies with acceptable accuracy). High quality class-D audio power amplifiers have now appeared on the market. These designs have been said to rival traditional AB amplifiers in terms of quality. An early use of class-D amplifiers was high-power subwoofer amplifiers in cars. Because subwoofers are generally limited to a bandwidth of no higher than 150 Hz, switching speed for the amplifier does not have to be as high as for a full range amplifier, allowing simpler designs. Class-D amplifiers for driving subwoofers are relatively inexpensive in comparison to class-AB amplifiers. The letter D used to designate this amplifier class is simply the next letter after C and, although occasionally used as such, does not stand for digital. Class-D and class-E amplifiers are sometimes mistakenly described as \\"digital\\" because the output waveform superficially resembles a pulse-train of digital symbols, but a class-D amplifier merely converts an input waveform into a continuously pulse-width modulated analog signal. (A digital waveform would be pulse-code modulated.) = Additional classes = Other amplifier classes are mainly variations of the previous classes. For example, class-G and class-H amplifiers are marked by variation of the supply rails (in discrete steps or in a continuous fashion, respectively) following the input signal. Wasted heat on the output devices can be reduced as excess voltage is kept to a minimum. The amplifier that is fed with these rails itself can be of any class. These kinds of amplifiers are more complex, and are mainly used for specialized applications, such as very high-power units. Also, class-E and class-F amplifiers are commonly described in literature for radio-frequency applications where efficiency of the traditional classes is important, yet several aspects deviate substantially from their ideal values. These classes use harmonic tuning of their output networks to achieve higher efficiency and can be considered a subset of class C due to their conduction- angle characteristics.  Class E  The class-E amplifier is a highly efficient tuned switching power amplifier used at radio frequencies. It uses a single-pole switching element and a tuned reactive network between the switch and the load. The circuit obtains high efficiency by only operating the switching element at points of zero current (on to off switching) or zero voltage (off to on switching) which minimizes power lost in the switch, even when the switching time of the devices is long compared to the frequency of operation. Mihai Albulet, RF Power Amplifiers, SciTech Publishing, 2001, pages 216-220 The class-E amplifier is frequently cited to have been first reported in 1975.N. O. Sokal and A. D. Sokal, \\"Class E A New Class of High-Efficiency Tuned Single-Ended Switching Power Amplifiers\\", IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits, vol. SC-10, pp. 168‚Äì176, June 1975. However, a full description of class-E operation may be found in the 1964 doctoral thesis of Gerald D. Ewing.Gerald Dean Ewing, \\"High-Efficiency Radio-Frequency Power Amplifiers\\", Oregon State University, submitted in April, 1964. Interestingly, analytical design-equations only recently became known.Acar, M., Annema, A. J., & Nauta, B. \\"Analytical Design Equations for Class-E Power Amplifiers\\", IEEE transactions on circuits and systems I: regular papers, vol. 54, no. 12, pp. 2706‚Äì2717. 2007. https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2007.910544  Class F  In push‚Äìpull amplifiers and in CMOS, the even harmonics of both transistors just cancel. Experiment shows that a square wave can be generated by those amplifiers. Theoretically square waves consist of odd harmonics only. In a class-D amplifier, the output filter blocks all harmonics; i.e., the harmonics see an open load. So even small currents in the harmonics suffice to generate a voltage square wave. The current is in phase with the voltage applied to the filter, but the voltage across the transistors is out of phase. Therefore, there is a minimal overlap between current through the transistors and voltage across the transistors. The sharper the edges, the lower the overlap. While in class D, transistors and the load exist as two separate modules, class F admits imperfections like the parasitics of the transistor and tries to optimise the global system to have a high impedance at the harmonics.http://rfic.eecs.berkeley.edu/~niknejad/ee242/pdf/eecs242_class_EF_PAs.pdf Of course there must be a finite voltage across the transistor to push the current across the on-state resistance. Because the combined current through both transistors is mostly in the first harmonic, it looks like a sine. That means that in the middle of the square the maximum of current has to flow, so it may make sense to have a dip in the square or in other words to allow some overswing of the voltage square wave. A class-F load network by definition has to transmit below a cutoff frequency and reflect above. Any frequency lying below the cutoff and having its second harmonic above the cutoff can be amplified, that is an octave bandwidth. On the other hand, an inductive- capacitive series circuit with a large inductance and a tunable capacitance may be simpler to implement. By reducing the duty cycle below 0.5, the output amplitude can be modulated. The voltage square waveform degrades, but any overheating is compensated by the lower overall power flowing. Any load mismatch behind the filter can only act on the first harmonic current waveform, clearly only a purely resistive load makes sense, then the lower the resistance, the higher the current. Class F can be driven by sine or by a square wave, for a sine the input can be tuned by an inductor to increase gain. If class F is implemented with a single transistor, the filter is complicated to short the even harmonics. All previous designs use sharp edges to minimise the overlap.  Classes G and H  Idealized class-G rail voltage modulation Idealized class-H rail voltage modulation Rail voltage modulation Basic schematic of a class-H configuration There are a variety of amplifier designs that enhance class-AB output stages with more efficient techniques to achieve greater efficiency with low distortion. These designs are common in large audio amplifiers since the heatsinks and power transformers would be prohibitively large (and costly) without the efficiency increases. The terms \\"class G\\" and \\"class H\\" are used interchangeably to refer to different designs, varying in definition from one manufacturer or paper to another. Class-G amplifiers (which use \\"rail switching\\" to decrease power consumption and increase efficiency) are more efficient than class-AB amplifiers. These amplifiers provide several power rails at different voltages and switch between them as the signal output approaches each level. Thus, the amplifier increases efficiency by reducing the wasted power at the output transistors. Class-G amplifiers are more efficient than class AB but less efficient when compared to class D, however, they do not have the electromagnetic interference effects of class D. Class-H amplifiers create an infinitely variable (analog) supply rail. They are sometimes referred to as rail trackers. This is done by modulating the supply rails so that the rails are only a few volts larger than the output signal \\"tracking\\" it at any given time. The output stage operates at its maximum efficiency all the time. This is due to the circuit ability to keep the rail transistors (T2 and T4) in cutoff until a music voltage peak is of a sufficient magnitude to require the additional voltage from the + and - 80 V supplies. Refer to the schematic figure. The class H amplifier can actually be thought of as two amplifiers in series. In the schematic example shown by the figure, + - 40 V rail amplifiers can produce about 100 Watts continuous into an 8 ohm load. If vout music signal is operating below 40 volts, the amplifier only has the losses associated with a 100 W amplifier. This is because the Class H upper devices T2 and T4 are only used when the music signal is between 100 and 400 Watts output. The key to understanding this efficiency without churning the actual numbers is that we have a 400 Watt capable amplifier but with the efficiency of a 100 Watt amplifier. This is because the wave-forms of music contain long periods under 100 Watts and contain only brief bursts of up to 400 Watts instantaneous; in other words, the losses at 400 Watts are for brief time periods. If this example were drawn as a class AB with just the 80 V supplies in place of the 40 V supplies, the T1 and T3 transistors would need to be in conduction throughout the 0 V to 80 V signal with the corresponding VI losses all through the vout wave period - not just the brief high energy bursts. To achieve this rail tracking control, T2 and T4 act as current amplifiers, each in series with its low voltage counterpart T1 and T3. The purpose of T2 and T3 is to allow back-biasing diode D2 when vout is at a positive peak (above 39.3 V) and back biasing D4 when vout is at negative peak less than -39.3 V. During the vout musical peaks from 100 to 400 Watts, the 40 V supplies have zero Amperes drawn from them as all current comes from the 80 V rails. This figure is too simplistic however as It will not actually control the T2 T4 transistors at all. This is because the D1 and D3 diodes which are intended to provide a path for the vout back into the upper devices are always reverse biased. They are drawn backwards. In place of these diodes, a voltage amplifier with gain which uses vout as its input would be needed in an actual design. There is another reason for this gain requirement between vout and T2 base in an actual class H design and that is to assure that the signal applied to the T2 is always \\"ahead\\" of the Vout signal so it can never \\"catch up\\" with the rail tracker. The rail tracker amplifier might have a 50 V/¬µs slew rate while the AB amplifier might have only a 30 V/¬µs slew rate in order to guarantee this.

Life Phillpotts was born in Ealing, London and went to a local boarding school and then to Grassendale School in Southbourne, Dorset. Later she studied social care at Bedford College. As a 12-year-old girl she looked up to her slightly older Torquay neighbour Agatha Miller (later known to the world as Agatha Christie). Her father, the successful and prolific writer Eden Phillpotts, was impressed enough by Agatha's early work to help her with it, but at that point unsuccessfully. Amongst other literary celebrities who visited the Phillpotts family were Thomas Hardy and Arnold Bennett. Eden Phillpotts treated his daughter as an extension of himself. Her long-held secret, revealed in an interview in 1976 long after her father had died, was that the relationship had been incestuous. She contrasted his obsessive, controlling \\"love\\" for her by saying that she loved him too, but only as a father. However she was compliant to his demands.

A.; January 4, 1838 ‚Äì June 4, 1912) was a 19th-century American writer (journalist, novelist), lecturer, teacher, and feminist from Ohio. Conner began writing for newspapers at the age of 13. She served in various roles for the Saturday Evening Post, of Philadelphia, the Commercial of Cincinnati, and the New York World of New York City. She also worked towards the emancipation and advancement of women. She died in New York in 1912. Early years and education Eliza Archard was born January 4, 1838 in Monroe Township, Clermont County, Ohio on a farm near Cincinnati. Her parents were James and Jane Archard. Her ancestors were of Quaker, German Moravian, Irish and English Presbyterian background. They were among the pioneers of southern Ohio, and one of them founded the town of New Richmond. She was educated in Antioch College, Yellow Springs, Ohio, taking the full course in classics and higher mathematics. Her first newspaper contribution was printed when she was 13 years old. Career In her early career, she was a teacher and instructor in Latin and German in the Indianapolis High School. There, her persistent refusal to accept less wages than had been previously paid to a man teacher for doing the same work resulted in the passing of a rule by the school board that teachers of both sexes in the high school should receive the same salary. In 1865, she became a regular contributor to the Saturday Evening Post, of Philadelphia, under the name of \\"Zig.\\" Later, she wrote for the Cincinnati Commercial, (later, Cincinnati Commercial Tribune) signing the initials \\"E. A\\"; she joined the editorial staff in 1878. Conner went to New York City in 1884, serving as a literary editor of the New York World. In the following year, she accepted a place on the editorial staff of the American Press Association syndicate in New York. In editorial writing, she regularly furnished two columns daily of 1,000 words each. Connor performed various types of newspaper work, including police-court reporting, as well as editing a live-stock and dairy department, and served as a war correspondent, covering the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War. Her letters to the Commercial from Europe were published in a volume called \\"E. A. Abroad\\" (Cincinnati, 1883). She also wrote several serial stories. An important part of her work for the American Press Association was the preparation of a series of newspaper pages of war history, describing the battles of the American Civil War. Conner is also remembered as a novelist, and for her address before the International Press Congress of Chicago. Feminist In her girlhood, Conner worked towards the emancipation and advancement of women. She originated classes in parliamentary usage and extempore speaking among women. Wherever occasion permitted, she wrote and spoke in favor of equal pay for equal work, and of widening the industrial field for women. She was deeply interested in psychological studies and in oriental philosophy, accepting the ancient doctrine of repeated incarnation for the same individual. She was an enthusiast on the subject of physical culture for women, believing that mankind were meant to live out-doors and sleep in houses. She was a member of Sorosis and of the Woman's Press Club of New York City. Personal life On January 1, 1869, she married Dr. George Conner (born 1844), of Cincinnati. His paternal and maternal ancestors saw active service in the American Revolutionary War. He attended the district school of his neighborhood. In 1862, he enlisted in Company G, Fiftieth O. V. L, and participated with that regiment in many battles and skirmishes. He was with Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman during his Atlanta Campaign, and was also with Gen. George Henry Thomas at the battle of Jacksborough, July 22, 1862. At the close of the war, Dr. Conner returned home, and soon afterward entered Parker's Academy where he was graduated in 1800. He attended Miami Medical College, from which he was graduated in 1872, with the degree of Medical Doctor, and he at once began the practice of medicine in Cincinnati. He took an active interest in the Cincinnati Academy of Medicine, and the Ohio State Medical Society. He frequently wrote for newspapers and various periodicals. Conner and her husband were the parents of one child, Halstead A., who was connected with Specker Brothers & Company, Cincinnati. She died June 4, 1912 in Manhattan. Selected works * 1883, \\"E.

She has served as Bishop of Aberdeen and Orkney in the Scottish Episcopal Church since 2018. Previously, from 2005 to 2011, she was the Warden of Cranmer Hall, Durham, a theological college of the Church of England. Then, she was Rector of Holy Trinity Church, Haddington, East Lothian in the Diocese of Edinburgh between 2011 and 2018. Early life and education Dyer was born in February 1957 in Bradford, Yorkshire, England. She was educated at Bradford Girls' Grammar School, an all-girls independent school. She studied chemistry at St Anne's College, Oxford, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree: as per tradition, her BA was later promoted to a Master of Arts (MA Oxon) degree. She then worked as a business analyst/systems analyst at Unilever. In 1984, Dyer entered Wycliffe Hall, Oxford, an Evangelical Anglican theological college, to train for ordained ministry. During this time, she also studied theology. She left theological college in 1987 to be ordained in the Church of England. She continued her theological studies, and completed a Master of Theology (MTh) degree at King's College, London in 1989. Ordained ministry Dyer was ordained in the Church of England as a deacon in 1987 and as a priest in 1994. All Dyer's parish ministry in the Church of England was spent in the Diocese of Rochester. While she continued her studies, she held two non-stipendiary minister (NSM) appointments: at St John's Church, Eden Park (1987 to 1988), and at St George's Church, Beckenham (1988 to 1989). From 1989 to 1994, she was parish deacon of Christ Church, Luton. In 1993, she was appointed an associate adviser in evangelism for the diocese. From 1994 to 1998, she was also an NSM of St Barnabas' Church, Istead Rise. Then, from 1998 to 2004, she was the Ministry Development Officer for the Diocese of Rochester. In 2000, she was appointed an Honorary Canon of Rochester Cathedral. In August 2004, Dyer was announced as the next Warden of Cranmer Hall, Durham. Cranmer Hall is an evangelical Anglican theological college that forms part of St John's College, Durham University. In January 2005, she took up the appointment following her licensing by the Bishop of Durham (Tom Wright). In 2008, she was appointed an honorary canon of Durham Cathedral. She stepped down as warden in 2011, and was succeeded by Mark Tanner. In 2011, Dyer moved to the Scottish Episcopal Church, having been appointed rector of Holy Trinity Church, Haddington, East Lothian in the Diocese of Edinburgh. Since 2015, she has also been a member of the council of the Scottish Episcopal Institute, the Scottish Episcopal Church's theological college. =Episcopal ministry= On 9 November 2017, Dyer was selected as the next Bishop of Aberdeen and Orkney, making her the first woman to have become a bishop in the Scottish Episcopal Church. Her selection caused controversy due to her gender, support of same-sex marriage, and that she was not elected by the diocese itself (she was appointed by the house of Bishops after the diocese failed to choose its own bishop). Two senior clergy in the diocese resigned their diocesan roles in protest, including Emsley Nimmo, the dean of the Diocese of Aberdeen and Orkney. She was consecrated a bishop on 1 March 2018 during a service at St Andrew's Cathedral, Aberdeen. =Views= Dyer identifies with the Open Evangelical tradition of Anglicanism. In December 2014, Dyer signed an open letter to the bishops of the Scottish Episcopal Church that was supportive of same-sex marriage: it concluded with a \\"wish to make clear our continuing commitment to affirm and support all people in our church, and to recognise and rejoice in all marriages, of whatever sexual orientation, as true signs of the love of God in Christ.\\" With the SEC voting to allow same-sex marriages, she conducted her first such marriage in October 2017. Personal life Dyer is married to Roger. Together they have one child, a daughter.

Early life He was the son of Rittmeister Alexander Wichart von Wartenberg and Katharina Dorothea von Platen. He was first taught at home and came to the cadet corps in 1726; cadet corps records indicate he was 16 years of age on 16 May 1726. He remained in the cadet corps for five years, five months and was deployed to the king of Prussia's regiment.Adolf Friedrich Johannes von Crousaz, Geschichte des K√∂niglich Preussischen Kadetten-Corps: nach seiner Entstehung H. Schindler, 1857, 34. Upon his graduation, in 1730 he was in the retinue of Frederick William I (Prussia) at the large military service in M√ºhlberg. In 1731 he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant, and in the same year he enjoyed the distinction of being allowed to go to Russia with a royal license, in order to assist the Prussian army under Generalfeldmarschall Burkhard Christoph von M√ºnnich. He became a Russian first lieutenant at once and, from 1732-1739, he participated in the Russian campaigns against the Poles, Tatars, and Turks.Bernhard von Poten, Wartenberg, Hartwig Karl von.

Military career Frederick II recalled him on his accession to the throne in 1740 and transferred him as a major to the Natzmer regiment, which had been established in 1740 and became the Hussars Regiment No. 4 in 1742. On 2 March 1741 he was transferred to the Hussars Regiment No. 3 as lieutenant colonel. In 1744 he acquired the Order Pour le M√©rite after he helped suppress the insurgency in Silesia at Plesse. Subsequently, he was assigned to the corps of General Ernst Christoph von Nassau. On 5 April 1745, Hyacinth Malachow von Malachowsky, the Proprietor (Inhaber) of the regiment was killed in a skirmish at Gross-Strelitz;G√ºnther Gieraths, Die Kampfhandlungen der brandenburgisch-preussischen Armee, 1626-1807, Walter de Gruyter, 1964, 274. he was subsequently promoted to colonel and chief of the Hussars' Regiment No. 3 on 20 April 1745. On 3 September 1751 he was promoted to major general. He had attained such a reputation that the King ordered some officers of the Brandenburg and the Magdeburg cavalry regiments to join the Hussar Regiment Wartenberg, in order to perfect themselves in the cavalry service. In 1750 he received the Golmenglin estate in Zerbst (today a district of Grimme), which he sold with permission to Count von Melsch. He received the preeminence of the Abbey of Essen, and a sabre richly decorated with stones. In 1755 he bought the estate of Sch√∂nfeld from a Count von P√ºckler. At the outbreak of the Seven Years' War, in 1756, Wartenberg had with his regiment the advanced guard of the army division of the General Field Marshal Kurt Christoph von Schwerin. This service was also assigned to him and his regiment in 1757, when the army entered Bohemia under Schwerin. On the 2 May, he was instructed to secure the bridges and post roads in Alt-Bunzlau, to keep the Austrians from setting them on fire. With his regiment, and greatly outnumbered, he attacked 1,500 Pandours on the Elbe.Friedrich Christoph Jonathan Fischer, Geschichte Friedrichs des Zweiten K√∂nigs von Preussen, Francke, 1787, V. 1, 495. In the fighting, he was struck and killed by a musket ball. He was buried in Alt-Bunzlau. Upon his death, Charles-Emmanuel de Warnery became Proprietor of the regiment. He had been betrothed to Baroness Rudolphine Wilhelmine Charlotte of Dyhrn (later Countess Henckel) when he died. In his testament, he gave her all his fortune.

He was born in 1558 and died in 1625. Sir John was twenty- two when he succeeded his father, Thomas White, as High sheriff of Nottinghamshire.  Marriage  The Tomb of Sir John and Lady White in the White Chapel of the Church of St. Nicholas, Tuxford Sir John White was married at the age of 32 to Dorothea Harpur, daughter of John Harpur of Swarkston. Sir John's father-in-law was \\"one of the most considerable gentlemen in Derbyshire.\\" The Harpur pedigree can be traced for 14 generations before Dorothy, Lady White, beginning with Richard Harper, temp. Henry I. Dorothea White's grandmother, on her father's side, was Jane Finderne, heiress of Finderne. Of the house of Finderne, Burke writes- \\"The hamlet of Finderne, in the Parish of Mickleover, about four miles from Derby, was the chief residence of a family who derived their name from the place of their patrimony for nine generations,. From the times of Edward I to those of Henry VIII, when the male line became extinct and the estate passed, by the marriage of the heiress to the Harpurs, the house of Finderne was one of the most distinguished in Derbyshire. Members of it had won their spurs in the Crusades and also at the Cressy, and theAgincourt. Their territorial possessions were large as the Findernes were High Sheriffs, and were occasionally rangers of Needwood Forest, and also custodians of Tutbury Castle. Finderne originally erected temp. Edward I and restored and enlarged at one of the quaintest and largest mansions in the Midlands at different periods. The present Church had rows of monumental brasses and altar tombs, all memorials of the Findernes. Local legend says that the Findernes brought the so-called Finderne Flower back from the Holy Land by Sir Geoffrey Finderne.  Knighthood  At Greenwich, on 9 June 1619, King James I knighted Sir John White.  Family  In 1615, Sir John's second son, Richard White, died at age nineteen and was buried at Tuxford. His third son, Gervase, also died young. His eldest, Thomas, succeeded his father. Sir John had one daughter, Anne, who married (at a date not known) John Welby of Moulton, in Lincolnshire, one of the same family of Welby into which the previous generation had married. She died sometime prior to 1634 and left only one daughter, Mary, who died young. In 1623, Sir John was High sheriff of Nottinghamshire. Two years later, in 1625, he died on Christmas Day at age sixty-seven. In his times the execution of the Queen of Scots, the dispersal of the Armada, the Gunpowder Plot, the discoveries of Galileo, the assassination of Henry IV of France, and the Puritan colonisation of New England took place. Lady White erected, in the family burial place in Tuxford church, \\" a fair tomb\\" of alabaster, in memory of her husband, leaving a space in the inscription for the date of her own death which has never been inserted. This is likely because of her grandson, who was in inheritance when it took place, was more remiss than her children. The inscription is as follows: \\"HIC JACET JOHANNES WHITE, MILES, FILIUS ET HAERES THOMAE WHITE, ARMIG. SERVI QUONDAM PHILIPPI ET MARIAE, REGIS ET REGINAE ANGLIAE ET AGNETIS CECILL, SORORIS WILLIELMI CECILL BARONIS DE BURGHLEIGH SUMMI ANGL.

Dorothea, the dearly beloved wife of the said John White, son of John Harpur on Swarkeston in Com. Derby. in loving memory and in certain hope of the resurrection, was this monument created. Died this year.\\" In a niche in the monument lay recumbent full-length figures of Sir John and Lady White ‚Äì he with ruff and armour, she with ruff, gold chain, and an embroidered dress, all elaborately worked in alabaster, on which the remains of, gilding are to be seen, especially on the links of the chain, and the cushions on which the heads of the two figures recline. The fragments of a cherub kneeling at their feet remain. Within the canoed recess, above the figures, are two tablets of black marble with the inscription, flanked by pillars, and surmounted by a sword and helmet, death's heads, &c.; Above the niche is alabaster ornamentation which is supported on two pillars and surmounted by the family arms, an eagle sable from a ducal coronet, or; shield, gules, a chevron varie between three lioncells rampant or. In Withies' Visitation of Nottinghamshire, 1612, the coronet is argent; so it is in Betham's \\"Baronetage, and the Patent of Baronetcy;\\" but Thoroton, and all other authorities, make it or. The appearance of a coronet in a gentleman's crest of he who is not of the order of nobility, denotes, say that old heraldic treatises, deeds of arms done by his house, is never granted, but is for prowess in the field and denotes notable achievement. In the years 1633, 1634 and 1637, Lady White made a deed of gift of various lands in Arnall, Nottinghamshire, to her cousin-german George Pierrepoint, \\"out of great affection\\" (she writes) \\"to him and his father.\\" He was the fourth son of her uncle Robert Pierrepoint, Earl of Kingston, who says a historian, \\"was not more distinguished for his ample fortune than for the endowment of his mind.\\" The earl was an ardent loyalist. In the civil wars, he was lieutenant-general of the King's forces in Lincoln, Rutland, Huntingdon, Cambridge, and Norfolk. He lost his life at Gainsborough. His wife was one of the granddaughters of George, Earl of Shrewsbury. The Pierrepoints trace from Robert de Perpont, who came to England with the Normans, held lands in Sussex under the famous Earl Warren. The Harpur family continued in great opulence during the reign of King James. Richard, of Calke, brother of the head of the house, was knighted by the King, and annalists have left descriptions of the many dinners and entertainments held at the Harpur seats. During the civil wars, they were staunch Royalists and suffered heavily as a consequence by being fined by the Parliament more than once. Lady White, survived to the year 1653 when Cromwell was at the zenith of his power.

He later became chairman in 1947, a position he held until 1971. Early life Robert Kelly was born in 1902, the fourth son in a family of six sons and four daughters. His father James Kelly played for Celtic, and was the club's first ever captain. James Kelly subsequently became a director at the club and had a brief spell as chairman. Robert Kelly's mother, Margaret, was also herself the daughter of a Celtic founder. Kelly and his brothers were educated at St Joseph's College, Dumfries, a fee-paying school opened to develop a professional Catholic middle class in Scotland. His eldest brother, Frank, went on to play a handful of games for Celtic in 1918, but was killed on military service in a train crash in 1919. Three other brothers played for Queen's Park. Kelly himself played football for a spell at junior level for Blantyre Victoria, but was limited due to an injury sustained to his arm in a childhood traffic accident, and he soon gave up playing at his father's behest. Despite his arm injury, Kelly was also an excellent tennis player. Kelly went on to become a stockbroker by profession. Celtic director and football legislator Following the death of his father, Kelly joined the Celtic board of directors in 1932. Taking an interest in the administrative side of the game, he joined the Scottish League Management Committee in 1939. When chairman Tom White died in 1947, Kelly was appointed as his successor. Although Celtic's performances were generally poor at this time, Kelly's value as a legislator was quickly realised, and he was elected as president of the Scottish Football League in 1950. Kelly was a prime advocate in Scotland for use of the new all-weather white ball, in preference to the then standard brown leather ball which generally got heavier as the match progressed and was difficult for spectators to see on dark afternoons. He also resolutely defended Celtic's right to fly the Eire flag at Celtic Park when the SFA made efforts in 1952 to have it removed. He had a close working relationship at Celtic with manager Jimmy McGrory, and indeed had the final say on team selection in most instances. This resulted in decisions on line-ups that on occasion appeared somewhat eccentric. Despite this, Celtic's performances improved in the early 1950s, and a Scottish Cup Final win in 1951 was followed three years later by a league and cup double. In the late 1950s, he introduced a youth system, nicknamed 'Kelly's Babes', signing up a large group of talented local teenagers in an effort to emulate the Busby Babes of the era. In 1960, Kelly was elected as president of the SFA, and his tenure in that role coincided with an upturn in Scotland's football success. He expressed strong views on a variety of footballing matters, opposing the live television coverage of matches, due to concern that the fees obtained would not compensate for loss of atmosphere within the ground. He was, however, dismissive of the World Cup, stating regarding the 1962 tournament in Chile - \\"I can see no sense in playing... [in]... a remote country in which I understand it takes one year to become acclimatised.\\" He also initially lacked enthusiasm for European club competitions, instead advocating the setting up of a British Cup tournament. Celtic, however, were once again struggling in the early 1960s. By early 1965 they had gone over seven years without a major trophy. At this time, Kelly approached Jock Stein to become manager of Celtic. Stein agreed, taking control of all team matters from Kelly. Within weeks, Celtic won the Scottish Cup, and the following season won the first of nine successive league championships. In season 1966-1967 Celtic won all four domestic competitions, and also became the first non-Latin club to win the European Cup, defeating Inter Milan 2-1 in Lisbon. Many of the Lisbon Lions players were 'Kelly Babes' who had been with the club for several years, though it took the appointment of Stein for their potential to be effectively honed. In 1969, Kelly became the first club chairman in Scotland to be knighted for his services to football. He regarded the honour as belonging to Celtic and Scotland as much as to himself. Kelly stood down as chairman in April 1971, where he was then given the honorary title at Celtic of Club President. Desmond White succeeded him as Celtic chairman. After several months of illness, Kelly died at his home on 21 September 1971. Jock Stein stated that \\"No man has done more for the club [Celtic] in every way than Sir Robert Kelly.\\" Scottish League president, James Aitken, described Kelly as one of the \\"giants\\" of Scottish football, and that he was \\"a most outstanding legislator.\\" References Category:1902 births Category:People from Glasgow Category:Celtic F.C. non-playing staff Category:1971 deaths Category:Chairmen and investors of football clubs in Scotland Category:Celtic F.C. directors and chairmen ","title":"Robert Kelly (football)"},{"id":"54005894","text":"alt= Population density by French department showing the empty diagonal. The empty diagonal (French: diagonale du vide) is a band of low-density population that stretches from the French department of the Landes in the southwest to the Meuse in the northeast. The diagonal's population density is very low compared to the rest of France.  Description  The low population density (less than 30/km¬≤, or 78/mi¬≤) is caused largely by the rural exodus and urbanisation of the 19th and 20th centuries. Some commentators prefer to speak of a \\"low-density diagonal\\" (diagonale des faibles densit√©s) and regard the term \\"empty diagonal\\" as both pejorative and exaggerated. Still, DATAR. used the term and it remains the more common term. The pattern is more readily apparent at the departmental level than at the regional level. It is part of a broader pattern of low population density that extends into Spain and Portugal and is known as the continental diagonal.  History and evolution  Before the emergence of the empty diagonal, an earlier demographic feature was the Saint-Malo-Geneva line that ran from the northwest to the southeast and divided the industrial northeast from the agrarian southwest. Charles Dupin identified it in his 1837 treatise Forces productives et commerciales de la France. In 1947, the geographer Jean-Fran√ßois Gravier wrote of a \\"French desert\\" that corresponds, more or less, to the modern notion of the empty diagonal. Herv√© Le Bras and Emmanuel Todd argue that the concept is no longer valid in the 21st century because of growth that is observed in some departments like Indre and Gers.Herv√© Le Bras, Emmanuel Todd, Le Myst√®re fran√ßais, seuil, 2013 According to their analysis, the zone of negligible or negative population growth extends is only from the Massif Central to Lorraine. However, an analysis at the level of cantons and communes indicates that the zone of decline extends beyond the Massif-Lorraine axis and that the growth observed by Le Bras and Todd is fragile and driven by a temporary influx of retirees.  Literature  La diagonale du vide is the title of a 2009 novel by Pierre P√©juLa diagonale du vide, , √âditions Gallimard, Collection Blanche in which an urban businessman seeks solitude in a cottage in Ard√®che.

The most significant event to come out of the conference was that the formal signing of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women took place during the opening ceremony of the conference. Marred by conflict and politicization of international and national events which had little to do with women's issues, the conference was viewed by some participants as a failure. They were able to secure passage of a modified World Programme of Action to expand on previous targets to improve women's status, and established a follow-up conference for the end of the decade. History The 1980 Conference held from 14 and 30 July in Copenhagen, Denmark was the direct result of the First World Conference on Women, which had been held in Mexico City in 1975, establishing the World Plan of Action and Declaration of Mexico on the Equality of Women and Their Contribution to Development and Peace. These documents took the United Nations themes‚ÄîDevelopment, Equality, and Peace‚Äîof their path for women and created guidelines for nations to reach long-term objectives to improve the lives of women. When they were adopted, the UN established 1975 to 1985 as the Decade for Women and put in motion a plan for subsequent conferences to evaluate progress being made. The format of the conference was the same, with the official session made up of delegates representing their governments and the Tribune, representing NGOs. As with the previous conference, the Copenhagen conference was beset by the geopolitical divides of the Cold War and whether economics, racism, or sexism was the more important factor in the subordination of women. Initially planned to occur in Tehran, the Iranian Revolution of 1979 and the Iran hostage crisis, escalated the political backdrop as did the continuing tensions of conflict in the Middle East. Palestinian women, refugees, and Apartheid became topics that were added to the agenda and ensured that the event would be politicized by the various participants, rather than remaining focused on women's issues. To that end, the United States Congress issued instructions to its delegates that they would not approve any resolution which attempted to make what should be an apolitical conference into an indictment of government policy or any resolution which mentioned the word \\"Zionism\\". Saudi Arabia and South Africa boycotted the convention altogether. Having to hastily relocate the conference to Denmark, also impacted the accommodations available, in that there was no space large enough to accommodate the entire Tribune, which meant that rather than the entire group participating in exchange to create unity, the group was splintered into small venues. =Official conference= The Conference was the mid-point review of the decade and the conference president was Lise √òstergaard, Cultural Minister of Denmark. The Secretary-General of the conference was Lucille Mair, a Jamaican academic and single mother, whose primary focus was on the development theme of the triad. Discussion on the New International Economic Order subverted the discussion from being about what women needed to what the various governments needed from women or for women to reach their national goals. At one point, it was suggested that if Westernized nations would provide more funding for economic development, discrimination against women would vanish. Partisan political issues, such as insertion of the socialist economic system into the section dealing with the historical perspective on women, the repeated interruption of Israeli delegates with Muslim drummers and singers, and a storming of the conference by women protesting the Bolivian coup d'√©tat were just some of the manifestations of the divides. One hundred forty-five states with around 1500 delegates participated in the official session, including delegates like: of the USSR; Shirley Field-Ridley of Guyana; Ana Sixta Gonz√°lez de Cuadros of Colombia; Helga H√∂rz of East Germany; Ma√Ømouna Kane of Senegal; Sheila Kaul of India; Ifigenia Mart√≠nez of Mexico; of Austria; Inonge Mbikusita-Lewanika of Zambia; Elizabeth Anne Reid of Australia; Ginko Sato of Japan; Umayya Toukan of Jordan; Sarah Weddington, who headed the US delegation, among many others. May Sayegh of Palestine was also present at the conference. After opening remarks by Kurt Waldheim, Secretary-General of the United Nations, Queen Margrethe II of Denmark welcomed participants and expressed her hope that the conference would prove productive. Anker J√∏rgensen, Danish Prime Minister spoke briefly, followed by opening remarks by Lise √òstergaard, followed by the general discussion. Debates were strongly affected by post-colonial and socialist claims of women's advancement in centrally planned economies in which the state had an obligation to prevent and an accountability for discrimination against women. Having established mechanisms in the previous conference to gather data on the status of women, review of the statistical data showed that women's security had dwindled over the preceding five-year period. Among the documentation were statistics showing that while women put in two-thirds of all working hours, they received only one-tenth of the income, owning one- hundredth of its assets. Economic stagnation and industrialization in the period had led to significant increases in unemployment and benefits for women. Jobs which were available confined women to insecure, low-paid, and sex-stereotyped jobs and as much of their labor was toward unpaid production, it was still invisible in compiled economic reports. Decreased earnings had elevated health concerns. While literacy rates for middle class women increased, overall illiteracy among women increased. One of the most contentious issues discussed was the situation of households headed by women. Many officials denied that there could be such a thing, as legally in their countries women were not allowed to be the head of a household. On the other hand, one of the most memorable moments was when the delegates signed the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) on 17 July. The first committee, under the chair Ma√Ømouna Kane, with vice-chairs, Rafidah Aziz of Malaysia, Maria Groza of Romania, and Le√≥nidas P√°ez de Virgili of Paraguay, with Rapporteur of Belgium, discussed the effects of Apartheid and the Israeli-occupied territories on women; the progress and obstacles in attaining the objectives of the World Plan of Action; and the proposal for the World Programme of Action for the second-half of the Decade for Women. Of major concern was labor insecurity, caused either by the introduction of technologies which replaced women laborers or by the informal nature of many jobs open to women in developing countries. The committee discussed that more effort should be made to retrain laborers when their positions were eliminated by technological advances and that legal protections should be enacted. Also of grave concern was education of women to not only eliminate illiteracy but to make them aware of social and political processes and how they could be part of decision-making mechanisms. Apartheid and racism were condemned by the committee, as was the Zionist policy of Israel which was linked to racism. The discussion on the Palestinian right to self- determination was endorsed, though it was noted that when the Palestinian people as a whole were denied basic human rights, discussing the rights of only women was futile. Various draft resolutions, including resolutions to improve education and training, address women with disabilities, provide support for women migrants and refugees, provide economic security for elderly women, and to address violence against women. With modifications, the committee recommended approval of the Programme and accepted CEDAW with few reservations. The second committee, under the chair Sheila Kaul, with vice- chairs, Nermin Abadan-Unat of Turkey, Mar√≠a de Lourdes Castro e Silva de Vincenzi of Brazil, and Chavdar Kyuranov of Bulgaria, with Rapporteur Ali Benbouchta of Morocco, discussed an agenda identical to the first committee's focal points. Apartheid was rejected and the committee recommended that with its eradication, women in South Africa and bordering refugee states should be compensated with the means to reconstruct their societies in ways that created avenues for women's participation. With regard to the review of the Programme, the committee noted that without change in socio-economic systems, equality for women remained elusive. It was noted that globalization led to an increasing need to pursue paths for disarmament, peace and international cooperation. It was also noted that regional systems needed to be fully integrated to allow women's participation but additionally new programs organized specifically for women should be explored. The situation of refugee women, their vulnerabilities to exploitation and violence and the need to protect their human rights. On the question of Palestinian women, the committee recognized that material assistance would do little to stop insecurity unless Israel ended its colonization, returned land to its owners and worked toward a durable peace. The committee examined several draft resolutions regarding peace initiatives, refugees, water insecurity, and adding women to census figures, as well as draft resolutions on health and welfare, protecting families from defaulted support obligations, drug trafficking and forced disappearance, and integrating women into the UN system and programs. With modifications, the committee recommended approval of the Programme. =Tribune= The planning of the 1980 Tribune, or Forum as it was called in Copenhagen, was led by Edith Ballantyne, the executive secretary of the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom (WILPF) and president of the United Nations Conference of Non-governmental Organizations (CONGO). Elizabeth Palmer, a representative of the YWCA chaired the actual Forum, which was hosted at the Copenhagen University Amager Campus. The success of developing transnational networks of women was evident in the expansion of attendees at the NGO Tribune from 6000 participants in Mexico City to around 8000 in Copenhagen. Many complained of the inadequacy of the forum facilities, including the fact that child care had not been considered. The forum was split into small sessions consisting of around 200 meetings per day. Because of the lack of translators, and the fact that conferences were labeled as of concern to developed or developing nations, in-depth discussion was difficult and often barely touched the surface of issues. Peggy Antrobus and Charlotte Bunch, with sponsorship from the University of the West Indies' Women and Development Department and the Asian Pacific Centre for Women and Development (APCWD), recently relocated from Tehran to Bangkok, organized an orientation video Feminist Strategies for the Decade which was shown daily. Irene Tinker The politicization of the official conference also influenced the NGO Tribune, resulting in tensions and displays of nationalism, such as Iranian women holding a news conference to celebrate their revolution by calling for the use of the hijab as a protest against colonialism and Ukrainian women protesting for independence. When Nawal El Saadawi of Egypt presented a paper on female circumcision, western feminists were advised that the issue was a developing world problem and not their concern. Lesbians attendees hosted five workshops, which were well attended and less controversial than at the 1975 conference. Some of the prominent women attendees were Shulamit Aloni of Israel; Marie Assaad of Egypt; Charlotte Bunch, US lesbian activist; Phyllis Chesler a US expert on refugees; Betty Friedan, founder of the National Organization for Women (NOW); Natalia Malakhovskaia, Soviet exile; Marie-Ang√©lique Savan√© of Senegal. As they had in Mexico City, the members of the Forum continued the tradition of presenting their additions to the Programme of Action at the official session. A group of women led by Domitila Barrios de Chungara were met by police and barred from entering the plenary meeting until Lucille Mair met with them and allowed the recommendations to be presented. Outcomes The most significant outcome of the conference was the official signing of CEDAW by the delegates at the opening ceremony. The conference adopted the official World Programme of Action with a vote of with ninety-four favorable votes, twenty-two abstentions, and four opposed‚ÄîAustralia, Canada, Israel and the United States. It included sections to create women's bureaus or agencies, defined the roles of NGO and grassroots organizations, and established target issues countries were to monitor. Those issues included child care, households headed by women, migrants, rural women, unemployment, and youth. The Programme also included a section regarding water insecurity, but the most significant changes to the previous Plan of Action were sections devoted to ensuring equal access to education, employment opportunities, and adequate health care. The Conference established the Third World Conference on Women for the end of the decade to be hosted in Nairobi, Kenya in 1985 with a back up location in Tokyo. The conference was seen by those who rejected the Programme as having been a failed process. Rather than a serious discussion of the inequalities between men and women, the conference had limited discussion to politicizing international events, ideological principals and controversies, which obscured the real needs of women to participate in decision-making and economic development, and benefit equally in family matters, health, education and employment. Multiple countries which had abstained from voting expressed disappointment that the process, rather than dealing with women's issues, had duplicated work better suited for the General Assembly. Overall, the conference and forum conference were marred by conflict and politicization of international and national events which had little to do with women's issues. The official agenda was obscured by nationalist causes pitting the developing countries of the South and the developed countries of the North against each other. The question for continued participation in the conferences left many asking if the focus could be shifted away from political issues and return to the problems related to women: aging; credit for economic development; double duties between work and family; fertility versus infertility; shortage of heat and inadequate water, support systems and lack of them; women‚Äôs health; and violence against women.

Within the first season, Beane traded away many of the players Whaley had signed, drafted, or extended, including receiver Sammy Watkins, cornerback Ronald Darby, linebacker Reggie Ragland, and defensive tackle Marcell Dareus. Though Beane arguably had his sights on a long-term rebuild while purging unfavorable contracts for the Bills, some sports commentators criticized his tactics. In 2017, Beane's first season with the team, the Bills ended their 17-year playoff drought.

History The Leper's Tower was built on the ruins of an ancient Roman tower and was originally known as the Friour Tower, after the family that lived there. This family, whose name was mentioned for the first time in 1191, also occupied the Ports Decumana, now abandoned. After several changes of ownership, it was bought by the Order of Saint-Maurice in 1773 and was incorporated into a hospice of charity founded by Jean-Boniface Festaz. The current name derives from the fact that a leper named Pierre Bernard Guasco, a native of Oneglia was imprisoned there from 1773 to 1803. This story inspired Lepers of the city of Aosta, a story written by Xavier de Maistre, published in 1811. In 1890, the tower was restored by the Regional Monuments Office of Piedmont and Liguria, led by Alfredo d‚ÄôAndrade. Today it belongs to the Autonomous Region of Aosta Valley, which holds exhibitions at the site. Architecture The Leper's Tower was founded on a Roman tower whose foundations were excavated in the nineteenth century. A medieval tower was built on the site in the fifteenth century. Most of the remaining Roman windows have been walled up. Bibliography Zanotto, Andr√© (1993). The Castles of the Aosta Valley, ed. Musumeci, Quart.

Interactive Behavioral Therapy Interactive Behavioral Therapy (IBT) is a widely used form of evidence-based psychotherapy that was specifically developed for people with dual diagnoses,Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities 47(4) Diagnostic Manual‚ÄìIntellectual Disability: A Textbook of Diagnosis of Mental Disorders in Persons With Intellectual Disability book review meaning people who are diagnosed with both an intellectual disability (ID) and a psychological disorder. It uses a modification of theory and technique borrowed from other models in group psychotherapy, and its theoretical foundations and many of its techniques are drawn directly from a form of psychotherapy called psychodrama that was created by Jacob L. Moreno.Psychology Today \\"Positive Interactive Behavioral Therapy\\" As people with intellectual disabilities tend to have a difficult time verbalizing their feelings, IBT allows patients to act out particular issues they have while role-playing with others. In psychodrama, there are three stages during sessions (warm-up, enactment, and sharing), but those with ID have cognitive limitations, making it difficult to talk about abstract thoughts and feelings that are necessary for therapeutic change.NADD Bulletin 3(6) \\"The Interactive-Behavioral Model of Group Counseling For People with Mental Retardation and Chronic Psychiatric Illness\\" In IBT, four stages were developed: orientation, warm-up and sharing, encounter, and affirmation. Each of these stages works toward encouraging patients to communicate effectively while in group settings, particularly those with visual and auditory difficulties, bolsters them with affirmations,Journal of Intellectual Disabilities \\"Positive group psychotherapy modified for adults with intellectual disabilities\\" and improves social skills. People with ID have a higher rate of psychological disorders and, as a result, were often subject to diagnostic overshadowing. Their mental illness were often overlooked because of their ID or thought that the symptoms were part of the ID itself. But when mental illness was diagnosed, the route of traditional psychotherapy presented a number of obstacles. IBT addresses the unique circumstances of people with ID and mental illness in addition to giving them a sense of belonging and of self-understanding while learning to help others. By working in IBT, the patients with ID can experience an emotional release and learn there is hope as they each work through their issues.

It accompanied the final days of King James II's regime after his initially thwarted attempt to flee into exile in France. Troops of the Jacobite Irish Army were stationed in England to prop up James II's authority but were widely detested by the predominantly Protestant population of England. Rumours began to circulate in mid-December that the Irish soldiers were preparing to carry out a campaign of massacre and pillage against the English population in revenge for James's overthrow. False reports of the Irish burning English towns and massacring inhabitants spread the panic rapidly from London to at least nineteen English counties, whose inhabitants formed armed militias to guard against supposed Irish marauders. The panic subsided after a few days. It was never determined who was responsible for sparking it, though contemporaries suspected that it may have been the work of Orangist sympathisers seeking to further discredit James II. Background James II inherited an army in Ireland on his accession in 1685. At the time it amounted to 8,238 men, all of whom were supposed to be Protestants and required to provide certificates confirming that they received the Church of England's sacrament twice a year. (Some Catholics did nonetheless manage to join the force during the Catholic James II's reign.) By 1688 its strength had grown to 8,938, of which 2,820 were sent to England in September 1688 to reinforce the English Army against the expected invasion by William, Prince of Orange, James II's son-in-law who had been invited to enter the country by English politicians opposed to James II's rule. Many of them were stationed in Portsmouth, where they became objects of suspicion and fear. A newsletter of early October 1688 reported that Portsmouth's inhabitants were making \\"great complaints of the rude Irish who have caused many families to leave that place, having committed many robberies\\". Their presence in England further stoked long-standing fears that Irish or Catholic forces were poised to launch an anti-Protestant uprising. In Staffordshire in 1641, Protestants were reportedly so afraid that their Catholic neighbours would attack them that they \\"durst not go to Church unarmed\\". Later that same year, a panic in the towns of Ludlow and Bewdley led the inhabitants of both towns to mobilise on the night of 19‚Äì20 November, watching for what they believed was the arrival of insurgent Catholics. In 1681 the House of Lords announced the existence of \\"a horrid and treasonable Plot and Conspiracy, contrived and carried on by those of the Popish Religion in Ireland, for massacring the English, and subverting the Protestant Religion, and the ancient established Government of that Kingdom.\\" After spending three tense months garrisoned in Portsmouth, the Irish troops were sent north to fight in the Battle of Reading on 9 December 1688, the only substantial military action of the Glorious Revolution. They were defeated and a portion of the Irish troops were ordered to return to Portsmouth. Others were sent to Uxbridge west of London. Rather than fight William's invasion, however, the Earl of Feversham disbanded James's forces and released the Irish troops from their obligations. Outbreak of the Irish Fright On Thursday 13 December, according to Bishop Gilbert Burnet, \\"Country Fellows, arriving about Midnight at Westminster caused a sudden Uproar, by Reporting that the Irish, in desperate Rage, were advancing to London, and putting all before them to Fire and Sword.\\" Another newswriter reported that in the early hours of 13 December \\"an alarm was spread through City and suburbs of 'Rise, arm, arm! the Irish are cutting throats'.\\" The alert immediately sparked a mass panic and 100,000 men were reported to have mobilised to defend their homes within half an hour. Buildings were illuminated to ensure that marauding Irishmen could not sneak up in the early morning darkness. The Grand Duke of Tuscany's ambassador in London wrote that he had seen young and old alike, False reports that Uxbridge had been sacked by the Irish added to the panic. Philip Musgrave wrote that Lord Feversham's disbandment of the Irish Army \\"hath increased our miseries, for he did not disarm any of them, and the Irish and Roman Catholics ... are in a great body about Uxbridge who burn, kill, and destroy all they meet with.\\" The House of Lords convened at 3 a.m. at Whitehall to discuss the situation and send for word of the supposed burning of Uxbridge. =Spread= The Irish Fright thereafter spread rapidly across England. It reached Norfolk around 14 December, when it was rumoured that the Irish were marching on Norwich. Kent descended into mass panic on the morning of 14 December, while in Surrey, Kingston-upon-Thames was said to have been burned and the inhabitants cut down trees to block the path of the supposed Irish insurgents. In Cambridge, four to six thousand Irishmen were supposed to have destroyed Bedford and massacred its inhabitants and were on their way to Cambridge to repeat the deed. The news caused some of Cambridge's inhabitants to flee, but travellers arriving from Bedford were able to discredit the rumours and calm the situation. The panic reached the Midlands on the same day; the mayor of Chesterfield wrote that 7,000 Catholics and Irishmen had burned Birmingham and were advancing to Derby, while a Leicestershire clergyman, Theophilus Brookes, recorded that he had heard \\"that the Irish were cutting of throats, Lichfield on fire and Burton attempted upon.\\" Brookes was evidently an unusually martial clergyman, as he raised a militia of local men to confront the enemy, but he had to dismiss them after a day when no Irishmen could be found. Yorkshire's turn came a day later on 15 December, with the scare prompting several towns to mobilise troops and arm local people. Lord Danby sent a troop of horse from York to Pontefract to guard against possible aggressors from Ireland and pro- Catholic Lancashire. Wakefield received reports that Doncaster had been burned, while those in Doncaster heard that Birmingham and Stafford had been sacked. Artificers in Leeds abandoned the Sabbath to mend scythes for use as weapons, and the following day a sizeable army of about 7,000 infantry and cavalry was assembled there to defend the city. While Yorkshire was readying its defences against possible Lancastrians as well as Irish, the Lancastrians themselves were no less affected by the Fright. It reached the county at the same time as Yorkshire, with the same stories circulating of Birmingham's inhabitants being massacred and Stafford being burned to the ground. A rumour had it that after their defeat at Reading, the Irish had begun to \\"plunder kill & destroy\\", burning Birmingham and advancing towards Wolverhampton. In response, as a letter-writer signing himself as \\"J.E.\\" put it, the counties \\"rise to defend themselves\\". Local men formed militias and Warrington Bridge was barricaded and guarded. In Chester, the governor disarmed the royal garrison, armed the city's civilians from the garrison's armoury and placed cannon at the city gates. He wrote to Secretary at War William Blathwayt to inform him of his action and to express his alarm at \\"ye Reportt of a Body of 8 or 9000 Bloody Irish coming this way from London.\\" He had heard that they \\"Burn all Places they come at, and kill Man, Woman and Child\\" and he urged Blathwayt ensure that troops were sent to Chester to protect it from the Irish \\"Enemies of our Honest Protestant Religion and Country.\\" The West Country also received word of the supposed Irish onslaught on 15 December. The Dichess of Beaufort heard at 2 a.m. that the Irish were only five miles from Wootton Bassett and were burning and killing all in their path. Reading, Andover, Hampshire and Newbury were also said to have been destroyed and Marlborough was said to be under threat. A 'Mr. Cothrington', probably a cousin of Sir John Guise, brought a troop of gentlemen to guard the duchess at Badminton and took her house's arsenal of sixty muskets to arm the party. Sir John had meanwhile raised and armed the Gloucestershire militia and all of its officers. Probably not coincidentally, he was a supporter of William of Orange and most likely took advantage of the Fright to ensure that any uprising by James II's supporters could be quashed rapidly. The Fright continued to spread to remoter parts of England and even into Wales. It reached Dolgellau in Merionethshire on 18 December, where a local mob shot and killed a supposed Irishman ‚Äì who turned out to be an exciseman and therefore not someone who would have been much mourned by the inhabitants anyway. On the same day in Settle in the North Riding of Yorkshire, an announcement was made in the market that the Irish and Scots had burned Halifax and were marching on Skipton. The following day, the Fright reached the town of Yeovil in Somerset. In all, at least nineteen counties were affected by the Irish Fright. In each case, the details of the rumours were comparable: rampaging Irishmen were said to have burned and massacred the inhabitants of towns no more than 40‚Äì50 miles distant (i.e. a day or two's journey) and were said to be advancing in the direction of the town where the rumours were being proclaimed. Wherever it spread, the panic burned itself out quickly and subsided within only a day or two of erupting. The only reported casualty was the unfortunate exciseman in Dolgellau, but the panic had severely adverse effects on many innocent Catholics. The Yorkshire diarist Abraham de la Pryme wrote that Protestant mobs Responsibility for the Irish Fright The Irish Fright was a sign of the febrile and confused political climate that existed in the days after James II's flight from London, and demonstrated how years of anti-Catholic Whig propaganda had imbued the English public with a deep fear of Irish bloodthirstiness. It also undeniably served the interests of William of Orange's claim to be the protector of England's Protestants against Catholic oppressors. Writers at the time queried whether the Fright had been caused deliberately, and if so by whom. De la Pryme noted an oddity about the spread of the rumours, commenting that \\"no one letter appear'd out of the south concerning any such thing there till it was always gone past those places where these letters were to go.\\" He believed that it was an orchestrated plan \\"set on foot by the king and council to see how the nation stood affected to their new king.\\" In Leeds, Ralph Thoresby wrote that he \\"could never learn who was concerned, even in this neighbourhood\\" as the source of the rumours. The agitator Hugh Speke claimed twenty years later to have been responsible, but this seems unlikely and is not supported by any evidence. An anonymous historian suggested another scenario, noting the way that the Fright was spread out from London along the main communication routes: Some suggested that Marshal Schomberg, one of William of Orange's generals, was responsible for instigating the Fright. Bishop Burnet described it as \\"An effectual Strategem commonly ascrib'd to the Duke of Shomberg\\". Another writer of the mid-18th century attributed the start of the Fright to \\"the disbanded Troops finding themselves Money-less, and incapable of subsisting in a Country where they were so generally hated, took it into their Heads to force open a Country House, to keep themselves from starving. Upon this a Man in the Neighbourhood ran directly to London\\" where his lurid account of looting Irishmen sparked the panic. The events of the Irish Fright were repeated on a much larger scale a century later in the Great Fear of France, shortly before the French Revolution.

It was established on January 1, 2019, from the Bundesautobahn 395 and parts of the Bundesstra√üe 6. The highway is collectively known as Nordharzautobahn (North Harz highway) due to the route being parallel to the Harz mountains from Vienenburg to Bernburg.  History  In March 1926, a route between Seesen and Halberstadt north of the Harz mountains was first suggested as part of a greater network in Germany.Karte auf autobahnatlas-online.de More detailed plannings of parts of today's route reach back to April 1953, when a planning office in Brunswick recommended a highway-like route between Braunschweig and Bad Harzburg; this route was built between 1972 and 1994 as A 395 and replaced the B 4 along its way. This part wasn't considered a part of A 26 until discussions about upgrading the highway-like Bundesstra√üe 6 between Vienenburg interchange (A 395) and Bernburg (Saale) interchange (A 14) emerged in 2017 and were officially realized on January 1, 2019, leading to the renaming of the A 395 (Braunschweig ‚Äì Vienenburg) and B 6 (Vienenburg ‚Äì Bernburg) to A 36\\\\. The original planning of the A 36 considered a different route: In 1972, the highway was first named as A 106 and supposed to connect Bielefeld, Lage, Hamelin, Alfeld, Goslar, and Bad Harzburg to the Inner German border. Kartenausschnitt If built, this route would today connect the A 2 with a hypothetical A 35 south of Hamelin in direction of Hanover, the A 7 (Hanover ‚Äì Kassel), and the A 369 (Braunschweig ‚Äì Braunlage), not including the former B 6 route to the A 14\\\\. A second planning from 1976 designated the route from Bielefeld to Hamelin as a part of the A 35, leaving the highway from Hamelin to Bad Harzburg under the official name A 36\\\\. This last official plan was the base for the later renaming, considering the B 6 as the eastward continuation of the suggested highway. Kartenausschnitt This plan was eventually abandoned in 1980, with only a minor route east of the A 2 (Ubbedissen, four-lane B 6) and west of the recent A 369 (Harlingerode, four-lane B 6) being realized for the purpose of being part of a major highway.

Although she was treated as historical in Spain for centuries, there is no evidence for her existence whatsoever and her name is certainly a later concoction. The musical La Cava, which premiered in 2000, is based on the legend of Florinda. Legend La Cava was the daughter (or in some early accounts, wife) of Count Julian, a figure whose historicity is doubtful.Roger Collins, The Arab Conquest of Spain, 710‚Äì97 (Blackwell, 1989), argues that Julian is also a completely fictitious character. According to the earliest Arabic accounts, he was the Christian governor of Ceuta under the last Visigothic king, Roderic, a figure whose historicity is certain. She was either seduced by King Roderic, becoming his lover, or abducted by him and raped. In some versions, the king is depicted spying on her while she bathed in a garden. In others, she is the seducer. Afterwards, Julian, in order to avenge his dishonor on Roderic, colludes with the Umayyad forces (then subduing northern Africa) to invade Spain.Elizabeth Drayson, The King and the Whore: King Roderick and La Cava (Palgrave Macmillan, 2007). Etymology The tale of La Cava first appears in the 11th-century AkhbƒÅr majm≈´ øa, then in the early 12th-century Historia silense, where she is unnamed.Rafael Altamira, \\"Spain under the Visigoths\\", in H. M. Gwatkin and J. P. Whitney, eds., The Cambridge Medieval History (Macmillan, 1913), 184 She is first named \\"Oliba\\" in the 12th-century Chronica Gothorum pseudo-Isidoriana, but this name did not become common. The name by which she is commonly known appeared first in the 14th-century Portuguese Cr√≥nica Geral de Espanha de 1344 of Pedro de Barcelos, although it is only known from a Castilian translation. In this work she is given the Arabic-sounding name Alataba or Alacaba. In a subsequent rewrite, also known only from the Castilian translation, she is always called la Caba and this became the definitive form. Since the Cr√≥nica Geral de Espanha de 1344 is also the first work to depict La Cava as evil, it is likely that its author, or the author of the rewrite, intended the new name to remind readers of the Arabic word for a prostitute (qƒÉ·∏•ba). It was popularised in the Cr√≥nica del Rey don Rodrigo postrimero rey de los godos of Pedro de Corral, written around 1430 and printed in 1499.Patricia E. Grieve, The Eve of Spain: Myths of Origins in the History of Christian, Muslim, and Jewish Conflict (Johns Hopkins University Press, 2009), 24‚Äì27James Donald Fogelquist, \\"Pedro de Corral's Reconfiguration of La Cava in the Cr√≥nica del Rey don Rodrigo\\", eHumanista: Monographs in Humanities, 3 (2007), 13‚Äì16. In 1592, Miguel de Luna added the name Florinda. The name La Cava was possibly influenced by the Hebrew and Arabic words for Eve: Chava and ·∏§awwƒÅ, respectively. There are obvious parallels between her legend and the story of Eve, whose name in Arabic came to be a general word for a bad woman. One converso (ex-Jewish) writer of the 15th century drops the article (la) and calls her simply Caba. A connection between the names of the two figures is not made explicit until 1574, when the Carthusian theologian Gabriel Esteban de Salazar wrote that \\"we corruptly pronounce Eva for Chava. This is the sad name of the Chava, who was the occasion of the loss of Spain.\\"Alain Milhou, Pouvoir royal et absolutisme dans l'Espagne du XVIe si√®cle (Presses Universitaires du Mirail, 1999), 17‚Äì18: \\"pronunciamos corruptamente .. Eva por Chava. √âste es el nombre triste de la Chava, que fue ocasi√≥n de la p√©rdida de Espa√±a\\". By the 16th century, a promontory on the north coast of Africa was being called La Cava Rum√≠a and was presumed by many Spaniards to be named after La Cava of legend. The promontory in question is sometimes called Albatel. It lies opposite Cape Caxine. According to the 19th-century French survey of the Mediterranean by Magloire de Flotte-d'Argen√ßon, this bay was still called the golfe de la Malamuger (gulf of the evil woman). The ruins of Roman Tipasa lie on this bay, and the so-called Royal Mausoleum of Mauretania somewhat inland. This monument is known in local Arabic as Qabr Arr≈´miyyah, \\"the tomb of the Christian woman\\", which is probably a deformation of an original Punic name meaning \\"royal tomb\\". At some point, the anonymous woman was identified with Florinda la Cava. This identification may have originated among locals, since there was a large expatriate Andalusian population in the area. The local pronunciation of Qabr Arr≈´miyyah is similar to that of qƒÉ·∏•ba ·πõ≈çmƒ´ya (Christian prostitute) and it is the latter phrase that was translated by Miguel de Cervantes in Don Quixote (I, xli) as \\"the bad Christian woman\\" (la mala mujer cristiana). Already in the 16th century, Luis del M√°rmol Carvajal had argued that this was a misunderstanding and that the site was correctly known as Covor Rum√≠a, meaning \\"Christian tomb\\". Likewise, already in the 16th century, Diego Hurtado de Mendoza in La guerra de Granada dismissed the notion that the ruined Royal Mausoleum of Mauretania was a Christian tomb.Alberto Montaner, \\"Zara/Zoraida y la Cava Rum√≠a: Historia, leyenda e invenci√≥n\\", in N.

It was called North End Historic District until September 2015 when the district boundaries were expanded and the neighborhood was renamed. The residential area was developed for middle and upper-class people in the late-nineteenth century. The architecture includes Spanish Colonial Revival, Georgian Revival, Mission architecture as well as more contemporary Modern Movement, International Style and Bungalow styles. The houses, built between 1885 and 1965 are generally in good condition. History Colorado, which register the district as a historic place, says of the neighborhood, \\"The architectural character of the district is also indicative of the various periods of growth in Colorado Springs, from the late-nineteenth century gold boom through the post-World War II population influx. In addition, a number of the district's homes were designed by well- known, influential architects of the day.\\" It was registered by the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. History House in Old North End Historic District The first building constructed in the Old North End was a house for female students of Colorado College by its president, Edward Payson Tenney. Called the Columbian Club, the three-story Victorian house was built about 1881 with a covered porch, large dormer windows, and a steeple at Cascade Avenue and Columbia Street, four blocks north of the campus building, Cutler Hall. It burned down on January 1, 1884 while its occupants were away during the Christmas holiday. In the 1880s, Tenney built the first house for the president of the university on Cascade Avenue, north of San Rafael, the northern boundary of the city at that time. It is the current side of Loomis Hall, which was constructed in the mid-1950s. Colorado College, led by Tenney, purchased land as an investment in what became the Old North End. Called New Massachusetts, named for his New England background, the enterprise was not profitable due to the very slow growth of the city at that time. The college sold its interest in the endeavor at a loss and fired Tenney. By 1888, the Old North End district was primarily grassland with a few houses. House in Old North End Historic District Many homes were built in the neighborhood during a period of significant growth between 1890 and 1910, largely due to the success of the gold mines in Cripple Creek and Victor and resulting industry in the city of Colorado Springs. There were more than 400 mining companies and three mining exchanges established in Colorado Springs. Colorado Springs Mining Exchange became successful, trading \\"more shares than any other exchange in the world.\\" The population of the city doubled between 1890 and 1900. Architects Charles Thomas, Thomas MacLaren, E.C.G Robinson, Nicholas Van den Arend, and Douglas & Hetherington designed Tudor, Colonial Revival, Queen Anne and other style houses. Residents included the middle class, like gold stock brokers, Cripple Creek area mine manages, doctors, and judges. Some of the houses were built with sleeping porches for people who had moved to the dry, mountain climate of Colorado Springs to cure their tuberculosis, like Marshall Sprague. The 1200 and 1300 blocks of Wood Avenue, nicknamed Millionaires Row, was the site of mansions to many of the 50 North End millionaires, like mine owner James Ferguson Burns who had a mansion (later converted to apartments) at 1315 Wood Avenue and O.C. Townsend. Before it was renamed, the street was named Earl's Court. Colorado Springs & Interurban Railroad car, 1907 or 1908 Streetcars, operated by the Colorado Springs and Interurban Railway, provided service for the North End on the main north / south route on Tejon Street, on North Weber from downtown to Fontanero, and eastward on Fontanero. Having transitioned from horse-drawn cars, there were 44 electric trolleys in 1900. Streetcars operated until the 1930s. Stewart House The 1200 block of Wood Avenue is the site of the second president's house for Colorado College and Stewart House, which was donated to the institution by Philip B. Stewart. Also on the block is the former house of Alice Bemis Taylor who was a significant benefactor to the school. Taylor Dining Hall, now a theater, was named for her and Bemis Hall was named for her father. Charles L. Tutt Sr.'s house at Uintah and Cascade was donated to the college and is now the Tutt Alumni House. House in Old North End Historic District The neighborhood has remained stable into and through the 20th century due to the growth of Colorado College, Glockner and then Penrose Hospitals, and businesses and the court in downtown Colorado Springs. Homeowners have included physicians from the hospitals, college professors, lawyers, and businesspeople. During World War II, apartments were created in garages, basements, and entire houses, which were used for residences for military stationed at training facilities at Camp Carson and Peterson Field. Medical care =Tuberculosis= In the late 19th century, people afflicted with tuberculosis came to Colorado Springs, one of several Rocky Mountain locations, for its high altitude and cool, dry air. In the North End, there were convalescent homes and the Glockner Tuberculosis Sanatorium. A fully restored tuberculosis hut, or tent cottage, and its early 20th century furnishings that was used by people who came to the Colorado Springs area to cure their tuberculosis is located at the corner of Jackson Street and Cascade Avenue. =Glockner Tuberculosis Sanatorium= Marie Gwynne Glockner opened the Glockner Tuberculosis Sanatorium at 2200 N. Tejon in 1890 as a memorial to her husband, Dr. Albert Glockner, who had died of tuberculosis at 31 years of age. The first superintendent was Dr. Boswell P. Anderson, a former Colorado Midland Railway physician. In 1893, Glockner gave the sanatorium to the Sisters of Charity of Cincinnati, who were brought in for their care-giving and professional skills. It was the Glockner Sanatorium and Training School for Nurses by 1916 and the Glockner Sanatorium and Hospital in 1940. Glockner evolved over the years into Penrose Hospital. The Glockner Hospital was razed in 1959 for the construction of a new Penrose Hospital building, costing $10 million.

The show is itself based on the characters created by DC Comics set in the Batman mythology. The episode was written by co-executive producers Steven Lilien and Bryan Wynbrandt and directed by Maja Vrvilo. It was first broadcast on May 8, 2017. Nygma is told by Barbara about an organization that controls Gotham (the Court of Owls) and he sets out to discover it. In order to achieve this he kidnaps and interrogates newly-reinstated Mayor Aubrey James, additionally broadcasting a live TV message to lure out the Court and expose it to the public. Seeing the menace and fearing it could lead to exposure, Gordon is ordered to bring them Nygma as part of a initiation and prove his loyalty to them. Meanwhile, Cobblepot and Ivy begin uniting a group of villains in order to fight against Nygma and whoever else can oppose him. Five discovers that he is bleeding again, but this time receives shocking news. The episode received positive reviews, with critics praising Nygma's character development and Cobblepot's subplot. Plot Cobblepot (Robin Lord Taylor) and Ivy (Maggie Geha) travel to the Arctic and arrive at a lone structure. In it they meet Victor Fries (Nathan Darrow) who is angry at Cobblepot for causing him and all other freaks to flee Gotham during his mayor campaign. Cobblepot convinces Fries to join him and in exchange he will give Fries everything he needs to reverse his condition. They then present him his suit so he can go back to Gotham without the risk of exposure to warm temperatures. Gordon (Ben McKenzie) meets with Kathryn (Leslie Hendrix) in the Court. She wants him to prove his loyalty to the Court. They manipulate Frank's body scene, a fact Gordon \\"discovers\\" at the GCPD, but Lee (Morena Baccarin) sees through this and suspects he is hiding something. Gordon and Bullock (Donal Logue) become aware that Nygma (Cory Michael Smith), now being called \\"The Riddler\\" by the press, has struck again. Nygma is visited by Barbara (Erin Richards), who wants to know more about the organization that controls Gotham. Nygma remembers Strange worked for an organization in Indian Hill and seeks to find out more. Later, and as part of his plan to learn about the Court, Nygma kills actors during a play in front of Gotham's elite. In Wayne Manor, Five (David Mazouz) continues posing as Bruce, but also discovers that he is bleeding again. He meets with Kathryn, who tells him that he has limited time before he dies. Gordon and Bullock investigate Nygma's theater crime and find a box that contains a riddle signaling a \\"two-faced politician\\". Determining this is Mayor James, Gordon and Bullock arrive at his office where they find him eating Danishes made by a \\"citizen\\". When he tries to take a pill for his (presumed) indigestion, he discovers question marks in the pills. James' is taken to hospital but Nygma had caused an explosion at a biker gang's, so the bikers fill and riot in the hospital's A&E.; During the commotion Nygma takes James. With Fries on side, Cobblepot and Ivy then visit Bridgit (Camila Perez), who is now working in a steelworks. They convince her to join them, and while leaving she kills her boss. Nygma and Barbara interrogate James, who tells about an organization that controls Gotham - \\"The Court\\". Nygma then broadcasts on TV a hostage situation, planning on killing James if the Court is not exposed. Gordon is tasked to bring Nygma to the Court in order to prove his loyalty. He is reluctant, but agrees. Gordon then calls Nygma and promises to tell him everything about the Court if he comes to the GCPD. Nygma agrees but tells him to empty the department. Nygma takes James with a bomb around his neck. However, Gordon with the help of Tabitha (Jessica Lucas) neutralize the device, freeing James. Gordon then leaves with Nygma. Five visits Selina (Camren Bicondova), revealing his true identity and telling her to leave Gotham. Selina refuses, telling him he is not like Bruce and the she plans to tell Alfred (Sean Pertwee) who he is, but Five pushes her out of her apartment window to the sidewalk, seemingly killing her. Then, a group of cats begin to swarm around her. Gordon takes Nygma to a location where they meet with Kathryn, who tells Nygma to get in her car so he can find all the answers he needs. Barbara confronts Tabitha and Butch (Drew Powell) for neutralizing the device and storms off when she proves that she wants full control. Cobblepot, Ivy, Fries and Bridgit arrive in Dahl Manor while discovering about Nygma's activities.

Matt Fowler of IGN gave the episode a \\"good\\" 7.5 out of 10 and wrote in his verdict, \\"This week's Gotham stuck by Riddler's side as he launched an official 'investigation' into the Court of Owls, showing that his only goal is to be the top intellectual mind in the city, regardless of who he's pitted against. This character, like Jerome/Joker, is working out really well, and he's still fun to watch outside of the context of Batman. The rest of the show, though, feels like it's rushing its teenage characters into places they shouldn't get to for another decade.\\" Nick Hogan of TV Overmind gave the episode a 4 star rating out of 5, writing \\"Overall, this was a good episode. I'm more excited, however, on where it leads next. Several dangling plot threads should come to a head over the next few weeks, which has the potential to be exciting as the show has ever been.\\" Amanda Bell of EW gave the episode a \\"B-\\" and wrote, \\"This week, some of Gothams strongest alliances are literally tossed out the window while others are being formed. Ed Nygma is back to do his worst as the Riddler ‚Äî albeit with less vexing wordplay this time ‚Äî while the Court of Owls is ready to take Jim under its proverbial wing. Meanwhile, Bruce's doppelganger's endgame is coming into view, and Penguin and Ivy are recruiting their 'Army of Freaks' just in time for a busy day.\\" Vinnie Mancuso of New York Observer wrote, \\"If it's one thing Gotham has consistently been for three seasons it's an upward trajectory into Batshit Crazyville, always escalating its characters into weirder, more intense places.\\" Lisa Babick of TV Fanatic gave the series a 4 star rating out of 5, writing \\"I love the Penguin and Ivy relationship.

Last week's episode saw Penguin and Ivy launch a mission to assemble an ‚Äúarmy of freaks‚Äù to take on Riddler, Barbara and the rest of the reigning criminal underworld. Now, 'The Primal Riddle' sees both Penguin and Riddler ready themselves for the battle ahead, as the latter closes in on the Court of Owls. It seems he may be ready to solve the greatest riddle of all, but how will the court's planned 'cleansing' of Gotham affect the supervillains' agendas?\\" Kayti Burt of Den of Geek wrote, \\"Selina better not be dead. I mean... I don't think Gotham would do that (and characters here have survived much worse than a two- storey fall), but I'm just putting that out there. Selina is one of the best parts of this show and, if she goes, Gotham will be the poorer for it.\\" Kaitlin Thomas of TV Guide wrote, \\"It can be done and Gotham seems to specialize in the crazy and the extreme, especially when finale time rolls around. You can't blame a girl for being nervous though. Gotham also specializes in chronic uneven storytelling and repeated identity crises.

The ranch was officially designated in the Congressional Record as a \\"Texas Century Ranch\\" which recognizes ownership by the same family for over a century. It was also recognized as the only African-American owned ranch in Texas with the century ranch designation. The ranch was originally purchased in 1875 by Edward Ruthven Taylor at the persuasion of Ann George, who was one of the family's former slaves charged with overseeing Edward during his illness. The two fell in love and lived openly together as husband and wife, although they never officially married because at that time interracial marriage was a violation of Texas law. They raised six children, all of whom received a college education. Their granddaughter, Mollie Taylor Stevenson Sr. (1911-2003), a graduate of Fisk University, and her daughter, Mollie Taylor Stevenson Jr., (1946), who attended Texas Southern University, were both inducted into the National Cowgirl Museum and Hall of Fame in 2001, the first living African- American women to receive the honor. History In 1862, 16-year-old Edward Taylor (1845-1924) joined Waul's Texas Legion, a unit in the Confederate Army that originated in Brenham, TX. Edward was captured during the Battle of Vicksburg, and while being held prisoner, he contracted tuberculosis, or consumption as it was called in the 1800s. After his release from prison and discharge from further service in the army, he returned home to his parents, Aaroline and Edward Wyllys Taylor. Edward's parents had moved from Massachusetts to Texas sometime during the 1840s, and settled in Houston on land that became the site of the Wortham Center. E.W. Taylor was a prominent 19th-century merchant who had served many years as president of the Houston Cotton Exchange Board, and also brokered in slave trade. Ann George, a 21-year-old black slave who was purchased by Edward Wyllys in 1856, was charged with overseeing young Edward's care. She nurtured him back to good health and over time, the two fell in love. During the Civil War era, interracial marriage in Texas was not only illegal, it was dangerous for interracial couples to live under the same roof. Despite the risks, Edward and Ann were unofficially married, and chose to live openly as husband and wife. In 1875, Ann persuaded Edward to purchase land south of town in Pierce Junction, now known as the Taylor-Stevenson Ranch, where they could raise hay, livestock, and farm the land. They raised six children, all of whom were among the first African-Americans in Texas to receive a college education. It was three decades after their initial purchase that Edward first discovered oil under his land. By 1921, a producing oil well had been drilled by Hugh Roy Cullen on what became known as the Pierce Junction field. Of further historic significance, drilling the Pierce Junction field led to an innovative new drill bit designed by Hughes Tool Company that could drill through rock. In 1946, aviators Azellia White, Hulon \\"Pappy\\" White, Ben Stevenson, and Elton \\"Ray\\" Thomas opened the Sky Ranch Flying Service on the property. Stevenson, Thomas, and Hulon White were Tuskegee Airmen, while Azellia White was the first African-American woman to get her private pilot's license in Texas. The Sky Ranch Flying Service provided flying lessons and charter flights. It included a commercial airport used by African-American aviators, which had three runways up to 2,200 feet in length. The service closed when new restrictions on the use of the G.I. Bill caused a decline in customers. American Cowboy Museum The American Cowboy Museum is located on the Taylor-Stevenson Ranch. Established in 1988 by Mollie Taylor Stevenson Jr., the museum is focused on the art, history, and culture of the contributions of African Americans, Hispanic, Native Americans, and women to the development of the American West. Displays include fine art and posters, and historic papers and photographs related to the ranch. Other exhibits include cowboy gear and memorabilia, including saddles, spurs, hats, chaps, boots and other cowboy items. Outdoor displays of ranch equipment include tractors, plows, cultivators and planters.

During October 2013, a R51 billion (‚Ç¨4 billion, $4.46 billion) contract for the supply of 600 X‚Äôtrapolis Mega trainsets, including a local production arrangement, was signed by Alstom and PRASA. The majority of the vehicles are to be domestically assembled at a new facility in Dunnottar, established by Gibela, over the course of ten years. During December 2016, local testing of the first trainsets commenced; in May 2017, 13 trainsets begun performing revenue services upon Pretoria- based routes. It is anticipated for the X‚Äôtrapolis Mega shall replace the majority of PRASA's existing rolling stock, much of which dates back to the 1950s. Development The X‚Äôtrapolis Mega is marketed and produced by Gibela, a joint venture headed by Alstom and otherwise populated by several South African companies. On 5 December 2012, Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (PRASA) Chief Executive Lucky Montana and Transport Minister Dikobe Ben Martins announced that Gibela had been selected as the preferred bidder for the first of two ten-year contracts for a large R51 billion (‚Ç¨4 billion, $4.46 billion) order.\\"Gibela wins race to supply new rolling stock fleet.\\" iol.co.za, 6 December 2012. Tendered for by PRASA, this order called for the production and delivery of 600 Mega trainsets, comprising 3,600 units, to be delivered between 2015 and 2025, as well as the first 18 years of fleet maintenance. Other bidders included CSR-Wictra, Bombardier, Dudula Rail, China CNR Corp, CSR EMU Supply, and CAF.\\"Prasa receives seven bids for US$15 billion fleet renewal project.\\" africanreview.com, 3 October 2012. During October 2013, it was announced that the contract for the deal has been signed, clearing the way for production to proceed. During July 2014, the contract's financial closure was concluded. Under the terms of this sizeable contact, Gibela are to undertake the construction of a local manufacturing facility. This factory is located in Dunnottar, around 50km to the east of the city of Johannesburg. While the contract has stipulated that a minimum of 65 per cent of the train's content is to be produced, Gibela has claimed that it is to achieve 69 per cent by the second year of production on the order. Reportedly, the order was placed by PRASA with the stated aim of stimulating a revolution within South Africa's existing mass transit network; in excess of 8,000 jobs are to be directly created by the arrangement, in line with the South African government‚Äôs policy of skill development. To support this aim, Gibela agreed to spend R746 million on rail sector business development, R273 million on wider socioeconomic development and R797 million on personal skills development. Depots for the new trains are to be procured separately to this arrangement. The first 20 X'Trapolis Mega trainsets were built by Alstom at their facilities in Lapa, S√£o Paulo Brazil; during May 2015, the first six-car trainset was completed. Following the delivery of the remaining Brazil-built units, the following 580 EMUs are to be built at Gibela's new Dunnottar production line over the course of ten years.\\"Final Brazilian-built EMU for PRASA completed.\\" Railway Gazette International , 11 July 2017. Service history The X‚Äôtrapolis Mega trainsets serve as the first phase of a major fleet renewal project; in the long term, it is planned for the type to replace Metrorail's entire fleet, the majority of its prior rolling stock having been manufactured during the 1950s. In revenue service, they are normally operated as either four-carriage or six-carriage trainsets. At one point, testing in South Africa was originally intended to take place during early 2016, ahead of revenue service beginning in June. However, domestic testing did not commence until December 2016, about a year following the delivery of first trainset.\\"Gibela‚Äôs X‚ÄôTrapolis Mega train to launch next year.\\" infrastructurene.ws, 13 December 2016.

Design The X‚Äôtrapolis Mega is a member of the X‚Äôtrapolis family of trains, produced by French rolling stock manufacturer Alstom; the Mega is designed to be compatible with South Africa's Cape gauge.\\"Alstom X‚ÄôTrapolis Mega Suburban Train.\\" railway- technology.com, Retrieved: 3 June 2018. It has been claimed that the vehicle consumes 31 per cent less energy in comparison to its legacy counterparts, which has been attributed to its light-weight construction, achieved in turn via a stainless steel structure and the adoption of insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT)-based regenerative braking system. The vehicle is designed to be compliant with the EN 15227 crashworthiness standard for greater survivability in the event of an accident. The X‚ÄôTrapolis Mega is equipped with an automatic train operation (ATO) signalling system; this facility enables it to optimally navigate through highly-trafficked networks and reduced the impact of congestion. It has been reportedly designed to serve up to 30,000 passengers per hour in either direction along the network. The design of the train embraces modularity, reliability and high capacity, while the vehicle itself is intended to be applied to suburban and regional transport roles. The Mega can normally attain a maximum service speed of 120km/h, however, it is reportedly possible for the train to be upgraded to be capable of reaching up to 160km/h instead. The Mega has been offered with a range of modular options, such as different train lengths, either single- decker or double-decker configurations, variable carriage width and adjustable number of doors. The vehicles built for PRASA feature three external sliding double-doors on each side of every carriage, while the interior is furnished with a modular seating arrangement. The adoption of wide doors is said to enable better passenger flow during rush hour conditions. In the selected configuration, a seating capacity of 234 to 380 can be achieved, along with a seating/standing passenger capacity of between 1,088 and 1,218. Each trainset is provided with two universal accessibility-friendly toilets, while each carriage can readily accommodate two wheel chair users. The X‚ÄôTrapolis Mega features a relatively spacious interior to allow passengers to easily flow around the inside of each carriage; movement between carriages is facilitated via full-length connecting gangways. Efforts have been made to ease both the boarding and alighting process through the adoption of fairly wide doorways and the presence of step-free carriage entrances. Each carriage is furnished with comfort measures, including air conditioning systems and ergonomic seating; while areas specifically designed for people with reduced mobility have also been provided. Large exterior windows have been fitted to give the travelling public a level of improved visibility. Various modern interfaces and communication systems have also been provided for passengers, including Wi-Fi internet connectivity, real-time service information displays, on-board entertainment systems, and real-time ground communication facilities.

In 1940, aged 22, Young was flying around the Tulsa area and decided to land his plane in a hay meadow of what was then east of Tulsa. After pitching a tent, Young decided he would build an airport on this location, to which he was able to secure ownership of the land. Young claimed to have paid between $85 and $150 an acre. With the outbreak of World War II, Young was able to receive a government contract training pilots. It is estimated that 5,000 airmen conducted their flight training at Harvey Young Airport. After the conclusion of the war, Spartan School Of Aeronautics leased the airfield for five years for its own pilot training program.

It is notable for being the first time Julie Andrews sang in film following her 1997 botched throat surgery. Intermittent singing in films had used old recordings of her.  In the film  Within the context of the film, the song is one that Princess Amelia (Anne Hathaway) had heard in childhood; she asks her grandmother to sing it as she heads to adulthood and marriage. Clarisse sings it at a slumber party for Amelia and the other guests, before being joined by Asana after the remixed second verse starts to play.  Development  Andrews had initially resisted the idea of singing in The Princess Diaries 2, feeling that it would come across to audiences as gimmicky, as well as slow down the action. But she was eventually convinced by husband Blake Edwards and director Garry Marshall, on the condition that she would have the right to cut the number if it didn't fit. Andrews then personally chose Larry Grossman to work on the film's music, and he constructed a song that was written in a single octave to avoid it being vocally demanding for the actress. Andrews asked him to keep the song simple, low, and within her 5-note range. Lyricist Lorraine Feather commented \\"It's an old-fashioned song with classic-type lyrics\\". Music supervisor Dawn Soler described the piece as having a classic song structure, with a hip-hop feel. Andrews begins the song in a talk-sing style, then transitions to singing with a limited vocal range and noticeably raspy tone. Andrews added the idea of a back-and-forth banter between her character and Raven's. Trained soprano Hathaway, who had recently had a singing role in Ella Enchanted, abstained from singing in the number; one reason was that she did not think her character was one to break into song. In terms of staging, Andrews insisted that the number be deliberately impromptu, rather than a huge, show-stopping performance. Over 250 people (from both the film's soundstage and the surrounding ones) were present to watch Andrews's performance. Marshall said the song made those on the set \\"deeply moved\\" and \\"teary-eyed\\". Raven called the experience of singing with one of her \\"very favorite performers\\" an \\"experience of a lifetime\\"; meanwhile, Andrews recalled the set that day being \\"lively and full of energy\\".  Critical reception  Billboard thought the duet was awkward and didn't quite fit into the overall soundtrack. After, the site would later comment that the moment was significant in the context of Andrews's career: \\"Although she downplayed this return to singing, that is exactly what it was, demonstrating that she had made at least a partial recovery from her botched throat surgery.\\" Cinema Review deemed it a \\"highlight\\" and \\"memorable\\". Deseret News thought Andrews's music moment was \\"botched\\" by the \\"irksome\\" Raven. The St Albans Review thought the number demonstrated that Andrews had not \\"given up on her voice\\".

Several companies apply cooperative strategies to increase their profits through cooperation with other companies that stop being competitors. A cooperative strategy gives a company advantages, specially to companies that have a lack of competitiveness, know how or resources. This strategy gives to the company the possibility to fulfill the lack of competitiveness. Cooperative strategy also offers access to new and wider market to companies and the possibility of learning through cooperation. Cooperative strategy has been recently applied by companies that want to open their markets and have a liberalist vision of negotiation through cooperation.  Strategic alliance  Types of Strategic Alliances The main way to apply cooperative strategies are through strategic alliances in which firms use their resources and knowledge to create a competitive advantage. There are three types of strategic alliances. * Joint venture * Equity strategic alliance * Nonequity strategic alliances = Joint venture = A joint venture is a shared equity firm wherein the participant commit the same quantity of resources, this means that this legally independent new company share resources, capabilities and risks to achieve a competitive advantage. An example of a joint venture is the case of Facebook and Skype in 2011 that sign a Strategic Alliance that gave Facebook economic benefits and let Microsoft to open its market and move forward the social network market. = Equity strategic alliance = In this type of strategic alliance, each company owns a part of the venture that they created, it is important to mention that every part must be equal to be considered an equity strategic alliance. Using this strategic alliance each of the parts share all the benefits but also all the risks. In 2013 Fly Emirates made an Equity Strategi Alliance with Jet Airways both companies made an investment of $379 million in order that each company can get benefits of this alliance. = Nonequity strategic alliance = Nonequity strategic alliance refers to a type of cooperation wherein two or more companies establish a contractual relation which specifies that each company will share their resources and knowledge to achieve competitive advantage. In this case cooperation is not totally equal because each company will share only the resources that are convenient and this could cause that a company lose more than the others.Geringer and Herbert in 1989 made a nonequity strategic alliance that did not work because of the concept because each company chose how much to contribute, and in many cases this means that companies would not take risks, and this affects the alliance. = Develop strategic alliances = Companies develop strategic alliances for different reasons: * Firms create strategic alliances because it has a lack of resources or knowledge to achieve their objectives. * Cooperative behavior gives a company values that can not be achieved independently. * Reach stakeholders interests to reduce uncertainty inside the company. * Strategic alliances can lead to new sources of revenues. * Cooperation can improve the image of the company. * Alliances can improve the capabilities of the company to respond to the changes of the market and changes in the ways of production. * Strategic alliances offers opportunities to the company to acquire knowledge and experience. = According to market type =  Slow-cycle markets  In markets that are restricted and that have constant changes. An alliance can increase competitiveness because the partner can understand and adapt to the market.  Fast-cycle markets  Fast-cycle markets have the characteristic of having companies with excess of resources and capabilities and an alliance can improve the way of entry to this market.  Standard- cycle markets  In this type of market alliances usually happen between companies that use economy of scales that ensure benefits, experiences and knowledge to both sides.

Canterbury Frozen Meat Company (later renamed New Zealand Refrigerating Company) The old Templeton canning works long back in use became the site of a new Freezing work in 1889 erected by the newly formed Canterbury Frozen Meat Company, secretly promoted by John Cooke. The new company with its directors and shareholders almost entirely from Belfast Northern Ireland bought the farmers' livestock taking the risk of getting a good price in London. This arrangement had great appeal for small farmers. The trade became established but unregulated shipments created shortages and gluts on the British market and farmers who shipped on their own account found it difficult to check on the activities of possibly unscrupulous buyers.

Titus, built in Kansas in April 1856, during a period when forces aligned with Titus came into conflict with free-state settlers. The wider conflict, which emerged from a political and ideological debate over the legality of slavery in the proposed state of Kansas, became known as Bleeding Kansas. Construction Fort Titus was built about April 1856 to be the fortress home of Henry T. Titus, a colonel in the militia of the southern-oriented government of Kansas Territory. It was said Titus squatted on the claim of a free-state settler while he was away and built his cabin on this land. Fort Titus was a fortified log cabin with gun loopholes built into its walls to allow it to be defended from the inside.\\"Brutality of Col.

Battle of Fort Titus In August 1856 Camp Sacket, a U.S. Army post, was about a mile away from Fort Titus. Fort Saunders, some distance south of Fort Titus, was destroyed by free-state partisans on August 15, 1856. At 2 A.M. on August 16th southern partisans, including Henry T. Titus, attacked the fortress home of Judge Wakefield, but they were unable to take it. Later that day free-state men attacked and destroy the fortress home of Titus in the Battle of Fort Titus.

Titus had a force of at least twenty-one men, including thirteen German stonemasons from nearby Lecompton, Kansas, with him.Sara Walter, \\"Battle of Fort Titus,\\" Bald Eagle (Lecompton), Winter 1981, pp. 1-2. The attack was launched before a brass cannon had arrived on the site. This attempt was unsuccessful and the leader of this first attack was killed.

This cannon, named Old Sacramento, had changed hands between the northern and southern partisans three times prior to this battle. The cannon balls were made from type from a Lawrence newspaper.

Built in 1910, it was the first showroom of the Baker Electric Motor Car Co., a pioneer in Brass Era electric automobiles. Baker Electric merged with Rauch and Lang in 1914, and the building was sold in 1920. It served as an auto dealership, machine shop, and print shop for the next 86 years. The structure underwent a two-year renovation and historic preservation from 2006 and 2008, and now serves as a startup business incubator. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places on February 21, 2007. History of the site The site that would become the Baker Motor Vehicle Company showroom was originally a residence. From the 1860s to the 1920s, Euclid Avenue in Cleveland was known around the world as \\"Millionaires' Row\\" for the extensive number of mansions and fine homes that lined the street. The lot at 7100 Euclid Avenue had a Euclid frontage of and an East 71st Street frontage of . The site had a slight hill on its south end, and Giddings Brook wound around the hill on the west before crossing the property's northern third and heading east. The hill was occupied by a two-story wooden frame house, painted white. The home had a three-story tower and a sharply gabled roof. An extensive front lawn, covered with winding walks and trees, occupied several hundred feet in front of the house. The banks of Giddings Stream were reinforced with stone on both sides. A walled pond, roughly and with a island in the center, was adjacent to the property's eastern border. The house and property were owned by Alonzo F. Winslow, who began managing the American House hotel in Cleveland in 1852. He invented the Winslow corrugated roof iron for railroad freight cars and the Winslow stove for use in railroad passenger cars, which made him a wealthy man. He was a member of the Cleveland City Council from 1857 to 1858, and was elected Cuyahoga County Sheriff in sheriff in 1874. He died in 1908. About the building Baker Motor Vehicle Co. building in 1911 In early 1909, the Winslow House was sold to the Baker Electric Motor Car Co. and demolished. The structure was designed by local architect Frank B. Meade in a mix of Early Commercial and Mission Revival styles. The building faced Euclid Avenue, and was wide and long, and set back from the street. Between the street and the building was a grass lawn, and a red quarry tile terrace in front of the entrances. Over the two front entrances was a copper canopy. The building itself was two stories high, with square Mission Revival towers on the northeast and northwest corners. The roof was red tile, and the building walls of brickwork and stone. The mortar joints were wide and raked, and large headers framed the windows. Grueby tiles, some bearing the company's initials, decorated the exterior. Total square footage was reported at between and . The front part of the building housed the showroom and the offices. The showroom was wide and deep, and large plate glass windows looked out onto the street. Rohrheimer-Brooks, Cleveland's top interior design studio, designed and decorated the showrooms and associated spaces. These included a public office, large and small private office, women's toilet and anteroom, men's toilet, and separate men's and women's reception areas. The showroom and offices were paneled in oak stained silver- grey, although the two end walls were painted grey smooth plaster. The ceiling was open beam, and decorative crests were carved into each oak wall panel. Large lighting fixtures with Frink reflectors hung from the showroom ceiling, and the floor was covered in ceramic tile in a checked pattern with an intricate border. The reception rooms were painted with a silver-grey paint to harmonize with the showroom, and the furniture, light fixtures, and most other fittings were finished to look like silver. Garages and repair shops occupied the rear of the building. On the east and south sides were repair bays, and on the south a paint and upholstery shop. Directly behind the showroom and northwest reception space was a two bay garage for the servicing of electric cars. It had a separate entrance and exit on E. 71st Street, a car wash station, and a turntable. The floor was concrete, and the roof pierced by skylights. The electric garage had 60 charging stations, and the capacity to hold 80 cars in four tiers of elevated racks. Behind the electric garage was a one bay garage for the servicing of gasoline-powered cars. It had a single entrance/exit on E. 71st Street, a car wash station, and two turntables. The floor was concreted, and the roof pierce by skylights. A small elevator pierced the floor and led to a battery room in the basement. The gasoline garage had the capacity to hold 30 cars in four tiers of elevated racks. The small repair bays to the east of the two garages were for electric and gasoline cars, respectively. Between them was a tire room and a small oil storage room. On the south wall were the small upholstery shop and the larger paint shop. On the second floor above the showroom were several small apartments. A 60-car parking lot existed in back of the building. The Baker Electric Motor Car Co. building was first occupied on May 2, 1910. The showroom was utilized by both Baker Electric and Standard Automobile Co. salesmen. Industry magazines called the building a \\"model\\" for other dealerships, and the electric car garage was considered the finest in the nation. Subsequent history Plan of the first floor of the structure, as of 1911 Faced with significant competition from the gasoline-powered automobile and declining sales of electric cars, Baker Electric merged with the Rauch & Lang Carriage Company in 1916. Production of electric passenger vehicles ceased in 1919. In 1920, the building was sold to the A.L. Englander Motor Co., which used to showroom to sell Hupp Motor Cars and, later, Pontiacs and Buicks. Englander closed its doors in March 1942, and the building was sold to the A.W. Hecker Co., which used it as a machine shop. Hecker bricked up nearly all the large windows of the former showroom, covered the oak paneling with drywall, and laid asphalt floor tiles over the ceramic flooring. The company also installed a dropped ceiling that covered the skylights in the garages and the original lighting in the showroom. The building was purchased by the newly formed GCC Corp. for $100,000 ($ in dollars) in July 1966 for use as a print shop. The building was renovated from 1980 to 1985 at a cost of $100,000 ($ in dollars). GCC's parent company closed the print business in 2000, leaving the building empty. Creeping ivy covered the building. =2006-2008 remodeling= Public office in the showrom in 1911. Cleveland developer Dick Pace considered purchasing the Baker building in 2002, but passed. By 2006, however, the HealthLine bus rapid transit project was under construction along Euclid Avenue, and the Cleveland Clinic was beginning to rapidly expand. Pace purchased the still-empty structure for $780,000 ($ in dollars. Over the next two years, Pace spent $7 million ($ in dollars transforming the building into laboratory, light industry, and office space for startup companies. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2007 for its association with the Cleveland's automobile industry and the electric automobile, and Pace received extensive historic preservation tax credits which paid for 40 percent of the renovation's cost. The showroom windows were unbricked, the dropped ceiling and drywall removed, and the original ceramic floor restored. The extensive renovations included making the building LEED Silver certified. To achieve this level of certification, extensive amounts of reclaimed building materials were used, all removed materials were repurposed, and a geothermal heat pump installed to help heat and cool the building. Because air conditioning systems were needed for each building tenant, multiple rooftop air conditioning units were required. To meet LEED Silver standards, of modified bitumen membrane and of EPDM rubber were removed from the roof and replaced with high-density wood panels with a high R-value. On top of this were of soy polyurethane foam; a base, intermediate, and top coat of silicone coating (each thick); and a silicone sealant. The high R-value of the roof allowed significant downsizing of the air conditioning and other HVAC equipment. By 2009, the Baker Motor Vehicle Building was 70 percent occupied. In 2010, the city of Cleveland installed one of the first public electric vehicle recharging stations at the Baker Motor Vehicle Building‚Äîbringing electric automobile charging back to the building 90 years after it was removed.

In this scenario, formal planning systems are criticized by a number of academics, who argue that conventional methods, based on classic analytical tools (market research, value chain analysis, assessment of rivals), fail to shape a strategy that can adjust to the changing market and enhance the competitiveness of each business unit, which is the basic principle of a competitive business strategy. Strategy planning systems are supposed to produce the best approaches to concretize long term objectives. However, since strategy deals with the upcoming future, the strategic context of an organization will always be uncertain, therefore the first choice an organisation has to make is when to act; acting now or when the uncertainty has been resolved. The recognition of uncertainty supposes a dilemma for strategists: in predicting the future they are likely to be wrong and may fall into overconfidence, but on the other hand they risk clouding rational foundations for decision making. Therefore, when building a strategy, it is vital to use analytic tools based on the level of uncertainty the organization is facing (decision analysis, scenario planning, alternative futures), this will enable the organization to identify the origin and the nature of the uncertainty and act upon it.  The fallacy of prediction  Strategy with uncertainty According to strategic planning premises, the world is supposed to hold still while strategy is being developed and stay in the foreseen trajectory while said strategy is being executed. In the organizational world companies plan their annual strategy and they are approved the first of June by the boards of directors. However, competitors do not act according to that proposed schedule or based on that planned strategy, neither do they wait for the board's approval. Therefore, companies can not predict the period, nor the scenario in which their predictions may be accurate. While, certain repetitive patterns, such as seasons may be predictable, the forecasting of discontinuities as technological innovation or price variation is, technically, impossible. Nature of uncertainty  The first step to develop a competitive strategy is to understand the nature of the uncertainty the firm is facing and some of its most important characteristics. As established by Birger Wernerfelt and Aneel Karnani in their article \\"Competitive Strategy Under Uncertainty\\", there are four different kinds of sources: demand structure, supply structure, competitors and externalities. = Demand uncertainty = This refers to the uncertainty revolving around the size of the market and the projection of the demand, which is a basic question in every industry. The size of the different market segments may be uncertain, the channels of distribution can be uncertain, the design of the product to be introduced may be uncertain, and in the first stages of the industry life, even the dominant design may not have been created yet. For example, in the American corn wet milling industry, demand projections made in 1972, ranged from 2.5 billions pounds to 10 billions pounds, which directly affected production mechanisms. = Supply uncertainty = When it comes to supplies, uncertainty can be found in the internal operations of the organization or in the external development of technology. There may be uncertainty regarding the best technological process, or when a superior technology may be invented. Furthermore, external uncertainty can be influenced by powerful firms which can establish standards for product specifications while small firms have to adjust to this. Finally, uncertainty can arise from within the firm as well. Key executive can leave and accidents can occur. = Competitive uncertainty and externalities = It makes references to unpredictable circumstances inside organizations, it also approaches the nature of the major competitors, their strategies and their response to the environment. It revolves around competitors' identities and their aggressiveness.  Levels of uncertainty  Business environments present a lot of strategically relevant information, including clear trends such as market demographics, performance attributes for current technologies or the elasticity of demand for certain stable categories of products and competitors. The analysis of the business environment will allow the organization to reshape or adapt its strategies to the changing market. In fact, with the correct scrutiny of deciding factors and the subsequent implementation of strategic systems, even extremely uncertain environments may deliver high returns with low risk. However, the uncertainty left, after the best analytical process is carried out, called \\"residual uncertainty\\", often falls into one of these broad levels. = Level 1: Clear enough future = At this level an organization can develop a single forecast of the future that is precise enough for strategy development. Even so, the prediction will not be exact, to the degree that all businesses deal with uncertainty, but it will be enough to shape the strategy into a single direction. In this level residual uncertainty ends up being irrelevant for strategic planning and decision making. = Level 2: Alternate futures = In this scenario, the future may be considered as one of a few alternate outcomes, also known as discrete scenarios. Studies and analysis cannot precise which outcome will be taking place, but it may help to establish probabilities. = Level 3: A range of futures = At level 3, the organization can recognize a range of potential futures. This range is limited by a number of key variables, but the actual outcome may lie anywhere within the range of probabilities. = Level 4: True ambiguity = Within this level, multiple dimensions of uncertainty coexist and interact to create an environment that is practical impossible to predict, where the range of possible outcomes cannot be established, let alone scenarios within that range. It might not even be possible to clarify the key variables.  Confronting uncertainty  To confront uncertainty, organizations deal with predictions and forecasts which may end up being misleading if they are not based in the appropriated analytical tools. Using the right approaches enables the organization to anticipate the future enabling them to designing plans for multiple scenarios. For example, based on scenario planning, Mondex, the financial services provider, forecasted the introduction of electronic cash transactions and made big investments in product development to adjust to what the company assumed was the future of the industry. This was the right move, as Mondex responded on time to the growing need of the market. * When envisioning few future scenarios, organization may use option valuation models and game theory to shape the decision making of an organization into a goal oriented process involving one or more players and one or more probabilities for different possible scenarios. In this way, it is easier to assess risk and returns through a set of tools that can establish logically consistent models of rational human behavior. * When envisioning a wide range of scenarios, organizations may focus on scenario planning and technology forecasting to plan for 4-5 possible outcome scenarios. For example, an American, good consumer company, introducing itself into the Indian market, needs to plan for multiple- scenarios characterized by different variables, such as customer penetration and the demand level. * Act guided by a strategic posture, in order to clarify your intent strategy. This posture includes shaping: leading the organization's structure towards a new model; adapting: choosing how and where to compete within the current industry; reserving the right to play: increasing the investment to stay in the game without modifying the strategy.

Leir Institute for Human Security) is an interdisciplinary education and research organization founded in 2001, devoted to the study of human security, within The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, at Tufts University. IHS promotes research and education on the overlaps between humanitarianism, development, human rights, and conflict resolution. It is recognized as one of the early leading academic institutions in its field. Activities The Institute defines itself as bringing together \\"the concerns and practices that deal with the many faces of, and close relations between, freedom from fear and freedom from want.\\" The Institute seeks to connect academia with professional practice, with a special aim to conduct research that is operationally relevant through education, conferences, and fellowships. Both the research and education components of the Institute focus on three areas: Protection and promotion of the rights of at-risk populations; empowerment of people through dialogue, negotiation/mediation, political participation, and training; and promotion of responsible government and institutional practices. Specialists from multiple areas such as law, nutrition, politics, public health, psychology, business, and economics collaborate within IHS. History The Institute for Human Security was founded in the year 2001 and its creation was elucidated by leaders of The Fletcher School as a response to the accelerating change since the end of the Cold War. Among the foundational supporters was General John Galvin, Dean of the school. The Institute was inaugurated \\"to create leadership skills for future heads of NGOs\\", to eradicate the extreme misery, oppression, and violence, working at the intersection of humanitarianism, development, human rights, and conflict resolution. IHS was one of the earlier institutions that placed emphasis on human security as a field of study in a body of academic literature. The Leir Charitable Foundations was among the early supporters of the Institute. Peter Uvin, during his tenure at Fletcher, became the Institute's first director. Uvin's scholarship focused on the violence, governance, and development in the African Great Lakes region. In 2014, Uvin was succeeded by Eileen Babbitt, Professor of Practice of International Conflict Analysis and Resolution at The Fletcher School, as the Director of the Institute. Babbitt is also a Faculty Associate of the Program on Negotiation at the Harvard Law School, a member of the Council on Foreign Relations. Before joining Fletcher, Babbitt was Director of Education and Training at the United States Institute of Peace in Washington, D.C, and the Deputy Director of Harvard's Program on International Conflict Analysis and Resolution. She has worked as a trainer and facilitator for conflict resolution projects in the Balkans and the Middle East. In 2014 the Carnegie Corporation of New York awarded a $1 million grant to IHS, with the aim to connect academics and policymakers and help professors influence policy, as part of the Corporation's ‚ÄúRigor and Relevance Initiative.‚Äù Specifically, the Institute was awarded the funds to develop novel, feasible ways to bridge the gap between academics working on complex foreign policy issues, and policymakers dealing with the same concerns. IHS aims to focus the resources to develop and communicate strategies to enhance the legitimacy of fragile states across political, economic, justice and security sectors. One of the projects undertaken with the support of the Carnegie grant is the Corruption, Justice, and Legitimacy (CJL) project, which advances systems approaches to corruption analysis in fragile and conflict-affected contexts. In 2015 the Henry J. Leir Human Security Award was established, with the inaugural award going to Maria J. Stephan, for scholarship in civil Resistance and nonviolent conflict. In 2017 the Institute was renamed the Henry J. Leir Institute for Human Security. As of 2017, IHS has two endowed professors supported by the Leir Charitable Foundations: the Henry J. Leir Professor in Global Migration, and in International Humanitarian Studies. Partnerships and collaboration The Fletcher School has stated that IHS leverages the multi-disciplinary expertise that exists at Fletcher and at Tufts through the International Security Studies Program, the World Peace Foundation, and the Institute for Business in the Global Context. The Institute also partners with the Feinstein International Center at the Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy. IHS also closely collaborated with the Center for Human Rights and Conflict Resolution at the Fletcher School. CHRCR was later renamed the Program for Human Rights and Conflict Resolution (PHRCR), and merged into IHS. Journal In association with IHS, the students of The Fletcher School manage an annual, peer-reviewed journal, PRAXIS: The Fletcher Journal of Human Security, which provides a forum for the exchange of ideas and seeks to promote innovative research in the same intersection of fields of study that the Institute focuses on.

Unlike general artificial intelligence which is a frontier research discipline to build computerized systems that perform tasks requiring human intelligence, industrial AI is more concerned with the application of such technologies to address industrial pain-points for customer value creation, productivity improvement, cost reduction, site optimization, predictive analysis and insight discovery. Although in a dystopian vision of AI applications, intelligent machines may take away jobs of humans and cause social and ethical issues, industry in general holds a more positive view of AI and sees this transformation of economy unstoppable and expects huge business opportunities in this process.  History  The concept of artificial intelligence was initially proposed in the 1940s, and the idea of improving productivity and gaining insights through smart analytics and modelling is not new. Artificial Intelligence and Knowledge-Based systems have been an active research branch of artificial intelligence for the entire product life cycle for product design, production planning, distribution, and field services. E-manufacturing systems and e-factories did not use the term ‚ÄúAI,‚Äù but they scale up modeling of engineering systems to enable complete integration of elements in the manufacturing eco-system for smart operation management. Recently, to accelerate leadership in AI initiative, the US government launched an official website AI.gov to highlight its priorities in the AI space. There are several reasons for the recent popularity of industrial AI: More affordable sensors and the automated process of data acquisition; More powerful computation capability of computers to perform more complex tasks at a faster speed with lower cost; Faster connectivity infrastructure and more accessible cloud services for data management and computing power outsourcing.  Categories  Technology alone never creates any business value if the problems in industry are not well studied. The major categories which industrial AI may contribute to include; product and service innovation, process improvement, and insight discovery. Cloud Foundry service platforms widely embed the artificial intelligent technologies. Cybermanufacturing systems also apply predictive analytics and cyber-physical modeling to address the gap between production and machine health for optimized productivity. = Product applications for user value creation = Industrial AI can be embedded to existing products or services to make them more effective, reliable, safer, and to enhance their longevity. The automotive industry, for example, uses computer vision to avoid accidents and enable vehicles to stay in lane, facilitating safer driving. In manufacturing, one example is the prediction of blade life for self-aware band saw machines, so that users will be able to rely on evidence of degradation rather than experience, which is safer, will extend blade life, and build up blade usage profile to help blade selection. = Process applications for productivity improvement = Automation is one of the major aspects in process applications of industrial AI. With the help of AI, the scope and pace of automation have been fundamentally changed. AI technologies boost the performance and expand the capability of conventional AI applications. An example is the collaborative robots. Collaborative robotic arms are able to learn the motion and path demonstrated by human operators and perform the same task. AI also automates the process that used to require human participation. An example is the Hong Kong subway, where an AI program decides the distribution and job scheduling of engineers with more efficiency and reliability than human counterparts do. Another aspect of process applications is the modeling large-scale systems. Cybermanufacturing systems are defined as a manufacturing service system that is networked and resilient to faults by evidence-based modeling and data-driven deep learning. Such a system deals with large and usually geographically distributed assets, which is hard to be modeled via conventional individual-asset physics-based model. With machine learning and optimization algorithms, a bottom-up framework considering machine health can leverage large samples of assets and automate the operation management, spare part inventory planning, and maintenance scheduling process. = Insight applications for knowledge discovery = Industrial AI can also be used for knowledge discovery by identifying insights in engineering systems. In aviation and aeronautics, AI has been playing a vital role in many critical areas, one of which is safety assurance and root cause. NASA is trying to proactively manage risks to aircraft safety by analyzing flight numeric data and text reports in parallel to not only detect anomalies but also relate it to the causal factors. This mined insight of why certain faults happen in the past will shed light on predictions of similar incidents in the future and prevent problems before they occur. Predictive and preventive maintenance through data-driven machine learning is also critical in cost reduction for industrial applications. Prognostics and health management (PHM) programs capture the opportunities at the shop floor by modeling equipment health degradation.  Challenges  The challenges of industrial AI to unlock the value lies in the transformation of raw data to intelligent predictions for rapid decision-making. In general, there are four major challenges in realizing industrial AI: data, speed, fidelity, and interpretibility. Engineering systems now generate a lot of data and modern industry is indeed a big data environment. However, industrial data usually is structured, but may be low-quality. Production process happens fast and the equipment and work piece can be expensive, the AI applications need to be applied in real-time to be able to detect anomalies immediately to avoid waste and other consequences. Cloud-based solutions can be powerful and fast, but they still would not fit certain computation efficiency requirements. Edge computing may be a better choice in such scenario. Unlike consumer-faced AI recommendations systems which have a high tolerance for false positives and negatives, even a very low rate of false positives or negatives rate may cost the total credibility of AI systems. Industrial AI applications are usually dealing with critical issues related to safety, reliability, and operations. Any failure in predictions could incur a negative economic and/or safety impact on the users and discourage them to rely on AI systems. Besides prediction accuracy and performance fidelity, the industrial AI systems must also go beyond prediction results and give root cause analysis for anomalies. This requires that during development, data scientists need to work with domain experts and include domain know-how into the modeling process, and have the model adaptively learn and accumulate such insights as knowledge.

She was a granddaughter of Captain George Charles Beckley and High Chiefess Ahia and a descendant of High Chief Ho ªolulu, who helped conceal the bones of Kamehameha I. During her youth, she served as lady-in-waiting in the courts of Queen Emma and Queen Kapi ªolani. She was appointed kahu (keeper or caretaker) of the Royal Mausoleum of Hawaii at Mauna  ªAla in 1893 and served in this position until her death.  Family  Born on December 23, 1847, she was the only daughter and second child of Hawaiian chiefess Kahinu and William Charles Malulani Kaleipaihala Beckley (1814‚Äì1871). Her brothers were Frederick William Kahapula Beckley Sr. (1845‚Äì1881), who was Governor of Kaua ªi under King KalƒÅkaua, and George Charles Mo ªoheau Beckley (1849‚Äì1910), a ship captain. Her family was of the ali ªi (nobility) class and traced their descent to King Kahekili II of Maui and King Lƒ´loa of Hawaii. Her father was one of the sons of Captain George Charles Beckley, a British sea captain and advisor of King Kamehameha I, who married the High Chiefess Ahia. Her mother Kahinu was the daughter of the High Chief Ho ªolulu who, along with his brother Hoapili, helped conceal the iwi (bones) of King Kamehameha I in a secret hiding place after his death. Her Hawaiian name Kaha ªawelani means \\"carrying the heavenly one\\" and honored her grandfather Ho ªolulu who carried the iwi of Kamehameha to his secret burial place.  Court life and service as kahu  During the reign of King Kamehameha V (r. 1863‚Äì1872), she served as lady-in-waiting to Queen Dowager Emma, the widow of King Kamehameha IV. After King KalƒÅkaua was elected as monarch in 1874, he sent for Kahea to join his court. On learning of this, Queen Emma asked Kahea to accept the request and to become be lady-in-waiting to KalƒÅkaua's wife Queen Kapi ªolani.PCAFuneral KalƒÅkaua reigned from 1874 to 1891 and was succeeded by his sister Queen Lili ªuokalani who reigned from 1891 to 1893. Around 1891, Kahea and Hawaiian musician Lizzie Alohikea co-composed the song Ahi Wela which consist of \\"poetry of passion, telling of sexual combustion that may result from the act of love\\". Maria Beckley Kahea, during her later years On March 24, 1893, two months after the overthrow of the kingdom and the deposition of Queen Lili ªuokalani, Minister of Interior James A. King appointed Kahea and her husband as kahu (caretaker or keeper) of the Royal Mausoleum of Hawaii at Mauna  ªAla. They succeeded Princess Po ªomaikelani, a member of the deposed royal family and the sister of Queen Kapi ªolani in this post. On March 25, Lili ªuokalani wrote in her diary: Kahea was the first member of the Ho ªolulu family line to serve as kahu of the Royal Mausoleum. The kuleana (responsibility) of this position has continued in her family and the descendants of her cousin Miriam Auhea KekƒÅuluohi Crowningburg up to the present-day. On November 30, 1894, the newspaper Hawaii Holomua Progress published a letter Kahea wrote to the editor of the newspaper. In the letter, she explained her connections to the interred monarchs and responded to a November 17 report by the paper that former retainers of King KalƒÅkaua were refused access to the mausoleum on the occasion of the king's birthday on November 16.

Production Showtime approached Corman with the idea of doing a series of science fiction and horror feature films. They started filming in January 1995 and finished shooting 13 films in mid June. Corman said, \\"I don't think a day went by that we weren't shooting. We were shooting on weekends, we were shooting at our studio here. We were shooting at local locations, and we shot one film in Moscow and one film in Manila. So we were all over the world with this thing.\\" Corman ended up re-making two more films in the first season. According to Corman, \\"They were actually chosen by Showtime who did a lot of market research. I had said I didn't want to remake the Edgar Allan Poe pictures, because I didn't want to do those without Vincent, and also the period style of the pictures means that they're as new now as they were when they were made. Because the 19th century is the 19th century. Whereas the other pictures... being contemporary films could easily be remade, brought up to date, re-written for the '90s.\\" The other nine were originals. Corman said, \\"One of them, we purchased a screenplay because we couldn't develop enough. We had three of the thirteen shot before this year, and I shot the other ten in five and a half months. We couldn't develop all the scripts so a picture called Terminal Virus was the script that we bought and it will be the last one to go on, and all the rest were scripts that we developed ourselves.\\" Movies were still sporadically released under the Roger Corman Presents banner through 1999.

It was a remake of Humanoids from the Deep and was part of Roger Corman Presents. Plot The United States Army attempts to create the perfect amphibious soldier; they recruit Death Row Inmates to the program. Dr. Drake (Emma Samms) uses an unknown chemical on them and it transforms them into man-fish hybrids. However they are deemed too dangerous and ordered to be destroyed, but they escape, entering the sewers of a nearby town and finding their way to the open ocean. Meanwhile, at Harbor Shores, Canco Industries is polluting and putting chemicals in the ocean. Wade Parker (Robert Carradine) confronts Bill Taylor (Mark Rolston) about it. The next day, a fishing boat catches something in one of its nets - a young boy falls off the boat and is dragged underwater, the boy's mother jumps in attempting to save him, but is dragged under too. Wade sees the boat captain being interviewed about the incident, he heads to the Hospital where he meets with Sheriff Barnes (Kaz Garars) and the doctor to see if the attacks match the bite of the shark that attacked Wade while he was underwater a while back, but it doesn't match, proving that something else is responsible for the attack. Meanwhile, Bill and two of his workers; Porter (Greg Travis) and Rod (Walton Goggins) start loading the toxins on one of their boats while unknown to them, Kim, Wade's daughter along with Matt (Justin Walker) and some of their friends are spying on them and filming them. After Porter and Rod are caught pouring the chemicals in the ocean by Kim, Matt and their friends, an unseen creature boards and kills Porter, but Rod accidentally blows the boat up as his cigarette falls into the chemicals which causes the ship to explode. Seeing the explosion, Kim and her friends contact the Coast Guard, Dr. Drake arrives in town having seen the news reports, disguises herself as a reporter investigating the toxins and attacks. That night, Kim meets up with her friends and they go skinny-dipping, but something pulls Kim and everyone under - except Matt, who sees a monster in the water. Wade gets a call telling him that Kim is missing. He heads to the Police Station to bail out Matt, who is being interrogated, but nobody believes him about the monster that attacked them. Matt is taken to the beach, but he escapes and recovers the tape that he filmed. That night, a man and a woman are attacked while in a rowboat. Wade rescues them, but the man's legs have been ripped off, not before seeing the monster that Matt saw the other night. Taylor and his men attempt to kill Matt by lighting up dynamite, but Wade shows up and manages to save him. They are taken to the hospital to be treated, where they confront Dr. Drake who confesses that GRL wanted to test new technology, she refused until they took her work and went on the program to the create the perfect Amphibious soldier by using death row inmates, but the inmates began to mutate. They were believed to be dead, but it is revealed that they have taken women alive to reproduce with them in order to survive. Later that night, a Humanoid abducts Taylor's wife; Fran (Barbara Niven) then another one attacks the Sheriff and his Deputy (Clint Howard) while in the sewers until Matt and Wade show up, burning it with an arrow. Taylor finds his dog dead and believes his wife is dead also, but he and his boys end up getting arrested when one of them confesses to blowing up Matt's cabin. Dr. Drake is being interviewed on live TV and attempts to show Major Knapp (Warren Burton) that the Humanoids are alive, who is watching the whole time. Meanwhile, at the Bar, the boy's mother shows up alive and goes into labor. An infant Humanoid bursts out of her belly and escapes into a storm drain, as they search for a cave Major Knapp and his men arrived to deal with the problem. Somewhere in a cave, Kim, along with other female victims are being kept alive and cocooned by the Humanoids. One of them attempts to escape, but is caught until her body washes up on shore with a hole in her belly. Wade decides to bail Taylor out in order to save Kim, Fran, and the other female victims. They head out in attempt to put a tracker on one of the Humanoids, but one of them attacks the boat, kills one of Taylor's men and abducts Dr.Drake, not before shooting a tracker on it, but instead got a dolphin. Later, that night, the Humanoids attack a fair at the docks. Taylor, Wade, Matt, and one of his men arrive to stop it and head into the house of horrors, however it kills Taylor's men, but Taylor throws a bottle of fire on it and escapes allowing them to finally track it. They track it to the beach where Major Knapp decides to blow up the Humanoids, despite protests from Wade and the Sheriff, Matt and Wade steal a pair of scuba gear to dive under to save Kim, Fran, and Dr. Drake, while Taylor distracts Major Knapp's men. In the Humanoids' lair, Kim uses Dr. Drake's Lighter to start a fire to keep the Humanoids away. Wade and Matt arrived in the lair and save Kim, Fran, Dr. Drake and the other female victims while fighting off the Humanoids by using fire against them. They managed to escape the lair before the timer goes off and explodes. Major Knapp begins to celebrate, but is attacked and killed by a Humanoid, which is then shot and burned by his men. The next day, all the victims are given pregnancy tests, but all are negative, Kim is reunited with Wade and Matt and Taylor is reunited with his wife. Dr. Drake begins to leave, believing the threat is over, but back at the hospital, the doctors realise that Dr. Drake's pregnancy tests turn out to be positive. Dr. Drake goes into labor while in her car, which draws the attention of some people, suggesting the threat is not over.

Residing in Mill Valley, California, the group consists of Lilie Hoy (vocals, bass), James Jackson (guitar, drums, vocals), Alan Krumholz, (guitar), Van Jackson Weaver (guitar), Thelonious Quimby (keyboards) and Patrick Aguirre (drums). Julian Muller (cello) is also a founding member. Yassou uses film to portray themes of destruction, love, power, nostalgia and urban/rural isolation. In 2016, they collaborated with the Louisville Ballet in the world premiere of \\"How They Fade\\". The band defines their music as post-pop and have described their sound as \\"smokey\\". Critics have called their sound \\"genre-defying\\" an \\"ethereal brand of rock\\" and \\"shaped by sophisticated layering\\". Yassou is inspired by artists including: Radiohead, Kanye West, Efterklang, Phantogram, Lykke Li, and Sufjan Stevens. The band writes their music in a forested bungalow studio in Mill Valley, CA. They have released two EPs (Where We Come From in 2011 and In Fits in Dreams in 2013), one Video EP (Untitled in 2016) and five singles. Yassou has been associated with music executive and producer George Daly and About Records since 2013. History Original founders, Jackson, Hoy, Quimby, and Muller met at Hawthorne Valley Waldorf School, a school for performing arts in Ghent, New York. They bonded over singing together in chorus class and through a shared love for Radiohead. Jackson describes, \\"we would spend hours after practice just listening to whole albums, geeking out on the time signatures, melodies and the sounds.\\" The name Yassou Benedict comes from a high school friend who was struggling with adolescent psychosis and who was living with the band when they formed in 2010. The friend was going through a period of creating fictitious names for himself, including Yassou Benedict. \\"Yassou\\" means \\"hello\\" in Greek, and \\"benedict\\" means good word. Their first single \\"No Lights\\" was released with an accompanying video in September 2011. Directed and produced by rock musician Steve Durand, the video was \\"shot in three hours at an abandoned school in Upstate New York, using a skateboard, handheld camera, [and] a few tracks\\". The video was an official selection at the 2011 Woodstock Film Festival. Their first EP \\"Where We Come From\\" was recorded and produced by Durand at Dioramaland Studios in Hudson, NY and was self-released in March 2011. In October 2011, the band relocated to San Francisco. They took one car, one trailer, and their Great Dane and drove across the U.S. They met Aguirre in San Francisco and he joined the band in February 2012. In May 2012, they launched a Kickstarter campaign to raise money for their first full- length album. They stated they wanted their music to remain completely independent and free from any corporate or outside influence. After reaching their Kickstarter goal in the fall of 2012, they returned to Hudson, New York to record with Durand at Dioramaland. Produced by Durand, their second EP, \\"In Fits In Dreams\\" was released on July 2, 2013. The EP featured former Hole and The Smashing Pumpkins' bassist Melissa Auf der Maur on two tracks and contained three music video singles: * \\"The Cloisters\\" features Melissa Auf der Maur and was accepted into the Woodstock Film Festival. The video was a collaboration with Durand who helped film the video one afternoon during a recording session. The song has been called \\"meditative\\". * \\"In Fits In Dreams\\" was directed and filmed by Gary Yost, edited by Mark Spencer, with visual effects by Jamie Clay. The video was shot in 8 locations throughout San Francisco and Marin County. \\"In Fits In Dreams\\" has been called \\"poppy\\" and is about a young boy waiting for nightfall to dream a dream in which his mother gives him direction. * \\"Last Cicada\\" was released in August, 2013. It was directed, edited and filmed by Theo Quimby and Be_EasyBaby over the course of one morning in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park. Critics called \\"In Fits In Dreams\\" \\"dramatic and willful\\". In November 2013, Yassou toured the west coast and Jackson and Hoy relocated their studio from San Francisco to Mill Valley, CA. In the fall of 2014, Yassou toured the east coast for their SHPWRKD release with Sad Cactus Records. In April 2015, Yassou released their single \\"YoungBlood\\" through OIM Records. \\"YoungBlood\\" was featured on the compilation OIM: Vol 1 and was produced by Jeff Saltzman. The song is about the very long and very late night walks Jackson would take to see Hoy when they were falling in love as teenagers. In 2015, Yassou Benedict became Yassou upon the release of their debut Video EP. The Video EP is untitled and consists of six songs with five accompanying videos. The 8-month project was a collaboration between Yassou and four bay area directors: Gary Yost, Amy Harrity, Peter McCollough and George Daly. There was no physical or digital release, causing critics to name the Video EP \\"unconventional\\", \\"consumer-friendly\\", and \\"redefining the album\\". In regards to the unconventional release, \\"the band decided it was time to break away from the monotony of the music industry and prove that they, and other artists in their position, do not need major labels, big budgets, high end studios and a huge production team to create powerful and inspiring material.\\" The Video EP was called \\"truly gorgeous\\", \\"a powerful visual tale\\", and \\"raw and haunting\\". \\"Fall Again\\" premiered on Billboard in August 2015. The video was co-directed, produced and edited by Hoy and George Daly. Hoy has described its inspiration as \\"fake rituals to prepare for an inner battle\\" and from the importance of her bathroom, where the video was filmed. \\"To Win / Young Blood\\" premiered in September 2015. It was directed and produced by Mill Valley-based filmmaker and photographer Gary Yost and featured the synchronized swimming/dance company Aqualillies. The video was shot on Mt. Tamalpais, in Hoy's bathtub, and in an olympic-sized pool. It is the \\"first fully-infared music video featuring underwater, timelapse and real- time IR cinematography.\\" \\"To Sink\\" premiered in September 2015. It was co- directed by Peter McCollough and Hoy. The song is about \\"falling in love, with a boy, with an idea, with yourself. It's about being brave enough to lose control and strong enough to regain it.\\" It has been cited as negotiating the concept of impermanence. \\"The Woods\\" premiered in November 2015. Directed by Amy Harrity, the video was called \\"ambient and intoxicating\\" and starred Hoy's sister. It \\"examines the ways in which seemingly contradictory emotions can bleed into one another within a single experience.\\" \\"In These Summer Nights\\" was directed by Hoy and premiered in November 2015. In January 2016, they toured the west coast and Jackson Weaver joined the band. In June 2016, Yassou opened for The National at MASS MoCA at a benefit for their alma mater Hawthorne Valley Waldorf School. Band members stated \\"now more than ever, as Waldorf graduates, we feel it is our responsibility to bring creativity, inspiration, and feeling into the world‚Äîand we were honored to do it on such a stage, for our alma mater and alongside our idols.\\" In the fall of 2015, Yassou was given a commission to compose an original score to open the Louisville Ballet's 65th season. As part of the 2016-2017 they performed the world premiere of \\"How They Fade\\" in September 2016 at the Kentucky Center for the Performing Arts. The final collaboration was a performance of music, dance, and visual art. The band was accompanied by the Louisville Orchestra and included Hoy performing on stage as both observer and participant with the ballerinas and with scenic effects by contemporary visual artist Letitia Quesenberry. The piece was co-composed by Jackson and Muller and was choreographed and directed by Louisville Ballet's Artistic and Executive Director Robert Curran. Curran commissioned Yassou after viewing their video \\"To Sink\\". The piece is a \\"physically dynamic and demanding exploration of how those feelings of nostalgia affect human connection ‚Äî how we process our relationships, past and future\\" and received good reviews. In fall 2016, Yassou established itself as a creative content group.  Touring  Yassou has played with: The National, Melissa Auf der Maur, Louisville Orchestra, Buke and Gase, Sister Sparrow & the Dirty Birds, Lena Fayre, Willis Earl Beal, and Michael McDonald. They have performed at festivals including Broke LA 2016, CMJ Music Marathon 2014 and Sofar Sounds concerts and have been touring the east coast and west coast since 2013. Writing Process Says Hoy about her writing process: \\"While writing I often reminisce about the feeling of driving on country roads at night where we grew up, all the windows down and the cool air whipping your face after a hot summer day. That feeling is pure life, similar to what you feel when a song overtakes you.\\" Hoy describes their music arrangement as coming \\"from a place of ignorance. We get bored easily‚Ä¶ but in some way it is easier for us to write with no construct or boundaries.\\" \\"Overall we do not work from a formula. The more freedom there is the more likely you are to stumble upon something refreshing and instinctual, thus capturing your real emotion which will then be translated more clearly to the listener.\\" \\"It's a collaborative thing between James and myself,\\" she said. \\"He has the composing abilities in the band and initiates all the songs. I bring the visual aspect. I've always related to music that way. I get visual images when I'm writing lyrics, so it's a natural thing for me to want to make videos.\\" Musical Style Yassou has been compared to Radiohead, FKA Twigs, the XX, The National, Bjork, St. Vincent, and Passion Pit. They have been described as an \\"unconventional act\\", and \\"a band of layers\\". They \\"impeccably combine musical complexity with melodic lushness\\" and have \\"seemingly infinite, yet masterfully minimal, tracks.\\" The band describes themselves as \\"crossing genres\\" or that they don't think about genres at all. Furthermore, the band members have been described as having a dissimilar taste in music, with early influences ranging from Lykke Li to Aphex Twin to Mastodon. Hoy's voice has been described as \\"ethereal\\", \\"haunting\\" and having \\"the celestial purity of a young Joni Mitchell\\". Her lyrical style is not narrative or about storytelling and \\"has a refined quality that betrays her choir background\\". The band references darkness in many interviews and as key to their musical inspiration, with Hoy describing her aesthetic as \\"minimal and emotional\\". The band has also labeled Haruki Murakami novels as having a large impact on their emotional aesthetic.

The fortress was situated on a plateau between three mountain peaks known as the Trikuta Mountains. The ancient city of Lankapura is thought to have been burnt down by Hanuman. After its king, Ravana, was killed by Rama with the help of Ravana's brother Vibhishana, the latter was crowned king of Lankapura. The mythological site of LankƒÅ is identified with Sri Lanka. His descendants were said to still rule the kingdom during the period of the Pandavas. According to the Mahabharata, the Pandava Sahadeva visited this kingdom during his southern military campaign for the rajasuya of Yudhishthira.  Rulers of Lanka  According to both the Ramayana and the Mahabharata, Lanka was originally ruled by a rakshasa named Sumali. According to Uttara Kanda, Lanka was originally built by the divine architect of Devas, Vishwakarma for Lord Shiva, but was seized by the brothers, Malyavan, Sumali and Mali. The brothers ruled for thousands of years and invaded Amaravati (mythology) (the capital of Devas . After suffering a humiliating and disastrous defeat at the hands of Lord Vishnu, the brothers were too ashamed to return to Lanka. Kubera seized control of Lanka and established the Yaksha Kingdom and his capital was guarded by rakshasas. His half-brother Ravana, son of the sage Vishrava and Sumali's daughter (Kaikesi), fought with Kubera and took Lanka from him. Ravana ruled Lanka as king of the Rakshasa Kingdom. The battle in Lanka is depicted in a famous relief in the 12th-century Khmer temple of Angkor Wat. After Ravana's death, he was succeeded by his brother, Vibhishana.  Rulers  # Heti and Praheti were the sea mammals. When Brahma made sea of the world when he was making the sea by salt water they disturbed him and so they were cursed by Brahma to become Asuras and they formed an Island Kingdom called (Lanka). # Vidyutkesha was the son of Heti # Sukesha was the son of Vidutkesha # Malyavan, Sumali and Mali were the sons of Sukesha. # Kubera was a Yaksha King. By the order of lord Vishnu, he remade and ruled Lanka. # Ravana forced his elder brother Kubera to run away from Lanka after his penance to Brahma and Shiva and became the prince of Lanka and Sumali again became the King of Lanka. After Sumali's death, He became the ruler of Lanka. # Vibhishana after Ravana's death and on the order of lord Rama, He ruled Lanka.

It was based on the Vampirella comic book. It was directed by Jim Wynorski, who said in 2013 that it was the one film of his he regretted making. \\"I can look back on it today and just say 'Oh well', but back when the memories were fresh and the blood on the floor was yet to dry, it was painful to even edit\\", he said. \\"What went wrong??? Wrong choice for the star, massive union problems in Vegas, studio interference, theft, accidents, 112 degree heat, you name it, we had it happen. But as least I got to see Soupy Sales perform.\\" Plot 30 centuries ago, on a distant planet called Dr√°kulon, lies a civilized vampire society that drinks synthetic blood that flows through rivers across the planet. Harmony is interrupted when Vlad, a rebel vampire who prefers the traditional practice of sucking blood of others, ends, along with his accomplices, with all the members of the council of elders who govern Dr√°kulon and flees to Earth in order to create A race of vampires with their own ideals. Among the murdered elders was Ella's father, who, with a desire for revenge, decides to follow Vlad's trail to Earth. During her journey, she is forced to stay on Mars for a while and, meanwhile, remains in a deep lethargy. A long time later, it is found by astronauts and is taken to Earth. Upon arrival, he immediately begins to do everything possible to reach Vlad, who is now in Las Vegas and pretends to be a singer named Jamie Blood. In its eagerness, it coincides with a special police unit responsible for trapping extraterrestrial beings that intend to damage the Earth. At first Ella, who now calls herself Vampirella, intends to continue with her revenge plan, but then allies with the special unit and must fight against Vlad and his vampires to save humanity from being turned into a horde of vampires, although This implies that it violates its own principles of not drinking blood from other beings. Cast *Talisa Soto as Vampirella/Ella *Roger Daltrey as Vlad Tepish *Richard Joseph Paul as Adam Van Helsing *Lee de Broux as Lieutenant Walsh *Brian Bloom as Demos *Corinna Harney as Sallah *Tom Deters as Traxx *Angus Scrimm as High Elder *David B. Katz as Forry Ackerman Differences between the comic and the movie During the movie it is said that Vlad, during his stay on earth, was Count Dracula while in the comic Dracula is Vampirella's brother. Vampirella's costume in the comic is very provocative and erotic, while in the movie it is a bit more conservative. Also Vampirella in the comic is drawn very voluptuous while Talisa Soto is thinner. For the promotion of the film a suit very similar to the one used by Vampirella in the comics was used. Unfortunately for the realization of the film another suit was used Curiosities In the end, in the credits of the film a sequel is promised that would be titled Dark Avenger of Ddeath, however to date it has never been shot. Production =Development= A Vampirella film project had been in development for a number of years. Hammer Films came close to making one in the 1970s starring Barbara Leigh; Christopher Wicking wrote a script and John Hough was to direct. The film was going to be a co production with American International Pictures but then head of production Samuel Z. Arkoff decided not to make the film. In the early 1980s Peter Guber and Jon Peters had the rights when they were at Polygram. Film rights passed to Roger Corman and Jim Wynorski. Leigh says that Wynorski wanted to cast Paula Abdul in the title role. Wynorski had a friend, Gary Gerani, who was a Vampirella aficionado, and hired him to write the script. =Shooting= Jim Wynorski later called the film \\"a mess... a film I cannot watch. Everything went wrong. Everything!\\" His main concern was the casting of Talisa Soto. Wynorski said, \\"She's very pretty and she's very sexy. But she's not Vampirella. They forced me to use her. She just didn‚Äôt have the body for the costume....I should have had Julie Strain. But they didn‚Äôt think Julie Strain meant anything. So they put somebody wrong in the role.\\" Wynorski later said he should \\"have stopped and said let's just not do this. But, I was going to lose the rights in 6 months, so I did what I had to do. At least, I got the film made. But I should have said no.\\" \\"It would have been so simple to cast the latest Baywatch bimbo in this part\\", said Gerani. \\"So now she's a vampire wonder woman from outer space with a Puerto Rican accent. What more could you ask for?\\" The director thought Roger Daltrey \\"was great... the actors were fine\\". Filming took place in Las Vegas. \\"It was 110, everyday\\", said Wynorski. \\"Everybody was gambling, everybody was up all night. Everyone was blurry eyed. There was a thief on set who was stealing money. It was awful.\\" \\"When you see how lousy those bat transformations are\\", said Gerani, \\"you'll realize that we're just a hip little million-dollar drive-in movie.\\" \\"It was really a nasty, nasty picture to work on\\", said Wynorski. \\"And it came out badly, too... I wish I could go back now and redo it with the CGI of today. But even then, I just don‚Äôt ever feel like going back to that.... It's got a good Joel Goldsmith score.\\" \\"Given how absurd anything called Vampirella would be, the movie certainly doesn't insult your intelligence\\", says Gerani. \\"I think there's a nice emotional depth to the piece.\\" References External links * *Vampirella at Letterbox DVD *Vampirella at Vampire Lore Website *Review of film at Moria *Review of film at Total Cults Category:1996 direct- to-video films Category:1996 films Category:English-language films Category:Films produced by Roger Corman Category:American direct-to-video films Category:American films Category:American science fiction horror films Category:American superhero films Category:Alien visitations in films Category:American films about revenge Category:Vampires in film Category:Superheroine films Category:Superhero horror films ","title":"Vampirella (film)"},{"id":"54008509","text":"Where Evil Lies is a 1995 American erotic thriller film directed by Kevin Alber.

Overview  Kim's parents used to run Hanbok shop at Gwangjang market in Seoul but later moved to Gwanghwa Island. She graduated from one of nation's prestigious women's schools - Sookmyung Girls' Middle and High School. Kim holds a BA in Vocal Music at Kyung Hee University. She was a member of Seoul Metropolitan Chorus between 1978 and 1982. Kim met her future husband, Moon, during their university years at Kyung Hee University. Their relationship began to develop after she took care of Moon who was then knocked out by tear gas during an anti-Park Chung- hee protest. Moon and Kim married in 1981 when Moon was studying at Judicial Research and Training Institute, after Kim proposed marriage to Moon in an act that was virtually unheard of in South Korea. Due to her easy-going personality Kim has been given the nickname \\"Jolly Lady\\" widely popularised during the presidential campaign in 2017. Kim became First Lady of the Republic of Korea on her husband's inauguration as President on 10 May 2017. As First Lady she focuses on minorities in society, such as people with disabilities, single-parent families and elderly people, by hosting related events arranged by the Blue House, making commemorative speeches for related cultural events and visiting related facilities when accompanying her husband's official or state visit to foreign countries. Kim and Moon live with adopted dogs and cats from their home in Yangsan and to now Blue House. At their house in Yangsan they lived with several dogs and cats who were all once abandoned by their previous guardians. Among those, a dog Maru _(, a Pungsan dog)_ and a cat Jjing-jjing (or Jjing-Jjing-ee ) have been confirmed to live with them at the Blue House either by the media or its official social media posts. After coming to the Blue House, a dog Tory ( __, a mixed-breed) was adopted from an animal shelter in contrast with other \\"First Dogs\\" who have traditionally been purebred Jindo dogs.

The term is a neologism introduced in 2013. The proponents of the term state that in LitRPG, games or game-like challenges form an essential part of the story, and visible RPG statistics (for example strength, intelligence, damage) are a significant part of the reading experience.–°–µ—Ä–∏—è –∫–Ω–∏–≥ LitRPG by EKSMO . This distinguishes the genre from novels that tie in with a game, e.g. those set in the world of Dungeons and Dragons, or books that are actual games, such as the choose-your-own-path Fighting Fantasy type of publication. Typically, the main character in a LitRPG novel is consciously interacting with the game or game- like world and attempting to progress within it. If the main characters are transported to a game-like world from our world, or can remember the real world, the genre can overlap with Isekai.  History  The literary trope of getting inside a computer game is not new. Larry Niven and Steven Barnes's Dream Park (1981) has a setting of LARP-like games as a kind of reality TV in the future (2051); Andre Norton's Quag Keep (1978) enters the world of the characters of a D&D; game. With the rise of MMORPGs in the 1990s came science fiction novels that utilised virtual game worlds for their plots. Early examples are Tad Williams' 1996 - 2004 tetralogy, Otherland, Conor Kostick's 2004, Epic and Charles Stross's 2007 Halting State. In Taiwan, the first of Yu Wo's nine ¬Ω Prince (¬Ω ÁéãÂ≠ê √àrfƒìnzhƒ´yƒ´ W√°ngz«ê) novels appeared, published in October 2004 by Ming Significant Cultural. In Japan, the genre has reached the mainstream with the release of the media phenomenon Sword Art Online in 2009. Also of note is the Korean Legendary Moonlight Sculptor series with over 50 volumes. While these novels and others were precursors to a more stat-heavy form of novel, which is LitRPG proper, a Russian publishing initiative identified the genre and gave it a name. The first Russian novel in this style appeared in 2012 at the Russian self-publishing website samizdat.ru, the novel: –ì–æ—Å–ø–æ–¥—Å—Ç–≤–æ –∫–ª–∞–Ω–∞ –ù–µ—Å–ø—è—â–∏—Ö (The Rule of the Sleepless Clan)–ì–æ—Å–ø–æ–¥—Å—Ç–≤–æ –∫–ª–∞–Ω–∞ –ù–µ—Å–ø—è—â–∏—Ö. by Dem Mikhailov set in the fictional sword and sorcery game world of Valdira, printed by Leningrad Publishers later that year under the title –ì–æ—Å–ø–æ–¥—Å—Ç–≤–æ –∫–ª–∞–Ω–æ–≤ (The Rule of the Clans) in the series –°–æ–≤—Ä–µ–º–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–π —Ñ–∞–Ω—Ç–∞—Å—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–π –±–æ–µ–≤–∏–∫ (Modern Fantastic Action Novel)–ß—Ç–æ —Ç–∞–∫–æ–µ –õ–∏—Ç–†–ü–ì: –≤—Å—ë –æ –∂–∞–Ω—Ä–µ, Mir Fantastiki magazine . and translated into English as The Way of the Clan as a Kindle book in 2015. In 2013, EKSMO, Russia's major publishing house, started its multiple-author project entitled LitRPG. According to Magic Dome Books, a major translator of Russian LitRPG, the term \\"LitRPG\\" was coined in late 2013 during a brainstorming session between writer Vasily Mahanenko, EKSMO's science fiction editor Dmitry Malkin and fellow LitRPG series editor and author . Since 2014, EKSMO has been running LitRPG competitions and publishing the winning stories. GameLit Many of the post-2014 writers in this field insist that depiction of a character's in-game progression must be part of the definition of LitRPG, leading to the emergence of the term GameLit to embrace stories set in a game universe, but which don't necessarily embody leveling and skill raising. January 13, 2020 Although released in 2011, Ernest Cline's novel Ready Player One which depicts a virtual reality world called OASIS that is filled with arcade references from the 80s and 90s, became an example of this new genre. March 18, 2020 Other examples include Mary Lu's 2017 novel Warcross which is about an online bounty hunter in an internet game, January 8, 2018 and Louis Bulaong's 2020 book Escapist Dream which tells the story of a virtual reality world where geeks can role-play and use the powers of their favorite comic book, anime, movie and video game characters.

Shortly after taking office for his first term, Sra Kacaw joined residents of Xiulin, Hualien to protest Taipower's construction of a well and nuclear waste storage site in the area. He coauthored an amendment to the Mountain Slope Conservation and Utilization Act in 2012 that led to criticism from many aboriginal rights groups.

The most important feature in the Responsive evaluation is the responsiveness to main issues and problems, in particular those cases where people recognize at the site. The Responsive evaluation emphasizes: # Educational problems more than objectives or hypotheses # Direct and indirect observation of program participation (the pluralism of value standards held by various groups) # A continuous attention to audience information-needs and media for reporting In order to achieve a well responsive evaluation, it is essential to preordinate the evaluation.  Preordinate Evaluation  This approach designs a \\"front- loaded\\" with the evaluation tools consumed to accomplish the observations by interpreting them. The Preordinate Evaluation has a relative contrast with the Responsive Evaluation The Preordinate Evaluation design highlights: # A formal statement of goals # Standardized tests of student performance # Value standards held by program staff # A ‚Äúresearch-journal‚Äù type of report  Responsive Design  The fundamental project of the Responsive predispositition is Stake‚Äôs 12 Prominent Events: a) Identify program scope b) Overview program activities c) Discover purposes and concerns d) Conceptualize issues and problems e) Identify data needs f) Select observers, judges, and instruments (if any) g) Observe designated antecedents, transactions, and outcomes h) Thematize and prepare portrayals and case studies i) Winnow, match issues to audiences j) Format for audience use; k) Assemble formal reports (if any) l) Talk with clients, program staff, and audiences (Stake, 1976)  Strengths of Responsive Evaluation  334x334pxThe responsive approach is applicable to summative and formative evaluations The formative evaluation is useful when the project staff needs help monitoring the program and when no one knows what problems are going to face it. In summative evaluation is useful this approach when audiences want to understand the activities, the strengths and the shortcoming of the project The Responsive Evaluation is preferred over the Pre-ordinate evaluation when someone wants to know the extent to which set objectives have changed (Stake, 1972). The responsive approach let to generate large bases of data, to allow for a thick description of a program. In conclusion, the Responsive Evaluation allows for evaluations of programs which are either limited or broad in scope and is especially suited for programs which are in transition  Gender-Responsive Evaluation  Gender-Responsive evaluation is important as a means for building strong systems for generating and using evidence in order to improve the work that people do to achieve gender equality and women‚Äôs empowerment. Gender- responsive evaluation is a powerful resource for accomplish the transformative agenda of the Sustainable Development Goals. Gender-responsive approach can improve gender equality and the empowerment of women by incorporating gender and women‚Äôs rights aspects into evaluation approaches, methods, processes and use. Therefore, the evaluation is a link of positive change towards gender equality and the empowerment of women, but moreover the process itself also empowers the involved stakeholders and in this way, it prevents further gender discrimination and exclusion Effective gender-responsive programs and interventions enhance to eliminate social factors such as racism, sexism, and economic oppression which cannot be overlooked in discussions of effective interventions for women offenders. In termes of dealing with individual issues is important to take in consideration the social issues of poverty, race and gender inequalities because they have a profound impact on women lives. Successful interventions must relate to the social realities where women come from and to which they will return. Gender-Responsive Evaluation is sensitive to cultural differences and expectations.

It was part of the Roger Corman Presents series. It was filmed in Russia. Plot summary In the XVIII century, Aristocratic composer Octave Barron wrote a symphony for the Devil as part of a satanic pact. During his work Barron is \\"inspired\\" by murders he comits with the help of his lover and maid, Carlotta. For his crimes and devil worshiping Barron is taken out of his mansion by an angry mop of townsfolk and torn apart with horses. Years later his niece Gabriella (Jennifer Burns) inherits the estate and discovers the symphony. Believing all the stories about her late uncle are nothing more than superstition, she hires the church choir director and novice composer Marius (Ben Cross) to finish the symphony. In the process Carlotta, now an old woman and secret practitioner of witchcraft, is contacted by his master's spirit from hell, who directs her in how to bring him back in the body of Marius. Marius, possessed by Barron's evil spirit, murders two women for \\"inspiration\\" to finish the symphony, while Carlotta secretly helps him to scape and create alibis. Things get tense when Gabriella's fianc√© Julien arrives, clashing with Marius and showing jelousy. Carlotta poisons Julien to make him extremely angry and as a result he tries to rape Gabriella and challenges Marius to a duel. During the duel, Marius becomes possessed again by Barron's spirit after listening to the symphony being played by Carlotta, and in that state he defeats and kills Julien. Fearing for the worst, Marius tries to leave Gabriella's mansion, but before doing so Carlotta comits suicide, as instructed by Barron. Later, as Marius finishes the symphony he's taken again by the spirit of Barron and Gabriella by Carlotta's spirit. They both have sex even as their reflections show that they're possessed. Soon after Carlotta's spirit leaves Gabriella's body and she goes to hell as punishment for her suicide and crimes, as Barron intended from the beginning. Barron plans to live in full control of Marius body, but Gabriella confronts her uncle while the police and townspeople storm the place, seeking retribution for the third murder commited by Marius/Barron. A fight between the possessed Marius and Gabrielle ensues, and Marius regains conscience just before the police and the crowd arrive where they are. Knowing that there is no escape from the mental and physical hold Barron has over him, Marius chooses to save his soul by throwing himself into the fireplace and dying while burning, therefore releasing the spirit of Barron and saving his own soul. Nevertheless, that very same night, when everyone but Gabriella has left the mansion, Barron resurrects his dead body and comes out of the grave. Gabriella realizes she and Marius forgot to destroy the symphony that powers Barron. Gabriella then manages to survive by burning the symphony and Barron's piano, while the helpless Barron can only sit and play a few last moments at the burning piano before helplessly dying, this time forever. The next day, Gabriella closes all the doors to the estate and travels alone. Briefly looking back, she leaves the place, never to return.  Cast  * Ben Cross ... Marius Carnot * Jennifer Burns ...

He was an active member of Indian People's Theatre Association of West Bengal.  Early life  Bagchi was born in Tantihand village, Pabna District in Bangladesh. His family was attached with political and revolutionary activities in British India. His father, Durgadas Bagchi, was a member of the Jugantar group and elder brother took part in the Royal Indian Navy mutiny in 1946. After the partition, he came to Bankura and got admission in the Howrah Zilla School with his batch mate, veteran actor Soumitra Chatterjee. Bagchi regularly performed in school drama with Chatterjee, as a stage singer.  Cultural movement  He was initially dismissed from the school for having connection with the banned Communist party but latter joined in Narasinha Dutt College, Howrah. Since college life he became an active member of Indian People's Theatre Association (IPTA), Howrah District and latter joined in student and cultural wings of the Communist Party of India. Due to the political and cultural works he did not completed the graduation and again admitted into Krishnagar Government College. In the time of 1956 flood of West Bengal he took part in rescue team and collected fund roaming with the villages. That point of time Bagchi composed several mass, folk songs. His family was dead against those activities and sent him to Mumbai but Bagchi kept contact with Salil Chowdhury, Ruma Guha Thakurta, Basu Bhattacharya and others Bengali cultural political personalities there. It helped him to represent the Bengal in National conference of IPTA in Delhi. As per direction of Party congress of the communist party 1957 he went to the villagers again and worked with labours and farmers. Due to his singing ability he organised peasant association in Nadia and Murshidabad district successfully.  Politics  In 1951, Bagchi got the membership of the communist party.

While studying M.A in North Bengal University, he worked for the Left Front, became General Secretary of the students union and latter met with Charu Majumdar in Siliguri. But Majumdar negated his line of action. Bagchi wrote the first song on Naxalbari uprising in Kamtapuri dialect of the Rajbanshis 'O Naxal Naxal Naxalbarir Maa' which was popular to the Naxalites members. In 22 August 1967 he organised a public meeting in presence of Utpal Dutt in Siliguri in support of Naxal movement.

She is the Jack and Margaret Sweet Endowed Professor of History and the Associate Dean for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion in the College of Social Science at Michigan State University. She is also founding Editor-in-Chief of the Journal of West African History.  Background  Nwando Achebe was born in Enugu, eastern Nigeria to Nigerian writer, essayist, and poet, Chinua Achebe, and Christie Chinwe Achebe, a professor of Education. She is the spouse of Folu Ogundimu, professor of journalism at Michigan State University, and mother of a daughter, Chino. Her older brother, Chidi Chike Achebe is a physician-executive.  Education and Career  Achebe received her Ph.D. in African History from the University of California, Los Angeles in 2000. An oral historian by training, her areas of expertise are West African History, women, gender and sexuality histories. In 1996 and 1998, she served as a Ford Foundation and Fulbright-Hays Scholar-in-Residence at The Institute of African Studies and The Department of History and International Studies at the University of Nigeria, Nsukka. Her first academic position was as an Assistant Professor of History at the College of William and Mary. She then moved to Michigan State University in 2005 as a tenured Associate Professor, Professor in 2010, and is presently the Jack and Margaret Sweet Endowed Professor.  Scholarship  She has published six books. Her first book, Farmers, Traders, Warriors, and Kings: Female Power and Authority in Northern Igboland, 1900-1960, was published by Heinemann in 2005. Heralded as a ‚Äúlandmark in African historiography‚Äù by Distinguished Professor and author, Isidore Okpewho, and \\"a major event in African gender studies publishing,\\" by Chancellor Professor and feminist scholar, Obioma Nnaemeka, Achebe‚Äôs Farmers, Traders, Warriors, and Kings represents an important contribution to understanding gender and women‚Äôs history in Africa, as well as political and religious change in the colonial period. A significant and sustained intervention into debates over feminist historical methodology, the book centers what Achebe theorizes as the ‚Äúfemale spiritual principle‚Äù and northern Igbo women‚Äôs lives in ways that existing texts on Igbo history do not, by presenting both as active participants in the making of northern Igboland. Throughout the study, northern Igbo gendered histories are used to challenge received orthodoxies that characterize African women as subordinate by raising questions and presenting evidence concerning the true nature of female power and authority within this particular Igbo society. The author identifies she considers the religious, economic and political structures that allowed women to achieve measures of power during the precolonial or tupu ndi ocha abia epoch; as well as the effect of colonialism and missionary encroachment on these old structures and on women‚Äôs choices. As a piece of scholarship, Farmers, Traders, Warriors, and Kings is unsurpassed in its engagement with indigenous meaning, interpretation and understanding. Her second book, the critically acclaimed The Female King of Colonial Nigeria: Ahebi Ugbabe, was published in 2011 by Indiana University Press. It is a full-length biography on the only female warrant chief and king in British Africa, and it has won three book awards: the Aidoo-Snyder Book Prize, The Barbara \\"Penny\\" Kanner Book Prize and the Gita Chaudhuri Book Prize. A Leeds African Studies Bulletin review of the book calls it ‚Äúone of the most compellingly argued, rigorously researched scholarly writings in the fields of history and women studies in colonial Igbo society, Nigeria and Africa.\\" The biography, a fascinating case study of an extraordinary Igbo woman, Ahebi Ugbabe (c. 1885-1948)‚Äîwho during the course of her life transformed herself into a female king‚Äîreveals much about the shifting bases of gendered power under British indirect rule and the ways in which Igbo women and men negotiated and shaped the colonial environment. Drawing on extensive oral research, Achebe situates Ahebi‚Äôs life within the context of multiple gendered transformations into the female masculinities of female Headman, female Warrant Chief, female King and female husband. At the same time, the biography delineates the limits of such gendered transformations. In sum, The Female King of Colonial Nigeria illuminates one woman‚Äôs agency in remapping the terrain of traditional and colonial gendered politics in her district. Dr. Achebe is a co-author of the 2018 History of West Africa E-Course Book (British Arts and Humanities Research Council, 2018), ‚Äúa textbook aimed at West African students taking West African Senior School Certificate Examination (WASSCE) History Paper 1, ‚ÄúWest Africa and the Wider World from Earliest Times to 2000.‚Äù She is also co- editor with William Worger and Charles Ambler of A Companion to African History (Wiley Blackwell, 2019), and with Claire Robertson, Holding the World Together: African Women in Changing Perspective (University of Wisconsin Press, 2019). Achebe's 2020 Female Monarchs and Merchants Queens in Africa is published by Ohio University Press. Laura Seay of The Washington Post, writes of Female Monarchs and Merchant Queens in Africa, ‚ÄúA brilliant, thoroughly engaging and accessible book, ‚ÄòFemale Monarchs and Merchant Queens in Africa‚Äô is a fascinating and quick read that shows the many, many ways that women across the African continent have always led and continue to lead. It lays permanently to rest the notion of African women as passive or powerless and shows that women play key roles in every sector of society. It also makes a powerful case that African societies have more in common in this regard than differences, despite the continent‚Äôs size and diversity. Finally, Achebe makes a welcome contribution to efforts to bring analysis of queer identities to African Studies, showing definitively that notions of gender and sexuality have long been fluid and adaptable on the continent.\\"  Grants and Awards  Nwando Achebe has received grants from the Wenner Gren Foundation, Rockefeller Foundation, Woodrow Wilson, Fulbright-Hays, Ford Foundation, the World Health Organization and the National Endowment for the Humanities. She is also the recipient of three book awards.

Deutsche Bahn classifies it as a category 6 station and it has two platform tracks. It is located on the network of the Karlsruher Verkehrsverbund (Karlsruhe Transport Association, KVV) and belongs to fare zone 555. Since 2001, the station has also been part of the area where the fares of the Verkehrsverbund Rhein-Neckar (Rhine-Neckar Transport Association, VRN) are accepted at a transitional rate. Its address is Am Bahnhof 1. It is located on the Schifferstadt‚ÄìW√∂rth railway and was opened on 25 July 1876 with the commissioning of the Germersheim‚ÄìW√∂rth section of that railway. It is now classified as a Haltepunkt (halt). Since late 2010, it has been part of the Karlsruhe Stadtbahn. Its former entrance building is heritage-listed.  Location The station is located in the centre of Jockgrim.  History = Railway initiatives around Jockgrim = Originally the administration of the Circle of the Rhine (Rheinkreis), which was part of Bavaria, planned that its first railway line would be first in the north-south direction from Rheinschanze via Lauterbourg to Strasbourg, which would compete with the Mannheim‚ÄìBasel railway proposed by Baden. However, instead it was decided to build the Palatine Ludwig Railway (Pf√§lzische Ludwigsbahn, Ludwigshafen‚ÄìBexbach), which was opened in the period from 1847 to 1849. In the meantime, discussions took place as to whether a line from Neustadt via Landau to Wissembourg or a line along the Rhine via Speyer, Germersheim and W√∂rth was more urgent and desirable. Since the military preferred a route on the edge of the Palatinate Forest (Pf√§lzerwald), this was built in the form of the Maximilian Railway between Neustadt and Wissembourg. The branch line to Speyer, which was opened in 1847, was extended to Germersheim in 1864. A local committee from R√ºlzheim supported an extension of the line now ending in Germersheim to W√∂rth, which soon resulted in a first draft route plan. The line to W√∂rth, including Jockgrim station, was opened on 25 July 1876. = Further development = The station became part of the area of the Reichsbahndirektion (Reichsbahn railway division) of Ludwigshafen after the founding of the Deutsche Reichsbahn in 1922. During the dissolution of the railway division of Ludwigshafen, responsibility for it was transferred to the railway division of Mainz on 1 May 1937. Deutsche Bundesbahn (DB), which was responsible for railway operations from 1949, assigned the station to the railway division of Mainz, which was responsible for all railway lines within the newly created state of Rhineland-Palatinate. In the course of the staged dissolution of the railway division of Mainz from 1 August 1971, its counterpart in Karlsruhe took responsibility for the station. The station had been downgraded to a halt in the 1990s. The station became part of the Karlsruhe Stadtbahn in December 2010. Entrance building Former entrance building The former entrance building, which was built between 1860 and 1870, is built in the Neoclassical style and is now heritage listed. It is no longer used for railway operations. It was restored in the 2000s and now houses a law office as well as a psychotherapy practice. Operations =Passenger services= The halt is served at 30-minute intervals. Lines S 51 and S 52 of Karlsruhe Stadtbahn run once an hour, beginning in Germersheim station and running to the Karlsruhe inner city. The former follows the Winden‚ÄìKarlsruhe railway until shortly before Karlsruhe Hauptbahnhof, where it runs over the ramp to the Albtalbahnhof to connect with the tram network.

It sits between the village of Renton and the town of Dumbarton on the North side the Firth of Clyde in Dunbartonshire, Scotland (G82 4HQ). It was built in a Scottish baronial style by the architect Alexander Watt in 1866‚Äì69, or 1866-1869 according to some sources, for John Aiken of Glasgow.\\"It's a whole loch of castle\\", Oliver Stallwood, Metro, 9 May 2017, p. 18. Aiken's involvement in the wine and spirits mercantile trade was the basis for the castle's nickname, 'Brandy Castle', which has been in use ever since.Scots castle with UK‚Äôs ‚Äòlargest stained glass‚Äô window for sale. Russell Jackson, The Scotsman, 10 April 2017. Retrieved 10 May 2017. Early history Some sources indicated that the land was actually owned by Robert the Bruce at one time. The oldest document as to ownership is from 18 October 1533, a charter granting the property to John Palmer. The charter in 1569, after the Palmer family gave up ownership, granted the property to \\"John Sempill/Semple of Fulwood\\". The current house was built on the foundations of an earlier building, the blocked up windows of which can be seen in one of the wine cellars. Dalmoak was one of the royal manors in the district, and was used chiefly as a hunting seat. The Dalmoak Estate included the remains of the Palace of Cardross where King Robert the Bruce died. Aiken Mausoleum (detail) John Aiken, the castle's original owner, is buried in the grand and elaborate Aiken Mausoleum on the north slopes of the Glasgow Necropolis, as to reflect his vast wealth. 20th Century Before WW II, the Aiken Trust had leased the property to a local farmer, Robert Young (circa 1934) who operated it as Dalmoak Farm. (Some reports erroneously state that Young purchased the property.) For a time during the Second World War, the RAF used the castle as an operational headquarters. Later, it was sold to Alexandrina Reid Cousins who started the restoration. Her grandson, John Szwed, completed the restoration; the home was then converted into a nursing home. The full ownership record from 1801 to 2007 is stated as follows: > Descent: John Aiken (1801-75); to son, James Aiken (1843-1928); to Trustees, > one of whom (James Cyril Mawdesley Aiken), lived in the house; leased from > c.1934 to Mr Young, farmer of Dalmoak Farm; used by RAF during War as the > headquarters of the Clydebank decoy system, then as flats for homeless > families; then as cattle stalling until sold 1964 to Alexandrina Reid > Cousins (d. 1996); gifted to daughter, Constance Szwed-Cousins; gifted to > son, John Szwed (d. 2004), who restored it as a nursing home; to brother, > Michel Szwed-Cousins, who sold 2007 to Castle Glen Care & Nursing Home. Dalmoak House was A listed on 8 September 1980, #LB45600. The stables, lodge, walled garden and gatepiers are B listed, separately from the castle: #LB42921 and LB1163.

He ran into difficulties when trying to get planning permission. The 2019 listing by Savills provides no indication that Dalmoak House was ever used as a hotel. A November 2019 Country Life (magazine) report provided additional specifics about the property. While the castle was built in 1866, a home of some type has been located here since medieval times. The interior photographs confirm that the stained glass panels are quite massive. The home includes 14 bedrooms, a formal dining room and a basement with a wine cellar. The stable building has been renovated and is now used as cottages. Gallery File:Dalmoak House.jpgRear view of Dalmoak File:Dalmoak Castle.31.png2017  References  Further reading *Walker F.A. and F.

W. Bush negotiated a deficit reduction plan with Congressional leaders that included tax increases, despite his campaign pledge of \\"read my lips: no new taxes\\". The United States federal government shutdown of 1990 occurred over the 1990 Columbus Day weekend, from Saturday, October 6 through Monday, October 8. The shutdown stemmed from the fact that a deficit reduction package negotiated by President George H. W. Bush contained tax increases, despite his campaign promise of \\"read my lips: no new taxes\\", leading to a revolt led by House Minority Whip Newt Gingrich that defeated the initial appropriations package. Because the shutdown occurred over a weekend, the effects of the shutdown were lessened, with the National Parks and the Smithsonian museums being the most visible closures. Around 2,800 workers were furloughed, with the government losing $2.57 million in lost revenue and back wages.  Background  Newt Gingrich, then the House minority whip, led a revolt that led to the 1990 government shutdown. Because Gingrich opposed a deal supported by Congressional leaders from both parties, House Minority Leader Robert H. Michel characterized the revolt as \\"a thousand points of spite\\". The shutdown stemmed from disagreements over the 1991 United States federal budget, whose fiscal year was to begin on October 1, 1990. Over the course of the prior year, President George H. W. Bush negotiated with Congressional leaders on a deficit reduction plan. At the time, Congress was controlled by Democrats. In June, Bush announced support for tax increases to break a stall in the negotiations, abandoning his campaign promise of \\"read my lips: no new taxes\\". On September 30, the day before the beginning of fiscal year 1991, a deal was announced that would reduce the federal deficit by $500 billion over five years, including $134 billion in new taxes and making deep cuts to Medicare, with a temporary continuing resolution to fund the government through October 5. However, the new taxes in the bill were opposed by conservative Republicans led by House Minority Whip Newt Gingrich. The fact that deal was supported by the President and Congressional leaders from both parties after long negotiations, with Gingrich walking out during a televised event in the White House Rose Garden, caused House Minority Leader Robert H. Michel to characterized the revolt as \\"a thousand points of spite\\". In addition, liberal Democrats opposed the bill's cuts to benefit programs. In response to the opposition, Bush made a nationally televised address warning of the negative effects of failing to reduce the deficit. The deal was defeated in the House of Representatives in the early morning of October 5. Congress passed a second continuing resolution, but it was vetoed by Bush, causing a lapse in funding authority beginning on Saturday, October 6.  Shutdown  Because the shutdown occurred during a weekend, the most visible effect was the closure of National Parks and the Smithsonian museums. Although none of the appropriations bills had been passed, not all government agencies actually shut down. Full shutdowns occurred in the Environmental Protection Agency, Department of Labor, Office of Personnel Management, and Department of Housing and Urban Development, and partial shutdowns occurred in the Library of Congress, Government Printing Office, and the Departments of Energy, Interior, and State. According to a study by the General Accounting Office, Interior (which includes the National Park Service) furloughed about 2,800 workers, the Library of Congress around 100, and the other agencies fewer than 10 each.  Resolution and aftermath  In the morning of Tuesday, October 9, a revised deal was announced that would reduce the cuts to Medicare and would cut capital gains taxes in return for higher income taxes on the wealthy. A new continuing resolution lasting until October 19 was passed to allow for the bill to be finalized, allowing workers to return to work. The continuing resolution was passed by the Senate on a voice vote, and was passed by the House 362‚Äì3 at around 1:30 AM. The deal was driven by a perception that the public was blaming Congress for the shutdown rather than the President. Had the shutdown lasted into Tuesday, 2.4 million federal workers would have been furloughed. The final deficit reduction deal, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, derived 28% of its savings from tax increases including an increase in the top income tax rate, but the gasoline tax was not raised. Trims in Medicare and discretionary spending were also included in the deal. Only 47 of the 176 House Republicans voted for the final package. The defeat of the initial bill was seen as giving Democrats more leverage in negotiating the final deal. Bush initially announced that federal workers would not be paid for the furlough days, but Congress passed legislation granting them back pay due to the threat of lawsuits. The cost of the shutdown was $1.68 million, mainly as a result of lost revenue, not including back pay amounting to an additional $837,000. The shutdown was later seen as the first high-visibility example of Gingrich's political power, showing his willingness to weaken the President and his own party leaders to try to stop them from making compromises with Democrats. The revolt was partially responsible for negative perceptions of the Bush presidency, as they could not use Reagan's strategy of claiming that Congressional Democrats were responsible for the tax increases. During his 1992 reelection campaign, Bush called the deal a mistake.

Its leader and president is Benedetto Della Vedova, an economist and long-time Radical politician, who has been member of the European Parliament for the Bonino List (1999‚Äì2004), candidate for President of Lombardy (2000), president of the Italian Radicals (2001‚Äì2003), founder and president of the Liberal Reformers (2005‚Äì2009), member of the Chamber of Deputies for Forza Italia (2006‚Äì2008), The People of Freedom (2008‚Äì2011) and Future and Freedom (2011‚Äì2013), member of the Senate for Future and Freedom (2013), Civic Choice (2013‚Äì2015) and the Mixed Group (2015‚Äì2018), and undersecretary at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Renzi Cabinet (2014‚Äì2016) and Gentiloni Cabinet (2016‚Äì2018). The party took part to the 2018 general election within More Europe (+Eu). History FE was originally launched as a pro European Union campaign during a convention in Milan on 11 February 2017. The event saw the participation of leading public figures, including Mario Monti, Francesco Rutelli, Emma Bonino (leader of the Italian Radicals, who had recently parted ways from the Transnational Radical Party), Carlo Scognamiglio (leader of The Liberals), as well as some members of the Civics and Innovators (CI) group in the Chamber of Deputies (Andrea Mazziotti, Gianfranco Librandi and Stefano Dambruoso). The campaign soon became a structured association, with an active role played by Piercamillo Falasca and Carmelo Palma, who had been part of Della Vedova's inner circle since the years as Radical. In June 2017 Della Vedova introduced FE to the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party (ALDE Party) in Brussels, and, for their part, ALDE leaders had also been trying to unite FE, Civic Choice (SC), the Radicals and other left-leaning liberals, in order to build the Italian section of the ALDE Party, a goal they have long missed, most notably with the SC-dominated European Choice list in the 2014 European Parliament election (0.7% of the vote). In July 2017 FE organised a convention in Rome, which was seen as the beginning of its transformation into a full- fledged party. The event was attended by Bonino, Mazziotti, Librandi, Umberto Ranieri and Carlo Calenda (minister of Economic Development). In November 2017 FE, the Radicals and some CI members launched More Europe (+Eu), a pro- Europeanist list for the 2018 general election, led by Bonino. +Eu was part of the centre-left coalition led by Matteo Renzi and the Democratic Party (PD). The list won 2.6% of the vote in the election, falling short of the 3% threshold, and no FE member was elected neither in single-seat constituencies (Della Vedova missed the election in the constituency of Prato, Tuscany for 1.5% of the vote).https://elezionistorico.interno.gov.it/index.php?tpel=C&dtel;=04/03/2018&tpa;=I&tpe;=L&lev0;=0&levsut0;=0&lev1;=12&levsut1;=1&lev2;=1&levsut2;=2&lev3;=1&levsut3;=3&ne1;=12&ne2;=121&ne3;=1211&es0;=S&es1;=S&es2;=S&es3;=S&ms;=S In April 2018 FE's first assembly elected Della Vedova president, Mazziotti vice president, Falasca secretary and Palma coordinator of the national board. In July 2018 +Eu started to organise itself as a full-fledged party. It was decided that a committee, presided by Gianfranco Spadaccia (a long-time Radical), would lead +Eu until the founding congress, scheduled for January 2019.

Among his siblings were Fredrik Ljungstr√∂m, Birger Ljungstr√∂m, and Georg Ljungstr√∂m. Oscar Ljungstrom served as an archivist in the urban engineering office of Stockholm. With a background as an officer in Landstormen of the Swedish Army, and a determined anti-communist, he joined the White forces under Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim in Finland after the outbreak of the Finnish Civil War in 1918. He served as a platoon commander during the war, which the Whites eventually won against the Reds. Oscar Ljungstr√∂m had artistic interests and made several visual artworks, working mainly with oil paintings. Yet, writing became his primary element. Of a family background partly of Christians outside of the mainline Lutheran Church of Sweden, Ljungstr√∂m's main interests were in philosophy and religion ‚Äì interests shared by his brother Georg Ljungstr√∂m ‚Äì and he wrote extensively on matters of religious philosophy. Theosophy made an impact on European intellectuals and artists of liberal mindset around the turn of the 20th century, and this also applied to the brothers. Although an outspoken critic of esoterism, he advocated an eclectic ethical approach as opposed to both the state religion and secularism of his time, sparking debate on syncretism, and how Christianity could benefit from the inspiration of Eastern philosophy. After retirement, he resided with the Theosophical Society in Lomaland in California, United States. Among his last writings was Fredstankens tv√• aspekter (1940), where he expressed hopes for a peaceful coexistence of nations after an anticipated end of World War II. He died in 1943.

Shogakukan has published 13 novels since March 2015 under their Gagaga Bunko imprint. Two manga adaptations have been published by Shogakukan and Square Enix. An anime television series adaptation by Silver Link premiered on October 8, 2017. Plot The story follows the novelist Itsuki Hashima who is surrounded by various people, including a beautiful genius writer who loves him, a big-sisterly college classmate, a fellow male writer, a sadistic tax accountant, and his editor. As the story progresses, the underlying conflicts of dreams and goals surface, as each character attempts to achieve their dreams, in their own way. One such example is the rivalry between author Itsuki and his friend Haruto. Itsuki's stories are driven by a passion for stories about little sisters with praise from a selective yet strongly supportive fan-base, whereas Haruto's stories are given by victory and romance through more common, yet popular cliches. Each of their stories are riddled with common light novel themes and concepts, such as romantic comedy elements and erotic illustrations. They are all looked after by Itsuki's younger \\"brother\\" Chihiro, who in fact is his younger step sister. Characters ; : :Itsuki is a 20-year-old author who has an obsession towards younger sisters. He is a novelist who debuted when he was in high school; all of his novels feature younger sisters as the heroine. In the span of five years, he has published 20 books, some of which have ranked in the top 10 weekly rankings for light novels on Oricon. Despite his success, his irrational personality and writing style has led to mediocre ratings compared to his fellow writers. His relationship with his father became worse when his father remarried to Chihiro's mother only three years after Itsuki's mother died. Towards the end of the series, he proposed to Nayuta. The series ends with him being married to Nayuta and them having a son named Sora. ; : :Chihiro appears as Itsuki's younger stepbrother, but Chihiro is actually a girl. She is a dependable person who looks after everyone around her. The reason why she hides her real gender is because their father thought she was in danger when he found out about Itsuki's obsession during his novel debut. She hides her true identity only in front of Itsuki and his acquaintances. Her main hobby throughout the series is housekeeping. ; : :Nayuta is an 18-year- old genius novelist who debuted after she won a newcomer prize. Nayuta Kani is her pseudonym and at first even Itsuki does not know her real name. She cannot write if she is not naked, has a slight obsession with personal nudity, and she likes dirty jokes. Starting in junior high school, she refused to go to school after getting bullied. After reading Itsuki's novel, she falls in love with him and will not hesitate to show it. She is also part-Russian. It is later revealed that her real name is . At the end of the series, she is married to Itsuki and is pregnant with their second child. ; : :Miyako is Itsuki's classmate at college who at first had a bad first impression towards him. While Miyako does not understand Itsuki's stories, she became his fashion advisor to help him with his novel. After Itsuki dropped out college, Miyako still comes to see him. She has feelings for Itsuki but decided to support Nayuta instead. She is good friends with Nayuta and seems to be getting dragged into the latter's obsession with personal nudity. ; : :Haruto is another novelist who debuted around the same time as Itsuki. Despite his cool appearance, he loves maid characters and owns a lot of adult games and figurines. Haruto has a \\"persona\\" in his social media to gain fans for his novel and to increase his series' popularity. He has a younger sister () whom he thought is harsh to him, but is actually a sister who cannot be honest. His light novel series got a poorly-adapted anime because it was used as tool for newcomer voice actors with no ability. In the middle of his shock, Miyako encouraged him and his hard work. He gained a crush on Miyako, however he found out her feelings for Itsuki and decided to \\"keep going on his pace.\\" ; : :Setsuna is a 16-year-old illustrator who goes under the pen name . Setsuna was in charge of illustrating Itsuki's novels until Itsuki decided to stop because he thought his series is not worthy enough for Setsuna's art and asked him to wait until he is worthy enough. He dresses in Harajuku fashion and has an easygoing personality, even on deadlines. He has a butt fetish. ; : :Ashley is a 32-year-old tax accountant who wears lolita fashion. She is reliable but sadistic; she makes her clients reveal their fetishes through their expenses, but raises their tax return in exchange. She is currently the only one among Itsuki's acquaintances who knows about Chihiro's real identity. ; : :Kenjiro is an editor at GF Bunko who is in charge of Itsuki's works. He looks like a typical office worker and is often seen drunk when overly stressed with his job, particularly when it comes to Itsuki and Setsuna's deadlines. ; : :Kaiko is a girl who is in charge of adapting Itsuki's novel ( in the anime) into a manga. Her drawing skill level is so high that Itsuki becomes moved after seeing her works, despite her being a newcomer. She has an underwear fetish and refuses to draw a completely naked person without one, but then learn to make an exception thanks to Nayuta. The ribbon she wears on her head is actually a pair of panties; she will wear them on her face before she draws.

The details of the crime were made public soon after the start of the trial of the two boys who murdered two-year-old James Bulger in Merseyside, which contributed to the resulting moral panic in the United Kingdom. Background and murder Phillips lived on the Penywaun council estate, which had become increasingly dangerous since unemployment increased in the Cynon Valley and the local police station was closed as a cost-saving measure.Peter Dunn, \\"Despair and death on an estate without hope: Peter Dunn looks at the background to the brutal murder of a lonely old woman whose cries for help went unheeded\\", The Independent, 10 March 1993.

Also \\"Brutal Murder by Teen- Age Girls Adds to Britons' Shock\\", Los Angeles Times, 11 March 1993; \\"Britain Reels at Details of Torture Death\\", Tulsa World, 11 March 1993. Phillips took Maria for walks when she was little, but later made complaints about loud music and drunkenness at the Rossi house, and reported Maria to the police; after that the Rossis despised her, rubbish was dumped in her garden, and Maria threw stones at her, called her a \\"fucking bitch\\" in the street, smeared feces on her house and committed other vandalism, stole her money, and mistreated her dog, Chum.Marianne MacDonald, \\"Custody for 'evil' girls who killed pensioner\\", The Independent, 9 March 1993. In 1987, Phillips began asking to be moved to another house, but her request was not granted. In 1992, after Maria burgled her house, she wrote to her MP, Ann Clwyd; the police then put her in touch with Victims' Services and installed a burglar alarm, and a deputy divisional commander wrote to Clwyd that \\"All matters raised within the letter [had] been satisfactorily addressed.\\"Anne Clwyd with Joanna Masters, Rebel With a Cause, London: Biteback, 2017, , pp. 85‚Äì86. Late in the evening of 16 July 1992, under the influences of cider and drugs, Maria Rossi and her friend, Christina \\"Tina\\" Molloy, both 17, saw Phillips, who was then 70 and partially sighted, calling for Chum to come in; they forced her back into her house, where they strangled her with the dog's chain, slashed her 35 times in the face with a utility knife, scissors and a piece of broken glass, stabbed her 86 times and stamped on her chest, breaking five ribs, broke her nose and attempted to scalp her, and broke eggs over her body. They stole her vacuum cleaner, radio and her money. The next morning Maria was heard singing \\"Ding, dong, Edna's dead\\" or \\"We've killed Edna\\".\\"Stay away from us, killer told\\", Wales Online, 4 April 2003, updated 1 April 2013. Trial verdict and public reactions A crowd of 300 people attacked the Rossi house after discovery of the murder, throwing stones, destroying a greenhouse belonging to Rossi's grandparents and uprooting the plants. 'Murderer' was painted on the house and Molloy's parents' house was also wrecked; both families had to be taken to safety and their new addresses kept secret. On 8 March 1993, both Rossi, who had previous convictions for theft and drug offenses, and Molloy, who had two previous convictions for assault and criminal damage, were given indefinite sentences. In sentencing, Judge Baker described them as \\"evil products of a modern age\\"Alix Kirsta, Deadlier than the Male: Violence and Aggression in Women, London: HarperCollins, 1994, , p. 133. and said: \\"If as youngsters some discipline had been imposed upon you, whether in the home, at school or through the courts, you might not be standing in the dock for this dreadful offense.\\" Details of the crime were first made public at the sentencing, which followed by less than three weeks the start of the trial of two ten-year-old boys for murdering two-year-old James Bulger. It contributed to a moral panic in the UK concerning young killers,\\"[I]n the construction of the moral panic surrounding the James Bulger incident, [there were] a multitude of 'newsworthy' or 'panic-worthy' primary narratives [including] the abduction and murder of James Bulger [and] the murder of Edna Phillips by two teenage girls\\": \\"Abstracts\\", European Journal on Criminal Policy and Research 3.4, December 1995, pp. 132‚Äì36.Rosalind Miles, The Children We Deserve: Love and Hate in the Making of the Family, London: HarperCollins, 1995, , pp. 231‚Äì32. who, the sociologist Colin Hay said in a 1995 article, were particularly disturbing since they did not constitute a clear \\"folk devil\\".\\"Trial by Spectacle.

Sean Patrick Hier, London: Routledge, 2011, , pp. 53‚Äì70, p. 58. Appeal and reduction in sentence Molloy and Rossi were sentenced to a 'tariff' (minimum term) of 15 years. In April 1999 the Home Secretary, Jack Straw, reduced Rossi's to 13 years, but the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Woolf, refused to reduce it further, while reducing Molloy's to 12 years.\\"Killer could be released early\\", BBC news, 11 February 2004.\\"Young killer may be released\\", Wales Online, 12 February 2004, updated 31 March 2013. In a case brought on behalf of Rossi and of Anthony Dudson, who was 16 when he participated in the murder of Suzanne Capper in Manchester in December 1992, the High Court ruled that the Home Secretary must regularly review all sentences of those in prison for murders committed when they were juveniles; this ruling was affirmed in February 2004 over the objections of the then Home Secretary, David Blunkett. Rossi was then known as Maria Smith. Rossi was released in 2010. People in Penywaun warned that neither of them would be welcome to return. Christina Molloy was found dead in her house in Cambridgeshire in May 2017. Since her release she had struggled with alcohol and drug addiction, which led to her death.

Participants must compose a tanka poem beside a stream, within a time limit set by the passage of a lacquer cup of sake floating towards them on the water.

The film features Sharwanand and Lavanya Tripathi in lead roles along with Aksha Pardasany in an extended cameo role. Ashish Vidyarthi, Ravi Kishan, and Kota Srinivasa Rao play supporting roles. The score and soundtrack is composed by Radhan and cinematography is by Karthik Ghattamneni. The film released on 12 May 2017. Plot Radha Krishna (Sharwanand) grows up admiring Lord Krishna. He does not miss any chance to know about Krishna and his stories of protecting Dharma. An incident makes him believe that he can help people in need by becoming a police officer just like Krishna did. After completing his studies, he helps the police bust a gang and gets a police job with special permission. Radha Krishna completes his training in Hyderabad and gets posted to a small village with a 0% crime rate in Warangal district. He feels unhappy in the beginning that he had not gotten any adventurous work that he had always dreamt of, but he later sees a girl named Radha (Lavanya Tripathi) and tries to win her heart. Meanwhile, the home minister (Ashish Vidyarthi) of the state wants to become a chief minister and tries to influence the party observer and current chief minister (Kota Srinivasa Rao). However, the party observer declares his aide MLA Sujatha (Ravi Kishan) as a candidate for the post of Chief Minister, a very honest leader. On the other end, Radha Krishna gets transferred to the old city, Hyderabad. Suddenly, bomb blasts occur in Sujatha's election campaign. In the bomb blast, Radha Krishna loses his colleagues and promises to take revenge on the responsibility for the bomb blasts. It is then revealed that those bomb blasts were planned by Sujatha himself to gain sympathy from the people as an aspirant for the Chief Minister position. Meanwhile, due to Radha Krishna's unpredictable actions, Sujatha gets suspicious on Radha and promotes him to his personal security. In the course of events, it is revealed by his henchmen that Radha Krishna is well- aware of Sujatha's plans and actions. Then after some comical sequences and fights, Radha Krishna reveals Sujatha's true nature in the public. Sujatha gets run over in a stampede and dies. Radha Krishna concludes with a message that the public must respect the police as it is them that protect and maintain the good in the society just like Lord Krishna did during his entire life. The film ends with Radha Krishna again getting transferred to another place.

He later founded the Alliance of Fairness and Justice. Early career and activism Chien graduated from National Taiwan University and worked as a lawyer. He became active in the tangwai movement after the Kaohsiung Incident as a journalist and cartoonist. He and Chiou I-jen co- founded the Taiwan Labor Legal Support Group in 1984, which was later renamed the , an organization that Chien served as president before his election to the legislature. Political career Chien was elected to two terms as a member of the Legislative Yuan and served from 1996 to 2002. A legislative representative of the Democratic Progressive Party, Chien belonged to its New Tide faction. In 1999, he worked to pass stronger legislation protecting conscientious objection to military service on religious grounds after the Judicial Yuan ruled that such reasoning was not sufficient to refuse conscription. Chen spoke out against black gold politics later that year, citing data collected by the National Police Agency. In 2000, Chien was attacked by Lo Fu-chu and Lin Ming-yi. Lo later gained a reputation for using violence on the legislative floor. After stepping down from the legislature in 2002, Chien became leader of the Peacetime Foundation. Through the foundation, Chien advocates peace on both sides of the Taiwan Strait, leading to a formally independent Taiwan, negotiation with Chinese civic groups on Cross- Strait issues, and organizes the Peace Film Festival. Chien founded the Alliance of Fairness and Justice, also known as the Pan-Purple Coalition, on 10 August 2003 and announced that he would represent the coalition of social groups as its presidential candidate in the 2004 elections, but soon left the race. Since leaving office, Chien has supported many social causes and initiatives. Among them are judicial reform and tax reform, as well as workers' rights. Chien has also called for the government to fund programs that would raise Taiwan's birth rate. In 2005, he pushed the Chen Shui-bian administration to adopt less demeaning Chinese translations of the words \\"Jew\\" and \\"Islam\\". The next year, Chien helped lead the Million Voices Against Corruption, President Chen Must Go campaign alongside Shih Ming-teh. Chien later joined the Alliance for Fair Tax Reform to serve as its spokesman, leaving the group to establish the Anti-Poverty Alliance. Led by Chien, members of the Anti-Poverty Alliance held two hunger strikes in October 2011 to raise awareness of economic inequality in Taiwan. In 2012, Chien, representing the Anti-Poverty Alliance, was named to the Executive Yuan Tax Reform Committee alongside Wang Jung-chang of the Alliance for Fair Tax Reform. Chien and Wang had previously worked together prior to this as members of the Pan-Purple Collation. Additionally, both were members of an earlier convocation of the Tax Reform Committee which met from June 2008 to December 2009. Chien published a book, Power of the Weak in 2015. In it he advocated for the government to adopt nonviolent civil resistance as part of a strategy for national defense. Chien's Anti-Poverty Alliance supported third force political candidates in the 2016 elections, the most successful of which belonged to the New Power Party. Political stances Chien's opinion pieces appear frequently in the Taipei Times. His editorials for the publication have discussed Taiwan's participation in the International Criminal Court and the 2011 food scandal. Chien has also written repeatedly on the merits of nonviolent civil resistance, a topic on which he published a book in 2015. The Taipei Times has also published Chien's writing on economic inequality and tax reform.

It was one of the most popular comic series in the Netherlands in the 1940s and still highly regarded as a classic.Rich Thomassen, En Maz cre√´erde Dick Bos, Aspekt, 2014. Concept Dick Bos is a brave private investigator who is a master in jiujitsu and therefore used his fists a lot. Many stories follow him as he solves cases and has lengthy fight sequences in which thieves and crooks are beaten up. History In 1940 Alfred Mazure created Dick Bos, which he signed with Maz. The comics were very popular with the youth because during the Nazi occupation all American and British comics were banned and therefore Dutch magazines had to rely on home-made comics to sustain reader's interest. Yet in 1942 even Dick Bos got banned because Mazure refused to turn the comic into a Nazi propaganda strip, despite requests of the Nazi publishing company Ullstein. Mazure also made five low-budget films based on Dick Bos, which were shot and edited between 1942 and 1946. Two of these were Inbraak (1942) and Moord in het Modehuis (1946). After the Netherlands were liberated in 1944 Dick Bos was allowed publication again. Yet they caused a severe media scare over their rather violent content. Dutch Minister of Education, Culture and Science Theo Rutten eventually sent a circular among schools to discourage distribution of \\"violent comics\\". As a result, many comics in the Netherlands were only allowed if they were published in text comics format (which still allowed children to read more) and if the content was child-friendly. Mazure was therefore forced to quit Dick Bos, since magazines and newspapers were no longer willing to publish violent comics. Between 1963 and 1967, when media censorship against comics loosened, Mazure drew new adventures of Dick Bos and made two animated short films based on the character. Parody Ren√© Windig and Eddie de Jong parodied Dick Bos as Dick Bosch.

From Nov 1944, he worked in the OKW/Chi cipher bureau as a cryptanalyst. Life Kneschke came from a poor working family. In the Weimar Republic, undertaking study with little money was very difficult and required Kneschke to seek employment as well. In 1922, Kneschke, completed his seminary training as a primary school teacher and at the same time successfully passed the university-preparatory school leaving qualification, Abitur. After a four-year degree at TU Dresden, he graduated as an engineer in technical physics. In 1927, he was put forward by advisors Dr. Georg Wiarda and Max Otto Lagally for promotion to Dr. Phil in applied mathematics with a thesis titled: Application of the theory of integral equations to the impact problem of solid insulators (German:Anwendung der Theorie der Integralgleichungen auf das Durchschlagsproblem von festen Isolatoren). From 1926 to 1930 he was assistant to Max Otto Lagally. At the age of 27, he qualified as a lecturer at the Dresden University of Technology and passed the habilitation for the higher school office. In 1930 he went to work in the debt service, but at the same time taught as a lecturer at the TH Dresden, in 1938 he was awarded the title of professor extraordinarius. Kneschke was a teacher of mathematics and physics at the Higher School of Experiments in Dresden, then a mathematics lecturer at the Chemnitz University of Technology. He then headed the Oberrealschule in Meerane. In 1939 he was drafted. In 1945 he was released from the public service of Saxony in the course of denazification as a Nazi Party member. In 1945, he was dismissed from the debt service agency and the university service due to former Nazi Party membership. Between 1945 and 1949 he worked as an electrician FA. Gei√üler in Meerane. Between 1950 - 1951 Kneschke worked as a mathematical research assistant at VEB Carl Zeiss in Jena. On 1 November 1951 he was appointed as Professor with Chair of Technical Mechanics at the Faculty of Natural Sciences and Supplementary Courses of the Freiberg University of Mining and Technology and Director of the Institute for Applied Mathematics and Technical Mechanics.

Best known in the UK as a contributor to the Judge Dredd series of comics in the 2000 AD series, newspaper comic strips appearing in the first UK newspaper to be printed in full colour, Today, and The Daily Star. He is also one of the first UK born artists to obtain international recognition for developing commercial Disney art originating from the UK.  Early life  Kim Raymond was born in Woking, Surrey to parents Eric, an ex-navy communications engineer working in the domestic television industry and Patricia Raymond, a nurse. His early love of comics was of home-grown UK titles such as The Beano, Tiger and Lion, and more significantly, TV(Century)21, a spin-off title accompanying the puppet TV series of Gerry Anderson. Kim Raymond at his studio in Surrey - mid 1980s British artist Frank Bellamy contributed regularly to TV21 and later drew a daily comic strip for The Mirror newspaper, Garth. This had a major influence on the ambitions of Raymond, along with the growing availability of Marvel comics in the UK such as Spiderman, The Silver Surfer and Thor. After three years studying animation at art college in Surrey he took his interest to The Walt Disney Company in London, and began as a junior artist in the Character Merchandising Division. But after a year decided to pursue a career in comics, approaching the agent of David Wright, illustrator of the daily newspaper strip Carol Day, through his son Patrick Wright, at the time himself illustrating Modesty Blaise for the London Evening Standard.  UK Comics  Raymond started his comic career working for Dundee-based DC Thompson on girls' titles such as Mandy and Tracy. Later he progressed to boys comics for IPC London, on M.A.S.K., Robo machines, Starcom and then later Tharg's Future Shocks and Judge Dredd in black and white in the early eighties. His ability to draw women well and with confidence eventually led him to contribute to the exploits of Judge Anderson, Psi Division, in Judge Dredd. He confesses that he was heavily influenced by Jim Holdaway, the first Modesty Blaise artist; Romero, a Spanish artist who took up the mantle on Modesty Blaise after Holdaway‚Äôs untimely death, Frank Bellamy, and Ron Smith, who twice helped him with advice and guidance in his early and later comic career. Smith was also a regular Dredd artist and a co-contributor to the City of the Damned epic on which Raymond also worked, illustrating three episodes. His final comic work appeared over several years in the two daily national newspaper strips, Checkout Girl (The Daily Star) and Roy of the Rovers (Today Newspaper).  Disney  In the late eighties it became clear to Kim Raymond that the UK comics industry was becoming more ‚Äòlicensed properties‚Äô with little room to create new characters, so he returned to the area of work that had a huge legacy for him in terms of drawing quality, the art of Walt Disney. He worked for several years as a freelance contributor, and then in 1992 created Character Magic Ltd. in order to further develop both the quality of work that he was producing and also service the large licensee base that he was consulted to engage with by Disney. After further masterclass training in both the US and Paris, Raymond became the leading UK Disney Character artist and in 1999 he began working for The Disney Stores Europe as a consultant. He currently holds the position of Senior Principal Artist working for the U.S. parent company at Disney in London and is responsible for many Disney art successes.

(2014). A guide to quality in post-traditional online higher education. In J. Daniel & S. Uvalic ÃÅ-Trumbic ÃÅ (Eds.). Dallas: Academic Partnerships. Retrieved from http://www.academicpartnerships.com/ sites/default/ les/Guide-OnlineHigherEd.PDF  History  In Australia, Open Educational Practices (OEP) started around 1998, when some of the first open access initiatives were introduced and supported by the Australian government.Picasso, V., & Phelan, L. (2014). The evolution of open access to research and data in Australian higher education. RUSC. Universities and Knowledge Society Journal, 11(3), 122‚Äì133. doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.7238/rusc.v11i3.2076 In 2002, the open access movement had a substantial boost due to a programme funded by the Australian government called ‚ÄúBacking Australia‚Äôs Ability‚Äù.Shipp, J. (2006). Open access in Australia. In N. Jacobs (Ed.), Open access: key strategic, technical and economic aspects (pp. 169‚Äì174). London: Chandos Publishing. This programme was aimed broadly at promoting excellence in research, science and technology, but several initiatives attached to this programme played important roles in the progress of open access in Australia. They assisted in: raising awareness about open access; building research information infrastructure, including university repositories of open data, thesis and other digital objects; establishing metadata standards to improve access and discoverability of research information; and developing related guidelines.  Transformation of OEP Realised in Australia  Although the opportunities and benefits of OEP have been realised by the Australian government through investments in open access and by the VET and schools sectors, it was only in 2010 ‚Äî almost 10 years after the movement emerged in other parts of the world (i.e., the MIT OpenCourseWare Consortium in 2001) ‚Äî that it started getting more popular in higher education. It was during this period that the Office for Learning and Teaching funded a two-year research project, which resulted in the report \\"Adoption, Use and Management of Open Educational Resources in Australia Higher Education\\".Bossu, C., Brown, M., & Bull, D. (2014a). Adoption, use and management of Open Educational Resources to enhance teaching and learning in Australia. Sydney: Australian Government O ce for Learning and Teaching. Retrieved from http://www.olt.gov.au/system/ les/resources/CG10_1687_Bossu_ Report_2014.pdf One of the main deliverables of this project was the ‚ÄúFeasibility Protocol for OER and OEP‚Äù (Bossu, Brown, & Bull, 2014b), which is a set of guiding principles that prompts questions and raises issues to be considered by educational institutions wishing to experiment with OER and OEP. The protocol attempts to assist higher education leaders to make informed decisions about the adoption of OER and OEP at several levels within the institution, from management to individuals, including academics and students.Bossu, C., Brown, M., & Bull, D. (2014b). Feasibility protocol for OER and OEP: A decision making tool for higher education. Sydney: Australian Government O ce for Learning and Teaching. Retrieved from http://www.olt.gov.au/ system/ les/resources/CG10_1687_Bossu_Feasibility%20Protocol_2014. pdf The Feasibility Protocol addresses four topics: the opportunities that OER and OEP could bring to institutions and broader society; the challenges associated with OER and OEP adoption; considerations surrounding the institutions‚Äô strategic directions for an effective adoption of OER and OEP; and policy recommendations for higher education institutions in Australia. Another contribution of the two-year research project in helping the sector realise the opportunities of OER for higher education in Australia was the organisation of the first National Symposium on OER, held in August 2012 in Sydney. A range of stakeholders representing 21 national and international institutions (including higher educational institutions, VET and government bodies) attended the symposium. The symposium was a key dissemination strategy for this project, and a chance for the stakeholders to meet and discuss issues related to open education, opportunities for collaboration, and ways to together overcome some of these concerns.  Scope of Transformation of OEP in Australia  The scope of the transformation of OEP in Australia is best understood by looking at the main initiatives, programmes and activities categorised into five themes: collaboration; resources and infrastructure; open policies; learning and teaching; and research. = Collaboration = Collaboration amongst institutions and countries is recognised as one of the opportunities of the transformative potential of open education.Commonwealth of Learning. (2011). Guidelines for Open Educational Resources (OER) in higher education. Vancouver: UNESCO/Commonwealth of Learning. Retrieved from http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0021/002136/213605e. pdf An example of this collaboration is the OERu, which is a consortium of currently 39 international educational institution partners, spread across five continents. In Australia, six universities are part of this network: University of Canberra, University of Southern Queensland, University of Wollongong, Charles Sturt University, Curtin University and the University of Tasmania. The OERu‚Äôs vision is to make education accessible to everyone. Co-ordinated by the OER Foundation, it is an independent, not-for-profit network that offers free online courses for students worldwide. It also provides affordable ways for learners to gain academic credit towards qualifications from recognised institutions.McGreal, R., Mackintosh, W., & Taylor, J. (2013). Open Educational Resources university: An assessment and credit for students initiatives. In R. McGreal, W. Kinuthia, & S. Marshall (Eds.), Open educational resources: Innovation, research and practice (pp. 47‚Äì59). Vancouver: Commonwealth of Learning and Athabasca University. = Resources and infrastructure = Several Australian universities have invested in resource production and in the development and improvement of technological infrastructure. Examples of resource production are initiatives such as MOOCs. Following the international trend, a number of Australian universities have joined the major MOOC providers, including edX, Coursera and the British FutureLearn, while others have developed their own MOOCs.Norton, A., & Cherastidtham, I. (2014). Mapping Australian higher education, 2014‚Äì15. Grattan Institute. Currently, more than 100 Australian MOOCs are on offer.https://www.mooc-list.com/countrys/australia These are mostly free online courses and are likely to approach learning and teaching more traditionally (xMOOCs) instead of being truly open and adopting open pedagogies and open learning ecosystems (including cMOOCs).James, R., & Bossu, C. (2014). Conversations from south of the equator: Challenges and opportunities in OER across broader Oceania. RUSC. Universities and Knowledge Society Journal, 11(3), 78‚Äì90. doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.7238/rusc. v11i3.2220Smyth, R., Bossu, C., & Stagg, A. (2015). Toward an Open Empowered Learning Model of pedagogy in higher education. In M. Keppell, S. Reushle, & A. Antonio (Eds.), Open learning and formal credentialing in higher education: Curriculum models and institutional policies. Hershey: IGI Global. In Australia, only a few MOOCs have been developed with some open aspects. For instance, the content might be openly licensed, but the learning management system (LMS) where the courses are hosted is a proprietary system and requires learners to register. Some institutions are still investing in this space, but the initial hype about MOOCs seems to have faded to some extent in Australia. = Open policies = Encouraged by recent OEP initiatives taking place nationally and internationally, some Australian universities have realised that they need to review and, as needed, further develop their related policies in order to enable innovation and maintain a competitive edge. According to Scott,Scott, B. (2014). Supporting OER engagement at Australian universities: An overview of the intellectual property rights, copyright and policy considerations for OER. Retrieved from http://www.olt.gov.au/system/ les/resources/CG10_1687_ Bossu_OER%20engagement_2014.pdf intellectual property policies are currently under review at several Australian universities. Other universities have encouraged the adoption of OEP through supporting documentation, such as university strategic plans and teaching performance reviews. An example of such a development is the Technology Enhanced Learning and Teaching White Paper 2014‚Äì2018, developed by the Tasmanian Institute of Learning and Teaching at the University of Tasmania.Brown, N., Kregor, G., Williams, G., Padgett, L., Bossu, C., Warren, V., & Osborne, J. (2013). Technology-enhanced learning and teaching White Paper 2014‚Äì2018. Tasmanian Institute of Learning and Teaching (Trans.). Hobart: University of Tasmania. = Learning and teaching = Although it could be assumed that the examples above might all impact learning and teaching, there are some programmes specifically targeting learning and teaching for OEP. Most universities experimenting with OEP in Australia have some form of academic development activities to build internal capacity. These activities are in the form of workshops, webinars, one-on-one consultancies and online resources produced by the institutions or adopted/adapted from elsewhere. One example is the ‚ÄúCurriculum Design for Open Education,‚Äù which is an open and online professional development micro-course focused on developing the capacity of academics to adopt OEP as the basis for innovative, engaging and agile curricula. = Research = Research in OEP has been conducted as part of some of the projects and initiatives in Australia. Postgraduate students in several institutions have also undertaken research, and could very well be the Australian OEP advocates and researchers of the future.

It went into effect on 1 July 1974 and required licenses by the Swedish Data Protection Authority for information systems handling personal data. History Information and communications technologies (ICTs) were far developed in Sweden due to multiple circumstances and the use of computers in public administration was introduced relatively early. Furthermore, the concepts of transparency, public access and openness were traditionally widely present in Swedish society. Widespread public concern was raised in 1969 due to the year's public census. In 1969, the Royal Commission on Publicity and Secrecy was set up to investigate problems associated with the increasing use of computers to store and process personal data. They provided the initial analysis, recommendations and drafts that addressed these problems. In July 1972, they published their report Computers and Privacy (Sw. Data och integritet). The Data Inspection Board (DIB), proposed in the report, was set up in July 1973. In April 1973, the Riksdag uncontentiously passed the Data Act, also proposed in the report, which only slightly modified the commission's draft. It then came into force in July 1973. An associated amendment to the Freedom of the Press Act was adopted in February 1974 ‚àí around the same time as the Credit Information Act and the Debt Recovery Acts which regulated computerized credit information. =Problems and succession= As the law's data registration and transborder data flow requirements were considered cumbersome and confusing by private and public organizations and the DIB was soon overcome by the magnitude of registrations the law was amended in 1982 which made the private sector and the government more self-sufficient in terms of registration. After several more amendments in 1989 a Commission on Data Protection was set up to make a total revision of the act. The commission submitted its final report in 1993 recommending a new Data Protection Act based largely on the then current second proposal from the European Commission for an EC Directive. In 1995 Sweden joined the European Union which had adopted the Data Protection Directive in the same year and a new committee was entrusted with making recommendations on the implementation of the directive and a new total revision of the Data Act. In 1997 it presented a report on the implementation containing a proposal for a new Personal Data Act. The law was then superseded on 24 October 1998 by the Personal Data Act (Sw. Personuppgiftslagen) that implemented the 1995 EU directive. The 1973 law mainly focused on automated computer processing systems containing assignable information of living persons and not data processing in general and was considered to be outdated in many respects for many years. The law The act required a prior permit from the DIB for each computerised personal data register. When a permit was given, the Board issued tailor-made conditions for that register. It did not contain many provisions on when and how the data should be processed, or general data protection principles. Those who were subject of data contents were guaranteed freedom of access to their records. Exporting data on Swedish citizens outside the country required a license as well which wasn't granted when it was discovered that this was done to evade the regulatory requirements of the law. In 1979 the Swedish government issued a report which also raised concerns over critical data exported to other countries potentially becoming a target of terrorist organizations. It also requires responsible persons to pay compensations when individuals suffer damage due to incorrect information about them. The law also criminalized data intrusion but only intended to penalize persons physically breaking into offices to change data and did not consider Internet-based hacking at the time. Earlier data protection laws In October 1970 a data protection law went into effect in the West German state of Hesse ‚àí the Hessisches Datenschutzgesetz.

A Catalogue of the Music of Alfred Hill was finished by Alfred Hill in 1954 or 1955.Keith Anderson. Booklet notes to Naxos 8.220345 Its first two movements were arranged from Hill's String Quartet No. 4 (1916), while the last one derives from the finale of his String Quartet No. 17 (1938; this whole quartet was later turned into the Short Symphony, 1958). The symphony is dedicated \\"to my esteemed friend Henry Kripps\\",Catalogue entry for the manuscript of the symphony a prominent Australian conductor. Its approximate duration is 20 minutes.  History  The manuscript score and parts of the symphony are preserved at the National Library of Australia. The score carries on the title page a Bertrand Russell quotation: and an epigram by William Morris:  Instrumentation  The symphony is scored for a full orchestra.  Structure  Quiet unusual in Hill's output, this symphony has only three movements (like the Short Symphony). :I. The Search (C minor) :II. The Heart of man (A-flat major) :III. Finale. The Solution (C minor)  Program  The original quartets had no program, but for the new symphony Hill wrote explanatory notes. They were transferred in a type written sheet attached to the score. The Search. The introductory Allegro represents the hazy country, the Kingdom of Happiness, shadowed by dreams. The first subject of the movement gropes in the dark for light that is always there, if unseen, with the second providing a glimpse of some impossible heaven. The coda suggests that the evening of life may bring joy. The second movement, The Heart of Man, presents the heart of man as an exquisitely tender thing, with a second subject standing for human aspirations towards the highest goal. The Finale, The Solution, suggests in its first subject that the great source of happiness is work, useful, creative and constructive. The second subject adds that work brings joy, followed by a chorale that proposes the idea that even the humblest form of work will make us thankful for the gift of life.  Analysis  The opening introduction to the first movement is remarkable for its dominant prolongation with a sense of tonal ambiguity (the so-called Tristan chord used in parallel motion). It contrasts with the clear tonality of the first subject. All this can be found already in the original 1916 quartet. At the end of the slow movement the composer added characteristic progressions of juxtaposed triads based on the relationship of the thirds. Such triads can also be found in the finales of the Symphony No. 6 and the Symphony No. 12. The addition of a magnificent brass apotheosis of the choral motive in the final movement forms extra 26 bars and shows the largest alternation from the original composition among all Hill's arranged symphonies for full orchestra.  Editions  The symphony remains unpublished.

After the war ended, it was converted into a tank division.  Formation  The corps began forming on 22 February 1943 at the Moscow Armored Training Center near Naro-Fominsk, and soon became part of the new 5th Guards Tank Army. The 29th included the 25th, 31st, and 32nd Tank Brigades, the 53rd Motor Rifle Brigade, the 271st Mortar Regiment, and other smaller units, and was commanded by Major General Fyodor Anikushkin. Its chief of staff was Colonel Yevgeny Fominykh. The corps' three tank brigades were battle-hardened, but the others were newly formed and had not yet seen combat. On 2 March, Colonel Ivan Kirichenko became the corps commander. By 12 March, the corps concentrated 30 kilometers southwest of Millerovo, where it was joined by combat support units and received reinforcements. On 19 March, the entire army was ordered by Stavka to concentrate near Ostrogozhsk by 24 March, in a march taking place during the spring rasputitsa. After reaching the Ostrogozhsk area, the corps began intensive combat training on 1 April in anticipation of upcoming operations. In early May, army commander Lieutenant General Pavel Rotmistrov reorganized the tank brigades in order to create a strong corps reserve to repel unexpected enemy tank attacks and develop the breakthrough, the 32nd Brigade was equipped with only T-34 medium tanks, consisting of two battalions with three companies each, a total of 65 tanks. The 32nd's T-70 light tanks were transferred to the 25th and 31st Brigades, which also had a two-battalion structure, with the first battalion equipped with T-34s and the second battalion with T-70s. The corps was completely formed by 10 May after it was joined by the 14th Guards Heavy Tank Regiment and the 108th Anti-tank Artillery Regiment.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000. History A number of sawmills were established in the White Lake area between 1836 and 1850. Lumber from these mills was rafted through the narrow natural channel between White Lake and Lake Michigan before being loaded on ships. This was a time-consuming process, and the local lumbermen lobbied for an improved waterway. In 1866, an improvement program was funded by Congress. After surveying the area, the construction of a new harbor and channel was proposed. Work on this project commenced in 1867, and by late 1868 the channel was cut and revetments on both sides were in place. Piers extending out into Lake Michigan were gradually extended over the next five years. However, by 1873 it was determined that the original pier design was too short, creating a shoaling hazard, and both piers were extended. In 1875 a lighthouse was constructed along the channel, and in 1887 a life saving station was added. In 1900-01 both piers were again extended, and in 1907 the entire channel and harbor dredged to a deeper depth. A few years later, shipping traffic through White Lake declined considerably, and the Army Corps of Engineers recommended the abandonment of the harbor. However, maintenance continued, with annual dredging, and, in 1936-37, the replacement of the superstructures of both piers with concrete. In 1946 the Life Saving Station was sold and subsequently moved, and in 1970 the lighthouse was sold and converted into a local museum. Description Lighthouse on south pier White Lake Harbor is an man-made channel running through strip of land which separates White Lake from Lake Michigan. The associated navigation structures include three elements: the south pier, the north pier, and the revetments. The north and south piers are parallel to each other, and are 200 feet apart, The north pier is 1717 feet long and the south pier is 1953 feet long. The piers are constructed from a series of piles near the shore, and additional cribs at the end. The entire pier has a concrete superstructure. The revetments were originally of timber pile. A double row of sheet piling was added later, and concrete replaced the timber superstructure.

Its main goals are to study Lebanon's ecosystem, encourage preservation, and maintain a scientific archive of Lebanon's wildlife and the Mediterranean marine life.  History  The Museum was first opened in Tyre in 2001 by Dr. Jamal Younes, who has been collecting and preserving specimens for more than 30 years.

They contain some of the earliest known cave paintings in the Horn of Africa. Laas Geel's rock art is estimated to date to somewhere between 9,000 and 3,000 years BC. =Dhagah Nabi Galay= Neolithic rock art at the Dhagah Nabi Galay . One of the sites associated with Laas Geel, Dhagah Nabi Galay is unique in that it features what is considered to be the first examples of writing in East Africa. There has been minimal research conducted on this site, but it offers a wonderful opportunity to study the Neolithic Horn of Africa anterior to the introduction of Islam. =Dhagah Kureh= Dhagah Kureh exhibits the most rock paintings depicting cows in Somaliland,. Dhagah Kureh translates to ‚Äúthe stone with the head‚Äù in the Somali language. The site is located in a beautiful and naturally green landscape with fertile farming lands nearby, and the rock shelters are made of stony outcrops with rocks resting on each other above an approximately 4 km- long granite range. The greatest number of rock art panels depicting large cows in Somaliland is found in Shelter 1 of Dhagah Kureh, making this site unique amongst the rock art sites of Somaliland. =Dhambalin= Snakes, sheep and goat polychrome with symbolic elements in Dhambalin. Dhambalin (\\"half, vertically cut mountain\\") is an archaeological site in the northwestern Togdheer province of Somaliland. The sandstone rock shelter, contains rock art depicting various animals, such as horned cattle and goats, as well as giraffes, an animal no longer found in Somaliland region. The site also features the earliest known pictures of sheep in Somaliland. Discovered in autumn 2007, residents of Beenyo Dhaadheer reported the rock art to the Somali archaeologist Sada Mire, Director of the Department of Archaeology within the Ministry of Tourism and Culture of Somaliland. =Shimuhshimuh or Haadh= A herd of cows and Giraffe in Haadh, Sanaag. Cave paintings have been found at Shimuhshimuh north of Erigavo. The painting were found by Jama Dabhaan and colleagues in 2010 but have been declared now after the photos taken were recovered.

Allerton Castle, Arundell's Yorkshire home Arundell was the second son of John Arundell, 2nd Baron Arundell of Trerice and his second wife Barbara, the widow of Sir Richard Mauleverer, 4th Baronet, of Allerton Mauleverer, Yorkshire. He succeeded his mother to Allerton Mauleverer in 1721. Arundell was a page to Queen Anne from 1707 to 1714. With the patronage of his friend the Earl of Burlington he was returned unopposed as Member of Parliament for Knaresborough at a by-election on 16 April 1720. He retained the seat unopposed until his death in 1758. In 1726 he was appointed Surveyor of the King's Works by Sir Robert Walpole, holding the post until 1737, when he accepted the more lucrative post of Master of the Mint (until 1744). He was also Surveyor of the King's Private Roads from 1731 to 1744. In 1744 Prime Minister Henry Pelham (Arundell's brother-in-law) appointed Arundell a Lord Commissioner of the Treasury, promoting him to be Treasurer of the Chamber in 1746, a position he held until 1755. He was also awarded in 1748 the sinecure of Clerk of the Pipe for life. In 1740 Arundell was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. Arundell died childless on 20 January 1758. He had married Lady Frances Manners, the daughter of John Manners, 2nd Duke of Rutland in August 1732.

In its current form, it models the motion of objects with non-zero mass as well as massless particles under the attraction of a time independent conservative force in some inertial frame. Unlike general relativity, RND is not restricted solely to a gravitational potential and does not require the exigency of curving spacetime. Created in 2015, the centennial year of Einstein's general relativity, by Israeli scientists Yaakov Friedman in collaboration with Joseph Steiner, RND predicts accurately both classical and modern tests of general relativity, such as, the perihelion precession of Mercury (planet) which agree with the known observed perihelion precession,C. W. Misner, K. S. Thorne and J. A. Wheeler, Gravitation (1973) Freeman and co.W. Rindler, Relativity, Special, General and Cosmological (2001) OxfordS. Kopeikin, M. Efroimsky and G. Kaplan, Relativistic Celestial Mechanics of the Solar System (2011) Wiley-VCH, Berlin the periastron advance of a binary star, which is identical to the post-Keplerian equation of the relativistic advance of the periastron in a binary, gravitational lensing which is identical to Einstein's formula for weak gravitational lensing√ñ.

Sigbj√∂rn, Einstein's General Theory of Relativity: With Modern Applications in Cosmology (2007) Springer using GR, and light travel (Shapiro delay) time delay which agree with the known formula for the Shapiro time delay, confirmed experimentally by several experiments. Suppose that an object or a particle moves under a conservative, time independent force with a negative potential U(\\\\mathbf{x}) any space point \\\\mathbf{x}, vanishing at infinity, in an (idealized) inertial frame K. In order to express the influence of this potential energy at this point, introduce a normalized vector \\\\mathbf{n}(\\\\mathbf{x}) = abla U(\\\\mathbf{x})/ abla U(\\\\mathbf{x}) in the direction of the gradient of U(\\\\mathbf{x}). Using an extension of the Equivalence principle, the influence due to U(\\\\mathbf{x}) on time intervals, space increments and velocities in the neighbourhood of \\\\mathbf{x} in RND are quantified via the relativistic length contraction and time dilation due to the escape velocity v_e(\\\\mathbf{x}) of the escape orbit originating at \\\\mathbf{x}. Specifically, the space increments in the direction of \\\\mathbf{n}(\\\\mathbf{x}) and the time intervals are altered by the Lorentz factor \\\\gamma_e (\\\\mathbf{x})= 1/\\\\sqrt{1 - v_e^2(\\\\mathbf{x})/c^2}=1/\\\\sqrt{1 - u(\\\\mathbf{x})} due to this influence, while space increments transverse to \\\\mathbf{n}(\\\\mathbf{x}) are not. This implies that the velocity components in the direction of \\\\mathbf{n}(\\\\mathbf{x}) are unaltered when transformed to K, but those transverse to \\\\mathbf{n}(\\\\mathbf{x}) should be multiplied by \\\\gamma_e^{-1}(\\\\mathbf{x}) resulting in an upper bound c_x=\\\\gamma_e^{-1}(\\\\mathbf{x})c in K, lower than the speed of light c. This change in the direction of the velocity causes in turn a change in the classical trajectories. For a central force this modification leads finally to the equations for the trajectory r(\\\\varphi) and time dependence t(\\\\varphi) in terms of integral of motion k and integral of motion J. For motion in the gravitational field a spherically symmetric massive object of mass M, the dimensionless gravitational potential is u(r)=\\\\frac{r_s}{r}, where r_s= \\\\frac{2GM}{c^2} is its Schwarzschild radius. In this case the above equations yield the correct formulae for all the above-mentioned tests of general relativity.

As an alternative to the medal one can choose a wristwatch or a crystal bowl/art glass. Originally awarded by the King in Council, it is since 1976 awarded by the Swedish Agency for Government Employers. History A medal with the inscription \\"Honorary reward for Zealous and Devoted Service of the Realm\\" (Hedersbel√∂ning f√∂r nit och redlighet i rikets tienst) was proposed in 1803 by the Generaltullarrendesocieteten as a reward for customs officials. It was approved by the King in Council on 20 May the same year, but the first known awarding took place in 1830. Then as a silver medal of the 8th size. On 1 July 1947 it was decided that the medal would only be awarded in gold of the 6th size. Previously it had been in four different sizes, three of gold and one of silver. By the 1973 order reform, the Riksdag decided that the medal would be the only award to be awarded for state service. Appearance The medal is made of 23 karat gold, weighs 11 grams and has a diameter of 27.5 millimeters (\\"6th size\\" according to the Berch's Scale). It is crowned by a royal crown and carries the image of the ruling monarch. The medal is worn on the left side of the chest in a 28 millimeter broad, blue ribbon with yellow edges. The band is straight for men, and bow knot for ladies. The medal is in its present appearance on the obverse provided with King Carl XVI Gustaf's portrait in profile made by Ernst Nordin. The reverse has the text \\"For Zealous and Devoted Service of the Realm\\", along with the name of the recipient and an oak leaf wreath.

They were intended (initially) as a security measure to avoid displaying the division's designation in the clear. They were used on vehicles, sign posts and notice boards and were increasingly, but not universally, worn on uniform as the War progressed. Discontinued by the regular army after 1918, only a few Territorial divisions continued to wear them before 1939. Reintroduced officially in late 1940 in the Second World War, divisional formation signs were much more prevalent on uniforms and were taken up by many other formations, independent brigades, corps, armies, overseas and home commands, military districts and lines of communication areas. The sign could be based on many things, geometry (simple or more complex), heraldry, regional or historical associations, a pun, the role of the division or a combination. First World War Until 1916, unit names were written on vehicles, notice boards and camp flags, when an order to end this insecure practice was given to adopt a 'device, mark or sign' particular to that division. Initially only a few divisions wore the division sign as a badge on clothing, including some which had been wearing one before the order. This practice became more widespread, especially in 1918 but not universal.Chappell pps. 3‚Äì6 The 43rd, 44th and 45th Divisions (all first line territorial) were sent to India to relieve the regular army there and did not adopt division insignia, as did numbers of second line territorial and home service divisions.Chappell pp. 23, 39 Battle Patches were distinct signs used at the battalion level as a means of identification on the battlefield, although some continued the scheme to include company and even platoon signs. Consisting of relatively simple shapes and colours they were introduced by Kitchener's Army troops in 1915 and could follow a divisional or brigade scheme or be based on the regimental colours or insignia. They were worn on the sleeves, the back of the tunic or painted on the helmet.

Other marks were used for brigade and division headquarters, machine gun and mortar units. The 5th Canadian division was broken up for reinforcements before being fully formed and would have had a burgundy‚Äìpurple colour patch.

In May 1940 an order (Army Council Instruction (ACI) 419) was issued banning division signs worn on uniforms, even though some were in use on vehicles in France.Davis p. 92 Some infantry battalions in France had even started wearing battle patches in a similar manner to their First World War antecedents.Davis p. 101 In September 1940 ACI 419 was replaced with ACI 1118, and division signs were permitted to be worn on uniform below the shoulder title. Below this was worn an 'arm of service' stripe ( by ) showing the relevant corps colour (for example Artillery, red and blue, Service Corps, yellow and blue, RAMC dark cherry, and so on, see right). Battalion specific or general regimental patches, in addition to the shoulder title, could also be worn below the arm of service stripe, but the cost of these had to be borne from regimental funds, not the War Office.Davis pps. 94, 97 Until D-Day these signs were only to be displayed or worn in Britain, if a division went overseas all formation markings had to be removed from vehicles (tactical signs excepted) and uniforms. This order was obeyed to varying degrees in various theatres of war. However, 21st Army Group formations wore their signs when they went to France.Cole p. 9 The signs shown below were used as vehicle signs and worn on uniform (except where noted). The short-lived 7th Infantry Division did not have a formation sign and that for the 66th Division was designed but never used. Those for the 12th and 23rd divisions were worn by a small number of troops left behind in Britain. In the British Army, ACI 1118 specified that the design for the formation sign should be approved by the general officer commanding the formation and reported to the War Office.Davis pps. 95, 97 A further order of December 1941 (ACI 2587) specified the material of the uniform patch as printed cotton (ordnance issue), this replaced the embroidered felt (or fulled wool) or metal badges used previously. In other theatres the uniform patch could be made from a variety of materials including printed or woven cotton, woven silk, leather or metal embroidered felt (or fulled wool).Davis pp. 99‚Äì100 =Infantry= File:1st Infantry Division sign WW2.svg1st Infantry Division First patternCole p. 36 File:British 1st Division 3 type.svg1st Infantry Division Second pattern File:British 2nd Infantry Division.svg2nd Infantry Division File:British 3rd Infantry Division Vehicle Sign.svg3rd Infantry Division Vehicle Sign in France 1940.Chappell (2) p. 17 File:British 3rd Infantry Division2.svg3rd Infantry Division.

The early provenance of this painting is unknown but it can be dated based on other works by Van Verendael, such as his garland painting in the Prado which was long attributed to Jan Brueghel the Elder, who began floral painting in Antwerp a half-century beforehand. Description and interpretation This painting dates to the period in Antwerp when hothouses became popular among the nobility and patrons ordered paintings to record their personal hothouse triumphs. Not all of the blooms would have bloomed at the same time, and the painting was meant more for decoration than for botanical accuracy. The work shows the following flower species: Rosa alba, Tropaeolum majus, Hepatica nobilis, rosemary, Tulipa, Delphinium, Aquilegia, Punica granatum, Rosa √ó centifolia.Painting record in the RKD Later history and influence This painting was stored for safe- keeping during WWII in the Albrechtsburg in Meissen, from whence it was found and taken by marauding Soviet troops in 1945.

Description  It is a short-lived herbaceous plant with ascending hispid stems. The entire leaves are alternate, linear-lanceolate. It flowers from January to April, the small flowers are dark blue to violet producing hemispherical nutlets.  Taxonomy  The species name Hormuzakia derives from Constantin Freiherr von Hormuzaki a prominent Austro-Romanian naturalist. Anchusa derives from the , a plant used as a rouge. The epithet aggregata, derives from Latin and means to bring together or cluster. * The standard author abbreviation Lehm. is used to indicate Johann Georg Christian Lehmann (1792 ‚Äì 1860), a German botanist. * The standard author abbreviation Gusul. is used to indicate Mikail Gusuleac (1887-1960), a Romanian botanist.

Biography A native of Boston, Massachusetts, Warfield has served on the faculty of Harvard Medical School since 1978. She was appointed Edward Lowenstein Professor in Anaesthesia in 2000. At the time of her appointment, she was one of only 13 women holding endowed professorships at Harvard Medical School. Dr. Warfield served as director of the Pain Management Center at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (renamed the Arnold-Warfield Pain Management Center in 2013) and its predecessor Beth Israel Hospital from 1980 until 2007 and as Chief of Anesthesia for the hospital from 2000 onwards. Publications Warfield has authored two textbooks on pain management, Principles and Practice of Pain Medicine, and the Manual of Pain Management as well as over 100 academic publications. Lawsuit In 2008, Warfield filed a lawsuit against Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, former Beth Israel CEO Paul F. Levy, Harvard Medical Faculty Physicians, and Josef E. Fischer alleging gender-based discrimination, retaliation, and defamation in connection with Beth Israel's decision to terminate Warfield's appointment in 2007. Warfield alleged that during the preceding several years, Fischer engaged in a relentless pattern of gender-based discriminatory treatment of her, and that she repeatedly complained to Levy about Fischer's treatment, but that no or insufficient action was taken. The parties settled out of court in February 2013. While the defendants admitted no wrongdoing, under the terms of the settlement Beth Israel Deaconess paid Warfield $7 million, named the hospital‚Äôs pain clinic in her honor, and agreed to sponsor an annual lecture series on women‚Äôs health and the academic contributions of women in surgery. The case and its settlement attracted considerable local media attention due to the large settlement amount and the fact that the settlement was made public.

Hyginus, Poeticon Astronomicon. \\"U.S. Naval Observatory Library\\" Cassiopeia (ŒöŒ±œÉœÉŒπœåœÄŒµŒπŒ±) or Cassiepeia (ŒöŒ±œÉœÉŒπŒ≠œÄŒµŒπŒ±), a figure in Greek mythology, was queen of Aethiopia and wife of king Cepheus. She was arrogant and vain, characteristics that led to her downfall. Her name in Greek is , Kassiope; other variants are , Kassiopeia and , Kassiepeia.  Family  Some sources describe Cassiopeia as the daughter of Coronus and Zeuxo but Nonnus calls her a nymph.Nonnus, Dionysiaca 43.117 ff. While according to Stephanus, she was called Iope, the daughter of Aeolus, from whom the town of Joppa (now the Jaffa neighborhood in Tel Aviv) derived its name.Stephanus of Byzantium, Ethnica s.v. ·º∏œåœÄŒ∑  Mythology  The king of Ethiopia Cepheus and the queen Cassiopeia thank Perseus for freeing their daughter Andromeda, La D√©livrance d'Androm√®de (1679) Pierre Mignard, LouvreCassiopeia boasted that she and her daughter Andromeda were more beautiful than all the Nereids, the nymph- daughters of the sea god Nereus. This brought the wrath of Poseidon, ruling god of the sea, upon the kingdom of Ethiopia.Pseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 2.4.3Hyginus, Fabulae 64 Accounts differ as to whether Poseidon decided to flood the whole country or direct the sea monster Cetus to destroy it. In either case, trying to save their kingdom, Cepheus and Cassiopeia consulted a wise oracle, who told them that the only way to appease the sea gods was to sacrifice their daughter. Accordingly, Andromeda was chained to a rock at the sea's edge and left to be killed by the sea monster. Perseus arrives to kill Cetus, saves Andromeda and marries her. Poseidon thought Cassiopeia should not escape punishment, so he placed her in the heavens chained to a throne in a position that referenced Andromeda's ordeal. The constellation resembles the chair that originally represented an instrument of torture. Cassiopeia is not always represented tied to the chair in torment, in some later drawings she holds a mirror, symbol of her vanity, while in others she holds a palm frond.Hyginus, Astronomica 2.10.Aratus, Phaenomena 187 Constellation The constellation Cassiopeia, near to the pole star, can be seen from latitudes north of 35¬∞N during the whole year. The constellation is also visible in countries north of the Tropic of Capricorn, in late spring.  Notes   References  * Aratus Solensis, Phaenomena translated by G. R. Mair.

Those two prior organizations were: * Wichita Commission on Civil Rights (WCCR)\\"Bush v. City of Wichita\\", Ravel Law, retrieved May 10, 2017 (often incorrectly referred to as the \\"Wichita Civil Rights Commission\\") (an agency formed in 1972, charged with enforcing Wichita's Civil Rights Ordinance, which forbade various forms of discrimination in government and public accommodations);Associated Press (AP), \\"Wichita Civil Rights Group Slaps Club,\\", September 15, 1974, Leavenworth Times, p.15, Leavenworth, Kansas retrieved May 10, 2017 and * The Wichita Equal Employment Opportunity / Affirmative Action Board (EEO/AA Board) (an agency oversight board, formed in 1974, charged with enforcing the City's EEO and Affirmative Action performance requirements for recipients of City money and aid, such as vendors, employment agencies and recipients of subsidies and concessions.) The staff of the new agency, initially referred to as the \\"Civil Rights and Equal Opportunity Office,\\" were partially funded through federal CETA funds, and drawn from the City's Human Rights Division‚Äîan office that had previously provided staff support to the WCCR and had worked on police-community relations (PCR) issues. The rest of the Human Rights Division was reassigned to serve the City Manager, directly, on PCR issues. Functions The official goals of CREEOC were to \\"eliminate and prevent discrimination, segregation and separation in all places of public accommodations, housing and employment because of race, religion, color, sex, physical handicap, national origin or ancestry, and marital status as authorized by the City Code.\\" To attain that goal, the CREEOC performed two complementary functions: * The Civil Rights function involved the intake, investigation and analysis of discrimination complaints‚Äîas well as conferences, conciliations, or public hearings upon findings of probable cause. * The EEO function involved reviewing and monitoring the businesses and organizations having contracts or agreements with the City of Wichita, to determine if their employment practices were non- discriminatory, and were applied equally to all applicants and employees. The responsibility of this organization was to carry out the city's adopted policies directed at civil rights and equal employment opportunity. This office assisted in the drafting and filing of civil rights complaints related to employment, housing and public accommodations. The responsibility of the program in 1979 included the review of all Equal Employment Opportunity (\\"EEO\\")programs submitted by vendors of the City, or by agencies in contract with the City. In addition to the review of EEO programs submitted to the city by its contractors and vendors, this office was responsible for monitoring those adopted EEO programs to determine and track their compliance with City requirements. By 1983, CREEOC had also been assigned responsibility for providing staff support to two other city advisory boards: The Commission on the Status of Women and the Commission on the Status of Handicapped People, and part of the Executive Director's salary was accordingly paid from federal funds for that purpose. Organization and Authority A 10-member volunteer Commission (multi-racial and dual-gender) oversaw the CREEOC office and its staff, which included a paid Executive Director (originally Jesse Rice,\\"Wichita bishop vows to ignore gay law,\\" October 16, 1977, Louisville Courier-Journal, Louisville, Kentucky, page 124, retrieved May 10, 2017United Press International (UPI), \\"Wichita civil rights director sues the city,\\" October 25, 1978, Salina Journal, Salina, Kansas, page 5, retrieved May 10, 2017 later Annie Montgomery Associated Press (AP), \\"SCHOOL MASCOT: Fight over 'Redskins' moves past principal; American Indians ask Wichita's civil rights board to investigate,\\" December 10, 1996, Salina Journal, Salina, Kansas, page 10, retrieved May 10, 2017Stumpe, Joe, \\"Beautillion program marking 40 years of uplifting young black men,\\" March 26, 2015.

The CREEOC commissioners were assigned to review civil rights complaint cases, following investigation by staff, and‚Äîon rotating assignments‚Äîhad individual authority to rule on probable cause in civil rights cases, with authority to refer such cases to the City Attorney (or District Attorney in the case of offenses by the City government) for prosecution. The city of Wichita was the first city in Kansas to adopt the Kansas Act Against Discrimination by reference (incorporate it into local law). This act provided enforcement authority for the local civil rights commission in the areas of employment, public accommodations, and housing. CREEOC‚Äîaccording to a July, 1980 review by the Kansas Advisory Committee to the United States Commission on Civil Rights‚Äîhad \\"identical investigative and remedial authority to that of the State commission [(KCCR)]. Controversy Though developed to address community civil rights and minority issues -- during a period of execeptional racial tensions and community conflict -- CREEOC was largely preoccupied with its own internal battles, and battles with other offices of city government, and played an unexpectedly minor role in the community issues it was designed to address.Brown, judge, Rice v.

The trial became complicated by interconnection with a police lieutenant, fired from the Wichita Police Department, who was also pursuing a wrongful-termination suit against the city (later won in Federal District CourtTheis, District Judge, \\"Sheldon WULF, Plaintiff, v.

On February 9, 1979, CREEOC Director Rice was fired by City Manager Denton, for \\"flagrant insubordination\\" by allegedly walking out of the Feb. 7th CREEOC board meeting, taking a tape recorder and tapes owned by the City, and dismissing the secretary who was taking the minutes of the meeting.

The company specialises in the sale of new and genuine automotive parts from manufacturers and wholesalers. The company is headquartered in Paris and Gennevilliers and operates in France, Spain, Belgium and the US. History In the early 2000s, following the completion of his studies at Sciences Po and a first experience as the director of a SMB, Pierre-No√´l Luiggi endeavoured to create Oscaro.com as an answer to a common problem: he found it impossible to find a replacement rear-view mirror for his car. Faced with the unreasonably high cost of spare parts as well as lengthy lead times, he and V√©ronique Campbell came up with the idea for an online service offering spare parts at a discounted rate. Oscaro.com was launched in March 2003 following three years of negotiations with the Economic Interest Grouping in order to obtain access to their catalogue of products as well as technical data. In 2005, the company achieved a significant milestone: its first million euros in sales revenue. The following year, Oscaro Recambios launched in Spain. In October 2011, Pierre- No√´l Luiggi, founder of Oscaro, was appointed member of the French delegation represented at G20 YES (Young Entrepreneur Summit). In 2012, Oscaro.com was reported to have 1.46 million unique monthly users according to M√©diam√©trie, making it the first in its category of French specialised websites. In October 2015, Oscaro became a shareholder of Temot International, an international buying group specialised in automotive customer service. In April 2016, Oscaro expanded its services to Belgium, serving primarily its Francophone community. After opening a research centre in California in 2012, Oscaro launched its website on the US market under the name Oscaroparts.com. Activity Oscaro.com specialises in the sale of new and genuine automotive parts from manufacturers and wholesalers. The name OSCARO is a portmanteau of CAR bookended by the letter O, representing two wheels. With the creation of Oscaro.com, its founder had high ambitions to make the website \\"the Google of spare auto parts\\", giving its users access to any spare part they desired. Since 2008, Oscaro has been affiliated with the Quality Charter of the Federation of E-commerce and Distance Sales. In June 2016, Oscaro‚Äôs online catalog presented 700,000 spare part referrals to its clients from a pool of 150 suppliers. Over 8,000 packages are shipped daily. As of 2017, Oscaro is a major player in France, Spain, Belgium and the US. =Infrastructure= Since its creation, the company‚Äôs administrative centres and warehouses have been based in Gennevilliers. It also serves as a hub for nearly 200 technicians, the purpose of which is to give information to its clients. Since 2016, Oscaro has expanded to a second warehouse (22,000 m2 in size) in Cergy-Pontoise. =Sporting sponsorships= Luiggi, founder of Oscaro and a Bastia native, has committed to Oscaro‚Äôs investment in the region‚Äôs sports clubs and associations.

The conservation park occupies land in Part Section 138 of the cadastral unit of the Hundred of MacDonnell. The land contains the cottage occupied by the poet, Adam Lindsay Gordon from 1864 to 1866. It was purchased by the Government of South Australia in 1922 at ‚Äúthe request of the Dingley Dell Restoration Committee.‚Äù The land originally gained protected status as a national pleasure resort proclaimed under the National Pleasure Resorts Act 1914 and which was managed by the South Australian Tourist Bureau. On 27 April 1972, it was renamed as the Dingley Dell Conservation Park upon the proclamation of the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972 which repealed the former act along with other statutes concerned with conservation. The conservation park was described in 1994 as follows: #Built development on the property consists of the restored cottage which serves as a museum for ‚Äúa collection of Gordon memorabilia,‚Äú and a ‚Äúcaretaker residence, workshop, public toilet facilities and picnic facilities.‚Äù #An ‚Äúopen woodland of South Australian blue gum‚Äù is located on the property along with ‚Äúisolated‚Äù stands of the following species - blackwood, golden wattle, coastal bearded- heath and native box. #its boundaries are fenced and are adjoined to the north and west by grazing land and by roads to its south and east. In 1980, the conservation park was listed on the former Register of the National Estate. Gordon's former home which was listed on the South Australian Heritage Register on 24 July 1980 under the name of the Dingley Dell Museum is managed by a commercial operator. As of 1994, visitation was ‚Äúlow‚Äù with ‚Äúthe majority of visitors viewing the cottage, and a lesser proportion using the walking track behind the cottage.‚Äù As of 2014, the conservation park had not been given an IUCN protected area category.
