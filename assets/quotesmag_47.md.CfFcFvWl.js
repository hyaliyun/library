It is one of the earliest established and next nature reserves. The beginnings of landscape protection of today's reserve date back to the 19th century. The forested slope of the Vistula Valley was called the Maria Park (German Marienpark), from the name of Marta Matilda Maria Alvensleben-Schönborn (1854-1915) - heir to the estate of Ostromecko and the wife of Albrecht von Alvensleben (1840-1928). A road was made on its area with bridges, along which birchwood benches were set. The reserve was created to protect diverse forest complexes overgrowing steep canyons and the Vistula valley steam: from the ash-alder forest through the subcontinental forest, fertile low beech forest to mixed continental forest. This area also has high landscape values, due to the large denivelation of the terrain, spring and groundwater exudates.

Angeli's salt and the Angeli–Rimini reaction are named after him.  Scientific career  Angeli studied in Padua, where he met the chemist Giacomo Luigi Ciamician. When Ciamician moved to a new appointment in Bologna, he chose Angeli to work as his assistant, even before Angeli had graduated. In 1891, Angeli was awarded his doctorate in chemistry at Bologna. In 1893, he became a lecturer in Bologna, and in 1895 he became a professor. In 1894, he worked briefly in Munich with Adolf von Baeyer, learning medicinal chemistry. In 1897, he moved to the University of Palermo where he became Professor of Pharmaceutical Chemistry. In 1913, Angeli became director of the Pharmacy School in Florence. In 1915, he became Professor of Organic Chemistry at the University of Florence (Istituto di Studi Superiori), a position that was created specifically for him. Angeli focused on nitrogen compounds. He investigated the structure of hydrazoic acid, synthesised nitrohydroxylamine (1894), and discovered the nitroxyl radical. The Angeli-Rimini reaction (1896) for the detection of aldehydes was named after him and his student Enrico Rimini. He discovered sodium trioxodinitrate, which is known as Angeli's salt.

Mission  The Energy Future Coalition is an ambitious, visionary effort by business, labor, and environmental groups to bridge their differences and identify broadly supported energy policy options that address three great challenges related to the production and use of energy: *The political and economic threat posed by the world's dependence on oil. *The risk to the global environment from climate change. *The lack of access of the world's poor to the modern energy services they need for economic advancement. The Coalition seeks to connect those challenges with a vision of the vibrant economic opportunities that will be created by a transition to a new energy economy.

Wirth, President, United Nations Foundation; former U.S. Senator from Colorado; Under Secretary of State for Global Affairs under President Bill Clinton  History  In late 2001, with the support of the Turner Foundation and Better World Fund, the Energy Future Coalition held exploratory meetings to discuss the inadequacies in U.S. energy policy. These meetings were focused on addressing our dependence on foreign oil and the associated risk to our economy and national security, the neglected threat of climate change, and the need to bring electricity and modern fuels to the two billion people who lack them. A consensus emerged on the need for change, and on the opportunity to present a new vision that linked security, environment, and economics for a more sustainable future. Over the next six months, more than 150 individuals from business, labor, government, academia, and the NGO community came together to create a compelling new vision of what the energy economy could become, and to identify policy changes that would spark a revolution in energy technology. The Coalition focused on practical political coalition building, aimed at breaking the gridlock along partisan lines that had previously prevented substantive advances in energy policy. The Coalition created six Working Groups of diverse participants that participated in a nine-month effort to identify a new path forward. These working groups presented recommendations in the areas of transportation, bioenergy and agriculture, the future of coal, end-use efficiency, the smart grid, and innovative financing for international energy development. The original recommendations formulated by the working groups can be found in the 2003 report, Challenges and Opportunities: Charting America's Energy Future. Elements of the Coalition's recommendations were included in the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPAct 2005). Building on the Coalition's Bioenergy and Agriculture Working Group, a group of agriculture and forestry leaders developed the 25x'25 vision, which states that America should produce 25% of its energy from renewable resources by 2025. In the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 Congress endorsed 25x'25 as a goal for the nation. In 2007, the Coalition began working at the state level on the cheapest and fastest way to meet our energy needs—energy efficiency. In 2008, the Coalition launched exploratory meetings into what would become the Rebuilding America initiative. In 2010, Rebuilding America developed federal legislation to incentivize commercial building energy efficiency upgrades via federal rebates. The legislation became known as Building STAR, and while it ultimately failed to pass, it laid the foundation for Rebuilding America's continuing work in the commercial building energy efficiency sector at the federal, state, and local levels. Americans for a Clean Energy Grid was launched in 2010 as an outgrowth of the Coalition’s work on the smart grid. This initiative brings together a diverse group of stakeholders to support policies that scale up a cleaner electricity system by unlocking domestic renewable energy resources currently stranded in our country’s remote areas and deploying smart technologies to make the transmission and distribution grid more reliable, resilient, and secure, accommodate renewable power, and enable more energy efficiency by consumers and businesses.

Microphone design helps maintain natural and directional localisation cues through microphone placement in the concha cymba area of the pinna. Because Behind-the-Ear (BTE) and some traditional custom hearing aids have inefficient microphone placement, distortion can occur if sound collection from the pinna is not utilised. Taking advantage of the pinna effect helps to preserve natural localisation and directional cues.

It lies south-west of Nowa Wieś Wielka and south of Bydgoszcz. Dziemionna is located to the south-east of Nowa Wieś Wielka on the eastern edge of the former wetlands called Dziemionna (German: Dzimiona Bruch). From the east to the village adjoins a strip of forest, through which runs the national road No. 25 Bydgoszcz-Inowrocław and the railway line No. 131. The village is adjacent to the east with Nowa Wia Wielka and Tarkow Dolny. The village lies within a large valley depression drained in the west by the Noteć River (Odra basin) and the Green Struga River in the east (the Vistula basin). In the south, on the moraine Wysoczyzna Kujawska (erected about 10 m higher), the village of Krążkowo is adjacent. Physically and geographically, it lies within the Toruń-Eberswald Pradolina in the mesoregion of the Toruń Basin. There are two closed evangelical cemeteries in the village. The history of settlement of the Dziemionna village dates back to the 19th century and is associated with the German settlement characteristic for this area. The village was not marked on the topographical map of Friedrich von Schrötter (1798-1802), which documents the state at the time of the passage of the area under the tutelage of the Kingdom of Prussia. In the second half of the nineteenth century, the village was called Minutsdorf. In January 1920, under the Treaty of Versailles, the town was within the borders of the reborn Poland. She received the Polish name Dziemionna, which referred to the naming of the neighboring wetland from Old Polish times. The village was still located (until 1954) in the district of Inowrocław. In 1934, as a result of administrative reform, it was included in the Złotniki Kujawskie rural commune. In the village there was a four-elementary elementary school with a German language of instruction. After the war, the murdered Poles from the villages of Dziemionna, Jakubowo, Januszkowo, Krążkowo, Prądocin and Tarkowo were buried after the exhumation at the cemetery in Lisewo Kościelny, where in 1965 a monument was erected for them. In the years 1945–1954, Dziemionna was a village cluster, part of the Złotniki Kujawskie commune. In 1948, it had an area of 186 ha and population of 278 people. In 1947, in discussions about the new administrative division, the representatives of the villages were in favor of leaving them within the territorial boundaries of the Złotniki Kujawskie commune, which was motivated by economic ties and property-related treatment of residents by the municipal authorities. The Commune National Council in Złotniki Kujawskie, however, passed a resolution to depart Dziemionna for the newly created municipality Nowa Wieś Wielka, as well as several other villages. After the administrative reform of September 25, 1954, the village was included as one of 16 village councils in the Novaya Wielka community. In 1946, there was a one-grade public school in the village with a service flat for the teacher. Until 1961, it was a full school, implementing a program of seven classes, after which the institution was liquidated, and children from the village were sent to the school circuit in Nowa Wieś Wielka. On February 13, 1974, by virtue of the resolution of the Commune National Council, Dziemionna was temporarily liquidated and the Nowa Wieś Wielka village was incorporated into the village. The previous state was restored on December 9, 1987, reactivating Dziemionna. In the years 1958-1961 the village was electrified. In 1964, as part of a social act, the road to Nowa Wieś Wielka was hardened, and in 1966 street lighting was introduced. In 1978, the construction of the water supply system was started, and a year later the road Dziemionna - Nowa Wieś Wielka was covered with asphalt. In 1993, a municipal sewage treatment plant in Dziemionno was commissioned, and in 2001-2002 the village was sewered.

The ab. myricae Guen., occurring in the Scotch and Irish mountains, is still darker, with narrower, more pointed forewings, but not smaller as Staudinger states. The ab. euphrasiae Brahm, which appears to be the commoner form in France and south-western Europe, is paler than the type and more luteous; Lastly, the ab. esulae. Hbn. is a quite, small form, with the markings obscured.Seitz, A.

It lies south-east of Nowa Wieś Wielka, south-east of Bydgoszcz, and west of Toruń. In the pre-partition period, Tarkowo was a noble village. The village was mentioned in the advisory register from the area of Kujawy from 1489. In the 16th century Tarkowo belonged to the Roman Catholic parish in Pęchów. The village was owned by the szlachta Sośnickich, and from 1764, the property belonged to Kraszewscy. In 1583, the village had six fields of arable land. In the 18th century as part of the Olęder colonization supported, among others by starosts and mayors of Bydgoszcz on the outskirts of the Bydgoszcz Forest - the village of Tarkowskie Olędry appeared. This initiated the division of the village into the upper part - a noble located on the moraine and lower plateau - an Olęder located in the valley with peat soil and extensive meadows. In Tarków Gorne, Catholics definitely prevailed, in Lower - Evangelicals. The census of the Bydgoszcz region from 1833 states that in the village of Tarkowskie Holendry (German: Tarkower Haulander), 115 people (all Evangelicals) lived in 18 houses. The village belonged to the Evangelical parish in Łabiszyn. Another census from 1860 states that there were 152 people in Tarkow Olędrach (129 evangelicals, 23 Catholics) in 17 houses. The nearest elementary school was in Nowa Wioska (Evangelical) and Lisewo (Catholic). The geographical dictionary of the Kingdom of Poland for 1884 states that Tarkowskie Olędry (German: Tarkowo Hauland, then Kol. Tannhofen) was a village located in the district of Inowrocław. 206 people lived here (190 Protestants, 16 Catholics) in 23 houses. The village had an area of 224 ha, of which 112 ha is cultivated land and 99 ha of meadows. The nearest post office and railway was in Nowa Wieś Wielka. The village belonged to the Catholic parish in Pęchów and the Evangelical parish in Nowa Wieś Wielka. During the Great Poland Uprising (1919), Polish insurgent troops were stationed in Tarków Dolny, Krążków, Pałczyna and Dąbrówka Kujawska. Attempts to approach Bydgoszcz were unsuccessful, despite temporary successes, including mastering of Nowa Wieś Wielka and Brzoza. In January 1920, under the Treaty of Versailles, the town was within the borders of the reborn Poland. The village was still in the district of Inowrocław. In 1934, as a result of administrative reform, it was included in the Złotniki Kujawskie rural commune. There was a four-grade elementary school with a German language of instruction in the village. In 1937, the school in Złotniki Kujawskie became a collective school, and a dozen or so students from Tarków began to attend this school from the fourth grade. After the war, the murdered Poles from the villages of Dziemionna, Jakubowo, Januszkowo, Krążkowo, Prądocin and Tarkowo were buried after the exhumation at the cemetery in Lisewo Kościelny, where in 1965 a monument was erected for them. In the years 1945-1954, Tarkowo (including Górne and Dolne) was a rural cluster. being part of the Złotniki Kujawskie commune. In 1947, in discussions about the new administrative division, the village's representatives were in favor of leaving them within the territorial boundaries of the Złotniki Kujawskie commune, which was motivated by economic and transport connections. After the administrative reform of September 25, 1954, the town was divided into two parts between the district of Bydgoszcz and Inowrocław. Attached to the cluster Nowawieś The Great part of Tarków appears from 1954 under the name Tarkowo Dolne. On May 13, 1955, the Presidium of the District National Council in Nowa Wieś Wielka asked the Presidium of the Poviat National Council in Bydgoszcz for the final delimitation of the boundaries between the villages of Tarkowo Dolne and Tarkowo Górne [4]. In 1946, there was a one-grade public school in the village. Until 1961, it was a full school, implementing a program of 7 classes, after which the institution was liquidated, and children from the village were sent to the school circuit in Nowa Wieś Wielka. In 1955, a common room was opened in Tarków Dolny, and from 1964, members of the Union of Rural Youth ran a library point in the village. In the years 1958-1961 the village was electrified. In 1964 a bus line Tarkowo Dolne - Brzoza (24 km) was opened. A year later a club café was opened in the village. In 2001-2002, the water supply system was supplied to Tarków Dolny.

It was first described by Carl Linnaeus in his 1758 10th edition of Systema Naturae. It is found in the Palearctic region. A. rumicis lives and feeds on plants located in wide-open areas. At its larval stage, as a caterpillar, it causes such a large impact as a crop pest that it has received much attention and research. A. rumicis feeds on maize, strawberries and other herbaceous plants. The moth's evolution has been affected by the industrial melanism that occurred in Europe during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, causing a dramatic increase in two aberrations (salicin and lugubris), which have darker grey wings. Today, A. rumicis is important to conservation efforts in the United Kingdom, because, like many other species, it is in decline. However, as it is part of a UK Priority Biodiversity Action Plan and receiving greater awareness and conservation, the species may become more abundant. Description and identification A. rumicis has a wingspan of 34–44 mm. The forewings are blotched with a mixture of dark and light-grey shades, while the hindwings are dark brown.Alford, D. V., 2014. Pests of Fruit Crops: A Colour Handbook. p.356. A white spot is seen midway down the trailing edge of the forewing providing a distinct marker for A. rumicis not seen in other Acronicta moths. Chinese and Japanese moths tend to be larger than their European counterparts. The Asian moths also have lower forewings that have darker shades of grey. Technical description and variation C. rumicis L. (3i). Forewing dark grey, varied in places with whitish; lines and shades black; outer line marked by a white spot on the submedian fold ; hindwings brownish fuscous Larva marbled dark and light grey: a dorsal row of red spots on black blotches, and a row of white spots on each side; a pale line below spiracles, containing orange-red tubercles; segments 5 and 12 of dorsum humped; tubercles with fascicles of fuscous and fulvous hairs— turanica Stgr., a form from Central Asia, is much paler, with the hindwings whitish. — Chinese and Japanese examples (3k) are larger than European and in all cases darker; in particular the lower half of forewing is blacker and the white spot of outer line then often obscured ; possibly the scotch form figured by Curtis as salicis, a melanic form, may represent this aberration , though the larva figured as belonging thereto is unquestionably that of menyanthidis. — ab. alnoides Geest (3k) has the costal half of forewing grey, the inner half blackish, somewhat interrupted with a strong black dagger-shaped mark at base and above anal angle ; superficially resembles a dark grey alni ; recorded from Freiburg in Baden. — ab. euphorbiae Steph. nec. Hbn. is grey brown, with the stigmata and space between them pale; and ab. euphrasiae Steph. nec Dup. is pale yellowish grey with numerous black lines and the orbicular stigma faint or obsolete, occurring in Cornwall.Warren. W. in Seitz, A. Ed., 1914 Die Großschmetterlinge der Erde, Verlag Alfred Kernen, Stuttgart Band 3: Abt. 1, Die Großschmetterlinge des palaearktischen Faunengebietes, Die palaearktischen eulenartigen Nachtfalter, 1914  Taxonomy and phylogenetics  A. rumicis is a moth of the genus Acronicta and family Noctuidae. Noctuidae has upwards of 21,000 species. Noctuids are commonly known as \\"owlet moths\\" because of their large eyes that shine in the dark and the colour of their wings which make them difficult to see.Singh, H., 2014. Taxonomic Studies on Family Noctuidae (Lepidoptera) from North-East India. In their usual resting position, noctuids fold their wings back over their bodies; the forewings overlap one another. The closed wings form a tent-like shape.Waring, Paul, et al. Field Guide to the Moths of Great Britain and Ireland. British Wildlife, 2009. Almost all Acronicta larvae are brightly coloured with spiky brown hairs all along the dorsal side of the body.Chapman, T.A., 1890. The Genus Acronycta and its Allies. The Entomologist's Record and Journal of Variation, 1(April), pp.1–4, 26–28. According to Thomas Algernon Chapman, the genus Acronicta can be split into three major groups: The first, characterized by a hoop-like structure of the pupa and clumped oviposition, includes: A. auricoma, A. myricae, A. menthanthidis, A. venosa, and A. rumicis. The second, characterized by terminal spines of pupa and dome-shaped ova laid apart from others, includes: A. psi, A. tridens, A. strigosa, A. alni, A. megacephala, A. leporina, A. aceris. The third group has only one species, A. ligustri. Palearctic region  Distribution and habitat  A. rumicis is distributed throughout the Palearctic. It is common in northwestern China, the Korean Peninsula, and Japan, although it has also been found in other parts of Eurasia, including Russia.Anon, 1901. Transactions of the Entomological Society of London. A. rumicis is found in almost all parts of Europe, though it is absent in some areas of north-western Scandinavia. There has been much research about the species in England and Scotland. These moths tend to spend their lives in plants located in wide-open areas like meadows, woodland clearings, gardens, and hedgerows, generally in non-humid areas.Winiarska, G., 1990. Communities of noctuids (Lepidoptera, Noctuidae) of linden-oak-hornbeam forests of the Mazovian Lowland. Fragmenta Faunistica, 15(11), pp.143–163.  Food resources  Rumex obtusifolius, or broad-leaved dock = Caterpillars = At the caterpillar stage, A. rumicis tends to feed on low-growing, herbaceous plants, including sorrel, dock, bramble, thistles, hop,Skinner, B., 2009. Colour Identification Guide to Moths of the British Isles: (Macrolepidoptera). p.149. and occasionally on the leaves of shrubs. In addition, A. rumicis larvae favour fruit trees like Prunus species and plants of the family Polygonaceae.Cho, Y., Kwon, O. & Nam, S.-H., 2006. Ecological and morphological characteristics of the endoparasitoids of larval Acronicta rumicis (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae). Entomological Research, 36, pp. 208–215. In research, one of the most commonly used host plants is Rumex obtusifolius, a herbaceous plant commonly found within A. rumicis range.  Parental care  = Oviposition = Drawing of A. rumicis egg shape Females tend to lay eggs on leaves of host plants in large clusters. These clusters are arranged in long longitudinal ridges, which originate and spread out on the leaf from the micropylar (ovular) area of the plant. The longest ridges tend to be in a zigzag formation.Dolinskaya, I. V., 2014. Egg Morphology of some Noctuidae (Lepidoptera). Vestnik Zoologii, 48(4), pp. 353–364. The eggs have a flattened shape, making clustering and clumping easier.  Life history  A. rumicis species generally have two broods: the first generation flies in May and June, while the second flies in August and September. However, the number of generations can differ based on location; in southern Europe, it tends to have three broods, while in the north, it has only one, most likely due to diapause. The number of broods may be determined by the duration of light and temperature ranges. The larvae tend to feed from the summer onwards until winter, during which A. rumicis spend its time in the pupae stage in cocoons. Caterpillar = Egg = Eggs are laid in clusters, in almost regular, overlapping rows on host plants. The egg stage lasts about 5 to 10 days. The eggs have a round flattened shape like a sand dollar and has a micropylar area that has 20 long ridges that radiate from the center, almost like a child's drawing of a sun and its rays. The flattened structure allows for stability while resting on the host plant. = Caterpillar = When larvae hatch, they tend to nibble out the round opening of the egg. Usually, A. rumicis larvae are ready to pupate after 30 days. They tend to be about 40 mm long, having dark brown bodies, with white spots along both sides of the body and red spots along the centre of the back.Anon, 2010. The Knot Grass moth and caterpillar – Acronicta rumicis. Wildlife Insight. Body hairs grow in tufts, arranged in rows: two rows along each side of the body and one row along the centre of the back. Cocoon = Pupae = Once the winter months near, fully grown caterpillars pupate in cocoons on leaves or leaf litter. The cocoon has tough white silk with one simple layer of grass, twigs, or leaves for better concealment from predators. = Adult = Adult moths tend to emerge in June but can also appear in earlier months if the weather is consistently warm.  Enemies  = Predators = Although the general cause of trouble in the life of A. rumicis is parasitism via parasitoids, another group of predators includes small birds. These birds, like the great spotted woodpecker, tend to breed and nest in agricultural regions. In one study from Slovenia, the birds were nested in a hop field. Hop is a popular food resource for A. rumicis, while caterpillars are the primary food source for these birds.Vogrin, M., 2002. Breeding birds in hop fields. Ornis Svecica, 12, pp.92–94. = Parasites = Parasitism in A. rumicis generally occurs in the months of May and October. Rates are lower in the months of June and July for reasons yet unknown. Most parasitoids affecting A. rumicis are parasitic wasps in the Braconidae and Ichneumonidae families, as well as parasitic flies.Cho, Y.-H., Kwon, O.-S. & Nam, S.-H., 2006. Species Composition and Seasonal Distribution of the Endoparasitoids on Acronicta rumicis (Lepidoptera, Noctuidae). Journal of Ecology and Environment, 29(1), pp.55–60. One of the most common parasitoids of A. rumicis is Glyptapanteles liparidis, a larval parasitoid that is highly distributed throughout Eurasia.CHO, Y.-H., NAM, S.-H. & KWON, O., 2006. Interaction of Acronicta rumicis (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) and its larval parasitoid, Glyptapanteles liparidis (Hymenoptera: Ichneumonidae). Entomological Research, 36, pp. 79–84. G. liparidis oviposits on the surface of the moth larvae; once hatched, the wasp larvae feed on the A. rumicis larvae and eventually cause death. Based on one study in South Korea, G. liparidis affects A. rumicis in its first, second, third, and fourth instar. The same study also discovered that the second-instar larvae were apparently the best food source for this parasitoid, as the second-instar larvae had the highest mortality rate in comparison to the other three larval stages. As the G. liparidis continuously grows and utilizes the resources produced internally by A. rumicis larvae, the feeding habits of these larvae change as well. On average, parasitized larvae consume more plant material than those not parasitized; the second instar larvae tend to consume the most food in comparison to the first, third, and fourth instars, supporting the idea that most G. liparidis feed most efficiently on the second instar larvae of A. rumicis.  Genetics of colour patterns  = Pigmentation and structural colouration = Industrial melanism exists within the species, meaning the moths evolved during the industrial period in England when dark soot was deposited into the environment. The aberration salicis Curtis, which is commonly found throughout the moth's distribution range, has darker grey- blotched sections on wings and retains the A. rumicis identifying marker, the white spot on its forewings.Skinner, B., 2009. Colour Identification Guide to Moths of the British Isles: (Macrolepidoptera). , p. 149. Aberration salicis is commonly found distributed in England, Wales, and Ireland. The aberration lugubris Schultz is almost completely black, lacking the mixed-grey mottling on the wings, but still retains the prominent white spot marker on its forewings.West, B.K., 2005. Acronicta rumicis L. ( Lep.: Noctuidae) extreme melanic ab. lugubris Schultz in Kent, and continued decline in melanism. Entomologist's Record and Journal of Variation, 2005(4), pp. 174–175. Aberration lugubris can be found mainly in England. According to B.K. West, since the late 1990s, melanism in A. rumicis has become less and less prevalent; in 1995, about 20% of A. rumicis were observed to be melanic, but over the course of five years the percentage decreased to 6.1%. By 2004, only 2.8% of population were melanic. With the industrial period in the past and resting surfaces less darkened by soot, it is reasonable to see that evolutionarily, the melanic variations are no longer as favourable.  Physiology  = Diapause = In A. rumicis, duration of light and temperature are two major factors causing diapause, the slowing or stopping of development in an insect when environmental conditions are not optimal. In one study, the onset of diapause was observed after varying photoperiods, while constantly rearing A. rumicis larvae at 27-28 °C. When A. rumicis were exposed to light on a short day, or 6–15 hours in the experiment, during the larval feeding period, almost all individuals underwent diapause after reaching pupal stage.Lee, A.D., 1955. The Physiology of Diapause in Arthropods 4th ed., Cambridge Monographs in Experimental Biology. As the daily photoperiods extended past 17 hours, the incidence of diapause began to drop, not causing any change to the development of the pupae in the cocoon. The ability of A. rumicis to undergo diapause allows for the completion of two generations while its host plants are available.Saulich, A.K., Sokolova, I. V & Musolin, D.L., 2015. Seasonal development of the dark spectacle Abrostola triplasia (L.) (Lepidoptera, Noctuidae) and its environmental control. Entomological Review, 95(6), pp. 687–692. The first generation develops under longer photoperiods, therefore the pupae are physiologically active, while the second generation grow under shorter photoperiods, meaning it is more beneficial for pupae to form diapause as they overwinter through the cold.  Interactions with humans  = Pests of crop plants = A. rumicis is a minor pest of various of fruit plants, mostly strawberries. However, they can also cause damage to blackberry, raspberry, loganberry, apple, pear, and cherry. Usually the larvae cause defoliation as they feed on the newly grown leaves. A. rumicis also attacks beans, ground nuts, wheat, maize, brassicas, and others.Hu, M. & Qi, M.L., 1993. The morphology and behaviour of Acronicta rumicis L., Ke xue chu ban she. According to a study in Poland, A. rumicis has also taken over maize populations, feeding until the leaves of the corn plants are no longer fresh and new because of the shift into harvesting season. During the spring and summer, the larvae of these moths damages both the leaves and silks of the cobs, occasionally eating soft kernels as well. When the second brood came in the fall, they only ate the leaves. This study in Poland further supports that A. rumicis larva prefer to eat fresh and newly grown leaves.Bereś, P.K., 2009. Knot grass (Acronicta rumicis L.) - a new maize pest in Southeastern Poland, Institute of Plant Protection. [Accessed October 23, 2017].  Conservation  Overall, the population of A. rumicis is in a sharp decline. Focusing on the moths in the United Kingdom, current research suggests that moths are in danger due to habitat loss, poor habitat management, global warming, and environmental deterioration from pesticides and pollution.Coulthard, E., 2015. Habitat and landscape-scale effects on the abundance and diversity of macromoths (Lepidoptera) in intensive farmland. The University of Northampton. Since 1969, the population of A. rumicis has declined by nearly 75%. Recently, A. rumicis was assigned as a Priority Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP) species, meaning the moth was identified as most threatened and will immediately be part of conservation efforts.Anon, 2016. UK BAP priority species. Joint Nature Conservation Committee. Researchers are realizing that the conservation of woodland areas is a high priority, in order to sustain as many populations of BAP species as possible; they also found a positive correlation between the species richness of herbaceous plants and the population density of moths. = Habitat loss and migration issues = hedgerows According to Emma Coulthard, hedgerows in close proximity to crop plants and farmlands are highly important to the survival of moths like A. rumicis. Habitats like hedgerows tend to provide food resources, shelter, and a place for females to lay eggs. In addition, recent studies have shown that hedgerows may act as guides for moths when flying from one location to another. As moths are nocturnal, it is highly unlikely that they use visual aids as guides, but rather are following olfactory markers. However, recently, hedgerows have been removed to increase agricultural efficiency. Removing key habitats like hedgerows not only limits the basic necessities of survival (i.e. food, shelter), but also prevents the moth from navigating properly; eventually, the moth would lose its trail and then potentially die. Even the smallest gaps between two bunches of hedgerows can cause a moth to go astray; one metre of no hedgerow can make an impact. Therefore, it is crucial for agriculturalists to figure out a way to pursue their plans while conserving the homes of moths like A. rumicis.

History Edict issued by Wladyslaw, King of Poland confirms that the Cistercians of Byszewo will continue have the same privileges that previous leaders have offered them, as well as ownership of the Nakielska manor, as previously under German law with the addition of various freedoms. Since 1288 Samsieczno and adjacent areas belonged to the Cistercian monks of Byszewo, although the village itself is not named in the monastery documents in 1386. The village was probably a retreat of Gunter of Bronikowa, a descendant of the Sorbian noble family Pradel (Predel), who arrived in the fourteenth century. The first record of the name of the village appears in district court records of Nakło nad Notecią (\\"Nakel\\" in German) dated 4 August 1453, naming Jan de Guncerzewy (John from the village Guncerzewy). From the start the site was strongly \\"connected\\" with Samsieczno and its buildings were developed on the plan ulicówki. Since the beginning the village was owned by nobles who were under an obligation to participate in military expeditions. Since the mid-fifteenth century the village was property of the Guncerzewskich family. In 1578 the village belonged to the family of Siedlce and Turzyńskich Szczutowskich. In the mid-seventeenth century, the village was taken over by the family Działyński. At the end of the seventeenth century, the heir was Michael Działyński, Lord of Chełm. At the beginning of the eighteenth century, the lands in the village go to the family Potuliccy. The last heiress of the village is Angela Constance Countess Alexander Potulicka. On 20 October 1932 the village board passes under the \\"Potulicka Foundation\\", created by Angela Potulicka Potuliccy. During World War II the village was part of the Reichsgau Danzig-Westpreußen. After World War II, the assets of the Foundation Potulicka land was nationalized and became part of the village Agricultural Combine in Wojnowo. Since 1990 the rural goods have been administered by the John Paul II Catholic University of Lublin (Universitas Catholica Lublinensis Ioannis Pauli II), as legal heirs to the \\"Potulicka Foundation\\". Notable residents * Margarete Himmler (1893–1967), wife of Heinrich Himmler Etymology The name of the village comes from the Sorbian name for Gunter. Its sounds different from the spelling and is phonetically similar to Gunczerz. The original name of the village Gunczerzewy has evolved over the years. Since the mid-fifteenth century to the partitions the name was recorded as: Guncerzewy, Gunczerzowy, Gunczerzewy, Guncerzewo, Gunczarzewy, Gącarzewy, Goncerzewo, Guncerzowy, Guncerzewice, Gunczerzewy. In the Grand Duchy of Posen there were two variations of the name: Gońcarzewy in Polish, and Goncerzewo in German. The Polish version Goncarzewy, which is currently in force, first appeared in 1926.

At heavy cost, Colonel Giovanninelli's 1st Brigade of the Tonkin Expeditionary Corps defeated forces of the Black Flag and Yunnan Armies blocking the way to the besieged French post of Tuyên Quang.Hubert, 109–16; Huguet, 89–93; Lecomte, Lang-Son, 324–9; Vie militaire, 215–31; Nicolas, 402–9; Thomazi, Conquête, 247–8; Histoire militaire, 107–8  Background  The French capture of Lạng Sơn in February 1885 in the Lạng Sơn Campaign allowed substantial French forces to be diverted further west to relieve the small and isolated French garrison in Tuyên Quang, which had been placed under siege in November 1884 by Liu Yongfu(劉永福)'s Black Flag Army and Tang Jingsong(唐景崧)'s Yunnan Army. The Siege of Tuyên Quang was the most evocative confrontation of the Sino-French War. The Chinese and Black Flags sapped methodically up to the French positions, and in January and February 1885 breached the outer defences with mines and delivered seven separate assaults on the breach. The Tuyên Quang garrison, 400 legionnaires and 200 Tonkinese auxiliaries under the command of chef de bataillon Marc- Edmond Dominé, beat off all attempts to storm their positions, but lost over a third of their strength (50 dead and 224 wounded) sustaining a heroic defence against overwhelming odds. By mid-February it was clear that Tuyên Quang would fall unless it was relieved immediately.Thomazi, Conquête, 237–41 and 246–8; Histoire militaire, 102–3 and 107–8  Relief march of the 1st Brigade  The Battle of Hòa Mộc was fought to relieve the Siege of Tuyên Quang. Following his capture of Lạng Sơn on 13 February 1885, General Louis Brière de l'Isle personally led Colonel Giovanninelli's 1st Brigade to the relief of Tuyên Quang. The brigade left Lạng Sơn on 17 February, after replenishing its food and ammunition, and made a forced march back to Hanoi along the Mandarin Road, via Cut, Thanh Moy, Cau Son and Bắc Lệ. After briefly pausing at Bắc Lệ to pay homage to the French soldiers killed in June 1884 in the Bắc Lệ ambush, Giovanninelli's men pressed on to Hanoi via the French posts at Kép, Phu Lang Thuong and Dap Cau. The brigade reached Hanoi on the evening of 22 February. It had left Lạng Sơn 3,000 strong, but straggling had reduced its numbers by a sixth, and it set off to relieve Tuyên Quang with only a little over 2,400 men. Five gunboats of the Tonkin Flotilla (Éclair, Henri Rivière, Berthe de Villers, Moulun and Trombe) carried Giovanninelli's men from Hanoi up the Red and Clear Rivers and put the brigade ashore near the French post of Phu Doan on the Clear River, fifty kilometres southwest of Tuyên Quang. The brigade was reinforced at Phu Doan on 24 February by two ad hoc infantry battalions (1,000 men) drawn from the garrisons of Sơn Tây and Hưng Hóa. This mixed force of Turcos, marine infantry and legionnaires, under the command of Lieutenant- Colonel de Maussion, had set out from Hưng Hóa on 21 February. The relief force now numbered 3,400 men.De Maussion's two mixed battalions were under the command of chefs de bataillon Beranger and Frauger. They included two companies of the 1st Battalion, 1st Foreign Legion Regiment (Captains Chmitelin and Broussier) and a marine infantry company (Captain Kuntz). Map of the Battle of Hòa Mộc, 2 March 1885 On 27 February Giovanninelli's men set out from Phu Doan towards the Yu Oc gorge, the most direct route to Tuyên Quang. The French knew that the Chinese and Black Flags had established a strong blocking position in the Yu Oc gorge, near the village of Hòa Mộc. In theory, the French column could have avoided this blocking position by advancing northwest along the Song Chay river and approaching Tuyên Quang from the west. Brière de l'Isle and Giovanninelli considered the possibility of making a flank march to bypass the Hòa Mộc position, but rejected it. If the column marched inland from the Clear River, it would lose the support of the gunboats. It would also be exposing its rear to a potentially devastating counterattack by the enemy troops at Hòa Mộc. It would be advancing through unknown country, along paths reported to be bad. Finally, whichever route the column took, it would not get to Tuyên Quang without a battle. Even if the flank march succeeded, the column would still have to fight its way through the Yunnan Army's siege lines around Ca Lanh or Phu An Binh, and these were reported to be as well-defended as the Hòa Mộc position. Brière de l'Isle and Giovanninelli therefore decided to advance directly on Tuyên Quang through the Yu Oc gorge, forcing the defences of Hòa Mộc. This was the route taken by Colonel Jacques Duchesne's column in November 1884, before the Battle of Yu Oc, and the French at least knew the lie of the land. Giovanninelli told his men that he was leading them 'into known dangers, by a known way'. On 28 February the brigade crossed the Song Chay river and camped five kilometres below the village of Hòa Mộc, at the entrance to the Yu Oc gorge. There, as they expected, they found the route to Tuyên Quang blocked by a strong Chinese defensive position.Huguet, 83–9; Lecomte, Lang-Son, 318–24; Vie militaire, 161–77, 195–206 and 207–13; Nicolas, 400–402  Forces engaged  Colonel Ange-Laurent Giovanninelli (1839–1903) Liu Yongfu (1837–1917) Giovanninelli's reinforced 1st Brigade consisted of seven infantry battalions (Mahias and Lambinet's marine infantry battalions, de Mibielle and Comoy's Turco battalions, Tonnot's battalion of Tonkinese riflemen and de Maussion's two mixed battalions) and two marine artillery batteries (Captains Jourdy and Péricaud).Mahias's battalion consisted of the 25th, 29th, 34th and 36th Companies, 1st Marine Infantry Regiment (Captains Tailland, Salles, Hougnon and Bourguignon). Lambinet's battalion included the 25th A, 28th and 31st D Companies, 1st Marine Infantry Regiment (Captains Chanu, Herbin and de Damian) and a fourth, unidentified company (Lieutenant de l'Étoile). De Mibielle's Turco battalion was the 3rd Battalion, 3rd Algerian Rifle Regiment (Captains Camper, Chirouze, Polère and Valet). Comoy's Turco battalion was the 4th Battalion, 1st Algerian Rifle Regiment (Captains Gérôme, Boëlle, Bigot and Rollandes). The French gunboat flotilla was unable to ascend the Clear River as far as Hòa Mộc, despite the utmost efforts of the gunboat crews, who hauled their vessels along the shallow river bed. Their absence was recognised by the French officers as a serious loss. Had they been present, they could have sailed up the Clear River beyond the Black Flag positions and enfiladed them from the rear, as they had done in September 1883 in the Battle of Palan. The Chinese and Black Flag forces blocking the way to Tuyên Quang were under the personal command of Liu Yongfu (Luu Vĩnh Phúc, as he was known to the French from the Vietnamese pronunciation of his name), and seem to have numbered around 6,000 men. They held three lines of trenches, one behind the other, and their flanks rested on the Clear River to the east and on impassable mountain terrain to the west. The position was well chosen, and the French had no option except to attack it frontally. Their single advantage was their artillery, which was stationed by Giovanninelli on hilltop positions from which the guns could fire down into the enemy trenches.  The battle of Hòa Mộc  Comoy's Turcos attack the Chinese positions at Hòa Mộc, 2 March 1885 The French approached the Chinese and Black Flag positions late in the morning of 2 March 1885. The enemy flags were down, and the Chinese trenches appeared to be deserted. The French shelled the trenches but there was no sign of life, so Giovanninelli sent forward a platoon of Tonkinese riflemen to draw any enemy fire. The Tonkinese were met with a murderous volley at point-blank range that killed or wounded 20 out of 30 men. Having established that the Hòa Mộc position was occupied, Giovanninelli attacked the left flank of the Chinese defensive line early in the afternoon. The first assault was made by chef de bataillon Comoy's Turco battalion. The Chinese exploded a mine in front of their trenches as the Algerians advanced, killing and wounding scores of the attackers, and the assault failed. One of the battalion's company commanders, Captain Rollandes, was mortally wounded in the attack. A second French assault, in mid-afternoon, was made by chef de bataillon Mahias's marine infantry battalion. The attack was met by accurate close range rifle fire, and also failed with heavy casualties. Giovanninelli reinforced the attackers with Lambinet's marine infantry battalion, and a third and final assault was made. This time the French broke through, capturing a large section of the enemy's forward trenches. To distract their attention, Liu Yongfu launched a counterattack against the French left flank, but it was driven off with heavy losses by the French reserves. Failed attack by the marine infantry of Mahias's battalion Although the French had made some progress in the afternoon's fighting, their casualties had been disconcertingly high, and it was not clear whether the brigade was strong enough to break through on the following morning. According to Lieutenant Huguet of Lambinet's marine infantry battalion, both Brière de l'Isle and Giovanninelli had been shaken by the ferocity of the enemy's resistance and were contemplating the possibility of defeat: > The general-in-chief was sitting behind a bank, anxious, his head in his > hands, surrounded by his staff, perhaps wondering whether he would have to > retreat. Colonel Giovanninelli, who valued the life of the humblest soldier > as dearly as his own, was pale and shaken as he watched the lines of > bloodstained stretchers file past him, and kept exclaiming in a strangled > voice, 'My children! My poor children!' The bullets whistled incessantly in > the close air, and the groans of the wounded men lying in the rose bushes, > inside the bamboo groves, and against the sides of the enemy works, rose > ever more distinctly.Huguet, 92 During the night of 2 March the Chinese and Black Flags made a counterattack in an attempt to recover the trenches they had lost, but were met with the bayonet by Comoy's Turcos and driven off after vicious hand-to-hand fighting. On the morning of 3 March Giovanninelli brought up his reserves and ordered the entire brigade to assault the stretch of trench line still in enemy hands. The French infantry moved forward at the trot, then accelerated into a charge, expecting to be met by a volley at point-blank range. Instead, they found the enemy trenches deserted. The Chinese and Black Flags had evacuated their positions before dawn, leaving the way to Tuyên Quang clear.  Casualties  Captain Tailland, killed in action at Hòa Mộc, 2 March 1885 French casualties at Hòa Mộc were 76 dead and 408 wounded. This was the highest casualty rate and the heaviest loss in a single day's fighting sustained by the French during the Sino-French War. The casualties included six officers killed or mortally wounded (Captains Rollandes and Tailland, Lieutenants Embarck, Moissenet and de l'Étoile, and 2nd Lieutenant Brun) and 21 officers wounded. Three of the 21 wounded officers (Captains Bourguignon and Chanu and 2nd Lieutenant Peyre) later died of their wounds. The heaviest losses fell on Mahias's marine infantry battalion. The battalion's strength on 26 December 1884 was 600 men and 19 officers. Its casualties in the Battle of Núi Bop (4 January 1885) and during the Lạng Sơn Campaign (February 1885) had been relatively light, but after Hòa Mộc it could only muster 307 men and 6 officers.Nicolas, 409 The French wounded were evacuated back to Hanoi aboard the gunboats, but many of them later died of their wounds in the overcrowded military hospitals of Dap Cau and Thi Cau.  Significance  Costly though it had been, Giovanninelli's victory cleared the way to Tuyên Quang. The Yunnan Army and the Black Flags raised the siege and drew off to the west, and the relieving force entered the beleaguered post on 3 March. Brière de l'Isle praised the courage of the hard-pressed garrison in a widely quoted order of the day. 'Today, you enjoy the admiration of the men who have relieved you at such heavy cost. Tomorrow, all France will applaud you!'Thomazi, Conquête, 241 The French public did indeed applaud chef de bataillon Marc-Edmond Dominé's defence of Tuyên Quang, and it eventually became the defining image of the Sino-French War in France. The battle of Hòa Mộc, fought to relieve the besieged garrison, is far less well known, and some of its participants were aggrieved at how quickly their achievements faded from the public's memory. They took what comfort they could from the order of day issued by Brière de l'Isle to the 1st Brigade on 5 March 1885: > Vous venez d'ajouter une glorieuse page à l'histoire du corps > expéditionnaire. Après vos victoires sur la route de Chu à Lang-Son, sans > vous accorder un repos déjà bien mérité, j’ai dû vous demander de nouveaux > efforts, vous conduire à de nouveaux dangers. L’entrain que vous avez montré > dans vos belles marches de Lang-Son à Hanoï et sur les rives de la rivière > Claire a prouvé que vous sentiez l'importance de vos nouvelles opérations. > Le 2 mars, vous avez rencontré l'armée chinoise, descendue du Yun-Nan, > retranchée dans une série d'ouvrages formidables, sur un terrain d'une > difficulté inouïe. L’ennemi, renforcé de tous les bandits de Luu-Vinh-Phuoc, > avait annoncé bien haut qu’il vous barrerait la route de Tuyen-Quan, assiégé > avec rage par lui. Sans tenir compte du nombre de vos adversaires, vous avez > enlevé de vive force les ouvrages de Hoa-Moc après une lutte de près de > vingt-quatre heures. Le résultat a répondu à vos sacrifices, et, le 3 mars, > vous serriez la main des braves de l'héroïque garnison que vous veniez > d'égaler. Honneur à vous tous!Huguet, 96 > (You have just added a glorious page to the annals of the expeditionary > corps.

From 1930 to 1933, it was the regional subdivision of the Nazi Party in that area. History =Establishment of the Gaue within the party= The Nazi Gau (plural Gaue) system was originally established in a party conference on 22 May 1926,Die NS-Gaue (in German) Deutsches Historisches Museum website, accessed: 25 June 2008 in order to improve administration of the party structure. In the early stages, the borders and leaders of these Gaue fluctuated frequently, mainly due to internal power struggles.Gau (NSDAP) - Die bayrischen Gaue bis zur Machtergreifung 1933 (in German) Historisches Lexikon Bayerns, accessed: 25 June 2008 The Gau Munich-Upper Bavaria was, for the most part, identical with today's Regierungsbezirk Upper Bavaria, of which Munich is the capital. =The Gau from 1930 to 1933= The Gau Munich-Upper Bavaria was formed on 16 November 1930 by a merger of the two previously separate Gaue Greater Munich and Upper Bavaria. It came under the leadership of Adolf Wagner, the Gauleiter of Greater Munich since November 1929, Shoa.de - Übersicht der NSDAP-Gaue, der Gauleiter und der Stellvertretenden Gauleiter 1933 bis 1945 - Schwaben (in German) author: Joachim Lilla, accessed: 25 June 2008 and remained under his formal leadership until his death in 1944. Until 1930, Bavaria, as the heartland of the Nazi movement in the 1920s, was seen by Hitler as his personal realm, the local Gaue commonly being called Untergaue (English:Sub-Gaue), to show their dependence on the head of the party. Only when Hitler's ambitions turned national did his interest in Bavarian affairs dwindle. With the end of the internal power struggle, the following six Gaue had been established in Bavaria:NSDAP - Gaue und Gauleiter (in German) Historisches Lexikon Bayerns, accessed: 25 June 2008 * Gau Schwaben * Gau München-Oberbayern * Gau Mainfranken * Gau Bayerische Ostmark * Gau Franken * Gau Rheinpfalz Within those and the other Nazi German Gaue, Munich-Upper Bavaria claimed an elevated position for itself. The reason for this being, that Munich was the birthplace of \\"the movement\\" (German:Hauptstadt der Bewegung - a title it officially carried). The Gaue called itself Traditionsgau München-Oberbayern to cement this elevated position.Traditionsgau München-Oberbayern, 1930-45 (in German) historisches Lexikon Bayerns, accessed: 26 June 2008 =The Gau from 1933 to 1945= With the ascent of the Nazis to power on 30 January 1933, the so-called Machtergreifung, the party immediately began to disassemble the power of the German states, the Länder. It was envisioned by the Nazis that the Party-Gaue would take the place of the old structure. In reality, Hitler was afraid of such a move, fearing it would upset local party leaders and could possibly result in an inner-party power struggle.Gau (NSDAP) - Kontinuität der Gaugliederung nach 1933 (in German) Historisches Lexikon Bayerns, accessed: 25 June 2008 Gradually, the Gauleiters (English:Gau Leaders) took control over their territories, reducing the local Minister Presidents, nominally the highest office in the German states, to figureheads. As such, the development of the Gau from an inner-party administration to a political and administrative sub-division of the country was gradual, not sudden, but completed by 1934. The process termed Gleichschaltung took care of all political opposition and the Law concerning the reconstruction of the Reich from 30 January 1934 can possibly be seen as the final date for the transfer of power from the states to the Gaue. In Munich-Upper Bavaria, the most populous Gau in Bavaria, the local Gauleiter Wagner, a personal friend of Hitler's, initially attempted to incooperate the neighboring Gau Schwaben, to increase his already considerable power. The Gauleiter was directly appointed by Hitler and only answerable to him. In practice, Hitler interfered little in the affairs of the local leaders and their power was almost absolute. Parallel to the five Bavarian Gauleiter, a Bavarian Minister President still existed during this time, the Nazi politician Ludwig Siebert and, after his death in 1942, his successor, Paul Giesler. As a third authority in the still existing state, Bavaria 1933-1945 - List of Ministers accessed: 25 June 2008 Franz Ritter von Epp held the office of Reichsstatthalter but wielded no real power.Gauleiter - Die bayrischen Gauleiter nach 1933 (in German) Historisches Lexikon Bayerns, accessed: 25 June 2008 When Gauleiter Wagner became increasingly ill, Paul Giesler, his deputy, took up the running of the Gau. After Wagners death in April 1944, Giesler formally succeeded him in his office. The Gau was home to Nazi Germany's first concentration camp in Dachau, which opened soon after the Machtergreifung. With the outbreak of the Second World War, the power of the Gauleiter, and therefore the power of the Gau compared to the state government, increased. Many of the Gauleiters were put in charge of the war effort in their Military district (German:Wehrkreis).Gauleiter - Dezentralisierungsschübe 1936 to 1939 (in German) Historisches Lexikon Bayerns, accessed: 25 June 2008 As the war progressed and Nazi Germany grew more desperate, the Gauleiter were put in total control of the war effort in their Gau from November 1942.Gauleiter - Die bayrischen Gauleiter nach 1942 (in German) Historisches Lexikon Bayerns, accessed: 25 June 2008 In September 1944, the Gauleiter were ordered to form the Volkssturm in a last effort to mobilise all of the male population. The Gauleiter took up the position of Reichsverteidigungskommissar (RVK) (English:Reich Defence Comissiner), in competition to the Wehrmacht. Paul Giesler was put in charge of Swabia and three of the formerly Austrian Gaue. With the end of the war and the collapse of Nazi Germany, Gauleiter Giesler still remained a convinced Nazi, crushing an uprising in the Bavarian capital with the help of the SS on 28 April 1945. Its leader, Rupprecht Gerngroß, a Wehrmacht officer, survived, but many of his supporters were executed on Gieslers orders.Gauleiter der NSDAP im Ruhrgebiet - Paul Giesler (1895-1945) (in German) Historisches Centrum Hagen, accessed: 26 June 2008 Aftermath All of Upper Bavaria, like most of the rest of Bavaria, became part of the US occupation zone. Only the Pfalz, geographically separated from the rest of the state, became part of the French occupation zone. Political power, at first lying with the occupation authorities, was soon returned to the new Bavarian government. The Regierungsbezirk Swabia, never having formally been dissolved, took control of the civil administration of the region again. Its most pressing issue was the reconstruction of the destroyed cities and the refugee problem. Paul Giesler, last Gauleiter of Munich-Upper Bavaria, attempted to commit suicide with his wife, fearing capture by the allied forces but failed and was shot by one of his adjudants near Berchtesgaden on 8 May 1945.Universitätsbibliothek Regensburg - Bosls bayrische Biographie - Paul Giesler (in German) Other Nazi organisations in the region The various departments of the Nazi organisation were by no means streamlined with the Gau system, but rather fiercely independent and competitive to each other. For example, while Bavaria was sub-divided in six Gaue, it was also divided in four sections of the SA, three sections of the SS and six sections of the Hitler Jugend.Gau (NSDAP) - Regionale Organisation der Gliederungen und angeschlossenen Verbände der NSDAP (in German) Historisches Lexikon Bayerns, accessed: 25 June 2008 The Gau Munich-Upper Bavaria belonged to the military district Wehrkreis VII, which also had its headquarters in Munich.Übersicht über die Kasernen und Standorte der Wehrmacht (in German) Lexikon der Wehrmacht, accessed: 26 June 2008 Gauleiter The highest position in the Gau, Gauleiter, was held by only two people during the history of the Gau: * Adolf Wagner - 16 November 1930 to 12 April 1944 * Paul Giesler - 12 April 1944 to May 1945 =Deputy Gauleiter= Second in charge and, in Gieslers case, actually wielding the true power in the Gau due to Wagners illness, were the Stellvertretende Gauleiter: * Otto Nippold - December 1932 to 17 May 1940 * Joachim von Moltke - 1940 to 1942 * Paul Giesler - 28 June 1942 to 12 April 1944 Structure Like all Gaue since the restructering of 1932, Munich-Upper Bavaria was in itself sub-divided in smaller administrative entitiys, in the structure of a pyramid, these being (1936): * Kreise (26) - equivalent of a district * Ortsgruppen (249) * Zellen (1,291) * Blocks (4,258) References External links * The Nizkor Project - The Organization of the Nazi Party & State * Pictures of Gauleiter, including Wagner Calvin College website * Picture of Giesler in Gauleiter uniform * \\"The German Addressbuch\\" 1942 Names and addresses of the Nazi government of Bavaria with description of their tasks and duties in 1942 * List of Gaue and Gauleiter * Die NS Gaue at the Deutsches Historisches Museum website. * Die Gaue der NSDAP Munchen-Oberbayern Category:Former states and territories of Bavaria Category:1933 establishments in Germany Category:1945 disestablishments in Germany ","title":"Gau Munich-Upper Bavaria"},{"id":"18143358","text":"Trzciniec is a village in the administrative district of Gmina Sicienko, within Bydgoszcz County, Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship, in north-central Poland.

She wrote for more than 50 films between 1914 and 1930, and directed 14 films between 1917 and 1920. She was born and died in Los Angeles, California. She was married to film director and producer Joseph De Grasse, with whom she was regularly teamed at Universal. Early career Park got her start in the entertainment industry as a stage actress when she was 15 years old. During her time in the theatre she met her future husband, Joseph De Grasse, also an actor. When Pathé hired De Grasse in 1909, Park was hired as a writer. Together they were hired by Universal. Work at Universal The first screenplay that she wrote was titled A Gypsy Romance which was developed into a short scenario by director Wallace Reid. Reid also directed the next scenario that she wrote, The Man Within. Park then started to work with De Grasse who directed the next several pieces that she wrote. The two worked on multiple shorts and scenarios together over several years. Their first joint project was the short Her Bounty (1914), and their first feature-length film was Father and The Boys (1915). Most of the titles that the two worked on together were for Universal's Bluebird label. Park made her solo directorial debut in 1917 when she directed The Flashlight starring Universal's top dramatic actress Dorothy Phillips; after this picture, she and DeGrasse took turns directing Bluebird projects featuring Phillips. She went on to direct 13 more films, many of which were deemed \\"women's features\\". Park and De Grasse continued at Universal Studios until 1919 when they left for unknown reasons. Later career After leaving Universal, Park directed The Butterfly Man (1920), starring Lew Cody, followed by two independent feature-length films co- directed with her husband, Bonnie May and The Midlanders (both 1920). These were the latter of Park's directorial credits. De Grasse continued to direct for a few more years, and Park continued to write for the screen. She wrote an additional two films before she left the industry altogether. The last feature film that she wrote was The Playthings of Hollywood (1931) for Willis Kent Productions. Ida May Park died on June 13, 1954.

It is supported by DEFRA, Sir David Attenborough, and Science Learning Centres in the UK. Primary science resources kit boxes or 'Treasure Chests', developed by Kew, were sent to every maintained primary school in the UK in Spring 2009. The boxes' contents – teaching materials and seed processing equipment – support teaching of the primary science curriculum for every year group from 5–11. The resources enable children to experience the variation and adaptation characteristics of plants. UK children will also be invited to contribute seed to Kew’s Millennium Seed Bank, supporting their research and conservation work. All activities are linked to the National Curriculum for Key Stages 1 and 2, with a focus on the science curriculum, but also offering cross- curricular opportunities. Forming part of the Darwin 200 initiative, the Great Plant Hunt encourages primary school children to \\"follow in the footsteps\\" of Charles Darwin by going on nature walks in and around their school grounds. The aim is that children find out more about plants, think about the roles plants play in people's lives, and in the process learn key scientific skills. Schools do not need green space to participate in the project; local parks, churchyards, and playgrounds can be used. Many of the activities are completely classroom-based and will be supported with online resources including video and music. Engagement may involve the whole school or just one class. It was relaunched as a European project in 2015 using the resources previously developed by Kew but with different funders.

After graduating from his \\"Grundstudium\\", in 1544 Thym took up a post as under-teacher in Magdeburg, where he was a colleague of Martin Agricola. He soon moved to a school in Zerbst and - after acquiring his master's degree in Wittenberg - became rector of the school in his hometown in 1548. He did not remain there for long, however, since in 1551 he was summoned to Goslar and then in 1554 appointed to be a schoolmaster in Wernigerode. In 1555 he returned to Wittenberg, and in October that year was admitted to the philosophy faculty of the Wittenberger Akademie. Here he held private lectures, pursued his own studies further and established a private school. Thym was above all an author of school books, grammatical writings, and an author of German and Latin poems. Besides a handbook of the Christian teaching in verse form, he related the Henry the Lion saga in verse form.

Darts career Wagner has played in the Lakeside World Championship four times, reaching the last 16 on three occasions. In 2003, he beat Gary Robson in the first round before going out after losing to Erik Clarys. He beat Co Stompé in the first round in 2004 before losing to John Walton, and in 2005, he put out Jarkko Komula in his first match, but lost to Ted Hankey 3–2 in sets after leading 2–0. In 2008, Wagner reached the semi finals of the Dutch Open where he lost to eventual winner Robert Thornton, was runner up in the Finnish Open won by Steve West, and won the Norway National Championship where he beat Rune David in the final. Wagner reached the semi finals of the 2008 World Masters, beating Gary Anderson in the last 16 and then beat Joey ten Berge in the quarter final before losing to Tony O'Shea. Wagner played in the 2009 BDO World Championships, losing in the first round to Anderson. He then won the 2009 Finnish Open and retained the Norway National Championship.

Wagner came back from 2–0 and 3–2 behind to win 4–3 in the sudden death leg, three times having to break Woods's throw to stay in the match and seeing Woods miss one dart at bullseye for the match. Both players made a number of high finishes and consistent scoring, and it was very quickly labelled as one of the best matches ever played in the early stage of a World Championship.

It is a predator of paper wasps and possesses a potent sting, which can cause extreme pain and swelling. Description The workers of Vespa tropica are about 24–26 mm in length, while queens grow to 30 mm. The head is dark brown/red; the abdomen is black with a distinct yellow stripe which covers most of the second abdominal segment. However, there is some variation across its range and in Singapore and southeastern Asia, specimens are often completely black and larger in size, while in other regions such as Hong Kong, the head and flanks of the thorax are normally reddish. A third colour form is found in the Andamans and Nicobars, which has a reddish brown head and thorax and all the dorsal plate on each segment of the gastrum are orange except the first. Distribution Vespa tropica is distributed throughout southern Asia from Afghanistan to the Philippines, south to New Guinea, New Britain and the Torres Strait Islands but it has not been recorded in mainland Australia. =Invasive= In August 2016 Vespa tropica was found at two sites in Guam, and has since been deemed a permanent resident of the island's ecosystem, until a solution is found to exterminate them. Biology Active nest of Vespa tropica attached to a wall. Vespa tropica - collection of Filippo Turetta Vespa tropica are raiders of the nests of other wasp species and take captured larvae back to their own nest to feed to their larvae. They have been observed to catch honeybees quite frequently, and even dragonflies have been noted as prey. A worker of V. tropica has been recorded as capturing and killing an individual of Vespa bicolor. Vespa tropica is associated with forests in the lowlands, up to 2100m altitude. The nests are usually within 3m above the ground in tree hollows or in subterranean cavities normally down to a depth of 20 cm including a record of one found inside a dead log partly buried in the soil. In the vicinity of human habitations it will nest under roofs, in attics and sheds. The nest is normally rhomboid or bowl-shaped and has an open bottom, whereas most aerial hornets' nest are completely sealed. The outer shell of the nest consists of distinct, broad layers and the nest is quite brittle. Occasionally nests are built within the crown of trees. Predation by V. tropica is one of the foremost causes of colony failure in Polistes chinensis in Japan. V. tropica may play a significant role in controlling Asian polistine populations. It can be a secretive species, preferring to fly close to cover and often high among the crowns of trees.

In LIS, it is often considered synonymous with subject (documents). In the philosophy of mind it has been often considered synonymous with intentionality, perhaps since John Searle (1983). In the philosophy of logic and language it is understood as the way a piece of text relates to a subject matter or topic. R. A. Fairthorne (1969) is credited with coining the exact term \\"aboutness\\", which became popular in LIS since the late 1970s, perhaps due to arguments put forward by William John Hutchins (1975, 1977, 1978). Hutchins argued that \\"aboutness\\" was to be preferred to \\"subject\\" because it removed some epistemological problems. Birger Hjørland (1992, 1997) argued, however, that the same epistemological problems also were present in Hutchins' proposal, why \\"aboutness\\" and \\"subject\\" should be considered synonymous. While information scientists may well be concerned with the literary aboutness (John Hutchins, 1975, 1977, 1978), philosophers of mind and psychologists with the psychological or intentional aboutness (John Searle, 1983) and language of thought (Jerry Fodor, 1975), and semantic externalists with the external state of affairs (Hilary Putnam, 1975). These seminal perspectives are respectively analogous to Ogden and Richards' literary, psychological, and external contexts (1923), as well as Karl Popper's World 1, 2, and 3 (1977).

The International Pacific Halibut Commission (IPHC) is an International Fisheries Organization, having Canada and the United States as its members, responsible for the management of stocks of Pacific halibut or Hippoglossus stenolepis within the Pacific waters of its member states. It was founded in 1923 by an international treaty. The original treaty has been revised three times (1953,1976,1979). The 1979 amendment clarified the role of the IPHC in the management of the fishery through the North Pacific Halibut Act of 1982. It has carried out many activities including the use of chartered commercial fishing vessels to undertake bottom trawls and long-lining for sampling fish stocks, banding fish, recording water temperatures using bathythermographs, etc., in the North Pacific and Bering Sea for many years. Also, staff have been stationed at on-shore fish processing plants to sample catches, remove otoliths to determine the age of the fish, and many other research activities. The commission holds a regularly Annual Meetings and occasionally Special Meetings as necessary. Its offices were located on the campus of the University of Washington until November 2010. The IPHC has since moved its offices to the Interbay neighborhood of Seattle.

It was modified by subsequent legislation and finally repealed in 1993. It was one of the Licensing Acts 1828 to 1886.The Short Titles Act 1896, section 2(1) and Schedule 2 The precursor to the Beerhouse Act was the Alehouse Act 1828 (9 Geo.4 c.61), which established a general annual licensing meeting to be held in every city, town, division, county and riding, for the purposes of granting licences to inns, alehouses and victualling (i.e. provision of food) houses to sell exciseable liquors to be drunk on the premises. Enacted two years later, the Beerhouse Act enabled any rate-payer to brew and sell beer on payment of a licence costing two guineas (£2.10 in decimal currency, not adjusted for inflation). The intention was to increase competition between brewers; lowering prices and encouraging people to drink beer instead of strong spirits. It resulted in the opening of thousands of new public houses and breweries throughout the country, particularly in the rapidly expanding industrial centres of the north of England. According to the Act, Parliament considered it was The Act's supporters hoped that by increasing competition in the brewing and sale of beer, and thus lowering its price, the population might be weaned off more alcoholic drinks such as gin. But it proved to be controversial, removing as it did the monopoly of local magistrates to lucratively regulate local trade in alcohol, and not applying retrospectively to those who already ran public houses. It was also denounced as promoting drunkenness. By 1841 licences under the new law had been issued to 45,500 commercial brewers. One factor in the Act was the dismantling of provisions for detailed recording of licences, which were restored by subsequent regulatory legislation: the Wine and Beerhouse Act 1869 and the Wine and Beerhouse Act Amendment Act 1870. The Act was often amended, notably in 1834 and 1840. The final remaining provisions of the Act were repealed on 11 November 1993, by the Statute Law (Repeals) Act 1993 (1993 c. 50), s. 1(1), Sch. 1 Pt. XIII GroupI. The passage of the Act during the reign of King William IV led to many taverns and public houses being named in his honour; he remains \\"the most popular monarch among pub names\\".

Sri Madhva undertook a second trip to Badari. On the way, many interesting incidents took place. Once, after Sri Madhva and his followers crossed the Ganga river, the troops of a Muslim ruler arrested all of them. Sri Madhva explained to the King that it was the same Supreme Being that all people on earth worshipped and therefore he feared none. Looking at the fearless saint and impressed by his words, the King offered many gifts to Sri Madhva (all of which were politely refused) and permitted them to leave. On another occasion, a band of dacoits attacked the party. Sri Madhva asked Upendra Tirtha, his disciple, to confront them. Sri Upendra Tirtha, who went on to become one of the eight disciples who got the opportunity of worshipping Sri Krishna at Udupi, and who is the founder of the Puttige Matha, fought like a man possessed and drove away the bandits. # Kavindra Tirtha # Hamsendra Tirtha # Yadavendra Tirtha # Dharanidhara Tirtha # Damodara Tirtha # Raghunatha Tirtha # Shreevatsanka Tirtha # Gopinatha Tirtha # Ranganatha Tirtha # Lokanatha Tirtha # Ramanatha Tirtha- # Shreevallabha Tirtha- jnAnavairAgyabhaktyAdiguNapuShpArchitAchyutAn shrIvallabhAkhyayOgIndrAn naumyahaM tatkRupAbalaH # Shreenivasa Tirtha- Puthige mutt guruparampara shloka describes him as \\"Vadirajamunisupriyam\\".

They normally seat around 49 passengers. Its successor was the Alexander ALX300. This style was originally built for Singapore Bus Services, but Stagecoach Group is also a big user of the type, many examples having been purchased for use in the UK. Many FirstGroup examples have been scrapped, but buses previously with Stagecoach have fared better, with many of the latter leading new lives as school buses with smaller independent operators in Great Britain.

It is adjacent to, but not part of, the Cass-Davenport Historic District. History Early in the 20th century, Charles Hugh Stevenson, his brother, and his father-in- law founded the Davenport Realty Company.Hotel Stevenson from the city of Detroit Stevenson was a writer and lawyer and was internationally recognized for work in the hotel industry. In 1913, the Davenport Realty Company built the Hotel Stevenson (named for Charles Hugh Stevenson), which was designed to house the influx of male, transient, workers who came to Detroit to work in the booming auto industry. The hotel architect was Joseph P. Jogerst. The structure was designed as an apartment hotel, offering primarily efficiency and one bedroom units, rather than the two to four-room suites contained in typical apartment buildings of the time. The building was sold to the Milner Hotel Chain, which changed its name to the Milner Arms. In 2016, the building was sold to Broder & Sachse Real Estate Services, Inc. It is still in operation as an apartment building. Description The Milner Arms is an eight-story rectangular Georgian Revival steel frame apartment building clad with brick. The facade is symmetric, with the exception of the first floor. The first floor contains five arched openings with masonry quoins; the second is the entrance. A projecting cornice with brackets separates the first floor from the upper stories. Floors two through seven have identical double hung single pane windows. There is a narrow belt course between floors six and seven, and the windows on the seventh floor have continuous sills. A heavy cornice separates the seventh and eighth floors. The eighth floor windows are arched, and a balustrade above caps the facade. The Milner Arms contains a total of 93 apartments. Sixty-eight are studio apartments, ranging from 250 to 600 square feet. Twenty-two are one-bedroom units of about 800 square feet, and the remaining three are two-bedroom units of about 1,020 square feet.

It is located in embassy quarter on Bol'shaya Nikitskaja Str., house #51, that was previously occupied by the embassy of Morocco. Prior to 2013, the Tanzanian embassy was located at 33 Pyatnitskaya Street () in the Zamoskvorechye District of Moscow. The old Embassy occupied a listed memorial building - Korobkova House - built in two stages in 1890s. The oldest, northern part of the building contains a two- story core, built in 1866 and rebuilt in ornate late eclecticism by Lev Kekushev (1890-1894). In the same decade the owners acquired an adjacent southern lot and hired Sergey Schutzmann to expand the building from Kekushev's 21×23 to 30×23 meters. The annex, completed in 1899, corresponds to the three southernmost windows on the main facade. Instead of expanding Kekushev's original artwork to the south annex, Schutzmann completely redesigned the facade, radically changing its appearance.

Замоскворечье. — М.: Искусство, 1994. ) p.266-264 Public sources frequently, and incorrectly, credit the building to Kekushev alone or present Kekushev's and Schutzmann's work as a joint collaboration.

He won races over distances ranging from five furlongs to two and a half miles, but was especially effective over extended distances. Background Zarathustra was bred by Sir Harold Gray at Graymount in Antrim, Northern Ireland in 1951. When Gray died later the same year, the ownership of his horses, including the black foal who would become known as Zarathustra passed to his son, the writer and philosopher Terence Gray (Wei Wu Wei). Gray declined several offers to buy the colt and sent him to be trained in Ireland by Michael Hurley. Racing career =1953-1956: Ireland= Unusually for a future champion stayer, Zarathustra demonstrated precocious speed, winning three times as a two-year-old over the minimum distance of five furlongs. The most important of these was the Blake Plate at Phoenix Park. In 1954 he was one of the best horses in Ireland, winning the Irish Derby and the Irish St. Leger as well as the Desmond Plate at the Curragh. Following his win in the Irish Derby, Gray reportedly turned down an offer of £20,000 for the horse. As a four-year-old Zarathustra won the Royal Whip Stakes. =1956-1957: Britain= After one unsuccessful run in early 1956 he was transferred to England where he was trained at Newmarket, Suffolk by Cecil Boyd-Rochfort. By the end of the season he had won four races in Britain including the Ascot Stakes (by five lengths) and the Goodwood Cup. In 1957 Zarathustra sustained a fracture to his cannon bone which threatened his racing career. After spending two months recuperating in his stable he returned to the racecourse to run in the Ascot Gold Cup. The stable jockey, Harry Carr preferred to ride the Queen's runner Atlas, leaving Zarathustra to be ridden by Lester Piggott. After racing just behind the leaders, Zarathustra took the lead early in the straight and won the race by one and a half lengths from the St Leger winner Cambremer. Assessment Zarathustra was given a best end of year Timeform rating of 131 in 1956, when he was the third highest rated horse trained in Britain. Stud record Zarathustra returned to Ireland to stand as a stallion. The best of his offspring was Crozier, a stayer like his sire who won the Doncaster Cup. He was exported to Japan in 1964 and died there in 1967.

The agency created regulations to promote productive, healthy and safe workplaces for workers and employers in New South Wales. The agency formed part of the Safety, Return to Work and Support Division established pursuant to the . On 1 September 2015, WorkCover NSW was replaced by three new entities – Insurance and Care NSW (icare),http://www.icare.nsw.gov.au/ the State Insurance Regulatory Authority (SIRA),http://www.sira.nsw.gov.au/ and SafeWork NSW,http://www.safework.nsw.gov.au/ the new work health and safety regulator. The changes were part of reforms to improve the workers compensation system for employers and injured workers. The information below pertains to the former WorkCover NSW as WorkCover NSW no longer exists and its functions have been split between the aforementioned agencies. The Authority enforces their role 1324 providing a list of rules that employers must follow in the form of a legal legislation. It is possible for them to enforce it by having the right to inspect workplaces to check that the legislation is being followed. It contains the requirements to keep a hazardous chemicals register, requirements to train, instruct and provide information to staff about handling the chemicals. Some of the things work cover ensures when it inspects work places is that all employees are properly trained, have the correct and appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) and have the correct equipment to use.  Powers and responsibilities  The WorkCover Authority of New South Wales primarily administers New South Wales workplace health and safety law, including the and the . WorkCover prepares codes of practice for particular industries,Occupational Health and Safety Act 2000 (NSW), section 41 and investigates reports of unsafe practices in particular workplaces. Through the investigation of complaints of occupational health and safety practices, WorkCover inspectors may forcibly enter places of work, take objects, and require information from people in charge of particular places of work. Once an investigation has concluded, WorkCover may require employers to improve their occupational health and safety practices, or refrain from authorising certain work.  Health and safety  WorkCover assesses all health and safety aspects of the workforce. This includes the environment by which an employee may raise a workplace safety issue and how to do so, the rights and responsibilities of everyone in the work place, including employers, employees and people visiting the workplace, the duty of care of people in the workforce, including planning for the prevention of accidents to people in the workplace, and what happens when these duties aren’t met. WorkCover may also review bullying and psychosocial issues of employees and employers, and how to stop bullying, the appropriate knowledge and handling skills of different chemicals, how efficient and ergonomic the workplace is, ensuring appropriate usage of space. The Authority may also examine noise levels within the workforce, not exceeding the legal noise limit, and also the correct use and apt training for the use of machinery and equipment.  Insurance and premiums  If a workplace injury or disease occurs, workers and employers are protected by the NSW workers compensation scheme. The scheme is in place to help maintain a financially viable workers compensation system that is fair and affordable for employers and improves outcomes for injured workers. The scheme is in place to give workers injured in the workplace medical and financial support. It is funded by premiums that are paid by the employers. The amount of premium that is paid by the employer depends on a few factors including the industry or sector operated; the amount of wages paid to your workers, the costs of any claims made by your injured workers and the dust diseases levy. If an injury does occur in the workplace, the employer will be covered for the cost of compensation to the worker that is injured, provided the employer has a ‘workers compensation insurance policy’. Due to the workers compensation system, any injured worker may be able to get compensation in the form of weekly payments; lump sum payments for permanent impairment (and pain and suffering where applicable); and payment of medical and hospital expenses and rehabilitation assistance.  Injuries and claims  WorkCover is responsible for providing protection to workers and employers in the form of a compensation system for work sustained injuries, which can provide weekly payments, lump sums for permanent impairment (and pain and suffering where applicable), payment of medical bills, provision of legal assistance to pursue a claim, and/or intensive rehabilitation assistance. Workplace injuries are managed to ensure that the worker recovers and is able to return to work. This includes treatment and rehabilitation, retraining of the worker and the management of any compensation claims. The idea is that through the management of the injury, the worker may be able to return to work as soon as possible, and that all parts of an employer's policies for the return to work program are followed. A return to work coordinator should be nominated by an employer to help injured workers to return in a safe manner. The return to work coordinator can either be an employee nominated by the employer, or a person contracted specifically for this purpose. As part of the return to work program, an employer shall provide suitable duties for the worker during their recovery period, so that they are still able to continue working and do not have to take time off work completely. These duties should be short term, with a goal of assisting the recovery process, and shall comply with the worker's medical certificate, and finally shall be agreed upon by the employer, the worker, and their doctor. WorkCover also runs various programs to help injured workers in returning to work. These include short periods of work experience called work trials to assist them in developing or redeveloping skills, and to build up physical and psychological fitness; formal retraining of skills at TAFE or university if the worker is unable to find suitable work after injury; funding to help with purchasing equipment to modify the work environment to the injured worker's needs; and the JobCover placement program (JPP), which provides a financial incentive to another employer to employ the injured worker In the case of a worker being injured, the employer, worker and insurer all have certain responsibilities to ensure that they are compensated, and given assistance so they can make a full recovery and return to work. =Injuries= It is the responsibility of an injured worker to immediately report it to their employer, and the details of the incident must be added to the register of injuries – a list containing all current injuries suffered by workers, caused in the workplace. If the injury is deemed serious enough, a claim can be made to the insurer. This can be made by anyone; however it must be done within 48 hours of the injury being notified. The insurer will then give the person who notified them a notification number, which can be used to track their notification. The claimant shall provide the insurer with details about the following: #worker's information – their name, residential address, contact details and date of birth #employer's information – the business name, current business address and employer contact #treating Doctor information – the name of the doctor or hospital where the injured worker is being treated #injury or illness details – the date of the injury, description of how it happened and a description of the injury itself #notifier information – the name of person making the notification, relationship to injured worker and contact details #supporting information – anything else the notifier considers necessary. Payments will be made to the injured worker on a weekly basis, the amount dependent on the severity of the injury. In cases where the worker is injured permanently, they may be entitled to one or two lump sum payments. The employer shall send the claim to the insurer within seven days of receiving it, and the insurer may ask the employer questions about the claim, and ask for extra documentation which must be provided before the claim can go through. A complying agreement must then be made in writing between the insurer and the injured worker. If the employer has not notified a workplace injury to the insurer or will not provide the employee with their workers compensation insurance policy number, the WorkCover Assistance Service on 13 10 50 assists with guiding claimants.  Licensing  Before people and businesses undertake high risk activities in the workplace, they may be required to: *obtain a permit *notify WorkCover *register certain equipment *hold a licence or certificate of competency WorkCover's Licensing Solutions Unit administer, advise, assess and approve applications for licences, permits, registrations and notifications. To be able to use explosives or fireworks, a licence must be received from WorkCover. They are in charge of the regulation of explosive chemicals, in terms of unsupervised handling, use, manufacture, storage, import, supply and transport.[5] It is illegal to be in possession of explosive and dangerous chemicals without the appropriate WorkCover licence. Licences for explosives will only be given for commercial manufacturing, mining and quarrying, and anyone applying for these licences must have extensive background checks from police and security agencies. For fireworks, either a pyrotechnicians licence, or a fireworks (single use) licence is required. A pyrotechnicians licence allows you to use fireworks and teach people with a fireworks (single use) licence in the correct handling of fireworks. A licensed pyrotechnician must also notify WorkCover seven working days before any fireworks are used, and complete the Fireworks display: Notification of pyrotechnics/fireworks display form. As well as explosives and fireworks, licences must be issued for things such as asbestos removal, demolition work, and other high risk work activities. As well as gaining the respective licence, WorkCover must be notified if someone is undertaking any of the following activities: *asbestos removal *demolition work *fireworks displays *importation or export of explosives or security sensitive dangerous substances *lead risk work *operating a Major Hazard Facility (MHF) under the Work Health and Safety Regulation 2011 *storage of dangerous goods *using carcinogenic substances at a place of work  Medical and health care  = Allied health providers = Allied health providers contribute significantly to improved health and also return to work outcomes for injured workers. All allied health providers have to abide by administrative procedures proposed by WorkCover. Chiropractors, exercise physiologists, hearing service providers, independent consultants, osteopaths, physiotherapists, psychologists and counsellors, and remedial massage therapists are all subject to these requirements.  Law and Policy  WorkCover is responsible for the administration and enforcement of compliance with occupational health and safety, management of workplace injury and workers compensation legislation it also manages the workers compensation system. = Acts = Acts are legislation created by parliament. WorkCover administers several acts as its main statutory function. These include:   * * = Codes of Practice = WorkCover uses industry codes of practice in order to achieve industry standards. Under the Occupational Health and Safety Act, 2000, codes of practice may be made under approval of the Minister for Finance and Services. Whilst not legislation, the codes of practice should be observed. Employers, workers, designers, manufacturers and suppliers should follow the codes of practice in accordance with the legislation and associated regulations. A person cannot be prosecuted for not observing codes of practices. If there is an offence under the Act, the breach of the codes of conduct can be used as evidence. = Fraud = WorkCover helps to minimise the impact of fraud by a company's employers, workers and/or service providers. WorkCover may assist with investigations into suspected fraudulent activities. Fraudulent acts by employers may include failing to pass on workers compensation benefits to workers and/or supplying false or misleading information to obtain a policy. Fraudulent acts by workers may include their claiming their injury occurred at work when it actually happened playing sport or during another activity undergone in the worker's own time. Fraudulent acts by service providers may include submitting fraudulent invoices or providing false information to the service recipients. = Regulations = A regulation is law and, as such, employers, workers, insurers, designers, manufacturers, suppliers and others must meet their obligations under both the legislation and the regulations. WorkCover administer several regulations:   * * = Standards = Australian standards outline safety requirements and give guidance to people working in certain areas or people that use certain equipment. When incorporated into legislation these standards become legally binding. Under NSW law, a variety of systems, equipment, products and materials must meet Australian Standards. The establishment of standards ensures that particular requirements are met. The requirements that are outlined are quality, performance, construction design, endurance time specificity, systems or processes and certain hazards and controls.  Controversy  In December 2005, the Independent Commission Against Corruption found that 23 WorkCover employees had issued false certificates of competency, which ICAC states significantly undermined workplace safety on building sites. ICAC further states that systemic corruption risks were exposed by the incident: In 2002, a New South Wales parliamentary committee criticized the WorkCover Authority.  2012 legislation  In 2012 a new Act, Regulations and Codes of Practice was enacted. The revised legislative instruments aimed at providing rights for health and safety to everyone in the workplace as well as providing them the opportunity to give their opinion of their workplaces' health and safety practices without having to worry about speaking out about an issue. The legislation includes changes to the laws involving PCBU's reasonably, control of hazardous work, plant and structure requirements, construction restrictions, labelling and classification of hazardous chemicals and a few changes to those regarding mines.

It was built 1000 years ago. It is situated on National Highway 944 (India), which connects Nagercoil with Tirunelveli and Trivandrum, the capital city of Kerala. The Krishnan temple at Krishnancoil is described as \\" The Guruvayoor of South \\" as the chief deity is visually similar to the one in the Guruvayoor temple. It connects the realistic tradition of Hindu mysticism to local folklore and happens to be a premiere spot for local devotees to show up and present their prayers. A Government middle school that imparts education up to 8th standard is located in the suburb. Most of the people in the area work in the offices of the Nagercoil town or in agriculture. The main crop is rice. The railway station situated in this suburb is called Nagercoil Town, and the main railway station of Nagercoil is called Nagercoil Junction. Krishnancoil is nearer to vadasery police station. Location The Krishnancoil temple in the suburb is well maintained, and was renovated in 2008 for Kumbabhishekam which took place after many decades. The temple is surrounded by the living population in 4 main streets named according to the direction (south,north,west mada street and sanadi street). The pond adjacent to the temple (known in Tamil as \\"Theppakulam\\") has two \\"pipal trees\\" on its banks, one each on the west and south sides. The annual ten-day temple festival is conducted during the Tamil month of Chithirai, which falls between 14 April and 14 May. Krishna is the childhood avatar of this temple.

He is mostly known for his 1956 publication Oracles and Demons of Tibet, which was the first detailed study of Tibetan deity cults.  Biography  René Mario de Nebesky-Wojkowitz was born in Groß Hoschütz in Moravia on 29 June 1923. After completing his secondary education in Leitmeritz and Prague, he devoted himself to the study of Central Asian ethnology, Tibetan, and Mongolian at the universities of Berlin and Vienna. It was especially the teachings of the late Robert Bleichsteiner at the University of Vienna that encouraged him to specialize in Tibetan studies. Before the defense of his doctoral thesis (see Bibliography, no. 3) on November 3, 1949 he published two articles on the Bön religion and the state oracle.“Die tibetische Bön-Religion,” Archiv für Völkerkunde 2 (1947), pp. 26–68.“Das tibetische Staatsorakel,” Archiv für Völkerkunde 3 (1948), pp. 136–155. From November 1949 to July 1950 he continued his studies in Italy under the direction of Giuseppe Tucci and Joseph Rock, as well as in London at the School of Oriental and African Studies and the London School of Economics. In August 1950, Nebesky-Wojkowitz set off for Kalimpong and did not return to Europe until February 1953 (nos. 16, 18). His long stay there gave him access to many texts on protector deities and allowed him to benefit from the council of Tibetan scholars who sought refuge during the Chinese incursion. One can find a vivid description of events at that time in a book he intended for non-specialists (no. 20). Nebesky-Wojkowitz published the results of his research in several articles, and especially in his most important work, Oracles and Demons of Tibet: The Cult and Iconography of the Tibetan Protective Deities (no. 22). This voluminous 666-page book is widely considered a foundational study of Tibetan popular religion and deity cults, making it an indispensable compendium for all those who deal with protector deities. Nebesky-Wojkowitz also made several excursions among the Lepcha of Sikkim (nos. 7, 10, 14, 15). In 1954 he spent five months in Leiden identifying the collection of Lepcha manuscripts at the National Museum of Ethnology, where he had already made a list of the titles of Tibetan xylographs and manuscripts during a seven-month stay in 1953. René de Nebesky-Wojkowitz visited Kalimpong and Sikkim a second time in the last months of 1956 before going to Nepal to look for a new site of exploration (no. 23). In 1958-1959 he visited Nepal again and stayed there for three months. He collected a considerable amount of material as well as 400 objects for the Museum of Ethnology in Vienna, where they remain today. In 1958 he became a \\"wissenschaftlicher Beamter\\" at the Museum of Ethnology. At the start of 1958 he was diagnosed with pneumonia, the effects of which were felt during his third expedition to the Himalayas in 1958-1959. The travels that he undertook in Nepal became too demanding on his health and, upon his return to Vienna, he died at the age of 36 on July 9, 1959 after a brief illness.The majority of this information was drawn from de Jong, \\"René Mario von Nebesky- Wojkowitz †\\"  Cause(s) of Death  According to de Jong,de Jong, \\"René Mario von Nebesky-Wojkowitz †\\" René de Nebesky-Wojkowitz died of pneumonia. However, his cause of death has been almost completely eclipsed by how tragically young he was when he succumbed. Because of this, an urban legend of sorts has come to surround Nebesky-Wojkowitz's death, with many members of the Tibetan Buddhist community believing that his death was actually brought on by the wrath of the very protector deities he studied so assiduously. In his critique of Tibetan shamanism, scholar Zeff Bjerken describes his own personal experience with this widespread belief: :[Nebesky-Wojkowitz’s] sudden untimely death, shortly after the...completion [of Oracles and Demons of Tibet], was thought to have been brought about by Tibet’s protective deities, who were avenging his efforts to reveal their secrets and magic power. At the Library of Tibetan Works and Archives in Dharamsala, when I tried to check out Nebesky-Wojkowitz’s text for my research, I discovered that it was not on the shelf with most other books but kept separate under lock and key. Only after offering the Tibetan librarian my American passport as collateral was I permitted access to the work, although not before being warned of its dangerous content.Bjerken, “Exorcising the Illusion of Bon ‘Shamans’,\\" p.38 Among scholars of Tibetan religions, as well as outside observers, opinions vary, with some taking this belief seriously and others not. Two decades prior to Bjerken’s account, John Blofeld, a popular British writer on Eastern religions, made the following morbidly droll statement: “Tibetans were not surprised when the distinguished author of Oracles and Demons of Tibet came to an untimely end soon after completing that monumental but dullish book. The subject of Guardians is one on which nothing detailed should be said; to write at length about demons is always held to be unwise; but his ultimate crime was to make them seem boring!”Blofeld, The Tantric Mysticism of Tibet, p.73 This latter contention is, at times, still spoken of in jest among Tibetan specialists today.

Pre-war Chicago blues vocalist and harmonica pioneer John Lee \\"Sonny Boy\\" Williamson first recorded it in 1937. Subsequently, a variety of artists have recorded versions of the song, usually calling it \\"Good Morning Little Schoolgirl\\". Original song Sonny Boy Williamson I recorded \\"Good Morning, School Girl\\" in 1937 during his first recording session for Bluebird Records. The song is an uptempo blues with an irregular number of bars. Although identified with Chicago blues, a write-up in the Blues Hall of Fame notes \\"it was a product of Sonny Boy’s west Tennessee roots and his pre-Chicago ensemble work\\". The melody has been traced to “Back and Side Blues”, a 1934 blues song recorded by Son Bonds. \\"Good Morning, School Girl\\" features Williamson's vocal and harmonica with accompaniment by Big Joe Williams and Robert Lee McCoy (also known as Robert Nighthawk) on guitars. Blues renditions In October 1948, Leroy Dallas recorded a version of the song, titled \\"Good Morning Blues\\". Texas bluesman Smokey Hogg recorded his version, calling it \\"Little School Girl\\". In 1950, the song reached number nine on the Billboard Best-Selling Retail Rhythm & Blues Records chart and number five on the magazine's Most Played Juke Box R&B; chart. Memphis one-man-band Joe Hill Louis recorded an electric version titled \\"Good Morning Little Angel\\" in February or March 1953. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, several versions of \\"Good Morning Little Schoolgirl\\" were recorded as acoustic country-style blues, including versions by John Lee Hooker, Lightnin' Hopkins, Mississippi Fred McDowell, Muddy Waters, and Doctor Ross. In 1965, Junior Wells with Buddy Guy recorded it as a Chicago blues, with a distinctive guitar and bass line, for their influential Hoodoo Man Blues album. McDowell included a 1971 performance on Live in New York and in 1978, Muddy Waters recorded an updated rendition for I'm Ready. Rock and R&B; adaptations =Larry Williams version= Early rock and roll singer and pianist Larry Williams recorded \\"Little School Girl\\" on January 6, 1958 at Radio Recorders in Hollywood, California. Although it uses some of Williamson's lyrics and melody, music writer Gene Sculatti notes the more dance-inspired version. Specialty Records released the song as the B-side to \\"Ting-A-Ling\\", with the writer credit listed as \\"L. Williams\\". =Don and Bob/Yardbirds version= In 1961, Don Level and Bob Love, as the rhythm and blues duo \\"Don and Bob\\", recorded a different version of \\"Good Morning Little Schoolgirl\\" for Argo Records, a Chess subsidiary. Although they use the phrase \\"good morning little schoolgirl\\", the song has different chord changes and lyrics, including references to popular dance styles of the time. When the Yardbirds were looking for a song to follow up to their first single, \\"I Wish You Would\\", they chose the Don and Bob tune. The group's guitarist Eric Clapton explained in an early interview: The single was released on October 20, 1964, in the UK, where it reached number 49 in the singles chart, the band's first chart hit. Epic Records, the Yardbirds' American label, did not issue the single in the US, but in 1965 included the song on their first American album, For Your Love. Later, in his autobiography, Clapton described the early recordings: The group recorded a live version at the Marquee Club in London, which was released on the British debut album, Five Live Yardbirds, in December 1964. On the live version, Clapton and bassist Paul Samwell-Smith provided the vocals instead of lead singer Keith Relf. The Yardbirds single version was credited to \\"Demarais\\" or \\"H.G. Demarais\\" (Dee Marais, a Shreveport, Louisiana, record label owner/distributor and business associate of Leonard Chess), although some later reissues list Sonny Boy Williamson as the songwriter. Album credits for live version are either listed as Demarais or \\"Level–Love\\". Recognition and legacy In 1990, Sonny Boy Williamson I's \\"Good Morning, School Girl\\" was inducted into the Blues Foundation Hall of Fame in the \\"Classics of Blues Recordings – Single or Album Track\\" category. Numerous artists have recorded or performed the song through the years, usually with the title \\"Good Morning Little Schoolgirl\\". In 1967, the Grateful Dead recorded a version in 1967 for their self-titled debut album based on Wells' arrangement. Ron \\"Pigpen\\" McKernan provided the vocal and harmonica, which an AllMusic reviewer called a \\"greasy harp-fuelled take\\". The song was a staple of their early live performances. English group Ten Years After updated the song with a blues-rock arrangement for their 1969 album Ssssh. In an album review, Jim Newsom noted the seven-minute version included \\"reworked lyrics leaving little doubt as to what the singer had in mind for the title character\\".

The band was formed in 1990 in Prague on the base of rock 'n' roll band Matěj Čech. The band performs on many festivals e.g. Zámostí, Rock for People, Sázavafest, United Islands of Prague, Mezi ploty, Colours of Ostrava, etc.List of concerts on the official web pages History Drummer Kalina and saxophone player Belko began to compose music during their student's years in Matěj Čech rock 'n' roll band (founded in 1983). The group combined rock 'n' roll music with playful lyrics typical for their future band Sto zvířat. They split up in 1988. Belko joined Garáž (later Garage) for a brief time. Belko and Kalina reunited in 1990 and formed Sto zvířat.Article about Matěj Čech rock'n'roll band in the Czech Television Bigbít docummentary archive The band's initial concert was held in Malostranská beseda in the autumn of 1990. From the very beginning, the band members were also involved in many artistic activities outside the music, for example in the series of fine arts happenings Pavilon pro Sto zvířat (Pavilion for Sto zvířat). The first album Sto zvířat came out in 1991. It was followed by a series of concerts outside the Czech Republic (France, Germany, Switzerland) and few appearances in television. Despite the status of mainly domestic festival group, Sto zvířat also departed for two American tours in 1996 and 1997. Some of the members became active in theatre during the second half of the 1990s. After a series of personal changes (which continue up to these days) Sto zvířat achieved noticeable success in the mainstream with their album Ty vole, na základní škole... for a major label Sony Music in 2002. An interesting moment in the band's career came with a set of 2 DVDs Jste normální?, which includes parts of two concerts in Palác Akropolis where the band performed together with several well-known Czech and Slovak musicians (e.g. David Koller, Wohnout, Miroslav Žbirka, etc.) and many bonuses mapping their history. Lead singer and author of many songs Petr Ostrouchov left Sto Zvířat in 2006.

Temple legend According to Skanda Purana, Yada Maharishi son of venerated Maharshi Rishyasringa performed penance here to Lord Vishnu as Narasimha. Being pleased with his penance lord appeared before him and manifested himself in five forms: Jwaalaa Narasimha, Gandabheranda Narasimha, Yogananda Narasimha, Ugra Narasimha and Lakshmi Narasimha . Yada Maharishi begged Narasimha to remain on the hill in these forms. For this reason, the Lakshmi-Narasimhadeva temple on the hilltop has deities of Narasimha in all five forms embedded in stone in the main cave. Historically, the temple has followed the Thenkalai tradition of the Vaishnava Agama Shastras as followed in South India. Deities in the temple The temple is in a cave about 12 feet high by 30 feet long, located in back of the temple hall, by the rear pillar. You take a stairway down into the chamber and then toward the back. Jwala Narasimha is in the shape of serpent, while Yogananda Narasimha appears sitting in meditation in yoga pose. You will also see silver deities of Lakshmi-Narasimha, which are quite striking in appearance and lends presence of seeing them. To the right of the temple main door is a Hanuman temple. You'll see a long horizontal gap in the rock just below Hanuman. This is said to be where Gandabheranda Narasimha manifested. This is a very popular temple. It is said that any wish of sincere devotee visiting this temple will be fulfilled. The sanctum sanctorum or Garbhagriha is located in a cave, under a huge slating rock, which covers half the abode. New Yadadri Temple A new temple is being built at the old temple site. For use until the new temple is completed, a temporary temple, Balalayam, was built. The main temple was to open in August 2018 Being delayed by the TRS government, and the entire temple project is expected to be completed by the end of 2019 but never was. =Donations and Renovations= The Chief Minister of Telangana, K. Chandrashekhar Rao initiated the renovation of the temple, and approved a final layout and had been delaying Darshan of the Lord since then for years. Major renovation of the temple is being taken up with a budget of ₹1800 crores. The work started in 2016 and is being executed by Yadadri Temple Development Authority (YTDA). The temple owned 39 kilos of gold and 1,753 tonnes of silver for lining the gopurams and walls in the temple. The centuries-old practice of using lime mortar to join different stone parts is being used. The YTDA acquired around 1900 acres by spending ₹300 crores. The Seventh Nizam of Hyderabad, Mir Osman Ali Khan during his time also passed a grant of Rs.82,825 to this temple. =Sections= The sections of the temple include the main temple, Mukha Mandapam, seven gopurams (domes) with wooden rooves, vratha peetham, Swamy Vari Udyana Vanam, kalyana mandapam, satram etc. The pillars of 12 Alvars (those immersed in God) in the main temple is a significant feature. The temple entrance arch will depict Mahābhūta (the five elements). =Temple architecture= The architecture of the temple is based on Agama Shashtra. The temple is built entirely in stone. The temple was earlier built on 2 acres. After demolishing all structures on the temple hillock, the base for the temple is now 14 acres. =Design= The principal architect is Anand Sai and lead architect P Madhusudhan , chosen for there understanding of the ancient designs based on silpa and Agama principles. The entire temple is built in stone. The stone designs in Yadadri were provided by the chief sthapathi of the temple, Soundara Rajan. =Sculptures= Three types are stones are being used for the temple like Krishna Sila (Purusha Sila) for presiding deities in the sanctum sanctorum; Sthri Sila for deities of Goddesses; and Napusaka Sila for flooring and walls etc. Black granite stone is also used, based on the temple architecture of the Kakatiya Dynasty in Telangana. The black granite stone has tiny pores, that becomes strong and hard when milk, curd, oil and other liquids get into pores, according to shilipis (sculpture experts). Transport Yadagirigutta is about 60 km (approx. 38 miles) from Hyderabad and is well connected by both rail and road. The nearest railway station is Raigiri (about 3 km) for passenger trains. After alighting at Raigiri, one can take an auto rickshaw or tanga. The Hyderabad MMTS - Phase II is planned, to be extended from Ghatkesar to Raigir station, which is 5 km from Yadagirigutta. A new bus stand is built on a 15 acres, as a part of new temple development.

They had met in 1813 on the instigation of General Friedrich Karl von Tettenborn, in order to fight in the War of the Sixth Coalition. This association of volunteers was joined immediately by volunteers from Hamburg's Hanseatic sister cities Bremen and Lübeck. The Legion should not be confused with the Hamburger Bürgermilitär (Hamburg Citizen Militia). During their time of coexistence, the militia restricted itself to ejecting the French garrisons stationed in Hamburg and the other two Hanseatic cities, whereas the Legion also participated in the rest of the campaign under Russian overall command.  History  The Legion defended the Hanseatic cities against Davout's and Vandamme's troops until Tettenborn completed the raising of their sieges in the night of 29/30 May 1813. The Legion and the Hanseatischen Bürgergarden went with Count Tettenborn and in Mecklenburg joined the Allied northern army under Wallmoden's command, later taking part in the fighting in the area around Mecklenburg and in parts of the Duchy of Schleswig. The members of the Legion returned to Bremen, Hamburg and Lübeck on 30 June 1814, and all received the \\"Kriegsdenkmedaille der drei Hansestädte\\" (War-Medal of the three Hanseatic-League cities) in 1815.

Construction started in the 13th century. Ostrowite () is a village in the administrative district of Gmina Golub- Dobrzyń, within Golub-Dobrzyń County, Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship, in north-central Poland. It lies north-west of Golub-Dobrzyń and north-east of Toruń.  History  = Early History and the Church = In 1875 Ostrowite had fifty buildings, including six made of brick and wood - the rest made of the clay, all with thatched roofs. The large church was one of its most important buildings, having been restored in 1739 and 1870. In the early 1900s, however, it was demolished. Only the temple stands today. = Industrialization and the Cemetery = The rapid development of the construction industry in Ostrowite occurred in the years 1918 to 1939, then there already being brick houses and stoves. A more radical change took place 45 years later, and the last 30 years have undergone an explosion of construction. It is now nice, neat, and architecturally quite contemporary. However, there is much left of the almost two hundred years old monuments. One such monument is Ostrowitego. Ostrowitego is small, parish cemetery. The occupations of the parishioners there are still unknown, since 30– 50 years ago, many graves did not have subtitles. In this cemetery are three other monuments that are worth mentioning: two tombs of landowners, one of which was built in the mid-nineteenth century, the second at the end of it. It has been reported that there were four of these tombs, but only these two have survived. There is also a lovely family tomb of Tylmanowa. The most modern is that of Father Anthony Albina. Father Anthony Albina was an especially important priest; he oversaw the building of the church and the Parish House. Thanks to the efforts of the municipalities, money for the maintenance of these tombs has been found. At the moment, the Ostrowickiego cemetery is likely to remain for quite a while. With these tombs is often associated the World War two occupation. In 1940, the German occupiers threw many of the coffins on a pile and burned them. The cemetery was then transformed into a makeshift prison. Many Ostrowite inhabitants were kept there for several days and were often ill-treated before being exported to a prison camp in Inowrocław. = The Old Tavern = Perhaps the oldest - and certainly the longest inhabited - Ostrowitego building is an old tavern. At the beginning of the 1900s it was only an inn. Later on, however, it housed the Lewandowskich family’s butchery, and now is the home of the Smuszkiewiczów family. At the time when Poland was under German occupation, Ostrowite was part of the border between Germany and Russia. During this time the old inn was used for smuggling. Those who were involved in the smuggling of alcohol and spirits used this inn. These were such lucrative jobs that it was the root of many a fortune in the community. However, smuggling was not considered reprehensible. Smugglers filled wooden barrels with one side flat, forming a sort of cake. A strong man took could carry forty liters, weaker men would carry up to twenty. Smugglers had to walk quite a few miles, and even cross the lake Powidzkie. Some made their way up to Mielżyna, because there they would transfer it across the border at the greatest profit. = The Parish House and Father Albina = Another important, but more modern, building is the Parish House, locally known as the organist. After Poland regained its independence in 1918, and censorship ceased, a place where the cultural life of the municipalities and the parish could flourish was greatly needed. On the initiative of the aforementioned parish priest, Father Albina, the construction of the house began. It was to be established as the home of the fire brigade, the organists, and as a shelter for those who had no place to live. With great commitment to the parish community, the house was built in the early 1920s. It was built with the remnants of building materials made available from the demolition of the larch church. In the house, as planned, was the headquarters of the fire brigade, and the ground floor was an auditorium where civil life flourished. It also held content of a both religious and secular nature, as well as extravagant balls and dances. This house contains thick larch beams of up hundreds of years old, thanks to the material from the church, and more recently constructed benches. For 39 years this house was the center of cultural and civic community. = Aviation and the Metal Tower = An important, though perhaps less spectacular, monument is the metal tower, a building that is perhaps unique in the country. Modern Ostrowicz (citizens of Ostrowite) know little about it, and when asked about its origin, generally say it was a vantage point for firefighters. In fact, the tower is connected with aviation. In the 1930s, there was rapid development of aviation communication and navigation equipment. The number of passenger aircraft at that time was rather low, and there was no radar or radar equipment. It was most difficult to fly at night. To deal with this, from the Polish - German border to Warsaw a whole chain of towers was created, acting as lighthouses for air navigation.to the left of Ostrowite the tower was in the vicinity of Nekla, and in the east it was at Lubstowie. A generator on top of the tower was mounted movable reflector. Apparently, each of the towers used a different type of signal. In Ostrowite after dark, a lantern began to turn. It was probably dismantled by Germany during the occupation. However, there is the possibility that it was taken apart for scrap. This is an unusual monument, perhaps unique in all of Poland.Garsztka, Stanisław. Poland. Parish of Ostrowite. Interesting Facts. Ostrowite: , 2007. Web. .
