Contrary to the popular belief, this village is not ethnically Kurdish. Majority of the dwellers are descendants of a Turkish tribe popularly known as Karakecililer who were domiciled by Seljuk commander Ertugrul Gazi after 1071. The village is within 20 kilometers distance to Adiyaman Province's city center. Şerefli is surrounded by Elciler, Tepecik, Yaylakonak, Kusakli, and Gunesli villages. The village is perched on the periphery of a tor which is locally known as Sarikaya, literally translating to English as yellow rock. Şerefli's west boundaries are marked by a fresh water stream known as Tilkihan brook'. Serefli village entrance  Geography  Akdag mountain, which is within Toros mountain systems, stretches from southwest to north around Şerefli village. Land forms are rippled degrassively from Sarikaya Tor located on the north to the agricultural planes on the south. Almost each height and valley has a name attributed by local dwellers. The hill which is located on the north east (coordinates 37.805089, 38.088731) is known as 'Kulluk Tepe' (kulluk is a local hat worn by females), the fertile valley located on the southeast is known as Cavurd (Coordinates 37°47'45.2\\"N 38°05'24.7\\"E), agricultural plantations on the north is known as Kayanin Onu (37°48'39.3\\"N 38°04'43.5\\"E), flat fields located on the south are known as Duz (37°48'00.6\\"N 38°04'47.9\\"E). There are also allegorical place names named after local historical figures such as Mışo'nun Cukuru. Heights surrounding Serefli village's North = Vegetation = Oak trees are sporadically existent at relatively higher elevations. Majority of the elevated locations have been subject to water and land erosion. Due to the long and dry summer seasons, grasslands and forest vegetation are at minute amount. Lands that are uncultivated are covered by wilding and scrub. Aquatic plants grow in In reeds and marshy places. Some of these aquatic plants like yarpuz, sirim, pincar are edible and regularly picked by locals every spring. Thorn apples, rose hips, turpentine trees, wild pears grow naturally without anthropogenic involvement. = Wild Animals = Falcons, hawks, owls, partridges, quails, sparrows, pigeons, crows are primary bird species. Capturing and petting partridges is a common hobby among local men. Hunting partridges and quails for dietary purposes is also popular. Sarikaya Tor hosts most of these bird species as its steep and rocky structure acts as a safe heaven. Local men do not welcome strangers with hunting purposes. Serefli people can get territorial and they even often abstain from hunting on a land owned by a different person. The occurrences of attempted homicides and bodily harms due to territorial disputes are not uncommon. Rabbits, foxes, weasels are other wild animals living in the village's habitat. = Climate = Serefli village's summer weather trend can be classified as Csa on Koopen-Geiger climate classification system. It has long and dry summers. After the construction of Atatürk Dam, the increasing humidity levels likened the region's climate to Mediterranean climate. A considerable amount of precipitation is observed in cold winter months. August is the driest time of the year with a 1 mm average rain fall. 135 mm rainfall rate makes Decembers the month with the highest precipitation rate. July is the hottest month with an average 30.2 °C. An average temperature of 4.3 °C qualifies Januaries as the coldest month. The annual average temperature is 25.9 °C.  Agriculture  Serefli has fertile lands. The primary agricultural activity was tobacco cultivation until Turkish government imposed quota on tobacco harvests. The quota restrictions restrained the dweller's main income source dramatically, which caused a migration wave to cities in a pursuit of employment chances. Fig, grape, apple, pistachio, wheat, lentil, chick pea, barley are primary products harvested by Serefli farmers.  History  The village has been known as Şerefli since the foundation of Ottoman Empire (1259). The founders of the village were Turkic people belonging to Amini group of Karakecililer Turkmen Tribe who moved into the region with Seljuk forays. The neighboring village, Kizilhisar, was also founded by Amini group of Karakecililer Turkmen Tribe. The village community is very well known for their loyalty to governments. As traditionally observed in Turkmen tribes, they have always unconditionally accepted and supported the central governments. The Ottoman Empire used this Turkmen village as an outpost to keep the other villages populated by the Kurds and other minorities under surveillance and control. Likewise, the village has maintained its firm stand against Kurdish separatist organization PKK since 1980. Turkish Army recruited the village's men as village guards in an effort to reinforce the army's anti-PKK campaign in the region. PKK threatened the village and plotted attacks for a couple of times. The Kurdish separatists considered Serefli village as a hostile base weakening their foothold in the region. Geographical and strategical knowledge of Serefli village guards boosted Turkish Armed Force's operations against the PKK which is listed as a terrorist organization by international authorities. PKK launched a night raid targeting the houses of village mukhtar (headman), mukhtar's brother, and the chief of village guards in the spring of 1991. Those targeted three households were accommodated by women, children, and civilians. The attacking PKK militants opened a barrage of gunfire by their AK47s, machine guns and sidearms. A hand grenade thrown into a house did not detonate. The assailants also attempted to launch a rocket propelled grenade but the reacting village guard's suppressive fire stopped them. PKK terrorists fled using the darkness of night as cover. One civilian woman was killed by PKK fire. Serefli village is also known for its people's willingness to enlist in Turkish Armed Forces. Majority of Serefli men choose military and law enforcing careers. In Turkmen culture, one's forsaking his life for his country is considered to be holy, which is also known as martyrdom. Turkish Government entitles martyr title to the servicemen killed during military service. Specialist Sergeant Hakki Yildiz, a local Serefli man who chose military career, was entitled as martyr after he lost his life in a firefight against PKK in Bingol-Genc. Serefli people take pride in their patriotism and state loyalty despite the threats and pressure from surrounding ethnic fractions.  Politics  Serefli ballot boxes usually yield to center-right parties. The ruling political party, AKP, has received the majority of the votes in elections since 2003. ANAP, MHP, DYP, and DP were the other popular political parties before AKP. Majority of Serefli dwellers supported the military coup done by General Kenan Evren on 12 September 1982. Votes for liberal democrat parties and pro-Kurdish parties are not uncommon, either.  Transport  Adiyaman province is served by an airport and a coach station. Shuttle buses connect Serefli village with Adiyaman Province's city center.

His body was partly consumed by a fire likely driven by the wick effect, which commonly occurs near, and is aided by, an open fireplace. His death was recorded as \\"spontaneous combustion\\" by the coroner. Incident and Inquest In the early hours of 22 December 2010, Faherty's neighbour, Mr Mannion, was awakened by the sound of his smoke alarm. Mannion went outside to find heavy smoke coming from Faherty's house. Getting no answer from Faherty's house, he roused local residents and the Gardaí and the fire brigade was called. Faherty's home was searched by forensic experts from the Gardaí and the fire service. Faherty's body had been found lying on his back with his head closest to an open fireplace. The fire had been entirely confined to the sitting room and the only damage found was to the totally burnt body, the ceiling above and the floor beneath him. No trace of any accelerants was found and there was nothing to suggest foul play had taken place. Assistant chief fire officer Gerry O'Malley told the inquest into the death that after a thorough investigation, fire officers were satisfied that the open fire was not the cause of the blaze which led to Faherty's death. A post-mortem carried out by pathologist Grace Callagy noted that Faherty had suffered from Type 2 diabetes and hypertension but had not died from heart failure. Callagy concluded that \\"The extensive nature of the burns sustained precludes determining the precise cause of death.\\" In September 2011, the west Galway coroner, Dr Ciaran McLoughlin, informed the inquiry into the death that he searched medical literature to determine the cause of death. The coroner referred to Professor Bernard Knight's book on forensic pathology, which states that a high number of alleged incidents of spontaneous human combustion had taken place near an open fireplace or chimney. The coroner subsequently made a statement to an inquiry: \\"This fire was thoroughly investigated and I'm left with the conclusion that this fits into the category of spontaneous human combustion, for which there is no adequate explanation.\\" Possible causes Mike Green, a retired professor of pathology, related one similar case in his career, but would not himself use the term spontaneous combustion. He believed there had to be some source of ignition, a cigarette or ember from a fire. The source of the ignition is subsequently lost as the body burns. Green surmised that the circumstances surrounding the death of Michael Faherty were very similar to other possible cases. Green also dismissed any explanations centred on divine intervention. Benjamin Radford, science writer and deputy editor of the science magazine Skeptical Inquirer, contends, \\"Faherty's case may not be as mysterious as it looks. There was, after all, an open fire close to his burned body. It seems likely that a spark or ember might have popped from the fire onto his clothing, and caught his clothing on fire. It's not clear why the coroner conclusively ruled this explanation out.\\" Radford also casts doubt on the plausibility of spontaneous human combustion, \\"If SHC is a real phenomenon (and not the result of an elderly or infirm person being too close to a flame source), why doesn't it happen more often?\\" References Category:1934 births Category:2010 deaths Category:2010 in Ireland Category:Accidental deaths in the Republic of Ireland Faherty, Michael Category:Deaths from fire Category:History of Galway (city) Category:Spontaneous human combustion ","title":"Death of Michael Faherty"},{"id":"33185415","text":"Aktepe is a village in the District of Besni, Adıyaman Province, Turkey.

The report assessed the environmental impact of several activities, including food production. Summary The report assessed the impact of economic activities on the environment. It identified that the most critical impacts are related to ecosystem health, human health and resource depletion. From a combined production, consumption and materials perspective, the authors found that the production of food and all processes involving fossil fuels had the greatest impacts. Animal products caused more damage than producing construction minerals such as sand or cement, plastics or metals. Currently, more than half the world's crops are used to feed animals. In America, more than one-third of the fossil fuels produced are used to raise animals for food. The authors explained that Western dietary preferences for meat would be unsustainable as the world population rose to the forecast 9.1 billion by 2050. Demand for meat is expected to double by this date; meat consumption is steadily rising in countries such as China that once followed more sustainable, vegetable-based diets. According to the report: \\"Impacts from agriculture are expected to increase substantially due to population growth, increasing consumption of animal products. Unlike fossil fuels, it is difficult to look for alternatives: people have to eat. A substantial reduction of impacts would only be possible with a substantial worldwide diet change, away from animal products.\\" Role of the IRP The IRP provides independent scientific assessments and expert advice on a variety of areas, including: *the volume of selected raw material reserves and how efficiently these resources are being used *the lifecycle-long environmental impacts of products and services created and consumed around the globe *options to meet human and economic needs with fewer or cleaner resources.

He served in the Federation Council of Russia, from 2001 to 2015. He was its acting Chairman for four months in 2011. As of July 2018, he is a deputy governor of the Central Bank of Russia. Torshin is from and represented Mari El Republic in parliament. Allegations have been made about his involvement with the Taganskaya Gang. Torshin denied the allegations.РИА Новости: Центробанк прокомментировал статью Bloomberg о Торшине. 13:47 09.08.2016 Biography He graduated from the All-Union Legal Correspondence Institute with a degree in law in 1978. From 1990 to 1991 he was an employee of the department for relations with socio-political organizations of the apparatus of the CPSU Central Committee. From 1995 to 1998 he was the State Secretary of the Bank of Russia, was responsible for interaction with government bodies, public organizations and the media. In 1998, he assumed the authority of a representative of the government of the Russian Federation in the State Duma in the rank of deputy head of the government apparatus. From 1999 to 2001, he worked as Deputy General Director – State Secretary of the State Corporation \\"Agency for Restructuring Credit Organizations\\". In January 2001, Alexander Torshin becomes a member of the Federation Council from the government of the Russian Republic of Mari El. In January 2002, he was appointed deputy chairman of the Federation Council. In August 2004, he joined the ranks of the party \\"United Russia\\". In September 2008, Torshin became the first deputy chairman of the Federation Council. From May 18 to September 21, 2011, served as chairman of the Federation Council. He served in the Federation Council of Russia, the upper house of the Russian parliament, from 2001 to 2015, and as its acting Chairman for four months in 2011. Torshin, originating from the Mari El Republic, a republic in Russia, is a leading figure in the ruling United Russia party. There have also been accusations made that he is a leading figure within the Russian mafia. Republican Dana Rohrabacher called Torshin \\"sort of the conservatives' favorite Russian\\". Career Torshin and Valentina Matviyenko in 2013 Some time between 1995 and 1998, Torshin was State Secretary of the Central Bank of Russia. Torshin entered the Federation Council of Russia in 2001. He became the acting chairman for the succeeding Sergey Mironov on May 19, 2011, after Mironov was ousted by the majority United Russia in the Council. Torshin remained as acting chairman until the election of Valentina Matviyenko also from the United Russia Party. She assumed her responsibilities on September 21, 2011. He remained in the Federation Council until 2015. Torshin was appointed the deputy head of the Central Bank of Russia in 2015 and suddenly retired in 2018. Allegations in Spain In 2016, a Spanish investigation connected Torshin with Alexander Romanov, the leader of the Taganskaya Gang, who had been arrested in Spain and sentenced to four years in prison in May 2016 for illegal transactions. Torshin was allegedly involved in money laundering for the gang. According to Spanish police, he gave instructions to members of the Gang on laundering, through banks and real estate in Spain. They concluded that in the structure of the organized criminal group, Torshin \\"stood higher\\" than Romanov. As a result of wiretapping, which took place several months before the arrest of Romanov, Spanish intelligence agencies concluded that Romanov was following financial orders from Torshin, and that Torshin himself could be the manager of the assets of the gang. Romanov‘s properties in Spain, 80% of which Spanish police believe belong to Torshin, have been confiscated. Spanish police had planned to arrest Torshin in 2013 when he arrived in Mallorca for a friend's birthday party, but he did not arrive. Spanish police speculated he might have been tipped off by Russian authorities. In 2018, wiretappings from the Spanish police were handed over to the FBI. When asked if this had any relationship with politics in the US, José Grinda, a Spanish prosecutor, replied \\"Mr. Trump's son should be concerned.\\" Involvement in U.S. politics Torshin, and his assistant (sometimes described as his associate or representative) Maria Butina, have established a cooperative relationship between United States-based National Rifle Association (NRA) and the Russian-based \\"\\" which Butina founded in 2011. Torshin has been attending NRA annual meetings in the United States since at least 2011. Following the 2011 meeting then NRA President David Keene expressed his support for Torshin's \\"endeavors\\" and extended an invitation to the 2012 meeting. Torshin has attended every NRA annual meeting between 2012 and 2016, occasionally with Butina, and has met every NRA president since 2012. Torshin has tweeted that he and Butina are the only two Russians he knows of who are lifetime NRA members. Butina and Torshin attended the 2014 NRA annual meeting as special guests of former NRA president Keene. Torshin has been a subject of an investigation by the Senate Intelligence Committee into Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections. In January 2018, McClatchyDC reported that Robert Mueller's Special Counsel investigation is pursuing allegations that Torshin has links to Russian organized crime, and laundered money from the Russian government to the NRA to benefit Trump's campaign. Torshin is also the subject of a probe by the Federal Bureau of Investigation into whether the Russian government attempted to illegally funnel money to the NRA in order to help Trump win the presidency. On May 16, 2018, the Senate Intelligence Committee released a reporthttps://www.feinstein.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/b/3/b3e29bc4-8afd-4145-85d9-618dcad4a133/D069EF11DC3784A6D073B097E720572E.2018.05.15-transcript- release-findings-9-am.pdf stating it had obtained \\"a number of documents that suggest the Kremlin used the National Rifle Association as a means of accessing and assisting Mr. Trump and his campaign\\" through Torshin and Butina, and that \\"The Kremlin may also have used the NRA to secretly fund Mr. Trump's campaign.\\" Most of that money was spent by an arm of the NRA that is not required to disclose its donors. In April 2018, the United States Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control imposed sanctions on 23 Russian nationals, including Torshin, whose assets in the United States were frozen and whose entry into the United States barred, besides being subject to other financial disabilities. The New York Times reported on July 17, 2018 that Torshin was scheduled to visit the White House in 2017, but the meeting was canceled after a national security aide noted Torshin was under investigation by Spanish authorities for money laundering.

The First 100 Years, 1866-1966.\\" by Stephen Mills in Gloucestershire Society for Industrial Archaeology Journal, 1992, pp. 8-17. was a firm of hydraulic engineers who were an important part of the manufacturing sector in Gloucester until the 1990s.\\"Industrial heritage was a huge apprentice draw\\" by Kevin George in The Citizen, Saturday 17 September 2011. Started by two Lancashire men, Samuel Fielding (died 1874) and James Platt, the firm exploited the portable hydraulic rivetting technology of Ralph Hart Tweddell to build a business that exported hydraulic machinery worldwide. Apart from the wide range of items made, the firm was particularly noted for the quality and long-life of their products. James Platt was also a director of the Gloucester Railway Carriage and Wagon Company.\\"GLOUCESTER RAILWAY CARRIAGE AND WAGON COMPANY\\" in The Birmingham Daily Post, 17 August 1889, Issue 9718, p. 6. First orders The first orders were for small engineering machines and components but the firm quickly expanded into bigger items. They produced an iron seagoing steamer in 1868 and in 1870 they produced the steam boat S.S. Sabrina for the Gloucester & Berkeley Canal Co National Historic Ships. that was used on the canal between Gloucester and Sharpness. The Sabrina is still in use on the Thames. Between 1873 and 1875 they converted a number of broad gauge locomotives for stationary duties at Llanharon Colliery and in 1880 they built a bridge across the Severn at Gloucester Docks, adjacent to the North Warehouse, which was not replaced until 1962. The Tweddell System Tweddell's 150-Ton Rivetting Machine (1885), made by Fielding & Platt.The Engineer, Vol. 60 (1885), p. 88. In 1871 the firm was approached by the engineer Ralph Tweddell to manufacture his portable hydraulic riveter and it was the firm's exploitation of the Tweddell System that enabled them to become pre-eminent in the field of portable hydraulic riveting. The riveter was soon being exported worldwide and it was used in the construction of sewage mains in Sydney, Australia (1892) and in building the Forth Bridge (1890). 1870s - 1890s In 1874 Samuel Fielding died and his two sons, James and John Fielding, became joint junior partners with James Platt. The company was expanding rapidly at this time, building new equipment and registering patents. The firm built furnaces, hydraulic presses, travelling cranes, and machinery for processing girders. In 1874 they made a 900 ton flanging press. The firm won awards for its equipment at Philadelphia (1876), Paris (1878) and London (1880). A wide range of steam and oil engines were developed. The firm worked on the construction of Blackpool Tower.Stephan Mills: Fielding & Platt, An innovative Gloucester engineering company. The first 100 Years, 1866–1966, S. 11 The twentieth century In 1902 Fielding & Platt manufactured the first vacuum cleaner, designed by Hubert Cecil Booth, also of Gloucester. The company was acquired by Heenan & Froude in 1939. During World War II the factory manufactured munitions and parts for Hurricanes and Spitfires. Many more women worked for the company as many of the men had been called up for military service.

Young plants and coppice regrowth have leaves arranged in opposite pairs, linear to narrow lance-shaped leaves up to long and wide. They are the same glossy green colour on both sides. Adult leaves are narrow lance-shaped, long and wide, the same glossy green on both sides. There is a small point or hook on the end of the leaves. The flower buds are arranged in groups of three to seven, the groups on a peduncle long and the individual flowers a pedicel long. The mature buds are oval to club-shaped, long and wide with a conical operculum that has a small point on its top. Flowering occurs between October and March and the flowers are white. The fruit is an urn-shaped or barrel-shaped capsule long and wide on a pedicel long. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus apiculata was first formally described in 1902 by Richard Thomas Baker and Henry George Smith who published the description in a paper entitled A research on the eucalypts : especially in regard to their essential oils. The specific epithet (apiculata) is a Latin word meaning \\"apiculate\\", referring to the leaves. Distribution and habitat The narrow-leaved mallee ash is a rare species with a restricted distribution between Linden and Berrima where it grows in mallee shrubland.

(7 April 1865 in Milhow, Mullingar, County Westmeath, Ireland – 4 April 1928 in Orange, New South Wales), an Australian suffragan bishop, was the fourth Bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Bathurst, New South Wales. O'Farrell was consecrated by the Apostolic Delegate, Archbishop Cattaneo in 1920 and served until his death in 1928. O'Farrell was the first Vincentian bishop in Australia. Early years and background Educated at St. Finian's College, Navan, O'Farrell came from a devout religious family that included two sisters who became Sisters of Mercy, and three of his brothers became priests, two of whom migrated to Australia and worked as priests in the Archdiocese of Sydney. O'Farrell studied for the priesthood at St Patrick's Seminary, Maynooth, and he was ordained priest on 23 March 1887. He joined the Vincentians following Ordination. While at Maynooth, he studied with Daniel Mannix, who later became Archbishop of Melbourne. O'Farrell initially served as a missionary in Sheffield, England, before returning to Ireland where he became the Professor of Ecclesiastical History and of Higher Mathematics and Physics at All Hallows College in Dublin; subsequently taking up a post as Professor of Moral Theology at the Irish College in Paris. O'Farrell returned to Ireland in 1903 and for the next ten years conducted missions and retreats based from the Vincentian Parish at Phibsboro, in Dublin. Arriving in Sydney in 1913, O'Farrell took up residence at St Vincent's, Ashfield with the intention of conducting mission work. However, he was asked to act as the Spiritual Director of the two diocesan seminaries, firstly at St Columba's College, Springwood, and later at St Patrick's College, Manly. By 1915, O'Farrell had become the Vice Rector at St John's College within The University of Sydney. Roman Catholic Bishop of Bathurst At 55-years of age, O'Farrell was elected Bishop of Bathurst on 16 June 1920, some ten months after the death of his predecessor. His election was considered a surprise by some as O'Farrell had never served as a parish priest in Australia, nor held the office of Superior in his own community, or, it would seem, any administrative position other than that of Vice Rector at St John's. O'Farrell was consecrated as bishop in St Michael and St John's Cathedral, Bathurst by the Apostolic Delegate, Archbishop Cattaneo on 30 November 1920. After an expansionist period under Bishop Dunne, O'Farrell is accredited with placing the diocese on a firm financial and administrative footing. Immediately after his consecration, an audit of St Stanislaus' College, Bathurst was conducted. The auditor's report was critical of the lack of proper book-keeping. Under the guidance of Fr John Hall, within three years a subsequent auditor's report had seen a significant improvement. O'Farrell acquired Hathrop, a palatial residence in Bathurst and established St Vincent's Hospital in 1922 as \\"an institution catering especially for the sick poor.\\" In 1926, he brought the Daughters of Charity from England to Bathurst and entrusted them with the former Patrician Brothers novitiate in Orange and established a Boys’ Orphanage, the first work of the Daughters in Australia. He also presided over extensions to St Joseph's Orphanage in Bathurst, a new church at Kandos, improvements to other churches, and new convents in Borenore, Forest Reefs, Millthorpe and Portland. O'Farrell is also credited with the growth of the Society of Saint Vincent de Paul in the diocese, with congregations at Bathurst, Portland, Orange, Wellington, Cowra, Mudgee, Canowindra, Gulgong, Coonamble and Dubbo. O'Farrell also supported the university education, board and lodging of several of the Sisters of St Joseph to gain degrees in education and arts at The University of Sydney. Under his bishopship, he was able to recruit postulants for the two communities of religious sisters whose work was predominantly in education: the Sisters of St Joseph and the Sisters of Mercy. However, O'Farrell was not without his critics, most notably the Patrician Brothers who felt that he was more favourably inclined towards the Vincentians at St Stanislaus’ College. When the Patrician Brothers opened a boarding section attached to the parish school in Dubbo in 1921, O'Farrell claimed that the Brothers failed to teach the prescribed syllabus, which was the same syllabus as that laid down for the state schools. When a summer school of teachers was organised by O'Farrell with attendees from the Department in Public Instruction, the Brothers made a cursory appearance. Following the commissioning of a report that showed less than satisfactory education and teaching performance, O'Farrell charged the Brothers with incompetence and demanded in November 1924 that they leave the diocese. Despite an appeal to Rome, the Brothers lost and their schools were taken over by the De La Salle Brothers and their novitiate in Orange became Croagh Patrick Orphanage. As bishop, O'Farrell led a relatively private life, with the exception of a public battle with the Anglican Bishop of Bathurst, Dr George Long. The battle became known as the Ne Temere debate, taking its name from the 1908 decree that imposed the obligation that a Catholic marry before a priest, even when not marrying another Catholic. Failure to do so rendered that marriage invalid in the eyes of the Catholic Church. The consequence was that the Catholic Church regarded any children born of the marriage to be illegitimate. Aware that his health was failing, O'Farrell travelled to Rome for the Holy Year celebrations in 1925, taking his administrator, Father John Norton with him. While there, O'Farrell arranged to have Norton consecrated a Bishop with right of succession. O'Farrell returned to Australia in ill-health and died in Orange Presbytery on 4 April 1928. He was buried from St Michale and St John's Cathedral in the Catholic section of the Bathurst cemetery. O'Farrell left an estate of £2,896 to his successors for charitable purposes in New South Wales.

Prior to resignation, his rank was First Police Brigadier which is known as 'Briptu' in Bahasa Indonesia which is an abbreviation of Brigadir Polisi Satu. Kamaru catapulted into stardom after a video of him singing \\"Chaiyya Chaiyya\\" by A.R.Rahman while in uniform went viral in early April 2011 in YouTube. He recently signed a billion rupiah (US$113,000) recording contract. Biography Kamaru was born in Gorontalo, Gorontalo, Indonesia on 27 November 1985. He is the youngest of nine children born to Idris Kamaru and Halima Marthius. As a child he enjoyed singing. He eventually joined the Mobile Brigade, rising to the rank of First Brigadier. =Celebrity= Kamaru became famous after a video of him in uniform lip-synching \\"Chaiyya Chaiyya\\" and imitating Shahrukh Khan while on duty at a guard post was uploaded to YouTube on 29 March 2011. Bagus BT Saragih of The Jakarta Post notes that his hand movements are like those used by Indian actors, while the accuracy of his lip-synching indicates that he had memorized the lyrics. The video was a hit on YouTube, with viewers considering his actions \\"perfectly\\" like Khan's in Dil Se.., and eventually becoming a meme, \\"catapulting\\" Kamaru to fame. He began recording his first single, \\"Cinta Farhat\\" (\\"Farhat's Love\\"), in April of that year. As a result of his newfound celebrity, Kamaru became a guest on Opera Van Java and Bukan Empat Mata, hosted by Tukul Arwana. He also received a film and commercial offer, which were rejected by the police department; according to a spokesman for the department, Kamaru was not ready and would have to attend film school before acting. He also received a full legal scholarship from Bung Karno University in Jakarta, as well as a new motorcycle and a house. However, the performing schedule detracted from his duties. As a result, on 7 July 2011 he was taken from the set of Hitam Putih, where he was filming a skit, by twenty people. Although first reported to be a kidnapping, it was later revealed that it had been officers of the Bureau of Professionalism and Security Affairs who had taken him as he had not secured permission to be on the show. Kamaru has accepted a billion rupiah (US$113,000) contract offer from the mobile content developer Falcon Interactive. The terms of the contract require him to produce a single album; if he acts in a movie, he will receive another billion. That same month he tendered his resignation from the Indonesian National Police, citing the difficulty in finding time to perform; according to his mother, he had been arrested several times for performing \\"on the sidelines of his duty\\". After the Gorontalo police refused to accept his resignation, he went to the national police headquarters in Jakarta, where he was told that he could only resign if he repaid the cost of his training, as he had signed on for a ten- year contract; a spokesman for the police stated that the police force was \\"not like a [bus] shelter where people can just come and go whenever they want\\". The police later withdrew the demand. In order to create a new, more modern image, in April 2012 Norman Kamaru initial rap single 'Forget It' (Lupa-kan) and collaborate with rapper Saykoji. Reception Initially the police department intended to punish Kamaru for his dancing, calling his behaviour \\"undisciplined and childish\\" as well as \\"unethical\\", noting that police officers should be ever vigilant when on duty. After performing for his superiors and mounting public support, the police relented, deciding instead to \\"channel his talents\\". In response to the threatened police sanctions, Kamaru received popular support. Noted singer and songwriter Glenn Fredly tweeted that the police should instead punish those who \\"call themselves singers but are unable to lip-sync as cool as Norman\\", while legislator Eva Kusuma Sundari noted that actions like Kamaru's were good public relations for the police. However, Alexia Cahyaningtyas of The Jakarta Globe, called it \\"embarrassing\\" that \\"a lip-syncing policeman [was] considered first-class entertainment\\". Salingsilang.com, which records trends on Twitter, reported that Kamaru was the biggest trending topic on Twitter in Indonesia during the first half of 2011, beating Justin Bieber and the death of Osama bin Laden. The original upload was viewed 200,000 times in its first week and by 5 April it had been \\"liked\\" 160,000 times; it was only \\"disliked\\" 32 times in the same period.

The group runs Pinewood Studios and Shepperton Studios in the UK and Pinewood Toronto Studios in Canada, Pinewood Indomina Studios in the Dominican Republic, Pinewood Studio Berlin in Germany, Pinewood Iskandar Malaysia Studios in Malaysia, and until 2019 it had a controlling stake in Pinewood Atlanta Studios in the US. To date over 1,500 productions have used facilities or services provided by Pinewood Group. History =Formation and expansion= The Pinewood Studios Group was formed by merger of Pinewood and Shepperton Studios at the start of the new millennium. The company floated on the London Stock Exchange in 2004 as Pinewood Shepperton Plc. In 2005, Teddington Studios was purchased by the Group. A period of rapid international expansion began in 2009 when The Pinewood Studios Group took over sales and marketing of what was then Filmport (now Pinewood Toronto Studios). Then within three months, three new ventures were announced, two being completely new studio complexes. The first was Pinewood Iskandar Malaysia Studios in partnership with Khazanah Nasional Berhad (the investment holding arm of the Government of Malaysia). Next came the announcement of Pinewood Studio Berlin. Then in February 2011 the company announced that it was planning to open a 35-acre film and television studio in the Dominican Republic. Later in 2011, The Peel Group acquired a controlling 71% interest in the company for £96 million. = Project Pinewood = In November 2007, Pinewood announced a £200m expansion plan, known as Project Pinewood. When built the development will see replicas of streetscapes and zones replicating locations from the UK, Europe and the USA. Planned zones include a college campus, Amsterdam, modern European housing, Venice, Lake Como, Paris, an Amphitheatre, Prague, West coast American housing, warehousing and downtown New York sets, Chicago, Vienna, a castle, a UK canal, Chinatown and a London street market built. In addition it will also be used as residential housing, with the proposed creative community, expected to be in the region of 2000 and 2250, being integrated with the film locations. Job creation is also a key part of the plan, helping to boost the economy of both the region and the nation as a whole. An application for planning permission was formally submitted in June 2009. However, the planning application was rejected by South Bucks District Council in October 2009, following a prolonged opposition campaign by local residents, who formed a \\"Stop Project Pinewood\\" group. Pinewood have since appealed the decision and a public inquiry commenced on 5 April 2011. In June 2014 Pinewood won its appeal and began developing the expansion. =Recent developments= In February 2015, the name of the company changed from Pinewood Shepperton plc to Pinewood Group plc. In June 2015, The Peel Group reduced its stake in the company to 39%. In February 2016, the group confirmed it was considering options for its business, including a possible sale. In July 2016, its two largest shareholders, Goodweather Investment Management owned by The Peel Group and Warren James Holdings agreed to sell their respective holdings to Aermont Capital. Pinewood agreed to the £323 million deal in August 2016, which would take the group private. The sale was completed on 4 October 2016, and the company delisted from the London Stock Exchange the following day. Operations =United Kingdom= Pinewood Studios The 007 Stage at Pinewood Studios in 2006, prior to rebuilding. Pinewood Studios is probably most famous for its connection with the James Bond film series. It has also been the home for many productions over the years, large and the small. With a total of seventeen stages (including the 007 Stage, Underwater Stage and TV studios), Pinewood is the UK's largest and most prolific studio. Pinewood Studio Wales Pinewood Studio Wales opened in north-east Cardiff in January 2015. Television series The Bastard Executioner and Sherlock have been filmed there. Shepperton Studios Shepperton Studios is often described as the home for independent filmmaking in the UK but it has also been used for the production of a number of blockbuster films including Captain America: The First Avenger, which used eight of the fifteen stages at Shepperton. Teddington Studios Teddington Studios was a specialist television studio complex on the banks of the River Thames. It had eight television studios ranging from 383 sq ft to 8,891 sq ft. The first UK sitcom to be shot in high definition, The Green Green Grass was filmed at Teddington Studios. The studios closed in 2014 and the site cleared for residential revelopement. Pinewood Films In 2011, The Pinewood Studios Group created Pinewood Films to help fund and provide facilities to independent British films with budgets of approximately £2million. Pinewood Films would invest equity up to 20% per film with the intention to support four films each year. The first film to receive funding is A Fantastic Fear of Everything starring Simon Pegg. The film was shot at Shepperton Studios. =Elsewhere= Pinewood Toronto Studios Pinewood Toronto Studios Pinewood Toronto Studios is a major film and television studio complex in Toronto.

Such purposes include all political contests for voting by citizens, especially the election campaigns for various public offices that are run by parties and candidates. Moreover, all modern democracies operate a variety of permanent party organizations, e.g. the Democratic National Committee and the Republican National Committee in the United States or the Conservative Central Office and the Labour headquarters (\\"John Smith House\\", \\"Millbank Tower\\") in the United Kingdom. The annual budgets of such organizations will have to be considered as costs of political competition as well. In Europe the allied term \\"party finance\\" is frequently used. It refers only to funds that are raised and spent in order to influence the outcome of some sort of party competition. Whether to include other political purposes, e.g. public relation campaigns by lobby groups, is still an unresolved issue.Nassmacher, Karl- Heinz, The Funding of party competition. Baden-Baden: Nomos Verlag, 2009, p. 31. Even a limited range of political purposes (campaign and party activity) indicates that the term \\"campaign funds\\" (used as subject heading in Library of Congress cataloguing) see http://catalog.loc.gov is too narrow to cover all funds that are deployed in the political process. Expenses for politics Political expenses can be caused by * election campaigns run by candidates, candidate committees, interest groups or political parties, * contests for nomination or re-selection of parliamentary candidates, * training activities for party activists,Examples from the 1976–80 election cycle are given by Adamany, David, 'Political parties in the 1980s'.

Chatham, NJ: Chatham House, 1984, pp. 80–81, 89. officeholders or candidates, * policy development by parties or party related bodies, * current operations of party organizations at the national, regional or local level and * efforts to educate citizens with regard to popular initiatives, ballot issues or referendums. Most frequently and in most countries the organizations that raise and spend money for political purposes are parties (headquarters, branches and chapters). Party headquarters spend on public relations, mass media (including billboards), the expertise of consultants and offices. Local party chapters (e.g. constituency or riding associations), which rely on volunteers (party activists), cover telecommunication and mail charges as well as rent and heating for storefront offices, which they use as their centers of political activity.R. Kenneth Carty, Canadian Political Parties in the Constituencies. Toronto: Dundurn Press, 1991, is an unmatched (nationwide) case study of local party organizations. Sources of funds Political revenue may be collected from small donors or individual citizens (\\"grassroots fundraising\\"), who make small contributions or pay party membership dues; wealthy individuals; organizations including businesses, interest groups, professional organizations and trade unions; assessments of officeholders (called the \\"party tax\\"); government subsidies; or generally illegal activities including graft, buying access to politicians, offices, honors or titles, extortion of wealthy people and influence peddling). G. M. Gidlund has classified the available options of fund-raising by three categories: Membership, plutocratic and public funding.Gidlund, Gullan M., Partistöd (in Swedish with an English summary). Umea: CWK Gleerup, 1983, pp. 55, 353. As the relevance of signed-up party members and their dues The only example documented in Paul Webb, David M. Farrell and Ian Holliday (eds.), Political Parties in Advanced Industrial Democracies. Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press, 2002, p. 127, is France. For details from other countries see Richard S. Katz and Peter Mair, Party organizations – a data handbook. London: Sage Publications, 1992. can vary among the democracies the terms grassroots fundraising, plutocratic finance and public funding may offer a more adequate general framework. =Grassroots fundraising= Many believe that as a normative concept popular government (vulgo democracy) should require that the people at large cover the costs of their democracy. However, this can only be done on a voluntary basis, because all forms of political participation in a democracy are voluntary in principle. At election times many people abstain from voting. Likewise at all times the majority of citizens also abstains from donating to political coffers. Nonetheless, many believe that broad fundraising from small donors is the ideal form of funding. Political fundraisers should try \\"to exploit the latent giving power in the general population\\" and make every reasonable effort to raise \\"significant sums ... collected in small change.\\"Alexander Heard, The costs of democracy. Chapel Hill, NC: University of North Carolina Press, 1960, pp. 251, 250 (i.e. in reverse order). This is especially true for all democracies with a high standard of living for the majority of their citizens. Popular financing of politics can be an important source of political revenue (as it is in the U.S. and Canada, the Netherlands and Switzerland).For details see Herbert E. Alexander, Financing politics – money and political reform. 4th ed., Washington, DC: CQ Press, 1992, pp. 58–64, 73–5; W. T. Stanbury, Money in politics – financing federal parties and candidates in Canada. Toronto: Dundurn Press, 1991, pp. 213–24, 536–40; Ruud Koole, 'The modesty of Dutch party finance'.

However, it is not a constant and reliable source. The numbers of signed-up party members who pay their dues regularly fluctuates over time wherever democratic parties care to recruit them.Early data in: Maurice Duverger, Political parties – iheir organization and activity in the modern state. London: Methuen, 1954, figure 6; for more recent data see Paul Webb, David M. Farrell and Ian Holliday (eds.), Political parties in advanced industrial democracies. Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press, 2002, pp. 24, 55, 83, 121, 162, 163, 196, 225, 257, 325, 355. Today even the traditional mass-membership parties of the democratic left (Social Democrats or workers' parties) raise less than a quarter of their funds from the grassroots. Collection of small donations depends very much on the current mood of people's emotions towards politics, policies and politicians. A variety of ways are available (nationwide lottteries, direct mail drives, peer, neighborhood or internet solitication, social events at the local level, even yard sales) for grassroots fundraising. Personal (door-to-door or peer group) solicitation was quite frequent in the fifties. Since the 1960s it has been superseded by telethons and computerized mass mailings. In more recent years internet solicitation has played a major role. =Plutocratic finance= In the old days landed aristocrats and successful entrepreneurs of the ruling classes supplied the funds necessary for democratic politics.Pinto Duschinsky, Michael, British political finance, 1830–1980. Washington, DC: American Enterprise Institute, 1981, pp. 52–8. Later on, interest groups and others provided money. Although trade unions that funded left-of-center parties were among the suppliers of money, money for campaigns came from a relatively small number of large donors. In some cases governing parties have abused their powers by rent-seeking. Some have demanded graft for a license or a favor, others ristournes (in Quebec) or tangenti (in Italy) for public procurement. In some times and places, officeholders (including MPs, legislators and councillors) have been expected to pay an 'assessment' on their salaries for political jobs. =Public subsidies= After World War II, politicians including Luis Muñoz Marín in Puerto Rico, Gerhard Stoltenberg in Germany, Jean Lesage in Quebec and Tage Erlander in Sweden found a way to put \\"the costs of democracy\\" Phrase from the title of Heard, Alexander, The costs of democracy. Chapel Hill, NC: University of North Carolina Press, 1960. directly upon the taxpayer.For some details see Wells, Henry, Government financing of political parties in Puerto Rico. Princeton, NJ: Citizens' Research Foundation, 1961, pp. 16–21; Adams, Karl-Heinz, Parteienfinanzierung in Deutschland. Marburg: Tectum Verlag, 2005, pp. 112–26; Angell, Harold M., Provincial party financing in Quebec. Lanham, MD: University Press of America, 1996, pp. 31–53; Walter, Hanfried, \\"Staatliche Parteienfinasnzierung in Schweden seit dem Reichstagsbeschluss vom 15. Dezember 1965\\". In: Zeitschrift des öffentlichen Rechts und Völkerrechts, 1966, vol. 26, no. 2, pp. 371–404. Most modern democracies (in one way or the other) provide government subsidies for party activity, typically in cash and/or free access to public or private media. India and Switzerland are the most notable exceptions. Public subsidies can be relatively small (as in the UK and USA) or quite generous (as in Sweden, Germany, Israel and Japan), and usually exist side-by-side with private fundraising. Party organizations, parliamentary groups (party caucusses) and candidates are typically the recipients of public support (in cash or kind).For an overview see Casas Zamora, Kevin, Paying for democracy: political finance and state funding for parties. Colchester, UK: ECPR Press: 2005, pp. 30–1. Although government subsidies are now common in western democracies, such subsidies remain controversial.Michael Pinto-Duschinsky, 'It's their party, and we pay for it'. In: The Sunday Times, October 22, 2006; a brief compilation of pros and cons in: Casas-Zamora, Kevin, Paying for democracy: political finance and state funding for parties. Colchester, UK: ECPR Press: 2005, pp. 28–9. Because matching funds and tax credits depend on financial contributions by individual citizens such support is more compatible with participatory democracy than flat grants that do not require specific efforts by the fundraising organizations. Taxpayers in continental Europe and non-western democracies (like Israel and Japan) provide higher amounts towards party activity than their Anglo-Saxon counterparts. Many party headquarters in the high-subsidy countries cover between 40 and 60 per cent of their annual budget via public grants. Such heavy involvement of the taxpayer calls for a maximum of transparency for political funds. Regulation (political finance regime) Many countries have regulated the flow of political funds. Such regulation, the political finance regime, may include bans and limits on certain kinds of income and expenditure, level and distribution of as well as access to direct and indirect public subsidies, transparency of political funds by disclosure and reporting as well as enforcement of rules and sanctions for infringements. Financing of political campaigns have become very controversial, particularly since the era of party reform in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Arguments for restricting the amount of, or banning certain sources for, campaign contributions are usually couched in terms of the public interest in clean politics, but the effects of such restrictions or bans almost invariably are to protect incumbent office holders from serious challenges from aspirants who lack their name recognition or official status. Also, Democrats in the U.S. typically inveigh against the financial advantages of the so-called \\"fat cats,\\" while Republicans are wary of the war chests possessed by public and private labor unions, especially the former. The Hatch Act was passed in 1940 to forbid political activity by federal government employees, but the rise of the public sector union since 1961 has cemented a tight financial tie between government employees and their primary benefactors, usually Democrats. Bans on political expenditure concern either campaign expenses by non-candidates (\\"independent expenditures\\", \\"third party advertising\\") or media time paid for by political contestants. Both types of bans have to strike an adequate balance between two constitutional principles, the equality of opportunities (fairness) and the freedom of expression. Britain applies a spending limit for constituency candidates since 1883. Canada was the first democracy to add campaign limits for national party organizations in 1974 and spending limits for constituency nomination contestants in 2004. The U.S. Supreme Court (in Buckley v. Valeo 424 U.S. 1 (1976) has struck down spending limits because they interfere with free speech rights under the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. In order to be effective all limits require careful monitoring and serious enforcement backed up by adequate sanctions.'Regulation of Party Finance'. In: Katz, Richard S. and Crotty, William (eds.), Handbook of Party Politics. London, UK: Sage, 2006, pp. 446–47. Among the rules, which either restrict or favor specific types of political revenue, incentives to stimulate specific fundraising activities (like tax benefits or matching grants) are still rare.see Nassmacher, Karl-Heinz, 'Citizens' cash in Canada and the United States'. In: Alexander, Herbert E., and Shiratori, Rei (eds.), Comparative political finance among the democracies. Boulder, Colorado: Westview Press, 1994, pp. 145–57. More frequent are contribution limits or outright bans. Many countries ban anonymous donations or contributions from foreign sources. In some democracies even corporate donations for political purposes are illegal. Quite frequently political finance regimes include contribution limits. The maximum donation allowed may differ either by type of donor (individual citizens, legal entities), by recipient (candidate or party) or by purpose to be funded (nomination contest, election campaign, routine operation). In some countries (e.g. Germany) there is no statutory limit on the amount of political contributions, which a person or corporation may give to a party or candidate.'Regulation of Party Finance'. In: Katz, Richard S. and Crotty, William (eds.), Handbook of Party Politics. London, UK: Sage, 2006, pp. 447–48. If rules for transparency of political funds stipulate the disclosure of donors' identity, the public's right to know about financial backers may interfere with the need to protect the privacy of political preferences, the principle of the secret ballot. The practical solution will distinguish between categories of donors and/ or define cut-off points for privacy, e.g. $100 or €10,000. Both ways serve to separate financial contributions as a means of participation from donations as means of buying access or peddling influence. Any disclosure regulation has to identify a person or an institution that is responsible for the transparent flow of funds to and from party coffers and the kind of information, which has to be disclosed timely and accessibly.'Regulation of Party Finance'. In: Katz, Richard S. and Crotty, William (eds.), Handbook of Party Politics. London, UK: Sage, 2006, pp. 450–51. The reporting' of political funds (to be submitted annually and/ or after elections) usually includes various sources of income and specified items of expenditure, e.g. staff and offices, advertisements in print media, radio and TV, campaign material, direct mailing, opinion polling. Effective reporting by parties and candidates depends on the definition of useful categories for the funds raised and spent, the inclusion of data for all spending units as well as the procedure for examination and publication of financial reports. Currently no democracy provides for full transparency of all political funds.'Regulation of Party Finance'. In: Katz, Richard S. and Crotty, William (eds.), Handbook of Party Politics. London, UK: Sage, 2006, pp. 451–52. All political finance regimes require authorities and agencies that are responsible for monitoring, control and enforcement. Legislation has to strike a balance between practical independence of the agency in charge, effective enforcement of the rules for the funding of political competition and adequate implementation of legal stipulations. Global research shows that highly sophisticated rules, over-regulation of some issues and lax implementation of such rules do not lead to best practice.see http://www.idea.int/publications/funding-of-political-parties-and-election- campaigns/loader.cfm?csModule=security/getfile&pageID;=64347. Study of political finance The study of political finance was pioneered by James K. Pollock Pollock, James K., Party campaign funds. New York: Knopf, 1926. and Louise Overacker.Overacker, Louise, Money in elections. New York: Macmillan, 1932. Alexander Heard contributed a groundbreaking analysis for the U.S.Heard, Alexander, The costs of democracy. Chapel Hill, NC: University of North Carolina Press, 1960. – On the face of it this catchy title highlights the expense side of the subject only. Heard's book, however, covers the full range of the subject. International comparison started with Arnold J. Heidenheimer, who also introduced the term 'political finance' to comprise campaign and party funding.Heidenheimer, Arnold J. (ed.), Comparative political finance: the financing of party organizations and election campaigns. Lexington, MA: D.C. Heath, 1970; see also the Special Issue of The Review of Politics, 1963, vol. 25, no. 4, pp. 664–811. Thus he was bridgeing the gap of perception between North America and Western Europe. Herbert E. Alexander studied the U.S. situation for many decades Starting with: Alexander, Herbert E., Financing the 1960 election. Princeton, NJ: Citizens' Research Foundation, 1962, and ending with: Alexander, Herbert E.,'Spending in the 1996 elections'. In: Green, John C. (ed.), Financing the 1996 election. Armonk, NY: M.E.

Gunlicks concluded this cycle of comparative studies.Gunlicks, Arthur B., Campaign and party finance in North America and Western Europe. Boulder, CO: Westview Press, 1993. Daniel Lowenstein authored publications on legal aspects of campaign finance. The most important early studies on non-US countries were written by Khayyam Z. Paltiel (Canada) and Michael Pinto-Duschinsky (Britain).Paltiel, Khayyan Z., Political party financing in Canada. Toronto: McGraw-Hill, 1970 and Pinto Duschinsky, Michael, British political finance, 1830–1980. Washington, DC: American Enterprise Institute, 1981. Between 1963 and 2001 Colin Hughes and Ernest Chaples produced the early articles that covered campaign finance in Australia.For details see Hughes, Colin A.: Fifty years of campaign finance study in Australia, pp. 7, 10, available as: Discussion Paper 35/06 (December 2006), Democratic Audit of Australia, http://democratic.audit.anu.edu.au.

FEMNET helps non-government organizations share information and approaches on women's development, equality and other human rights. Activities FEMNET was originally set up in 1988 by national women's networks to co-ordinate African preparations for the Fourth World Conference on Women held in Beijing, China, in 1995. The organization is based in Nairobi, Kenya. FEMNET has worked with the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women, the World Conference against Racism and the African Union (AU). Areas of focus with the AU have included the protocol on the Rights of Women in Africa of the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights, the Economic, Social and Cultural Council and the New Partnership for African Development. FEMNET ran its first gender-training workshop in 1990 in Kenya, working with the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA). The workshop helped to train trainers, and FEMNET refined the approach and developed material based on results. FEMNET ran training sessions in the 1993-1999 period in Swaziland, Zambia, the United States and Malawi. They were supported by the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), UNICEF and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). FEMNET ran Train the Trainers sessions in 2000 for partner organizations in South Africa, Uganda and Ghana. Gender-based trainers have worked in many other countries in Africa. FEMNET has found that it is critical to involve men in the fight for gender equality. Male gender trainers have had great influence in introducing gender awareness in sectors such as developmental research where gender concerns had previously been neglected. It was assumed that raising awareness of gender issues would be extremely difficult in Swaziland, with its strongly patriarchal traditions. In fact, as a result of FEMNET assistance through UNFPA, high-level policymakers became sensitized to gender issues and measures to address gender concerns were included in key national plans. Malawi, where FEMNET has worked with UNFPA and UNICEF, has been another country where great progress has been made in training and sensitizing political leader, agencies and other organizations. In July 2008 FEMNET coordinated the official launch in Nairobi, Kenya, of the United Nations' Gender Equality Architecture Reform (GEAR) Campaign in Africa. As of 2010 FEMNET was active through membership and local organizations in more than 37 African countries.

The melt is solidified when deposed on a particle carrier, and thus captures the active drug in a solid dispersion either as a solid solution or in a nano-crystalline state. The particle size is then increased by controlling and optimizing the product temperature and feed rate of the melt. The granulate can be directly compressed into tablets without additional processing steps besides blending with a lubricant. In addition, the technology allows for customization of the release profile.

The group is composed of producers and songwriters whose backgrounds include working with Sanctuary Music Management, Trinity Records and Sacred Records. Greasy Geezers the name originates from the actual title of a record label established in 2002 by Najero Okenabirhie (previously working for Sanctuary Music Management on accountancy projects for Iron Maiden and Bruce Dickinson). This imprint label focused predominantly on garage releases. Most notable were releases presented by DJ Iron 'Some Good Garage EP'. As the garage scene waned the label diversified and changed their roster becoming a nu-jazz down tempo entity. Greasy Geezers adapted to the new market with releases by neo-soul and Latin house acts such as the Wah Wah Collective and Gafanhoto Lingo. The soulful diversification proved successful and the Wah Wah Collective gained notoriety in leading UK soul magazines with releases on playlists at Kiss FM (Patrick Forge), BBC Radio 1 (Giles Peterson), Smooth FM (Rosie Kendrick) and in the US with Rafe Gomez, dj/host of the nationally syndicated jazz mix show \\"The Groove Boutique\\". The Mid 00s Greasy Geezers \\"The Label\\" was disbanded in 2008 coinciding with the liquidation of Goya and Pinnacle distribution who held all stock titles by the label. The label catalogue and copyrights were then transferred and held by new indie label I-innovate (UK) who prior to the event were a video production group. 2009 onwards I-innovate (UK) in 2009 created the dance production unit called Greasy Geezers \\"The Dance Group\\" now composed of several dance producers including a team called Videoface previously from Trinity Records who gained notoriety in the soulful dance scene with the Norman Jay \\"Half is Mine\\" single (2005). In September 2010 The Wah Wah branch of the Greasy Geezers produced the single \\"Conceptual Love\\" by I-innovate artist Bada Badoo from X-factor (Season 7, ITV/SYCO UK). From 2011 Greasy Geezers embarked on several dance remake projects starting with an adaptation of a 1990 UK hip hop single 'Fry You Like Fish' originally performed by Caveman. This original track is rooted in the UK hip hop scene and was originally supported by Tim Westwood. A new 2011 electro adaptation called Fry You Like Fish @ The Jam was released in October 2011. Greasy Geezers working with screen writers from I-innovate created viral online characters including 'the greasy geezer' who provides comedic short-films supporting their dance releases. The Greasy Geezers brand is the balance between entertainment and creative dance music adaptations with a secondary emphasis to provide a comedic perspective on UK urban life within the music scene. In April 2012 Greasy Geezers released a revival garage digital ep Greasy Geezers Revival Jubilee.

The railway line is fully duplicated with overhead electrification. It is also connected to the north from Düsseldorf- Unterrath Karthäuser Weg junction over a single-track electrified line. History On 27 October 1975, in preparation for the upgrading of the line between Cologne and Duisburg for the introduction of S-Bahn services, a new line from Düsseldorf-Derendorf Dp junction to Düsseldorf Airport Terminal station opened for passenger traffic. For this purpose an existing siding had been duplicated and electrified and extended to the Terminal C building. At the time the line crossed the north-bound track of freight line 2670 at grade on the approach to Düsseldorf-Rath station, until the late 1980s when grade separated access was built to Unterrath station. On 27 May 1990, a northern access line was put into operation so that trains from the Ruhr area could approach the terminal station directly from the former Kalkum station. After the disastrous fire at the airport in 1996 and the subsequent short-term closure of the terminal, a temporary platform was opened halfway along the line, called Düsseldorf Airport Departure Terminal E. It was located near the temporary Terminal E established only for departures and operated until the opening of the Düsseldorf Airport long-distance station on 26 May 2000. Operations  Düsseldorf Airport Terminal station With the opening of the station on the main line from Düsseldorf to Duisburg the connecting line from the north was superfluous. Reversing in the underground station was too time consuming for through trains such as the former S-Bahn line S 21, which ran parallel to line S 1. Due to problems with the installation and acceptance of the Skytrain at first, a bus shuttle was established. The Skytrain is a driverless suspended monorail train, which commenced operations on 1 July 2002 and now connects the long-distance station via two intermediate stops at P4 parking station and Terminal A/B to the Terminal C station. Rail services  The track is served by line S 11 of the Rhine-Ruhr S-Bahn operating as follows: Düsseldorf Flughafen Terminal – Düsseldorf-Unterrath – Düsseldorf- Derendorf – Düsseldorf Hbf – Neuss Hbf – Dormagen – Cologne Hbf – Bergisch Gladbach.

He also painted genre and still-life subjects.  Personal life  Louis Dubois was born in 1830 in Brussels, Belgium. He died of a respiratory illness in Brussels in 1880 at the age of 50. Free Society for the Fine Arts Louis Dubois belonged to a group of artists who, in the style of the second half the 19th Century, rebelled against the traditional painting of the past in favor of the style of this period. With the painters Théodore Baron, Louis Artan, Edmond Lambrichs, F. Foudin, on March 1, 1868, he became one of the founders of La Société Libre des Beaux-Arts. The society was officially established in 1868 as \\"Comité de Salut Public révolutionnaire, pour la libération de l'Art\\" according to Lucien Solvay. The society members scorned the rules of the Academy and the aesthetics currently accepted; the artists of the \\"Free Society for the Fine Arts\\" freely and uniquely interpreted nature and reality, without following a common discipline, and stated their motto: \\"Liberté et Sincerité\\" and thus started a vehement controversy. To make known and spread their realist philosophy, in 1871 they created \\"L'Art Libre\\" an art and literary journal under Leon Dommartin's direction; it was published on the 1st and 15th of each month (the first was published on December 15, 1871). Louis Dubois, as the principal illustrator and the only painter-editor, was the most argumentative. Under the pseudonym \\"Hout\\" (Dutch translation of Dubois), in his alert, precise style, Dubois criticized traditional painting in his stories. In his well-respected lampoons, he spoke from the perspective of good sense, logic, sincerity, truth. Criticism On January 1, 1872, Duboi published under the title \\"Les Biographes et les Biographies\\" a critique of his professional enemies, The Romantics of the school of 1830 (published again in \\"L'Art Moderne, Revue artistique des Arts et de la Litterature\\" No 24 of the 4th year, Sunday, June 15, 1884. On February 1, and March 1, 1872, \\"Le Peintre d'Histoire\\" spoke against past painters of the so-called \\"Modern Era.\\" On July 15 and August 15, 1872, \\"Du Portrait\\" criticized official portraits on natural skins. On September 15 and October 1, 1872, in his article \\"Du Procédé\\" Dubois said, \\"paint as you like . . . provided that you use true tones, in the right places.\\" On February 11, 1873, after 10 years of publication, the Review underwent a transformation, expanding under the title \\"L'Art Universel\\"; Camille Lemonnier became the director. \\"Hout\\" the published an article \\"A propos des peintres du rire\\" (Frans Hals, Jordeans, Jan Steen, the triad of painters of good spirits). Dubois is also given credit for the articles signed \\"Karl Stur,\\" in \\"L'Art Libre\\" and in the daily newspaper \\"La Chronique\\" (lead article \\"Causerie\\"), during the years 1870-1871. Paintings Dubois worked in Paris at Thomas Couture's studio, which was active from 1847 to 1863. He also found himself in the company of Felicien Rops, Charles Hermans, Constantin Meunier, Jules Raeymaeckers, among the attendees of the \\"Atelier Libre Saint-Luc\\" in Brussels from 1853 to 1863, then directed by Slingeneyer - an association of young painters gathered to work together. Dubois exhibited for the first time at the Brussels Exhibition of 1857 where he showed three paintings \\"Joueurs\\" (Players), \\"Embuscade\\" (Ambush), and \\"Prêtre allant célébrer la Masse\\" (Priests going to celebrate Mass). At an 1860 show, Dubois showed the great work \\"Les Cigognes\\" (The Storks), (shown at Spa that same year) painted in 1858, \\"La Roulette\\" (both of which today hang in the Royal Museum of Fine Arts in Brussels) and a study called \\"Enfant de choeur\\" (Choir Child) (this remained in his family and is now on display in Maui, Hawaii in the home of his great great granddaughter Maureen Vernon Breen); in 1863 \\"Solitude\\" (formerly \\"Le Chevreuil mort [dead Deer]) (also now on display in the Royal Museum in Brussels) shows the dead animal outstretched in the middle of a silent forest. Associates Dubois considered as his friends: Courbet, Louis Artan, Felicien Rops, Constantin Meunier, Alfred Verwee, Joseph Coosemans. Alfred Verhaeren, Jean-François Taelemans (1851-1931), and Théodore Baron were his students, and Frans Van Leemputten (1850-1915) followed his influence. Camille Lemonnier wrote: \\"Master Louis Dubois, I saved him for last, like a hot pepper for a bored palate. Zounds! What painting! I recognized the power of another with distinction.\\" Edmond About said about him, \\"he was the most distinguished painter working in Belgium.\\"  Legacy  Twenty-one of Dubois' paintings and those of his students were displayed at the 1880 Brussels Artistic and Literary Circle; and in 1891 at the Arts and Press Expo.

Finley, 524 U.S. 569 (1998), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court ruled that the National Foundation on the Arts and Humanities Act, as amended in 1990, ( (d)(1)), was facially valid, as it neither inherently interfered with First Amendment rights nor violated constitutional vagueness principles. The act in question required the Chairperson of the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) to ensure that \\"artistic excellence and artistic merit are the criteria by which [grant] applications are judged, taking into consideration general standards of decency and respect for the diverse beliefs and values of the American public\\". Justice O'Connor delivered the opinion of the Court.  Background  Congress established the National Endowment for the Arts in 1965 as an independent agency of the federal government. As of 2012, the NEA had awarded a total of more than $4 billion to support artistic excellence, creativity, and innovation for the benefit of individuals and communities. Since its establishment, the NEA has funded thousands of individual artists and arts organizations. In 1989, two controversial works were partially or fully funded with grants from the NEA. The Institute of Contemporary Art at the University of Pennsylvania used $30,000 of a visual arts grant from the NEA to fund a retrospective of Robert Mapplethorpe’s work. The exhibit, titled \\"The Perfect Moment\\", included homoerotic photographs that some members of Congress deemed to be pornographic. Members of Congress also criticized Serrano’s work, Piss Christ, a photograph of a crucifix submerged in urine. The Southeast Center for Contemporary Arts, which also received funding from the NEA, awarded Serrano a $15,000 grant. In response to the use of NEA grants to funding these projects, Congress created an Independent Commission of constitutional law scholars to review the NEA's grant-making process and make recommendations. Ultimately, Congress adopted the Williams/Coleman Amendment. The Amendment became §954(d)(1), which directs the NEA Chairperson to judge the artistic merit of grant applications while also “tak[ing] into consideration general standards of decency and respect for the diverse beliefs and values of the American public”. The case ultimately known as NEA v. Finley was filed by four individual performance artists Karen Finley, John Fleck, Holly Hughes, and Tim Miller, and the National Association of Artists' Organizations (NAAO). The plaintiffs alleged that the defendants, the NEA and NEA Chairperson John E. Frohnmayer violated their constitutional rights by wrongly turning down their applications for NEA grants. They sought declaratory and injunctive relief on their constitutional and statutory funding claims, and damages on an additional Privacy Act claim. In addition, all plaintiffs sought a declaration that the so-called \\"decency clause\\" of 20 U.S.C. 954(d), was void for vagueness and violated the First Amendment on its face. The Supreme Court heard two motions. The first was the defendants' motion for judgment on the pleadings. Defendants argued that: (1) the NEA's funding decisions are unreviewable because they are committed to agency discretion by law; (2) venue was improper as to the Privacy Act claim; and (3) plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge the facial validity of the \\"decency clause\\" because they cannot establish the necessary injury. The Court also considered plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment on their facial challenge to the \\"decency clause\\".  Lower courts  = District Court = The District Court found that the decency clause debased the First Amendment by deceitfully preventing some forms of protected speech and that the clause was vague under the Fifth Amendment. The District Court rejected the NEA’s argument that “decency” and “respect” were implicit and voluntary standards in funding evaluations. Instead, the court stated that the clause represented criteria to determine eligibility for the NEA grants and that an overbroad statute would restrict protected and unprotected speech. The court held that while the government may constitutionally regulate “obscene” speech, the decency clause might repress indecent speech, a form of expression immune from substantial governmental obstruction. The court also argued that in certain protected areas, such as public education funding, government grants “may not be used to suppress unpopular expression”. Since both academic expression and artistic expression reached the core of a democratic society’s cultural and political vitality, the court found that, similar to education funding, art funding enhanced education neutrality. = U.S. Court of Appeals = The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals confirmed the district court’s finding and ruled in Finley’s favor.  Supreme Court Decision  The Supreme Court overturned the Court of Appeals decision. The Court found that decency does not certainly interfere with the First Amendment right to free expression and it does not violate the Fifth Amendment’s void for vagueness provision. The court found that 20 U.S.C. § 954(d)(1) merely adds factors to the grant-making process. It does not state that all grants should be denied to applications involving indecent or disrespectful artworks. Although the statute does not state how much weight the Advisory Commission should give these factors, the NEA has wide discretion in considering this provision. Also, the Court stated that Finley carried the burden of demonstrating that there is a substantial risk that the application of the decency clause will lead to the suppression of speech. However, the Court found that the provision on its face was very clear in that the decency and respect provision is only a consideration; it is not a provision that compels the Chairperson to require decency and respect in every application. Because the very nature of the subject matter is open to different interpretations, the Court determined that in the context of selected artistic subsidies it is not possible at all times for Congress to legislate with clarity and it is difficult to establish a precise criterion when granting subsidies.  Majority opinion and dissent  Justice O’Connor wrote the majority opinion, joined by Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justices Stevens, Kennedy, Ginsburg, and Breyer. The meaning of the section 954(d) obligation to take into consideration decency and respect for diverse beliefs and values had been debated throughout the litigation. From the outset, the NEA had argued that it could discharge this obligation simply by ensuring that the membership on the review panels reflected national diversity. Both the district court and the court of appeals, however, decisively rejected this reading. Like the lower courts, Justice Souter’s dissent readily disposed of this reading as inconsistent with the text and legislative history, as well as redundant because another statutory provision already required the Chairperson to consider diversity in selecting the panels. The majority dodged the issue by noting that it need not evaluate the NEA’s interpretation because the statute was constitutional on its face even if construed more broadly. The majority opinion is remarkably vague with regard to what exactly the statutory language entails. It seems that a panel and the Chairperson could find a particular project indecent and void of respect for diverse beliefs and values and yet still award the grant on the basis of the project’s artistic excellence. The construction would seem to be the most natural reading of the phrase “take into consideration”. As Justice O’Connor noted, “when Congress has in fact intended to affirmatively constrain the NEA’s grant-making authority, it has done so in no uncertain terms”—for example, the prohibition against awarding grants for obscene works. Neither Justice Scalia nor Justice Souter necessarily rejected the Court’s interpretation of the statute. Justice Scalia began his opinion with the comment that “’the operation was a success, but the patient died.’ What such a procedure is to medicine, the Court’s opinion in this case is to the law. It sustains the constitutionality of 20 U.S.C. 954(d)(1) by gutting it.” From the easily supportable conclusion that “consideration” is not equivalent to per se prohibition, the Court reasoned that the factors to be taken into consideration—“decency” and “respect” for diverse beliefs and values—are not intended to “disallow any particular viewpoints”. The Court noted that the legislation was bipartisan in nature, a compromise position designed to counter proposals to abolish the NEA and seemingly influenced by the Independent Commission’s cautions regarding the use of independently preclusive criteria. Perhaps the Court simply continued the argument that decency and respect are merely two factors in the mix that deserve some consideration.

She was a Landgravine of Leuchtenberg by marriage and a lady in waiting for the Elector Palatine and King of Germany, Rupert.  Life  Elisabeth of Oettingen was the daughter of Count Louis X of Oettingen (referred to as Louis XI by some authors)Genealogy of Count Louis XI of Oettingen (died: 1 May 1370) and his wife Imagina of SchaunbergGenealogy of Imagina of Schaunberg (died: 1377). Around 1376, Elisabeth married Landgrave Albert of LeuchtenbergGenealogy of Landgrave Albert of Leuchtenberg (died: ). Little is known about her life. She served as a lady in waiting at the Palatine court. Irmengard of Oettingen, the cousin of her grandfather, Frederick I of Oettingen, was married to Elector Palatine Adolf and was the grandmother of Rupert, the Elector Palatine and King of Germany, so Elisabeth was a third cousin of King Rupert. She may have received her position at the Palatine court on the recommendation of her elderly great-aunt Irmengard, the elector's grandmother, who at the time lived as a Dominican nun in the Liebenau monastery at Worms. Elisabeth donated a valuable collection of 52 relics in two silver containers to the collegiate church in Neustadt and der Haardt (now called Neustadt an der Weinstrasse). The relics were lost during the Reformation. Members of the House of Wittelsbach were buried in the choir of this church, and so was Elisabeth, who was a relative of the Wittelsbach family. Her damaged grave stone was found in 1907 in the church floor, near the northern entrance into the Catholic part of the church and is now part of the west wall of the south choir chapel. The church has an \\"eternal\\" tradition of celebrating mass in Elisabeth's memory; a contemporary record in the Seelbuch mentions the donation in connection with this mass. Elisabeth's son Landgrave Leopold of Leuchtenberg (d. 1463) was a Palatinate governor of Amberg and was later raised to Prince of Leuchtenberg. This, too, may be due to his remote family connection with the king, or to the reputation of his mother. Leopold was buried in the parish church of Pfreimd in the Upper Palatinate. His grave is marked with a well-preserved magnificent marble epitaph with a portrait of Leopold as a knight. The portrait can be seen in the header of the parish's official website.Detail of Leopold of Leuchtenberg's epitaph in the upper left corner of the web site of the parish at Pfreimd Oettingen family coat of arms, the epitaph in the St. Giles Church in Neustadt an der Weinstrasse Elizabeth's brother, Frederick IV of Oettingen was bishop of Eichstätt. He was considered one of the most pious and most active German prelates of his time. Her other brother, Louis XI \\"the Bearded\\" (he is called \\"Louis XII\\" by authors who call her father \\"Louis XI\\") served king of Sigismund for many years as Hofmeister and confidant. At the time, the Hofmeister was the highest official in the Emprire. He also represented the Emperor at the Council of Constance.

The formation, rise, and decline of the armies of the Maratha Empire can be broadly divided into two eras 17th century Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, the founder of Maratha empire, raised a small yet effective land army. For better administration, Shivaji abolished the land-grants or jagir for military officers and instituted a system of salary or cash payment for their services. During the 17th century the Maratha Army was small in terms of numbers when compared to the Mughals, numbering some 100,000. Shivaji gave more emphasis to infantry as against cavalry, considering the rugged mountainous terrain he operated in. Further, Shivaji did not have access to the North Indian Mughal dominated horse markets. During this era, the armies of the Marathas were known for their agility due to the light equipment of both infantry and cavalry.Artillery was mostly confined to the Maratha fortresses, which were located on hilltops, since it gave a strategic advantage and further these fortresses had abilities to withstand sieges (such as being equipped with sufficient water supply). The Marathas used weapons like muskets, matchlocks, firangi swords, clubs, bows, spears, daggers, etc. A Maratha helmet and armor from Hermitage Museum, St Petersburg, Russia. The Maratha Army, during Shivaji's era was systematic and disciplined.A case in point here is that the Marathas achieved success in systematic elimination of all forts which came their way during the Battle of Surat circa 1664. Regards the artillery, Shivaji hired foreign (mainly Portuguese) mercenaries for assistance to manufacture weapons. The hiring of foreign mercenaries was not new to the Maratha military culture. Shivaji hired seasoned cannon-casting Portuguese technicians from Goa. The Marathas attached importance to hiring of experts, which can be corroborated by the fact that important posts in the army were offered to the officers in charge of the manufacture of guns. The Army deployed musketeers as well - both regular and mercenaries. During the late 17th century, there is a mention of the Marathas using well-armed musketeers during their attack on Goa (during the reign of Sambhaji). Further, during the same period there is also a mention of Marathas using Karnataki musketeers renowned for marksmanship =Structure and Rank= Below was the structure and ranks of armies of the great Maratha at a high level during the reign of Chhatrapati Shivaji: Cavalry was divided into two at a high level: *Shiledar: A shiledar brought his own horse and equipment. Although organized different, even shiledar converged into the Sarnobat (chief of Army) *Bargir: One of the lowest rank (rank and file) cavalryman of the Marathas who was provided with horse and equipment from the State's stock The infantry consisted of the below: *Hetkari musketeers: Konkani musketeers recruited typically from the Konkan region, who possessed matchlocks and noted for their marksmanship *Mavales: Foot soldier recruited typically from western Maharashtra A Mahratta horseman - original pencil sketch by the artist H. Hall; standing figure in military costume with spear, left hand resting on horse Ranks and salary of the cavalry are as below. The infantry had a similar structure *Sarnobat (chief of Army)(a part of the Council of Eight): 4000 to 5000 hons per year *Panch Hazari: 2000 hons per year *Hazari: 1000 hons per year *Jumledar: 500 hons per year *Havaldar: 125 hons per year *Bargir: 9 hons per year Infantry ranks (starting with senior-most rank): *Sarnobat (chief of Army) *Saat (Seven) Hazari *Hazari *Jamdar *Havaldar *Nayak (or Naik) *Paek =During the War of 27 Years= During the War of 27 Years (1680 to 1707) the Maratha State forces (regular army) dispersed and the theater of warfare became entire Southern India (or Deccan India). During this period the armies of the Marathas resorted to guerrilla warfare; bands of irregular soldiers also joined in and it became a People's War. Raiding enemy's rear, isolated posts, supply lines was a feature during this period. Common men and women from virtually every town and village offered shelter to the Mahratta forces led by two valiant Generals - Santaji Ghorpade and Dhanaji Jadhav Jadunath Sarkar the noted historian writes in his famous book namely military history of India about Santaji Ghorpade, a brilliant strategist who fought the Mughals in the 27 year war : \\"He was a perfect master of this art, which can be more correctly described as Parthian warfare than as guerrilla tactics, because he could not only make night marches and surprises, but also cover long distances quickly and combine the movements of large bodied over wide areas with an accuracy and punctuality which were incredible in any Asiatic army other than those of Chengiz Khan and Tamurlane\\". 18th century =Pre-1761= During the 18th century the Maratha army continued its emphasis on its light cavalry, which proved better against the heavy cavalry of the Mughals. Post 1720, the armies of the Maratha Empire, in the reign of Chhatrapati Shahu started making their presence felt in Northern India (the bastion of the Mughals) and scored numerous military victories, primarily due to the skills of his Peshwa Bajirao I as a great cavalry leader and military strategist. Bajirao Peshwa made excellent use of small and heavy ammunition (using it in excellent coordination) and used smothering tactics. The Marathas led by Bajirao I would use their artillery to create a blanket of projectiles to smother the enemy. A Maratha cannon (Artillery battery), as seen at Raigad Hillfort A hallmark of Peshwa Baji Rao I's contingents was that of long-distance cavalry attacks, typically light and agile cavalry. During the reign of Chhatrapati Shahu, the cavalry strength was some 100,000. Chhatrapati's own cavalry was called as the Huzurat Cavalry which was an elite cavalry division led by the Peshwa. Further, Baji Rao used massed ranks of infantry consisting of flintlock-armed regulars under South Asian officers. =Modernization pre-1761= When the Marathas confronted the French (allies of the Nizam) on battlefield in 1750s, they realized the importance of western-style disciplined infantry. Hence the process of modernization began even before the Third Battle of Panipat (1761). Sadashivrao Bhau admired Western-style disciplined infantry. Circa 1750s, the Marathas endeavored to hire the services of the French General Marquis de Bussy-Castelnau (who served in the Nizam’s Army) for training purposes, but when they failed in their efforts, they managed to hire Ibrahim Khan Gardi. Ibrahim Khan was an artillery expert trained under the leadership of Bussy. The word gardi is a corruption of the French word garde (guard) and this gardi formed the backbone of Maratha infantry. Ibrahim Khan played a major role in re-configuring the Maratha artillery. He served the Marathas in the infamous Third Battle of Panipat. During the battle, out of the approximate 40,000 Maratha Army men, some 8000 or 9000 were artillery (Gardi Infantry). They possessed 200 cannons (consisting of heavy field-pieces as well as light camel or elephant-mounted zambaruks (a swivel gun equivalent) and also possessed handguns. During this era, sources state that the Marathas made use of both flintlocks and matchlocks and that their matchlocks had a technological advantage having superior range and velocity. However at Third Battle of Panipat, they possessed mainly just swords and spears whilst Abdali possessed a larger force with flintlock muskets. =Modernization post-1761= From the 17th century till the mid-18th century the artillery of the Marathas was more dependent on foreign gunners rather than their own. A Mahratta field artillery gun on display at Shaniwar Wada, Peshwa's Palace, in Pune Post 1761 Mahadaji Shinde, a distinguished Maratha Maharaja, focused his attention on European artillery and secured the services of the noted Frenchman Benoît de Boigne. Benoît de Boigne had received training from the best of the European military schools. Following suit, the other Maratha chiefs (including their First Minister the Peshwa) such as the Holkars, the Bhosales, also raised French- trained artillery battalions. *Chhatrapati's Cavalry: The elite Huzurat cavalry were equipped with matchlocks instead of long spears. *Scindia's infantry organization and weapons under De Boigne: De Boigne organized his infantry under campoos. One campoo had 10 infantry battalions, which consisted of 4000 infantrymen equipped with flintlocks and bayonets. Each battalion had 5 guns (1 howitzer and 4 field guns) and every battalion was commanded by a European gunner. Each campoo had 3 siege guns (16 and 24 pounder guns), apart from mortar guns, howitzers, and camel-mounted blunderbusses. Five campoos were raised between 1790 and 1803. The artillery had 50 bronze cannons (half of which were big caliber guns). *Training: Further there was emphasis on training and infantrymen were trained on handling firearms, gunnery practice, and military manoeuvres. *Innovations: Under De Boigne a new weapon was invented having six musket barrels joined together. *Ambulance Corps: Another novelty was the ambulance corps in charge of providing aid to wounded soldiers (including enemy soldiers) *Composition: Under Mahadji Scindia, Rajput and Muslim infantrymen were recruited in the Maratha Army. Further, his cavalrymen had a different uniform - long trousers as opposed to the shorter Deccani ones *Military-Industrial Complex: Further circa 1784, Mahadaji Shinde established a military-industrial complex for the armies of the Maratha near Agra. The ordnance factories of the Marathas made use of sophisticated indigenous technologies with more of adaptation as against innovation. Mahadaji Shinde created one of finest armies in India, with the help of the French and Portuguese and it also included a brigade known as Deccan Invincibles, which numbered some 27,000. *There is a mention of induction of 6 pound field guns under the command of Pierre Perron, Maratha General of Scindia dominions (the successor of De Boigne). These 6 pound guns were inducted after phasing out the earlier light 3 pound ones. *In a bid to Westernize the artillery, circa 1777, there is a mention of a Portuguese officer named Naronha heading the Peshwa’s artillery and further he had a number of European artillery men working under him. Circa 1790, the Peshwa's forces employed a Portuguese officer for casting 40-pounder guns. *The Nagpur Senasahebsubah Bhonsle's forces had two Westernized infantry brigades, however without any European officers, while Scindia's forces were the most Westernized. The arms of the Marathas However a point to be noted here is that it is untrue to conclude that armies of the Maratha got disciplined only post 1761. The Marathas were well aware of the importance of discipline and disciplined and drilled infantry in Maharashtra existed even in the Hindu classical era. The Mahrattas were aware of the Portuguese infantry models having concepts like \\"Spanish square\\" since sixteenth century. In the late 18th century and early 19th century, with French-trained artillery and infantry, the Marathas managed to regain their lost ground in North India, however they could not match the superior artillery of the British East India Company, which in due course of time, among other reasons, led to the defeat of the Marathas at the Third Anglo-Maratha War and decline of their Empire itself. =Employment of the Pindaris= Pindaris were irregular horsemen and their primary role was to plunder in return of payment. Pindaris composed of both Muslims and Hindus. They had implicit support from Maratha chiefs (Maharajas) such as Scindias of Gwalior, Holkars of Indore, and Bhosales of Nagpur. This band of freebooters accompanied Maratha forces during their campaigns and helped win wars in return for plunder and pay. They were a part of the Maratha Army during the Third Battle of Panipat and almost all Anglo-Maratha Wars. https://www.britannica.com/topic/Pindaris =Employment of Bargis= The Nagpur Bhosales employed thousands of units called Bargi to invade Mughal Bengal. The invasions lasted annually for ten years until finally the Nawab of Bengal, European merchants and locals had built the Maratha Ditch to safeguard themselves from war. The Bargi were involved in several war crimes. =Possible employment of Gurkha= The Peshwa was very successful in deploying forces in Northern India. There are indications that India's native Gurkha may have sided with the Maratha during their attacks upon Delhi, the seat of Mughal rule.

The incident caused a diplomatic scandal and increased stress between the rebels and the government. The event On 4 March 1997, at 15:30, two pilots of the 4020 Regiment left Rinas airport and headed towards the south of the country. During their flight they detoured towards Italy and landed at the Galatina Air Base in Lecce. They managed to avoid radar detection by flying their plane 15 meters from sea level and were only detected by Italian forces after landing. The Albanian government later demanded the repatriation of the two deserters. The pilots said they were ordered by the government to strike Mifol Bridge, connecting Fier with Vlorë, in order to isolate the insurgency. Not wanting to hit civilians, they fled to Italy and subsequently asked for political asylum. The Albanian government denied that the pilots had been ordered to fire on civilians and asserted that they were simply sent on a reconnaissance mission; this assertion was reinforced by the fact that no armament was found on the plane in Italy after it landed.

Development began along Hillsborough Street and moved north; a streetcar line along Hillsborough made the location especially appealing and convenient. Cameron Park's developers used restrictive deed covenants that set minimum house prices, created setbacks from the street, and excluded African Americans from living in the neighborhood (except as live-in domestic employees). Advertisements for Cameron Park openly recruited socially ambitious upper- middle class residents to the neighborhood, and land and house values were significantly higher than those of other early suburbs. The neighborhood is architecturally varied, featuring Queen Anne and Colonial Revivals, large bungalows, and more eclectic styles like Georgian Revival, Tudor Revival, and Mission Revival. Despite the stylistic variety, houses were uniformly large and upscale for the era. Cameron Park was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985 as a national historic district.

Representatives are elected for two-year terms; those elected served in the 107th Congress from January 3, 2001, until January 3, 2003. The election coincided with the 2000 United States presidential election. At the time, Florida had twenty-three seats in the House, apportioned according to the 1990 United States Census. Its delegation to the 106th Congress of 1999-2001 consisted of fifteen Republicans and eight Democrats. No seats switched parties in 2000, though the incumbents in Districts 4, 8, and 12 retired. Thus, Florida's delegation to the 107th Congress consisted of fifteen Republicans and eight Democrats. The election for 8th and 22nd districts were competitive, with both decided by a margin of less than 2%. The latter district, which was based in the Miami area, underwent a recount in the midst of a controversial recount of votes for the presidential election.

During the primary, Scarborough was challenged by Pensacola attorney David Condon. As expected, Scarborough prevailed over Condon, winning by a margin of 77.4%-22.6%. This was the only seat tantamount to the election in Florida, because the winner of the Republican primary would face no Democratic opposition. In the general election on November 7, 2000, Scarborough received only token opposition from four write-in candidates - Dave Blue, Mark Coutu, Fred Hoole, and Dudley Wiley. Scraborough won the election with 99.5% of the vote. ;Primary election results ;General election results =District 2= Incumbent Allen Boyd, who had been in office since 1997, sought a third term during this election cycle. He faced no challenges for the Democratic nomination. Likewise, Republican Doug Dodd received no opposition in his respective primary. Thomas A. Frederick also entered the race as a write-in candidate. Boyd prevailed in this then-left leaning district, winning with 72.1% of the vote. ;General election results =District 3= As in District 2, neither incumbent Corrine Brown (D) or Jennifer Carroll (R) faced opposition in their respective primaries. Write-in candidate Carl Sumner also entered the race. On election day, Brown defeated future-Lieutenant Governor Carroll and Sumner by comfortable margin, receiving 57.6% of the vote in this left-leaning district. ;General election results =District 4= Incumbent Tillie K. Fowler (R) declined to run for re-election in 2000, leaving an open seat. The two candidates in the Republican primary were CEO and President of America’s Choice Title Company Dan Quiggle and Ander Crenshaw, President of the Florida Senate and son-in law of former Governor of Claude R. Kirk, Jr. Crenshaw easily defeated Quiggle and received over two-thirds of the votes. Former Jacksonville mayor Tommy Hazouri, Jacksonville City County President Eric Smith, and former State Representative Mike Langton considered running for the Democratic nomination, but all declined, leaving only Jacksonville lawyer Kevin Sanders and businessman Tom Sullivan. On the day of the primary, Sullivan won, garnering about 62.2% of the vote. In addition, independent Deborah K. Pueschel and write-in candidate Vince W. Ray entered the race. Republican Crenshaw soundly defeated Sullivan, Pueschel, and Ray on election day. ;Primary election results ;General election results =District 5= Democratic incumbent Karen Thurman ran for a fifth term in 2000. She went unchallenged in the primary for her party's nomination. However, the Republican primary featured a tough contest between Pete Enwall and Jim King, both of whom were businessmen from Gainesville. During the week before the primary, the St. Petersburg Times hosted a candidate forum between Enwall and King. Enwall claimed that King's campaign fliers distorted his views on social issues and accused King of mudslinging. On the day of the primary, Enwall narrowly defeated King, garnering about 51.4% of the vote. Write-in candidate Don Johnson also entered in the general election. Thurman trounced Enwall and Johnson, receiving nearly two-thirds of the vote. ;Primary election results ;General election results =District 6= Republican Cliff Stearns, who had been in office since 1989, ran for a seventh term in 2000. He faced no primary challengers or a Democratic candidate in the general election. Timothy Clower, a Jacksonville taxi business owner and a write-in candidate for this election, intended to use the term limits issue against Stearns, as he promised in 1988 that he would serve only six terms. Barbara Elliott of Bradenton also ran as a write-in candidate. The term limits issue failed to gain traction, as Stearns was re-elected almost unanimously, winning approximately 99.9% of the votes. ;General election results =District 7= Republican John Mica has been elected every two years since 1992. He sought re-election again in 2000. Mica faced did not face a primary challenge; neither did his Democratic opponent, Dan Vaughen, a DeLand lawyer and ethics in law professor at the University of Central Florida. Additionally, Norman E. Nelson was eligible as a write-in candidate. Mica was endorsed by the Orlando Sentinel, which noted that \\"John Mica is the kind of representative others should strive to be.\\" Mica prevailed in a landslide, collecting about 63.2% of the votes. ;General election results =District 8= Republican Bill McCollum, who was first elected to this district in 1992, decided to run for the Senate seat of retiring incumbent Connie Mack III. This allowed for a very competitive Republican primary. By as early as August 1999, four candidates declared for the Republican nomination, including businessman Bob Hering, attorney Ric Keller, Orlando attorney Hector \\"Tico\\" Perez, and State Representative Bill Sublette. However, Perez withdrew from the race in December, around the time that then-State Senator Daniel Webster declined to run. ;Primary election results ;Run-off election results ;General election results =District 9= Republican Michael Bilirakis, first elected to the seat in 1982, sought another term in 2000. He was not challenged for the Republican nomination, nor did he face a Democratic opponent in the general election.

Each hundred had a 'fyrd', which acted as the local defence force and a court which was responsible for the maintenance of the frankpledge system. They also formed a unit for the collection of taxes. The role of the hundred court was described in the Dooms (laws) of King Edgar. The name of the hundred was normally that of its meeting-place. The hundred of Carhampton was a large hundred, covering approximately , that contained the parishes of Minehead, Cutcombe, Carhampton, Luccombe, Withycombe, Wootton, Luxborough, Almsworthy, Oare, Dunster, Porlock, Langham, Selworthy, Wilmersham, Allerford, Bickham, Broadwood, Holne, Staunton, Avill, Knowle, East Myne, West Myne, Exford, Aller, Doverhay, Gilcott, Bagley, Oaktrow, Downscombe, Rodhuish, Treborough and Stone. The importance of the hundred courts declined from the seventeenth century. By the 19th century several different single-purpose subdivisions of counties, such as poor law unions, sanitary districts, and highway districts sprang up, filling the administrative role previously played by parishes and hundreds. Although the Hundreds have never been formally abolished, their functions ended with the establishment of county courts in 1867County Courts Act 1867 (30 & 31 Vict. c. 142) s.28 and the introduction of districts by the Local Government Act 1894.

History  WITS was founded in 1980 by Rabbi Yehuda Cheplowitz, Rabbi Moshe Dov Harris, and Rabbi Raphael Wachsman. In 1984, WITS moved from Whitefish Bay, Wisconsin to its current facility, a Tudor-style mansion in Milwaukee’s Upper East Side overlooking Lake Michigan. The mansion was built by the lumber baron Henry M. Thompson in 1913 and designed by Alexander C. Eschweiler. It had previously been home to St. Mary's Ecumenical Retreat and Conference Center, a convent and retreat center for Catholic and Episcopalian nuns. In the late 1980s, David Draiman, frontman for the rock band Disturbed, briefly attended the high school. In 1995, WITS sought to expand the size of its facilities three-fold by building a “30,000-square-foot addition, which [would] include a gym, classrooms, offices, a dining room and worship hall,” but neighbors voiced concerns about zoning and feared the expansion would tarnish the historic character of the building and the neighborhood. After changes were made to the plans ensuring that the historic look of the building would be maintained, including building the new section out of similarly-colored limestone blocks as the old historic building, and ensuring that the new construction would not be visible from the street, Milwaukee’s Historic Preservation Commission approved the expansion, which was opened in March of 2000. Legal expenses and extra costs to reinforce the ground beneath the building, however, reduced the overall size of the project to 23,000 square feet, which, in the end, included “nine new classrooms, a state-of-the-art computer lab and a science lab,” but no gymnasium as originally planned.Gould (2000) On June 17, 2010, a small electrical fire on the third floor of the new building caused an evacuation of the building and minor damage. The building has since been renovated and returned to full use. Rabbi Raphael Wachsman, z\\"l, one of the founding deans, passed away on February 6, 2016.  Academics  WITS is divided into two programs: a high school program and a post-high-school Beis Medrash program. The high school program includes both a rigorous Judaic studies curriculum, and a competitive college-preparatory secular curriculum. Beyond the classroom, the school emphasizes strong rebbi-student relationships, mentorships, personal development and good midos. The Beis Medrash program offers \\"three levels of Iyun Shiurim\\" daily, and focuses on strong rebbi- student relationships, mentorships with high school students, and continued personal development.

Name DuChaine's surname derives from France and his ancestors settled in Canada around the beginning of the 17th century, before becoming part of the Native American Chickasaw tribe. Music career DuChaine started in music when his father taught him to play the ukulele at six years old. At 13 years old, he got his first electric guitar and formed a band with his friends in his hometown of Wayzata, Minnesota, playing mainly popular music at private parties and school functions. After reading some liner notes of an Eric Clapton album, Kent started researching blues. DuChaine discovered a Robert Johnson album and was astounded and fascinated at the banging sound as the bottle neck knocked against the frets as Johnson slid it up and down the neck of his guitar. Determined to recapture the sound, Kent used a butter knife at first. DuChaine immersed himself in the blues of Robert Johnson, Muddy Waters, Lightnin' Hopkins, T-Bone Walker and Bukka White and learned to play the slide guitar, soon developing his own ferocious style. In 1970, DuChaine opened a show for Bukka White. From 1972 until 1975, DuChaine performed in a band with Kim Wilson. The band backed blues musicians including Fenton Robinson, Boogie Woogie Red, Luther Tucker, Hubert Sumlin and Eddie \\"Guitar\\" Burns. The reputation of the band grew and Willie Dixon arranged a recording contract and a concert sharing the bill with Albert Collins, John Lee Hooker and Howlin' Wolf. In 1979, DuChaine acquired Leadbessie, a beat-up 1934 National Steel Guitar in an equally beat-up case and with extra heavy strings. DuChaine discovered and looked up Johnny Shines in 1989. They travelled together for three years and performed over 200 shows. In that time they recorded Back To the Country with Snooky Pryor, and were honoured with a Blues Music Award for best country blues album, but they did not add DuChaine's name to the recording. In 1991, the Smithsonian Institution honoured the King of the Delta Blues, Robert Johnson. DuChaine and Shines were invited to perform and Roots Of Rhythm & Blues: A Tribute to the Robert Johnson Era was the result. This was recorded by Sony BMG and also Grammy nominated. DuChaine and Shines' partnership and friendship was cut short when Johnny Shines died on 20 April 1992. Since going solo in 1982 and hitting the road in the United States, Kent has clocked-up over three million miles, including over a hundred tours in Europe, promoting the Delta blues. DuChaine also speaks of the history of the blues, the men who developed it, and his involvement with some of them, to audiences, with songs such as \\"Shake Your Moneymaker\\", \\"Jitterbug Swing”, \\"Trouble in Mind\\" and \\"St James Infirmary Blues\\". The Times newspaper has named him as one of the five best concerts in the United Kingdom.

The General Assembly of the United Nations approved by consensus two resolutions presented by Bolivia. The first, entitled “Harmony with Nature,” asks to convene an interactive dialogue on International Mother Earth Day on April 22, 2011. Topics will include methods for promoting a holistic approach to harmony with nature, and an exchange of national experiences regarding criteria and indicators to measure sustainable development in harmony with nature. This resolution recognizes that “human beings are an inseparable part of nature, and that they cannot damage it without severely damaging themselves.” It also seeks to contribute to the preparatory process for the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development in 2012. Text of the proposal The proposal in its entirety, verbatim, follows. Preliminary Proposal of the Plurinational State of Bolivia for the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20) The achievement of sustainable development in the 21st Century requires a Social and Ecological Contract among human beings and our Mother Earth that brings together and builds upon the progress made in the World Charter for Nature (1982), the Rio Declaration (1992), the Earth Charter (2000), and the World People’s Conference on Climate Change and the Rights of Mother Earth (2010). It would include the following premises: I. WE ARE BREAKING THE BALANCE OF THE EARTH SYSTEM 1\\\\. Twenty years after the “Rio Declaration,” it is necessary to update its First Principle such that it would state: “Human beings and nature are at the center of concerns for sustainable development.” It is essential to get beyond this anthropocentric vision. Not only do human beings “have the right to a healthy life,” but so too does nature, which is the basis of survival for all species including humans. 2\\\\. Nature is not just a set of resources that can be exploited, modified, altered, privatized, commercialized and transformed without any consequences. Earth is the only home we have. The Earth does not belong to us; we belong to the Earth. 3\\\\. The Earth is a living system. It is an indivisible, interdependent and interrelated community human beings, nature, the atmosphere, the hydrosphere, and the geosphere. Any substantive alteration of one of its components can affect other areas and the entire system. The Earth is the source of life. It is a system that coordinates physical, chemical, biological and ecological elements in a manner that makes life possible. Through the term Mother Earth, we express this relationship of belonging to a system and respect for our home. 4\\\\. Human activity is altering the dynamics and functioning of the Earth system to a degree never before seen. We have exceeded the limits of our system. We have broken harmony with nature. We are living through a series of rising crises that could cause the collapse of the system. It is essential to restore, affirm and guarantee the existence, integrity, interrelation, interaction and regeneration of the Earth system as a whole and of all of its components. II. SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT IN THE 21ST CENTURY 5\\\\. In this century, the two central challenges of sustainable development are to overcome poverty and inequality, and to reestablish balance within the Earth system. Both objectives are intrinsically linked, and one cannot be achieved without the other. 6\\\\. It is essential to recognize and affirm that growth has limits. The pursuit of unending development on a finite planet is unsustainable and impossible. It is unsustainable and impossible. The limit to development is defined by the regenerative capacity of the Earth’s vital cycles. When growth begins to break that balance, as we see with global warming, we can no longer speak of it as development, but rather, the deterioration and destruction of our home. A certain level of growth and industrialization is needed to satisfy basic needs and guarantee the human rights of a population, but this level of “necessary development” is not about permanent growth, but rather, balance among humans and with nature. 7\\\\. Sustainable development seeks to eradicate poverty in order to live well, not generate wealthy people who live at the expense of the poor. The goal is the satisfaction of basic human needs in order to allow for the development of human capabilities and human happiness, strengthening community among human beings and with Mother Earth. In a world in which 1% of the population controls 50% of the wealth of the planet, it will not be possible to eradicate poverty or restore harmony with nature. 8\\\\. To end poverty and achieve an equitable distribution of well being, the basic resources and firms should be in the hands of the public sector and society. Only a society that controls its principal sources of income can aspire to a just distribution of the benefits needed to eliminate poverty. 9\\\\. The so-called “developed” countries must reduce their levels of over-consumption to reestablish harmony among human beings and with nature, allowing for the sustainable development of all developing countries. The ecological footprint of the developed countries is between 3 and 5 times larger than the average ecological footprint that the Earth system can sustain without an impact on its vital cycles. 10\\\\. The developing countries should follow new paradigms different from those used by developed countries in order to attend to the basic needs of their populations and reestablish harmony with nature. It is not sustainable or viable for all countries to follow the example of developed countries without causing our system to collapse. 11\\\\. Sustainable development cannot happen only at the national level. The well being of a country is only sustainable if it contributes to the well being of the entire system. The pillar of sustainable development can only be achieved from a global perspective. The so-called developed countries are still far from reaching sustainable development. III. TOOLS FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT 12\\\\. In an interdependent and interconnected system like that of Earth, we cannot recognize the rights of the human part of the system without affecting the rest of the system. To reestablish balance with nature, we must acknowledge its intrinsic value and clearly establish the obligations of humans toward nature, and also recognize that nature has rights that should be respected, promoted, and defended. Just as human beings have rights, the Mother Earth also has the right to exist, the right to maintain its vital cycles, the right to regeneration, the right to be free from structural alteration, and the right to relate to the other parts of the Earth system. Without respecting and guaranteeing the rights of nature, it is not possible to guarantee human rights and achieve sustainable development. 13\\\\. We have to end the system of consumption, waste and luxury. Millions of people are dying of hunger in the poorest parts of the globe, while in the richest areas, millions of dollars are spent to combat obesity. We must change the unsustainable patterns of consumption, production, and waste through public policy, regulations, and the conscious and active participation of society. This includes promoting ethics that value human beings for what they are, not what they have. 14\\\\. To guarantee the human right to water, education, health, communication, transportation, energy and sanitation, above all in the very poor and marginalized sectors, the provision of these services must be essentially public and based on efficient social management, not private business. 15\\\\. States should ensure the right of their populations to proper nutrition by strengthening food sovereignty policies that promote: a) food production by farmers, indigenous peoples and small agricultural producers; b) access to land, water, seeds, credit and other resources for family and community producers; c) the development of social and public enterprises for food production, distribution, and sale that prevent hoarding and contribute to the stability of food prices in domestic markets, thus halting speculative practices and the destruction of local production; d) the right of citizens to define what goods they wish to consume, the origins of those goods and how they are produced; e) consumption of what is necessary and the prioritization of local production; f) practices that contribute to reestablishing harmony with nature, avoiding greater desertification, deforestation, and destruction of biological diversity; g) the promotion of the use of indigenous seeds and traditional knowledge. Food production and commercialization must be socially regulated and cannot be left to free market forces. 16\\\\. Without water, there is no life. Humans and all living things have the right to water, but water also has rights. All States and peoples worldwide should work together in solidarity to ensure that loss of vegetation, deforestation, the pollution of the atmosphere and contamination are prevented from continuing to alter the hydrological cycle. These cause desertification, lack of food, temperature increase, sea level rise, migrations, acid rain, and physical-chemical changes that can cause ecosystems to die. 17\\\\. Forests are essential to the balance and integrity of planet Earth and a key element in the proper functioning of its ecosystems and the broader system of which we are a part. Thus we cannot consider them as simple providers of goods and services for human beings. The protection, preservation and recuperation of forests is required to reestablish the balance of the Earth system. Forests are not plantations that can be reduced to their capacity to capture carbon and provide environmental services. The maintenance of native forests and woodlands is essential for the water cycle, the atmosphere, biodiversity, the prevention of flooding, and the preservation of ecosystems. Forests are also home to indigenous peoples and communities. The preservation of forests should be pursued through integral and participatory management plans financed with public funding from developed countries. 18\\\\. It is essential to guarantee a real and effective reduction of greenhouse gases, particularly on the part of the developed countries historically responsible for climate change, in order to stabilize the increase in temperature to 1 °C during this century. We must therefore strengthen the Kyoto Protocol, not replace it with a more flexible voluntary agreement in which each country does what it chooses. It is necessary to eliminate carbon market mechanisms and offsets so that real domestic reductions are made within the countries with said obligations. 19\\\\. All forms of violence against women are incompatible with sustainable development, including violence done to women in militarily occupied territories and domestic or sexual violence that treats women as objects. 20\\\\. In order for sustainable development to exist, is essential to guarantee the full application of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. 21\\\\. Under the framework of common but differentiated responsibilities established in the 1992 Rio Declaration, the so-called developed countries must assume and pay their historical ecological debt for having contributed the most to the deterioration of the Earth system. The payment of this ecological debt to developing countries and the sectors most affected among their own populations consists of the transfer financial resources from public sources and also the effective transfer of appropriate technologies required by developing countries. 22\\\\. The resources developed countries dedicate to their defense, security and war budgets should be used to address the effects of climate change and the imbalance with nature. It is inexcusable that 1.5 trillion dollars in public funding are used on these budgets, while, to address the impacts of climate change in developing countries, they want to dedicate just 100 billion dollars from public and private funds as well as market sources by 2020. 23\\\\. To address the challenge of achieving sustainable development in the so-called developing countries, a financial transaction tax should be created to help build a Sustainable Development Fund that would be managed by developing countries. 24\\\\. Sustainable development requires a new international financial architecture to replace the World Bank and the IMF with entities that are democratic and transparent, that refrain from imposing conditions or structural adjustments, are controlled by the developing countries, and are based on the principles of solidarity and complementarity rather than commercialization and privatization. 25\\\\. It is essential to promote the exchange of scientific and technical knowledge and to remove intellectual property barriers to allow a true transfer of environmentally friendly technologies from developed countries to developing countries. An effective Technology Transfer Mechanism should be created based on the need for socially, culturally, and ecologically appropriate technologies in the countries of the South. This mechanism should not be a showcase for the sale of technologies by rich countries. 26\\\\. Intellectual property rights over genes, microorganisms and other forms of life are a threat to food sovereignty, biodiversity, access to medicine and other basic elements of the survival of low-income populations. All forms of intellectual property over life should be abolished. 27\\\\. Gross Domestic Product is not an adequate means of measuring the development and well being of a society. Thus it is necessary to create indicators for measuring the environmental destruction caused by certain economic activities in order to advance toward sustainable development in harmony with nature, integrating social and environmental aspects that are not aimed at the commercialization of nature and its functions. 28\\\\. Respect for the sovereignty of States is essential in the management and protection of nature under the framework of cooperation among States. 29\\\\. There is no single solution for all peoples. Human beings are diverse. Our peoples have their own unique cultures and identities. To destroy a culture is to threaten the identity of an entire people. Capitalism attempts to homogenize us all to convert us into consumers. There has not been, nor will there ever be, a single model for life that can save the world. We live and act in a pluralistic world, and a pluralistic world should respect diversity, which is itself synonymous with life. Respect for peaceful and harmonious complementarity among the diverse cultures and economies, without exploitation or discrimination against any single one, is essential for saving the planet, humanity, and life. 30\\\\. Peace is essential for sustainable development. There is no worse aggression against humanity and Mother Earth than war and violence. War destroys life. Nobody and nothing is safe from war. Those that fight suffer, as do those that are forced to go without bread in order to feed the war. Wars squander life and natural resources. 31\\\\. An International Tribunal of Environmental and Climate Justice must be established to judge and sanction crimes against nature that transcend national borders, violating the rights of nature and affecting humanity. 32\\\\. The problems affecting humanity and nature are global in nature, and to address them requires the exercise of global democracy through the development of mechanisms of consultation and decision-making such as referendums, plebiscites, or popular consultations so that the citizens of the world as a whole may speak. 33\\\\. Sustainable development is incompatible with all forms of imperialism and neocolonialism. It is essential to end the imposition of conditionalities, military interventions, coups and different forms of blackmail in order to stop imperialism and neocolonialism. 34\\\\. The collective global response needed to confront the crisis we face requires structural changes. We must change the system, not the climate or the Earth system. In the hands of capitalism, everything is converted into merchandise: water, earth genomes, ancestral cultures, justice, ethics, life. It is essential to develop a pluralistic system based on the culture of life and harmony among human beings and with nature; a system that promotes sustainable development in the framework of solidarity, complementarity, equity, social and economic justice, social participation, respect for diversity, and peace. IV. DANGEROUS AND FALSE SOLUTIONS 35\\\\. Not all that glitters is gold. Not all that is labeled “green” is environmentally friendly. We must use the precautionary principle and deeply analyze the different “green” alternatives that are presented before proceeding with their experimentation and implementation. 36\\\\. Nature cannot be subject to manipulation by new technologies without consequences in the future. History shows us that many dangerous technologies have been released in the market before their environmental or health impacts are known, or before their social and economic impacts on poor people and developing countries are understood. This is currently the case with genetically modified organisms, agrochemicals, biofuels, nanotechnology, and synthetic biology. These technologies should be avoided. 37\\\\. Geoengineering and all forms of artificial manipulation of the climate should be prohibited, for they bring the enormous risk of further destabilizing the climate, biodiversity and nature. 38\\\\. It is necessary to create public and multilateral mechanisms within the United Nations to evaluate in an independent manner and without conflict of interest the potential environmental, health, social, and economic impacts of new technologies before they are spread. This mechanism must involve transparency and social participation by potentially affected groups. 39\\\\. The current ecological and climate crisis has put in jeopardy all of life on planet Earth, and thus it requires deep solutions based on the real causes of the climate crisis. It cannot be reduced to a simple market failure, which is a reductionist and narrow view. 40\\\\. The solution is not to put a price on nature. Nature is not a form of capital. The green economy should not distort the fundamental principles of sustainable development. It is wrong to say that we only value that which has a price, an owner, and brings profits. The market mechanisms that permit exchange among human beings and nations have proven incapable of contributing to an equitable distribution of wealth. To use an approach based on market principles and private appropriation to try to resolve the problem of inequality – itself a product of capitalism – is like trying to put out a fire with gasoline. 41\\\\. It is wrong to fragment nature into “environmental services” with a monetary value for market exchange. It is wrong to put a price on the capacity of forests to act as carbon sinks, and worse to promote their commercialization as does REDD (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation). The market for carbon credits based on forests will lead to: a) noncompliance with effective emission reduction commitments by developed countries; b) the bulk of resources being appropriated by intermediaries and financial entities and rarely benefiting countries, indigenous peoples and forests themselves; c) the generation of speculative bubbles based on the sale and purchase of said certificates; and d) the establishment of new property rights over the capacity of forests to capture carbon dioxide, which will clash with the sovereign rights of States and the indigenous peoples that live in forests. To promote market mechanisms based on the economic needs of developing countries is a new form of neocolonialism. 42\\\\. “Green” capitalism will bring about natural resource grabbing, displacing humanity and nature from the essential elements needed for their survival. The drive for profit, instead of reestablishing harmony within the system, will provoke even greater imbalances, concentrations of wealth, and speculative processes. V. GLOBAL GOVERNMENT AND SOCIAL PARTICIPATION 43\\\\. It is necessary to establish a United Nations organization to promote sustainable development in harmony with nature. This organization should articulate and unite the different authorities involved in order to avoid overlapping efforts and achieve effective coordination. Developing countries should have majority representation in said organization, and its functioning should be democratic, transparent, and accountable. 44\\\\. This organization should articulate all of the conventions regarding nature without leaving aside issues central to the United Nations, such as water. 45\\\\. Social participation is essential in this new organization. Workers, women, farmers, indigenous peoples, young people, scientists, and all sectors of society should be represented. The private sector cannot have the same amount of influence as the social sectors, given that, by definition, its goal is to create profit rather than social wellbeing. Effective mechanisms for interaction among all social actors are required.

It was designed and built at the Rogozarski factory in Belgrade. Design, construction and development The Rogozarski R-313 was a two-seater twin-engined fighter/light bomber/reconnaissance aircraft. It was powered by two in-line Walter Sagitta IIR engines, both fitted with a compressor; each was capable of 493 hp. The elliptical, wooden fuselage was covered in plywood which was also used to 'skin' the round-tipped, trapezoidal wings. The engine nacelles also housed the landing gear. The tail-wheel was, like the main landing gear, retractable. The fuel tank was located in the centre section between the wings. The reconnaissance variant of this aircraft was due to be equipped with a camera, a radio, a fixed 20mm cannon and a single FN 7.9mm machine gun, flexibly mounted. As a light bomber, the plane would carry four 106 kg 'Stankovic' bombs inside the fuselage.Ч. Јанић; Р-313, Београд, Operational history This aircraft did not get beyond the prototype stage. However, such characteristics as speed, rate of climb and distance required for take-off compared favourably with contemporary fighters. Only the relative lack of engine power let it down. Adopting the more powerful Daimler-Benz DB 601 or the Rolls-Royce \\"Merlin\\" was discussed but came to nothing with the outbreak of war. A total of 25 aircraft were planned, both reconnaissance and light bomber versions. The prototype became part of 603 training squadron which was located at Grab, near Trebinje during the April war. It was damaged and abandoned attempting to take-off from Grab on 12 April 1941. A month later, the Germans took control and sold the machine to the Croats who had taken over the 'Ikarus' factory. They renamed the aircraft \\"Независни\\" (\\"Independent\\"); after repairs, a test flight was carried out on 19 May 1942. Sabotage was then detected, so serious that further repairs could not be carried out.Љ.

A custom house has been present in the area since the 14th century, and a building on its current site has been rebuilt on a number of occasions. Today the Custom House is used by Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs. The address is 20 Lower Thames Street, . History Ground floor plan, 1817 Until 1814, the Custom House stood in the parish of All Hallows Barking, immediately to the east of the present site. The site was long known as \\"Wool Quay\\", and, from the medieval period, a custom house was necessary there to levy the duty payable on exported wool. Such a building is recorded as early as 1377. The quay and the buildings on it were privately owned. Around 1380, one John Churchman built a custom house there to collect dues for the City of London, and in 1382 the Crown came to an agreement to use its facilities. Churchman's custom house remained in use until 1559, the freehold passing through various hands. Its replacement was erected under the direction of William Paulet, Marquess of Winchester, the Lord High Treasurer. A print from 1663 shows it as a three-storey building, with octagonal staircase towers. This structure was destroyed in the Great Fire of 1666. The Custom House as designed by Thomas Ripley The post-fire replacement was on a rather larger scale, to the designs of Christopher Wren. The original estimate was for £6,000, but the eventual cost was more than £10,000. The new building was short-lived: in January 1715 a fire, which began in a nearby house, damaged it beyond repair, and a new, larger structure was built to the designs of Thomas Ripley, \\"Master-Carpenter\\" to the board of Customs. This necessitated the acquisition of ground to the north, fronting onto Thames Street, and the east. The main body of the new building, however, had the same plan as Wren's, and may have re-used its foundations, but was of three, rather than two storeys. Present building Laing's Custom House, before the collapse and rebuilding of the central section With the growth of trade, the opening of the docks, and the increases in duties during the Napoleonic wars, larger premises became necessary in the early nineteenth century. To meet this need, a new building was begun to the designs of David Laing in October 1813, on a site immediately to the west of Ripleys's building, where Bear Quay, Crown Quay, Dice Quay, and Horner's Quay had once been. Laing had held the position of surveyor to HM Customs since 1810. On 12 February 1814, the old building was destroyed by fire, resulting in the explosion of gunpowder and spirits. As a result, papers were retrieved from as far as Hackney Marshes. The northern front of Laing's new building was plain, but the south front towards the river had wings with Ionic colonnades and a projecting centre section. The attic storey of the latter was decorated with terracotta figures in bas-relief by John Charles Felix Rossi and J. G. BubbJames George Bubb - A Biographical Dictionary of Sculptors in Britain, 1660-1851, Henry Moore Foundation website representing the arts and sciences, commerce and industry, and inhabitants of various countries of the world. A clock dial, nine feet in diameter, was supported by colossal figures symbolising Industry and Plenty, and the royal arms by figures of Ocean and Commerce. The riverfront was 488feet inches long, and the building cost £255,000. The Long Room in Laing's Custom House (1808) As originally built, the interior contained warehouses, cellars, about 170 offices, and a \\"Long room\\", measuring, 190 by 66 feet. On the ground floor was the \\"Queen's warehouse\\", with a rib-vaulted ceiling. The cellars in the basement were fireproof and used to store wine and spirits seized by the customs. =Partial collapse= In 1825, the timber pilings which served as foundations for the custom house gave way, leading to a partial collapse of the building. On investigation, it soon became clear that the building contractors Miles and Peto had grossly underestimated the cost of the work and had started to cut corners. The foundations were totally inadequate, even though the ground was known to be unstable. Mile and Peto had used beechwood piles in the foundations rather than the oak that had been specified to counter the alternate damp and dry, and where the original plans had required nine piles under the twelve piers supporting the Long Room, they had only provided four under some and three under others - with only two piles under two of the piers. The piles were also found to be too narrow and so crooked they were impossible to drive properly.Sir Samuel Morton Peto, Bart, 1809 - 1889 by the Revd. Dr. Edward C. Brooks, first chapter. Further investigation showed: * that instead of paying the one shilling per pile to the pile drivers as they had claimed, Miles and Peto had only paid d per pile, * although Miles and Peto had invoiced for a total of 104,000 ft of piling, it was discovered that only 53,300 ft had actually been driven, * although Miles and Peto had charged for certain arches as though they were solid brickwork, after investigation, they were found to have been filled with chalk lime and stone waste that would have cost little more than the labour of conveying it there, * the south front steps were charged as if solid brickwork but were found to be filled with similar stone waste, * stone paving had been charged as if it were 6inches thick but was found to be only inches, * the roof boarding under the slates had been charged for as new and the best materials, but was found to be re- used old boarding. The poor quality of some of the workmanship prompted questions in Parliament in 1825 with the Chancellor of the Exchequer declaring the most scandalous frauds had been practised. Miles and Peto were censured for neglect and poor workmanship that a good builder would carefully have avoided. =Rebuilding= The Long Room The central section was rebuilt on new foundations, to a new design with Ionic columns by Robert Smirke, at the cost of £180,000. Current use The building is still currently used by Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs; however, the government has announced that it is to be closed and sold off in 2020.

It had an elongated snout lined laterally with barbed \\"teeth\\", or denticles.  Taxonomy  Despite formerly being classified within a family of extinct sawfish-like rays known as Sclerorhynchidae, phylogenetic analyses indicate that Ischyrhiza, Schizorhiza, and Onchopristis form a distinct clade that groups closer with the extant family Rajidae, which contains the true skates, possibly rendering the suborder Sclerorhynchoidei paraphyletic.  Description  restoration with the contemporary Mawsonia/Axelrodichthys The rostrum, or snout, was around long, lined with barbed \\"teeth\\" or denticles. In the type species, O. numidus, each tooth had one barb, but in O. dunklei there were two to five barbs on each tooth, and two to three in O. d. praecursor. This sclerorynchid was about long.This huge ancient sawfish had harpoons on its faceDenticle comparison with other sawfish and sclerorhynchid species, (O. numidus in red and O. dunklei in green)  Paleobiology  As with the modern sawfish, Onchopristis' eyes were on top of its head, to spot predators rather than prey, and its mouth and gills were under its body. The rostrum most likely would have had electroreceptors to detect food in the water below them like most modern sharks and some rays. Onchopristis may have raked through the riverbed to find and then eat prey.  Predators  It is thought that some species of Onchopristis may have migrated up rivers to breed. At the height of the breeding season, piscivores like Spinosaurus aegyptiacus may have preyed upon the them. References * Dutheil, D.B., Brito, P.M., 2009.

The species is solely known from the Middle Miocene, late Bartovian stage, Pacific Union Site in the Stewart Valley Group, Mineral County, Nevada. History and classification Agulla mineralensis is known only from one fossil, the holotype, specimen number 539. The specimen is composed of a complete specimen of an isolated hind-wing which is preserved as a compression fossil in sedimentary paper shale. The fossil was recovered from outcrops of the Stewart Valley group shales at the Pacific Union site, BLM locality #26-30-09-335, in Mineral County, Nevada, USA. A. mineralensis was first studied by Michael S. Engel of the University of Kansas, Lawrence, Kansas, USA. His 2009 type description of the new species was published in the journal Transactions of the Kansas Academy of Science. Engel coined the specific epithet mineralensis in honor of Mineral County, where the species was found. At the time of the species description, Agulla mineralensis was the only member of the order Raphidioptera to be found in Neogene aged fossil deposits in North America. Description The lone specimen of Agulla mineralensis is approximately in length and a maximum of in width. The presence of distinct M and Cu veins in the very basal section of the wing denotes the wing is a hind- wing. The wing is apparently hyaline in coloration with a slight darkening of the pterostigma area. The subcostal space is about half the width of the preserved section of the costal space. The notably long M vein prior to separation into MP and MA veins in A. mineralensis distinguishes the species from other Tertiary raphidiids with described hind-wings. While the elongated pterostigma is similar to the extinct species Raphidia mortua and Raphidia funerata, the M vein length and less branching of the veins near the wing tip separate them from A. mineralensis.

It is the seat of the Diocese of Crookston. The present Cathedral was dedicated September 25, 1990 and is designed in the modern style. Prominent within the cathedral is the magnificent organ which is Opus 2132 of the Reuter Organ Company of Lawrence, Kansas. It is a two-manual, 31-rank instrument that contains approximately 1789 pipes. The cathedral's west bell tower features a shrine to the Holy Family. The Blessed Sacrament Chapel located in the southwest corner of the church, houses the cathedral's Tabernacle, as well as the cathedral's reliquary, and shrine to Our Lady of Guadeloupe. It replaced the previous cathedral of the same name which had been built in 1912 at the intersection of North Ash Street and Second Avenue. The earlier Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception is unusual for having three spires on its Neo-Gothic facade, whereas most Neo-Gothic churches have two. Architect Bert Keck designed this church, along with the former Cathedral of the Sacred Heart in Duluth, Minnesota. None of these buildings serve as churches any longer. Keck's design included two balconies, on the north and the south side of the church, for antiphonal choir responses. It also has a large choir balcony in the rear of the church for the choir and organ. Bishop Timothy J. Corbett, the first bishop of the newly formed Diocese of Crookston, organized the construction of the cathedral. The structure was added to the National Register of Historic Places on October 1, 1989. After the Diocese dedicated the new cathedral, it transferred ownership of the former structure to a homeless shelter which used the rectory for additional space. The shelter removed the stained glass windows from the sanctuary and gave some to parish members, with the rest sold to provide funding for its programs. In 2001, a windstorm caused severe damage to the remaining stained glass, causing air and rain to leak into the building. The flat roofs of the sacristies were failing at the time of transfer and subsequently caused a lot of damage. The North Sacristy has been completely gutted, and the rest of the clean-up is scheduled for 2018 when doors can be opened again.

It can transfer up to 7 sterol molecules per minute between artificial membranes.  Function  STARD4 may regulate cholesterol levels in many cells, including in the liver. STARD4 has specifically been linked to the movement of cholesterol to the endoplasmic reticulum. The protein is associated with the endoplasmic reticulum and lipid droplets. Increases in the protein relate to cell stress. High levels of STARD4 increases the synthesis of bile acids and cholesterol esters in liver hepatocytes. Reductions in cholesterol synthesis by cells increase STARD4 levels while StarD4 declines in mice fed a high cholesterol diet. Increases in levels of either master gene regulator SREBP-1a or SREBP2, which both promote the production of proteins involved in cholesterol synthesis, increase StarD4 levels in mouse liver. Conversely, increased STARD4 increases active SREBP2 levels. Loss of the protein in mice has little effect. Mice without functional STARD4 weigh less and females tend to have lower cholesterol profiles. The most dramatic change observed to date is a reduction in NPC-1, a protein involved in bringing cholesterol into cells. Structure The protein is 205 amino acids long in the human (224 in the mouse) and almost entirely consists of a StAR-related transfer (START) domain. It also lends its name to the subgroup of START domain proteins it is part of, StarD4. This subfamily includes STARD5 and STARD6 and is closely related to the StarD1/D3 group.

History  Their self-titled debut album, Treefight for Sunlight, was released in the United Kingdom in February 2011, and received mixed reviews. Whilst general critical opinion was rarely against the album, concerns were raised that there wasn't enough power in it to ensure a successful career. Music blog DrownedinSound noted that while the album 'suggest[ed] potential' it was not well enough formed to earn a place in the UK music scene. By contrast, Clashmusic said of the group that 'the pace is infectious and small helpings will sweeten your day'. The single \\"Facing the Sun\\" fared better, with The Recommender saying that the band captured the feel they were aiming for 'remarkably well'. The Guardian called it 'one of the most glorious things we've heard all year'. The group have been compared in style to the Fleet Foxes and MGMT. Music guide Allmusic said that Treefight for Sunlight \\"could've been plucked from the Elephant 6 Collective\\".

Recently NASA named an asteroid in honor of the three generations of Knorre astronomers. Life and work Knorre was born in Dorpat, Russian Empire in present-day Estonia, the son of Ernst Friedrich Knorre, a German-born astronomer, and his wife Sophie (née Senff). Although Knorre's father died in 1801 when he was just 9 years old, the elder scientist's career as a professor of mathematics at the Universität Dorpat where he was also chief Observator for the Dorpat observatory, had already made a strong impression on the young boy who applied himself enthusiastically to the study of math and science. He gave private lessons in mathematics and Latin to other pupils of his school and even to adults, earning enough money to help his impoverished mother to pay for his education. The family had taken refuge with Knorre's uncle, Karl August Senff, a professor of painting at the university and with his help, Knorre was able to enter into a course of study there at the age of 15. Knorre was determined to continue in his father's footsteps as an astronomer, taking up the bulk of his unfinished work, but Senff felt that the clergy was a more secure means of self-support for a poor orphan, and urged him to study theology. Although he dutifully entered into the divinity program, Knorre still managed to attend several astronomy lectures and became devoted to the subject, largely educating himself in the ensuing years. He eventually availed himself to the new head of the observatory, Wilhelm Struve, who agreed to accept Knorre as an assistant. Under Struve's tutelage, Knorre had the opportunity to acquire a decisive experience in geodesy and had earned such esteem by the age of nineteen that Struve recommended him to Admiral Aleksey Greig who was looking for \\"a young and intelligent astronomer, able to help him to equip an observatory in Nikolayev on the Black Sea.\\" The challenge for Knorre was the equipment of the observatory. He asked for a business trip to tour the other important observatories of Europe, and when Greig agreed, set off on a journey by stagecoach that was to take more than two years. In Germany, he visited Friedrich Bessel, Johann Franz Encke, and Heinrich Christian Schumacher and, in Paris, he called on François Arago. From there he also went to both Greenwich and Dublin, largely in pursuit of manufacturers of good chronographs. Back home he discussed with admiral Greig his impressions and ordered the equipment for the observatory. In his equipment there was a mercuric artificial horizon mirror. To exclude measurement failures it was possible to look with the telescope direct to the stars or indirect via the mercurial mirror. Knorre was member of the Royal Astronomical Society. He was married three times, first to Elisabeth of Dieterichs (m. 1829) who died just three years later, next to her younger sister Dorothea von Dieterichs (m. 1833) who died at the age of 37 after giving birth to 13 children, and lastly to Emilie Gavel (m. 1852) who survived him in death. Knorre had fifteen children who survived infancy, of which the best known was his fifth son, the astronomer Viktor Knorre. He moved to Berlin in 1862 to study astronomy. Knorre retired 1871 from the Directorship of the Observatory in Nikolajew and moved to Berlin to be with his son Viktor. He died there in 1883.

Synurbization refers to the effects of urbanization on the adaptation of wildlife, and how animals that live in urban environments versus nature environments differ. Urbanization, in terms of ecology, means developmental changes to the environment. These changes are often in benefit to humans. When applying synurbization to circumstances of urbanization where species have adapted, that adaptation does not occur by accident. Animals making adaptations to the environment change are often only doing so because of urban expansion into their current environments—e.g., the expansion of cities removing forested areas occupied species such as birds. Urbanization causes synurbization. Animals change behaviour as required for survival. Those species that better adapt and have favourable variations in traits ultimately have higher fitness. However, while some of the behavioural adaptations are favourable for the species, consequences stem from the urbanization and impact these species. In some cases, even humans are victims to these consequences. Changes in the behaviour When compared to species that live in natural environments, the differences between those species and the urbanized species is clear. These adaptational changes in behaviour have been labeled as \\"urban wildlife syndrome\\" since the changes in one species is not exclusive to that one species, instead, it has been visible over multiple species. Changes in behaviour have been documented in many species responding to urban expansion into their habitats. = Population density increase = Including the correlation between other variables, such as aggression and wariness, multiple studies show a population density increase. Population density is the population number in one unit of area at a given time. The increase in population density has been highly correlated with the reduction in species wariness, as well as their intra-specie aggression. As population density increases, wariness of humans decreases- this is known as a negative correlation. As population density increases, intra-specific aggression increases- this is known as a positive correlation. Park spaces in urbanized spaces may contribute to this population density increase. These parks allow for species to mate, and access and be fed food by humans, with little to no predation. = Decreased wariness = Wariness is the observable fear that animals feel when encountering humans. They may be startled or retreat rapidly. Previous research hypothesized that population density is the main influence on this behavioural change. While coexisting with humans, it is logical that overtime animals become accustomed to human presence. However, not only are these animals less startled by humans, but they also are willing to approach and physically interact with humans. This tameness results from human willingness to feed these animals. Easy access to food changes natural behaviour in rural animal populations. = Increased intra-specific aggression = Intra-specific aggression is the aggression toward members of their own species. Similar to reduced wariness, the increase in intra-specific aggression may be the result of the increase in population density. Having more members of a species in a smaller unit area, all whilst still competing for the same resources is likely to have the outcome of higher aggression levels. = Increased lifespan = Squirrel having easy access to food due to humans having feeders for the wildlife. Animals living in urbanized populations are on average living substantially longer than their rural species populations. This is due to many factors such as: * Reduced migrations- The climate conditions and access to food seasonally has reduced the need for migratory species to leave during the colder seasons. Migratory species also face dangerous conditions and require high energy levels to endue a migration; without this need, the animals are being more safe and saving themselves time, and energy be remaining sedentary. * Longer breeding season- The sedentary lifestyle from the reduction of migration, as well as the preferential climate, allows the animals to breed for much longer periods of time compared to the rural populations. * Access to food- Since these animals live in urban areas, they encounter humans daily. Whether these are humans in a public park, a street, or even their own backyard; where there is a human, there is likely food. The reduction of wariness is favourable to animals in this sense because they can approach people in parks or the streets, and as a result gain food in return. Many people also have feeders in their backyard; another way for animals to easily access food. Favourable conditions- easier access to food, an abundance of sheltered areas, low predation, and favourable climates. = Change in the circadian rhythm = Some hypothesize that changes in circadian rhythm are because of artificial light from street lights, cars, homes, and large signs. = Change in nesting habits = In birds specifically, those in urban environments, use much different nesting materials than their counterpart rural populations. Birds in rural areas use materials such as twigs, grass, moss, and other naturally occurring materials for their nests, whereas urbanized birds have less access to these types of materials and have had to adapt to using other materials. Instead of nesting in trees, they can find shelter in the infrastructure of buildings and bridges, and public parks. Consequences of urban development The main consequence of urban development for wildlife is a decrease in its species and ecological diversity. The growing tendency towards synurbization observed in birds and mammals is a chance for enriching diversity of urban wildlife. Synurbization of some species could cause practical problems when their populations grow to high concentrations. An example of such problems is Canada goose in North American cities.Luniak , Maciej ,Synurbization[w]: Warsaw wild life:notes,Warszawa, 2008 References Category:Ecological processes Category:Neologisms ","title":"Synurbization"},{"id":"33187288","text":"Jorn Utzon's house, Hellebæk Utzon's House in Hellebæk is a one-storey private home in Hellebæk, not far from Helsingør, in Denmark's northern Zealand. Built by the world-famous architect Jørn Utzon for his family and himself in 1952, its innovative design was welcomed by the world of architecture. History Apart from a watertower in Svaneke on Bornholm, this was Utzon's first completed work although he had already won many competitions. During the Second World War, Utzon went to Stockholm to study the work of Gunnar Asplund. In the winter of 1943–44, there was an exhibition of modern American architecture where Utzon was particularly taken by Frank Lloyd Wright's houses which led him to study Wright's work in more detail. Wright's concern with nature and the characteristics of each building site as well as the need for attention to internal and external space convinced him that each project required its own special approach.Tobias Faber, \\"130 kvm\\" in Utzons egne huse, Copenhagen, Arkitektens Forlag, 2004, pp. 28–30. da icon After his family moved to Helsingør in 1937, Utzon — who was then 18 — became ever more attached to the area. The house remained his base for the rest of his life. \\"It's my laboratory,\\" he once commented. It was in his Hellebæk study that he began working on the design of the Sydney Opera House in 1959.Christian Krabbe Barfoed, \\"Utzon begraves i Hellebæk\\", BT.dk, 2 December 2008. Retrieved 24 September 2011. When Utzon started building the house on the edge of Hellebæk Forest just outside the small town of Hellebæk, it was rumoured that an innovative approach to one-family homes was in the making. Architects of considerable repute visited the site to monitor progress. Utzon himself directed the building work without any technical plans. As the building developed, he would often change its shape, rather like building a sand castle. He had learnt this approach in Finland in 1946 when he had spent a few months with Alvar Aalto who had used exactly the same method for his Villa Mairea. Aalto maintained it was the most economical solution for his client. Architecture A long, narrow, one story building with a flat-roof, it rises slightly above the gently sloping site on a brick platform. The southern facade consists solely of windows, allowing lots of light into the open-plan living room with a freestanding fireplace. The bedrooms have no windows apart from skylights.\\"Brick Bulletin Spring 09\\". Retrieved 24 September 2011. After experimenting with a few models, Utzon tells us he first built a full-size wooden version of the house in order to gain an impression of how a house with 130 square metres of living space would look in practice. Careful consideration was given to the surroundings: sun, view and shelter from the wind. The result was that he decided to have a completely closed wall along the northern side and an open glass wall for the southern facade. The builders agreed to work under Utzon's direction without plans. The north wall was first completed so as to establish the basic geometry. The kitchen and bathroom were then added and the remaining rooms were arranged with movable pinewood partitions and doors in order to facilitate any subsequent alterations. The materials used inside and outside are the same: yellow-white bricks, Oregon pine and aluminium. Yellow tiling is used both at the top of the walls — with hard-baked tiles — and in the kitchen, grill niche and shower as well as for the fireplace. The absence of windows in the children's rooms along the north wall has been mentioned as a possible disadvantage but they were lit by skylights.Jørn Utzon in Utzons egne huse, Arkitektens Forlag, Copenhagen 2004, pp. 38–39, first published in Arkitekten Månedshæfte No. 1, January 1953. Utzon's summed up his ideas about the house when he commented: \\"What is important for me is that the architectonic approach or system behind a house should not limit the house's function and thereby hamper life inside.\\" Later developments Not long before he died, Jørn Utzon had entrusted his son Jan with modernization work on the house and alterations to cater to his old age. The work was still in progress at the time of his death. In accordance with his own wishes, Utzon was buried in Hellebæk churchyard where his father and brother also rest.\\"Utzon begraves i Hellebæk lørdag: Jørn Utzon får sit sidste hvilested i familie-gravstedet på Hellebæk Kirkegård\\", Folketidende.dk, 2 December 2008. Retrieved 24 September 2011. Influence Utzon's design was widely imitated in the 1950s, first for one-family homes and later on a larger scale, when the Louisiana Museum in Humlebæk was built by Vilhelm Wohlert and Jørgen Bo in 1958. Halidor Gunnløgsson and Erik Christian Sørensen were among those who emulated Utzon's approach, developing a new Danish trend.Kim Dirckinck-Holmfeld and Martin Keiding in Utzons egne huse, Arkitektens Forlag, Copenhagen 2004, p. 10.

It is named after Brenda Baker, who announced it in a 1983 conference and published it in the Journal of the ACM in 1994. The idea for Baker's technique is to break the graph into layers, such that the problem can be solved optimally on each layer, then combine the solutions from each layer in a reasonable way that will result in a feasible solution. This technique has given PTASs for the following problems: subgraph isomorphism, maximum independent set, minimum vertex cover, minimum dominating set, minimum edge dominating set, maximum triangle matching, and many others. The bidimensionality theory of Erik Demaine, Fedor Fomin, Hajiaghayi, and Dimitrios Thilikos and its offshoot simplifying decompositions (,) generalizes and greatly expands the applicability of Baker's technique for a vast set of problems on planar graphs and more generally graphs excluding a fixed minor, such as bounded genus graphs, as well as to other classes of graphs not closed under taking minors such as the 1-planar graphs. Example of technique The example that we will use to demonstrate Baker's technique is the maximum weight independent set problem. =Algorithm= INDEPENDENT-SET(G, w, \\\\epsilon) Choose an arbitrary vertex r k = 1/\\\\epsilon find the breadth-first search levels for G rooted at r \\\\pmod k: \\\\\\\\{V_0,V_1, \\\\ldots, V_{k-1} \\\\\\\\} for \\\\ell = 0, \\\\ldots, k-1 find the components G^\\\\ell_1, G^\\\\ell_2, \\\\ldots, of G after deleting V_\\\\ell for i = 1,2, \\\\ldots compute S_i^\\\\ell, the maximum- weight independent set of G_i^\\\\ell S^\\\\ell = \\\\cup_i S_i^\\\\ell let S^{\\\\ell^*} be the solution of maximum weight among \\\\\\\\{S^0,S^1, \\\\ldots, S^{k-1} \\\\\\\\} return S^{\\\\ell^*} Notice that the above algorithm is feasible because each S^\\\\ell is the union of disjoint independent sets. =Dynamic programming= Dynamic programming is used when we compute the maximum-weight independent set for each G_i^\\\\ell. This dynamic program works because each G_i^\\\\ell is a k-outerplanar graph. Many NP-complete problems can be solved with dynamic programming on k-outerplanar graphs. Baker's technique can be interpreted as covering the given planar graphs with subgraphs of this type, finding the solution to each subgraph using dynamic programming, and gluing the solutions together.

The organization was formerly named the Makers of Memories Foundation.  History  The Makers of Memories Foundation was established in 2007 by marketing and media entrepreneur Brian F. Martin. Martin was raised in a family with chronic, serious abuse and created the Foundation to help families and children overcome the trauma of domestic violence they experienced and to pursue more positive possibilities in their lives. In 2007 and 2008 the Foundation hosted journeys for families which combined a restorative experience along with educational and therapeutic services. Financial author David Bach and the Central Park jogger, Trisha Mieli, participated in the intervention programs. In 2011, the Foundation announced the launch of a national, comprehensive Action Plan with five elements: research, education, support services, intervention programs and shelter support. The Foundation continues to work with key leaders from the Department of Justice to ensure these challenges are faced with support from the government. The Foundation also partnered with the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence for the \\"Congressional Hearing on The Impact of Domestic Violence on Children\\" in October, 2011 on Capitol Hill to educate American policy makers about the problem of domestic violence on children. In late 2012 the organization was renamed \\"Childhood Domestic Violence Association\\" to better capture the message of the organization.  Leadership  Brian F. Martin, founder, serves as chairman of the board of directors. Martin is the chairman and founder of Brand Connections. The advisory committee includes a number of leading domestic violence experts, including Jeffrey Edleson, Professor of Psychology at the University of Minnesota, Sandra Graham–Bermann, Professor of Psychology at the University of Michigan, and Renee McDonald, Associate Professor of Psychology at Southern Methodist University. The advisory committee also includes author and authority on leadership psychology Tony Robbins and Brand Connections CEO Sherry Orel. Bill Livermore was appointed executive director in 2011.  Programs  The Foundation's Action Plan includes initiatives related to the effects of domestic on children and also on adults who experienced domestic violence as children; intervention programs focused on building resiliency in affected children and adults and preventing vulnerable children from experiencing domestic violence; support services for affected children and adults; educational materials to raise awareness about the problem of childhood exposure to domestic violence; and material aid and support for domestic violence shelters. The foundation also speaks out against public policy that damages laws protecting the victims of domestic violence. The Makers of Memories Foundation began production on a documentary film, 43 Million Secrets, in April 2011. The film profiles a family that has been devastated by domestic violence and includes interviews with experts in the field of domestic violence, law enforcement officials and adults and children who have experienced violence in their homes. The Foundation plans to use the film as an educational tool to inform the public about the effects of domestic violence on children, adults and society. Release of the film is scheduled for Spring 2012. The Foundation convened a summit of scholars and interventionists in April 2010 in New York to identify the most promising existing intervention programs to help children impacted by domestic violence and to develop a new intervention program model focused on prevention. That research led to a partnership will partner with MINCAVA, of the University of Minnesota School of Social Work to launch a pilot program in 2012 that uses informal family protective networks to provide assistance and support to children who have experienced domestic violence and are at risk. Congressman John Conyers, as the ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee, works with Makers of Memories and recently called for an oversight hearing to assess where the government is in their work on the impact of domestic violence on children, and what more can and should be done. On January 16, 2012, Brian F. Martin appeared on the \\"Dr. Phil\\" TV Show to discuss childhood exposure to domestic violence. On October 1, 2012, Makers of Memories renamed itself as Childhood Domestic Violence Association to assist the public in understanding the purpose of the foundation. On October 5, 2012, The documentary 43 million secrets was re-titled \\"The Children Next Door\\", funded by the Childhood Domestic Violence Association, it was released on the independent film festival circuit where it won 25 awards from different festivals.

It is located in the zone comprising lagoons with salt marshes and backwaters, submerged under water during high tide and forming an arm of the sea with the opening to the Bay of Bengal at the creek. The zone is spread over an area of 4 km2, and the creek covers an area of 2.25 km2. It is located 20 km north of the city centre and 2.6 km south of the Ennore Port, and the creek area stretches 3 km into the sea and 5 km along the coast. The creek is nearly 400 m wide, elongated in northeast–southwest direction and merging with the backwater bodies. Once a flourishing mangrove swamp, the creek has been degraded to patches in the fringes mainly due to human activities in the region. The depth of the creek varies from 1 to 2 m and is shallow near the mouth. The north–south trending channels of the creek connect it with the Pulicat Lake to the north and to the distributaries of the Kosasthalaiyar River in the south. The northwestern part of the creek merges with the tidal flats. The soil in the region is of loamy and alluvial types. Most of the area consists of tracts of alluvial soil and the eastern region comprises beach dunes, tidal flats and creek. The creek is oriented from west to east and opens into the Bay of Bengal to the east at Ennore. The creek acts as an outlet for the excess water from the Poondi Reservoir. The creek separates the town of Ennore from the Ennore Port located in the north and the Kattupalli Shipyard located further north. The North Chennai Thermal Power Station is located at the north of the creek and the Ennore Thermal Power Station is located to the south. The creek is part of the Pulicat water system, including the Pulicat lagoon and the Buckingham Canal. As per the 1991 Coastal Regulation Zone notification, the entire Pulicat water system is designated CRZ I. The creek is experiencing siltation due to emergence of the Ennore Port. Ecology and drainage According to the Department of Environment, the zone covers an area of 6,469 acres of the creek identified as a tidal waterbody protected as a No-Development zone under CRZ-I regulations. The region is drained by a couple of seasonal rivers, namely, Araniar River flowing in the north and Kosasthalaiyar River passing through the creek, fed chiefly by the northeast monsoon and the cyclonic storms of the eastern coast between October and December and, to a lesser extent, by the southwest monsoon. The annual rainfall is about 1200 mm per annum and the temperature ranges from 25 °C to 40 °C. The water flow is scanty during most part of the year with occasional floods in the event of cyclonic storms. These rivers, which are source for groundwater recharge in the region, support several lakes found in the area. Both the rivers do not reach the sea directly but confluence in the brackish water bodies, mangroves situated at the fringes of the creek and the Buckingham Canal. The Kosasthalaiyar River drains into the Ennore backwaters reaching the sea through the creek. The littoral currents moving in a northerly direction for 9 months from February till October transport the sediments and deposit them few kilometres off shore and, in an area of emergence, these strands form strand plains. The mean wind speed in the region is about 4.7 m/s. The flux-level changes vary from 0.4 to 6 m3/s/m2. Surface elevation ranges from 0.2 to 0.6 m. The current velocity at the creek varies from 0.08 to 0.16 m/s during flood tides and from 0.2 to 0.15 m/s during ebb tides. At the mouth, the current velocity towards the east reaches a maximum of 0.5 m/s during flooding and 0.3 m/s during ebbing conditions. The mangrove region found in the estuarine area supports a number of wildlife. The creek is surrounded by fishing villages, croplands and aquaculture ponds. Salt manufacturing, lime shell quarrying and fishing remains the chief occupations of the region. The northern part of the creek is connected to the biodiversity-rich Pulicat lagoon through the Buckingham Canal. Pollution The creek receives wastewater from numerous sources including untreated wastewater and treated effluents from industrial sources in the surrounding area. Studies reveal that permitted discharges account for less than 40% of the total BOD load measured in the creek. Heavy metal concentrations are found to be higher near the creek mouth compared with the nearshore waters. Majority of heavy metal pollutants are likely to be present in a close proximity range of 0.5 km from the creek mouth after which there is a steady decline in their concentration up to 1.5 km. In January 2017, a collision of two ships, Dawn Kanchipuram and BW Maple, at the Ennore Port resulted in an estimated 251.46 tonnes of oil spill. Developments In 2000, an artificial beach nourishment (to prevent downdrift erosion) was taken up by placing 3.5 × 106 m3 of sand dredged from the Ennore harbour basin and the approach channel through capital dredging. A 670-m-long two-lane bridge is constructed on the creek by the Highway Department at a cost of 560 million, connecting Ennore High Road off the coastline with North Chennai Thermal Power Station at the northern end of the creek, with approach roads for about 1.7 km on either side of the Ennore High Road and near the thermal power station. The project, however, was proposed way back in 1997.Proposal for bridge across Ennore creek See also * Adyar Creek * Birding in Chennai * Kosasthalaiyar River * Pallikaranai wetland * Water management in Chennai References Category:Geography of Chennai Category:Estuaries of India ","title":"Ennore Creek"},{"id":"33187699","title":"All the Things I Should Have Known"},{"id":"33187702","text":"Johannes Christoffel Jan Mastenbroek (5 July 1902 – 23 May 1978) was a Dutch football manager who coached the Dutch East Indies in the 1938 FIFA World Cup.Copa do Mundo da FIFA França 1938 Mastenbroek was born and raised in Dordrecht, son of Klaas Mastenbroek, a tailor, and Goverdina Rackwitsz.

It is based on a 2008 novella by Denis Osokin. The film was awarded the Golden Osella for best cinematography and a FIPRESCI award. It was considered a frontrunner for the Golden Lion, but did not win. However, it did win Best Screenplay (awarded to Denis Osokin) at the 2011 Asia Pacific Screen Awards. It received generally positive reviews from critics.  Plot  Aist is a middle-aged bachelor who leads a lonely life in the northern town of Neya. Like many of his neighbours, he identifies himself as a Meryan and strives to keep alive the ancient traditions of his people. One day his boss, Miron, informs Aist of the death of his wife Tanya. Later, the pair spend quite some time washing her body and putting coloured threads in her pubic hair. (In their culture, the same ritual is performed on brides-to-be). The two men take her body to Gorbatov (the smallest town in Russia), in order to perform cremation rites on the banks of the Oka River. In the car, they carry with them two Bunting birds. On their way back to Neya, they get lost and are approached by two prostitutes, with whom they have sex. Later on, while crossing \\"the great Meryan river\\" (The Volga), on the Kineshma Bridge, the Buntings fly around the car, causing it to crash into the river. Both men drown.  Reception  Silent Souls received considerable praise from film critics. Silent Souls has an approval rating of 96% on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 47 reviews, and an average rating of 7.70/10. It also has a score of 76 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on 15 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\".https://www.metacritic.com/movie/silent-souls The official Rossiyskaya Gazeta compared the film to Tarkovsky's best work as a powerful evocation of pre-Christian roots of rural Russia. Andrei Plakhov praised the film as \\"a metaphor for the lost (and probably mythical) world that was crushed by the moloch of industrialisation\\". Among American critics, Jim Hoberman wrote: \\"Dour yet affirmative, this laconic, deliberately paced, beautifully shot movie seeks the archaic in the ordinary\\". Jeannette Catsoulis of The New York Times commented: \\"Populated by memories and dappled with desire, “Silent Souls” is part folk tale, part lesson in letting go. In its quiet acceptance of the passing of time, this unusual film reminds us that to die is not always the same as to disappear\\". Roger Ebert expressed the opinion that the film \\"in only 75 perfect minutes achieves the profundity of an epic\\", also mentioning that \\"not often have I been more deeply touched\\".

Anglo-Mysore Wars and Polygar Wars (1768-1802 CE)  Coimbatore was coveted by the Mysore sultans as well as British troops during the Anglo-Mysore Wars. The city was taken by the forces of the British East India Company in 1768 but were forced to abandon it due to treachery. Colonel Fullarton occupied the city in 1783 but later returned to Tipu Sultan as per the Treaty of Mangalore. At the beginning of the Third Mysore War, Coimbatore was, once again, taken by the British. Tipu Sultan besieged the city twice and repulsed in the first, he was successful in the second and Coimbatore surrendered in October 1791. The commanders of the garrison, Lieutenant Chalmers and Lieutenant Nash were taken as prisoners to Seringapatnam. Coimbatore fell to the British at the end of the Third Mysore War but was restored to Tipu Sultan at the cessation of hostilities. Coimbatore was eventually annexed by the British on the defeat and death of Tipu Sultan in 1799. Coimbatore was taken by the Polygars in 1800 and was an important stronghold in the Polygar Wars. It was made capital of Coimbatore district in 1865.  British Colonial period (1802-1947 CE)  1855 illustration of Bazaar in coimbatore Sir Robert Stanes. The municipality of Coimbatore was created in 1866 as per the Town Improvements Act 1865 with Robert Stanes as the first Chairman. Stanes pioneered the industrialization of Coimbatore, establishing a number of textile mills. As per the 1871 census, the first in India, Coimbatore had a population of 35,310 and was the tenth largest town in the Madras Presidency. Coimbatore was severely affected by the Great Famine of 1876–78 and the Famine of 1891-92. An earthquake on 8 February 1900 killed nearly 30 inhabitants damaging the Coimbatore jail, a Roman Catholic chapel and many other buildings. Coimbatore experienced a textile boom in the 1920s and 1930s partly abetted by the decline of the textile industry in Bombay. Growth of the city was also fostered by the construction of the Mettur Dam in 1934. During this period, road and rail connectivity with Coimbatore was improved considerably facilitating easier transportation of goods. The period 1911-1921 also witnessed the construction of over 15,000 irrigation wells with government loans bringing large chunks of barren land under cultivation. Coimbatore was also home to some of the earliest film studios in South India. Rangaswamy Naidu established the Central Studios in 1935 while S. M. Sriramulu Naidu set up the Pakshiraja Studios in 1945. In 1922, Narayanaswamy Naidu started a workshop to repair cane crushers and cotton ginning machines. Two years later, he established the Dhandayuthapani Foundry to manufacture Agricultural Pumps and Motors.Coimbatore's wealth creators , The Hindu Around the same time, G.D.Naidu started his unique bus service.

Among the international DJs participating in the first festival were Italians Mauro Picotto, Joy Kitikoni and Marco Carola, the Hungarian Corvin Dalek and British DJ Pete Tong, playing alongside twelve Colombian DJs. From 2005 onwards the festival played in a different location in Cartagena each night. Among the 130 international artists who participated in the festival over the years were Armin Van Buuren, David Guetta, Tiesto, Paul Van Dyk, Ferry Corsten, Roger Sanchez, Sasha, Deep Dish, Richie Hawtin and Axwell. In 2008, the UltraMar Festival joined with Summer Dance Festival, another dance festival that had been taking place in the same week in Cartagena since 2006, to create the Ultra-Summer Festival. With the growing popularity of UltraMar and other dance festivals in Cartagena, problems started to surface regarding noise pollution and policing of the event. The 2011 UltraMar Festival was canceled at short notice after the organizers were unable to obtain the necessary permission from the local authorities and the Convention Center where the event was to be held. Tickets for the event were sold before a deal with the site had been reached, and were later reimbursed. UltraMar returned in 2012 and 2013, but faced more obstacles: the 2012 event was moved out of Cartagena to the beach of Manzanillo del Mar north of the city, and then in 2013 it was moved again at the last moment to Punta Canoa, another beach even further away, following complaints from residents about noise and delinquent behavior. The logistical difficulties faced in putting on the 2013 festival and the competition from the rival Summerland (now Storyland) Festival resulted in the organizers deciding to discontinue UltraMar.

B. Hawley offered his risk theory of profit in 1893. According to Hawley, risk in business arose from product obsolescence, a sudden fall in prices, superior substitutes, natural calamities, or scarcity of certain crucial materials. Background Risk taking was an inevitable component of dynamic production, and those who took risk in business had a right to a separate reward known as \\"profit\\". According to Hawley, profit is the price paid by society for assuming business risk. A businessman would not take a risk without expecting compensation in excess of actuarial value- i.e., a premium on calculable risk. The reason that expected profit must be more than actuarial risk is the assumption that risk gives rise to dis-utilities of various kinds. Therefore, assuming risk gives the entrepreneur a claim to a reward in excess of the actuarial value of the risk. Hawley stated that profit was composed of two parts: one part represents compensation for average loss incidental to the various causes of risk, and the other part represents an inducement to suffer the consequences of being exposed to the risk. Hawley believed that profits arose from the factor of ownership, as long as the ownership included risk. If the entrepreneur avoided [risk] by insuring against it, he ceased to be an entrepreneur and should not receive profits. According to Hawley, profit arose out of uninsured risk. The uncertainty ends with sale of the entrepreneur's product. Profit thus is a residue.

Lagerführers were typically employed in camp complexes, where a main camp would be divided into one or more smaller camps.

Pearson (born February 8, 1959) is a former college ice hockey player and is the head coach of the Michigan Wolverines men's ice hockey team. Pearson played for Michigan Tech from 1977 to 1981, then served as an assistant coach for the team from 1982 to 1988. Following the 1987–88 season, he spent 23 years as an assistant coach and associate head coach at Michigan under Red Berenson before returning to Michigan Tech as head coach in 2011. Early years and playing career (L–R) Rick Boehm, Al Mickalich, Tim Watters and Mel Pearson display the third place trophy after defeating Northern Michigan at the 1981 NCAA Tournament. Mel Pearson was born in Vancouver on February 8, 1959, the son of Vancouver Canucks player George \\"Mel\\" Pearson. His father's playing career ended in 1973 as a member of the Minnesota Fighting Saints, and Mel, who had been playing since the age of six, played hockey in suburban Minneapolis at Edina East High School under coach Willard Ikola. Pearson was recruited to play college hockey by both Michigan and Michigan Tech, and he ultimately chose Michigan Tech after visiting the campus and \\"[falling] in love with the place\\". While on his visit, Pearson met with coach John MacInnes, who \\"made me feel so welcome, and I knew I wanted to play for him right away\\". Pearson played forward for Michigan Tech from 1977 to 1981 and scored 21 goals among 56 points in 97 games. As a senior, he helped the team advance to the semifinal of the 1981 NCAA Division I Men's Ice Hockey Tournament, where the team lost to Minnesota. Michigan Tech won the Great Lakes Invitational tournament four times in Pearson's four years as a player. He scored the tournament-winning goal in triple overtime against Michigan in 1979. Pearson graduated from Michigan Tech in 1981 with a degree in business administration. Coaching career =Michigan Tech (1982–88)= In 1982, Michigan Tech promoted assistant coach Jim Nahrgang to head coach following MacInnes's retirement. Nahrgang and assistant coach Herb Boxer, who had both served on MacInnes's coaching staff during Pearson's time as a player, sought out Pearson to fill the other coaching position. \\"[T]hey were the ones that really got me into coaching. I hadn't really thought about being a coach until they approached me\\", Pearson said. In addition to his on-ice responsibilities, Pearson recruited players including eventual National Hockey League (NHL) regulars Randy McKay and Damian Rhodes, and Michigan Tech's first Western Collegiate Hockey Association (WCHA) scoring champion, Shawn Harrison. Pearson retained his assistant coach position when Boxer replaced Nahrgang, who resigned in February 1985, as head coach. During Pearson's tenure as assistant coach, Michigan Tech accumulated a record of 97–136–9. The team neither advanced beyond the first round of the WCHA playoffs nor qualified for the NCAA tournament. =Michigan (1988–2011)= After the 1987–88 season, Pearson accepted the position of assistant coach with the Michigan Wolverines under Red Berenson, who had just completed his fourth season as head coach. Pearson and fellow assistant Larry Pedrie focused heavily on recruiting, describing their typical schedule thusly: \\"We'd practice, get in the car, go see a game somewhere, play our games on the weekend, then get back in the car to see a prospect play on Sunday night.\\" The coaching staff's recruiting diligence, which continued after Pedrie left and his position was filled by David Shand and then Billy Powers, paid off. Beginning in 1991, the Wolverines qualified for every NCAA Division I Men's Ice Hockey Championship tournament for the remainder of Pearson's tenure. They advanced to the Frozen Four in eleven of those tournaments, and won the national championship in 1996 and 1998. More than fifty of the players Pearson helped recruit to Michigan have gone on to play in the NHL. In 1996, Pearson was a candidate for the head coaching position at Michigan Tech, but his former teammate Tim Watters was appointed instead. Later that year, Jeff Jackson named Pearson one of his assistant coaches for the US men's national junior ice hockey team that competed in the 1997 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships. The team lost the championship game to Canada, but its second place finish was its best in the event until it won the championship in 2004. Pearson interviewed for and was offered the head coaching position at Miami University in 1999, but he turned down the job that later went to Enrico Blasi. His decision to stay at Michigan was quickly followed by a raise and promotion to associate head coach. \\"We're doing it to recognize [his] loyalty to the program\\", Berenson said. The following year Pearson received the Terry Flanagan Award, which recognizes an assistant coach's career body of work, from the American Hockey Coaches Association (AHCA). When asked in 2007 why he had stayed at Michigan for so long, Pearson said, \\"[Berenson] gives us a lot of responsibility. He lets us be hands-on. And, you have a chance to win every year. I don't have an ego where I need to be a head coach.\\" After Michigan's loss to Minnesota–Duluth in the 2011 National Championship game, however, Michigan Tech pursued Pearson for its vacant head coaching position. =Michigan Tech (2011–17)= Michigan Tech athletic director Suzanne Sanregret had been given the authority and resources to \\"go after the best coach\\" following Jamie Russell's resignation in March 2011, and she interviewed Pearson, Nebraska–Omaha associate coach Mike Hastings and Green Bay (USHL) head coach Eric Rud. Pearson's interview took place four days after the loss to Minnesota–Duluth, and when Sanregret gave him 48 hours to decide whether to accept the position, he ultimately could not say yes. \\"[W]ith everything going on, it was just a tough time to make ... a life-changing decision\\", Pearson said. \\"So I just think I went with the safe way and said no\\". Sanregret continued the search after Pearson turned down the job, but she met with Pearson again in early May at the AHCA convention in Naples, Florida, and this time he was ready to accept an offer and become the twenty-first head coach in the Huskies' 91 years of college hockey. Pearson signed a five-year contract and was introduced at the Grant Hockey Educational Center on Michigan Tech's campus on May 10. At the press conference, Pearson posited that what separates him from the previous alumni who have returned to coach the Huskies is his 30 years of experience. \\"As you're in the game longer you get a bigger network of people who can help you recruit, so I think that's the biggest difference right now\\", Pearson said. He hired Bill Muckalt, a veteran of five NHL seasons who was coached by Pearson at Michigan, as an assistant coach in June and retained Damon Whitten as the other assistant coach. \\"Our coaching staff has done a lot of winning and we want to instill the attitude that we're going to win\\", Whitten said. Pearson spoke of changing the team's style of play to emphasize skill, speed and offensive creativity, and said his staff's efforts would be focused on recruiting for the next few months. He brought in Steve Shields, another former NHL player who played under Pearson at Michigan, as a volunteer goaltending coach in September. On September 24, 2014, Michigan Tech announced a five-year extension for Pearson, keeping him signed through the 2020–21 season. =Michigan (2017–present)= On April 24, 2017, Pearson was announced as the new head coach at the University of Michigan.

She was the first executive director of the African Women's Development and Communication Network (FEMNET), formed in 1988. Career Wainaina became involved in gender and development work in the early 1970s, and since then has been a leader in the women's movement in Kenya. She attended global meetings of the World Conference on Women in Mexico City (1975), Nairobi (1985) and Beijing (1995). Wainaina helped to pioneer FEMNET in the late 1970s. At FEMNET she coordinated and integrated gender concerns in the programs of development agencies in Kenya. She has campaigned for male support in eliminating discrimination against women, particularly gender-based violence. When she retired from FEMNET she was succeeded by Lynne Muthoni Wanyeki, a radical feminist in her early thirties. As of 2010 Wainaina was almost 70, a wife, mother and grandmother, still active both in business and as a gender consultant. Views Wainaina says that gender training involves challenging centuries-old structures, challenging power relations at the personal, family, community and national levels. She says \\"it can be a very threatening exercise\\". She has said of her work \\"Women's leadership is the most political work. First of all, we are fighting for rights. We are fighting for something somebody else has [that belongs to us]. So we have to fight them, persuade them. Trick them. So it is so political, You need to be very confident to just be able to continue and to say you know, yes, I understand what you are saying, but ... and to be able to keep your head and not get angry\\". Wainaina is founder of Men for Gender Equality Now, a Kenyan NGO. She has explained of her work with men \\"There are many women today who feel that working with men and boys is diluting, diverting and trivializing our struggle. Many hold the view that because men and boys are the beneficiaries of male privilege and discrimination against women and girls, they can never understand our struggle. Many doubt that men and boys can commit to changes that would mean them losing the privileges they now enjoy. But, as understandings of gender, its social construction, maculinities, femininities and their impact on all deepen, it becomes clear that males have reasons to want to change as well and that gender equality would also benefit them. Work with men and boys for gender equality is only one of the many strategies that must be combined to tackle the ever-growing problems of inequality, injustice and oppression\\". Wainaina has pointed out \\"The focus on the girl child since the Beijing Conference has particularly challenged men to look at the boy child. In several countries in Africa, gender programs are targeting boys because of the recognition that boys too suffer certain gender specific problems, especially arising from their socialization. There is, for example, growing concern that while girls have been overburdened with family responsibilities as helpers to their mothers, boys are growing up without learning and taking their responsibilities at their personal, family and community levels. The result is an increase in drug abuse, violence, crime and other social problems — a high social cost for the community\\".

Professor Kuznetsov was very important as a pioneer in the fields of insect physiology, Lepidoptera fauna of the Arctic (Siberia) and knowledge of fossils of Lepidoptera. He influenced the very famous lepidopterist and writer Vladimir Nabokov: \\"At the age of eight he [Nabokov] began reading serious books on entomology from the family library and at nine he already attempted to make his first scientific discovery, writing about it to the leading Russian lepidopterist, Nikolay Kuznetsov.

Biography He graduated from the University of St. Petersburg in 1895. Then he was appointed demonstrator in animal physiology at the university and later became a lecturer, and a professor. He also lectured on entomology and insect physiology at the Institute of Applied, Zoology, but, his main interest was centred at the Zoological Institute of the Academy of Sciences, where he was in charge of Lepidoptera for more than forty years, he was specialized in the family Pieridae and also studied fossil insects in amber. He was colleague and friend of Grigory Grum-Grshimailo. He was awarded the Order of the Red Banner of Labour.  Legacy  His personal collection of specimens of Lepidoptera, including the acquisition of the Wocke's collection, today is at the Zoological Institute (St. Petersburg).

Though her appearance in Braunschweig was unsuccessful, she was engaged at the court theatre () of Vienna that same year, debuting on 5 August 1822 as Rutland in Essex, which she had performed earlier in Mannheim to much applause. She also became reader to the empress of Austria. Her most notable roles were Chrimhild (Raupach’s Nibelungen), Lady Milfort (Shiller's Kabale und Liebe), Rosaura (Leben ein Traum), Ophelia, Preciosa, Semiramis (Raupach’s Tochter der Luft), Portia, Zaire, Hedwig and Juliet (Romeo and Juliet). After her death, a portrait of her as Princess Eboli was hung in the court theatre's hall of outstanding performers. Her biography, by Mailath, was published at Vienna in 1832.

It is presented in a found footage style, and concerns a school which is haunted by a wish-granting spirit. Shiraishi appears in a starring role within the film, playing himself, as do the six then-members of the Japanese idol group Momoiro Clover Z. Plot Director Kōji Shiraishi wants to film an episode for a Japanese television program, featuring members of the \\"Idol\\"-genre singing and dancing ensemble, Momoiro Clover Z (referred to in the film by their previous name, simply Momoiro Clover). The program is one wherein minor celebrity guests are employed to investigate haunted houses and similarly mysterious locales, in an attempt to determine the truth about such places, and their associated paranormal phenomena. The members of Momoiro Clover are asked to visit an abandoned school, where a shrine to a minor kami known as \\"Shirome\\" is located. This shrine takes the form of a painting that is thought to be that of a butterfly, but which may actually represent the entity's face. According to local legends, if Shirome is asked to grant a wish, he will do so, but only if the person asking is completely sincere in both their request, and their belief in the existence and power of the Shirome entity. If any wish is asked of this being in a frivolous manner, or in a spirit of unbelief, Shirome will destroy that person, either through causing them to have a fatal accident, inducing them to commit suicide, or driving them hopelessly insane. The girls visit the shrine, and request of Shirome that they be granted a chance to appear on a nationwide Japanese television broadcast. As soon as this wish is pronounced, a series of chaotic disturbances ensue, and a hulking, large, white-eyed being is briefly seen standing (or floating) next to the girls. Subsequently, their entertainment career becomes characterized by a high degree of popularity and commercial success, but a disturbing video clip taken from immediately after one of their high-profile concerts suggests that their success may have been obtained in an ill-advised manner, and that the young ladies face the possibility of very fearsome, dire consequences in the future, perhaps including the loss of their souls.

It was founded in 1999 in Salta in the north west of Argentina, when seven British businesses working in Argentina (including Unilever, British Gas, and Rio Tinto Borax), inspired by the work of the Princes Trust, agreed to fund a similar initiative. The following year, in response to the demand for help to establish similar organisations in various countries around the world, the Princes Trust established YBI (Youth Business International), an umbrella organisation to advise and certify these organisations in the different countries. The Fundación Impulsar became an accredited member of YBI in 2002. Background The Fundación Impulsar helps entrepreneurial minded young people aged between eighteen and thirty-five years old who have a good idea for a business. It focusses particularly on those from economically disadvantaged backgrounds, who would not be able to find funding elsewhere. Along with seed capital, the Fundación Impulsar also provides business planning and development support and mentoring to the start ups that it helps. The Fundación Impulsar advertises its services in the media, and then interviews the applicants that respond to the adverts, to get to know them and to discuss their ideas. If their business seems viable, the Fundación Impulsar sends the potential entrepreneurs on a course to help them write a business plan. If the plan still portrays a feasible, sustainable business, they sign a contract and the funding and mentoring begin. The funding is in the form of a loan that is typically repaid over the course of three years. Since its founding in Salta, eight other branches of the Fundación Impulsar have been established throughout the country, in Tartagal, Tucuman, Mendoza, Cordoba, Missiones, San Luis, Puerto San Julian and in Buenos Aires. Over time, the Buenos Aires office has become the head office, a logical step with the capital the undisputed transport and communications hub of the country. The original Salta office continues to play a central role though, training staff in the other offices as well as in similar organisations that have since been established in other countries throughout Latin America. To date, the Fundación Impulsar has helped over one thousand people start businesses in Argentina, of which seventy percent are still trading after three years. On average, each business now employs two point five people. Each year, Youth Business International, which has member organisations in thirty-four countries, holds the Entrepreneur of the Year awards to recognise the best and most innovative new businesses founded that year throughout the world. The 2009 Entrepreneur of the Year was the Argentine Juan Ramón Nuñez, who with the support of the Fundación Impulsar set up a community radio station alongside a sound and lighting rental business in a deprived suburb of Buenos Aires. The president of the Salta office, Ramiro Cornejo Torino, says: “You plant a seed, you nurture it, and you wait to see how far it will grow”. One project funded by the Salta office, a leather workshop, now supplies luxury leather goods to Casa Lopez, a leading Argentine fashion chain, as well as to Estados, a small British company that sells a range of exclusive handmade leather goods in the UK.

However, the historical truth of his existence is in some doubt, because all known records that describe him are of highly questionable veracity. The siege Nándorfehérvár (Belgrade) was at this time under the command of Hunyadi. From 4 to 22 July 1456, Nándorfehérvár was besieged by the Sultan Mehmed II. After ongoing, fierce battles, Ottoman troops attacked the city walls on 21 July, and a Janissary succeeded, according to legend, to climb a turret and momentarily hoist the Ottoman banner. It was immediately overthrown by soldiers in the same moment that Dugovics grabbed the bearer. As a result, both Dugovics and the standard- bearer plunged from the walls to their deaths. This heroic act was significant in the repulse of the Ottomans and honours the memory of the defenders of Nándorfehérvár. Authenticity In his study,Szőcs 2009, p. 3–35. historian Tibor Szőcs claims Titusz Dugovics did not exist. A familiar figure in Hungarian history, Dugovics is the embodiment of anti-Ottoman resistance and self-sacrifice. This heroic deed by him has served as the subject of numerous works of literature and art since the middle of the 19th century, and several streets in Hungary have been named after him. Nevertheless, an analysis of the available sources proves that the story cannot be considered as historically accurate. The heroic act was first documented in Antonio Bonfini's chronicle written at the end of the 15th century, where an anonymous Hungarian fighter is mentioned. The same story is told by both Bonfini and the Serbian Konstantin Mihailović, in relation to the Siege of Jajce in 1464, featuring an unnamed soldier as well. Early modern-era Czech historical literature by Jan Dubravius also refers to the hero of Belgrade/Nándorfehérvár as being unknown, but defining his nationality as Czech. From the end of the 18th century, with the forming of Hungarian national consciousness, the valiant soldier had been regarded as a national hero and role model. Imre Dugovics, a member of the Western Hungarian noble family of Croatian origin, took advantage of that.Dugovics Titusz legendája kipukkadt In 1821, by means of three false documents, he attempted to verify that the anonymous fighter had been an ancestor of his family, called Titusz Dugovics. The name was made known to the public by Gábor Döbrentei, a recognised scholar of the period, who had been deceived by the false documents, and published them in study. Thus, Titusz Dugovics and his story soon became (and have ever since remained) a part of Hungarian historical consciousness, although his character should not be considered more than early-19th-century fiction. The only element of the story that may be accepted as authentic is that of the unknown soldier described by Bonfini and Konstantin. (Hungarian text: \\" A 15. századi források vizsgálata azt mutatja, hogy keringett valamiféle történet egy ismeretlen katonáról, aki így adta bizonyságát hősiességének. A 18-19. század fordulóján ezt a vitéz tettet fedezte fel újra a magyar történelmi emlékezet, amely a romantikus nemzeti múlt-kép egyik fontos epizódja lett. Az 1820-as évek elején ezt a hírességet használta ki Dugovics Imre, aki saját családját kívánta rokonságba hozni a belgrádi hőssel. Céljai elérése érdekében a hamis oklevelek gyártatásától sem riadt vissza. Azonban ő sem gondolta, hogy Döbrentei Gábor lelkesedésének köszönhetően Dugovics Titusz alakja bekerül a nemzeti panteonba. \\" - Translation: \\"The 15th-century sources show that there was a story about an unknown soldier who proved his bravery by his action. At the turn of the 19th century the Hungarian historical memory re-explored this heroic deed, which thus became an important part of the nation's romantic past. At the beginning of the 1820s, a certain Imre Dugovics took advantage of this famous act when he wanted to establish a relationship between his family and the hero of Belgrade. He actually falsified records to achieve his aim, but even he never counted on Titusz Dugovics making it into the national pantheon by historian Gábor Döbrentei's enthusiasm\\") References Bibliography *Szőcs, Tibor: Egy \\"legendás\\" hős: Dugovics Titusz története.

From the court's inception through 2018, a worldwide total of 274 people have earned its Master Sommelier diploma, the highest level. History  The first Master Sommelier examination was held in the United Kingdom in 1969; the Court of Master Sommeliers was later established as an international examining body for sommeliers. It was set up under the supervision of the Vintners Company, The Institute of Masters of Wine, The British Hotels & Restaurants Association, The Wine & Spirit Association of Great Britain, and The Wholesale Tobacco Trade Association. In 1984, Fred Dame was the first person ever to pass all three parts of the Master Sommelier examination at once, which is called winning the Krug Cup. Master Sommelier Fred Dame: Best Job In The World PAUL HODGINS, MARCH 23, 2016 Master Sommelier Frederick L. Dame San Diego Wine Classic The roast of master sommelier Fred Dame Jordan Winery, May 2014 In 1986 the first Master Sommelier exams were held in the United States. The American chapter of the CMS was established under the name Court of Master Sommeliers Americas, and also conducts exams and workshops in Canada.Official page In 2018, the Court of Master Sommeliers invalidated the results of the tasting portion of the exam and rescinded the MS title from 23 of the 24 who were awarded the MS title. A proctor for the exam gave at least one candidate information about the wines used in the exam. Education and certification The court has four stages of certification that grow in depth and complexity with each stage. Those who achieve a particular stage are awarded a certificate and badge on the same day as the exam. =Introductory= Open to anyone with several years experience in the restaurant industry, this level consists of two days of classes followed by a multiple choice exam that typically has a low failure rate. Topics covered include but are not limited to: winemaking basics, grape varieties, the major wine regions, wine and food pairing, and the very basic details of beer, sake, and liquors. Passing the Introductory Sommelier Course does not confer the \\"sommelier\\" professional title. Persons passing the exam receive an “Introductory” lapel pin and certificate. =Certified Sommelier= This stage was created in 2006 to bridge the gap between the Introductory and Advanced levels.Taking the Court of Master Sommeliers Level 2 – Certified Sommelier Exam It is only open to those who have passed the Introductory course and examination, and focuses a great deal more on service and more in-depth knowledge of the world of wine. The exam has three parts: theoretical consisting of multiple choice and short answer questions, a written blind tasting of four wines (two white and two red), and service. The minimum score to pass is 60%. Certified Sommelier Examination The Court of Master Sommeliers America reports that on average 66% of applicants pass the Certified Examination.Certified Sommelier Examination mastersommeliers.org =Advanced Sommelier= Testing for the Advanced Sommelier certificate requires candidates to have passed the Certified exam and taken the Advanced Sommelier Course. In the United States, the three day Advanced Course is offered twice per year and requires the candidate to first submit an application and take a timed knowledge survey which is then followed by the exam at a different date. For the European chapter, the course and exam are done in one, five-day sitting. The Court generally recommends 1–2 years of preparation after successfully passing the Certified exam. The Advanced exam is generally offered three times per year but differs in frequency between the American and European chapters. Candidates must be working and living in one region or the other to sit the exam there. Often referred to as the \\"Mini Master\\", there is a heavier emphasis on service and a more intimate knowledge of all wine styles, regions and wine producers themselves. The examination is a written test with multiple choice and 60 short answer questions, a blind tasting of 6 wines in 25 minutes, and a 45 minute service test. The minimum pass mark is 60% in each section, and all three sections must be passed together. =Master Sommelier= Those who wish to take the Master Sommelier exam must have passed the Advanced exam, be invited and/or recommended to sit the exam and have typically worked in the industry for at least 10 years. The exam covers all aspects of the world and industry of wine, beer, spirits, cocktails, and hospitality from a business, service and philosophical approach. The three part, oral exam consists of theory (must be passed before taking the other two parts), blind tasting six wines before a panel, and service; the three sections do not need be attempted at once. It is allowed to take the blind tasting and service exam in successive years. Once the first portion is passed, a candidate has a three year window, starting with the first attempt, to pass all three portions i.e. a candidate can pass one part each year for about three consecutive years and successfully become a Master Sommelier. If all three parts are not passed in the three year window the candidate resets to zero and must retake all parts. The minimum score for each of the three sections to pass is 75% at the Master Sommelier level. The typical pass rate at the Master Sommelier exam is around 3–8% of applicants; in some instances as few as 1 in 70 have succeeded.10 REASONS THE MASTER SOMMELIER TEST IS THE HARDEST IN THE WORLD LYNNE LAVELLE, thrillist.com, 11/06/2015Pass Rate in Latest Master Sommelier Exam: 1 in 70 Rebecca Gibb, 17 July 2013 The Master Sommelier exam is offered twice per year in the US and once per year in the UK.

The Master Sommelier Diploma Exam Katie Kelly Bell, Forbes.com, June 24, 2013 Only nine people have ever passed the Master level on the first try. Some attempt the exam up to a dozen times before passing. In 2020, the American branch of the court removed the single term \\"master\\" from its title-ship, instead adopting the full term \\"master sommelier\\" to cultivate diversity and reducing racism.

She is also the former Executive Director of the Kenya Human Rights Commission and the African Women's Development and Communication Network (FEMNET). Early life and education Wanyeki was born in 1972 to a Canadian mother and Kenyan (Kikuyu) father, and grew up in Kenya. Her father died in 1991. She holds a BA in Political Science (international relations) and French (literature) from the University of New Brunswick and Simon Fraser University respectively. Wanyeki also holds an MPA (cum laude) in public affairs from L’Institut d’études politiques in Paris and is currently pursuing her doctoral studies in the Department of Politics and International Studies at the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS). Wanyeki's PhD thesis at SOAS is titled \\"‘African solutions for African problems’: the question of member states’ compliance with the African Union using Kenya as a case study.\\" Career Wanyeki began her work as an activist focused on women's rights in 1988, while studying for her undergraduate degree in Canada. In Canada she also got her start in media, working with local newspapers and radio stations on issues related to immigrant and refugee women. Upon returning to Kenya after college, one of Wanyeki's first jobs involved development work in rural Ukambani, where she conducted volunteer work for Oxfam and the United Nations Environmental Programme. In the late-1990s, she worked in Nairobi for Inter Press Services, an advocacy news organisation, and for ECO News Africa. While in her early thirties she succeeded Njoki Wainaina as executive director of FEMNET. At first, she viewed the organization as one dominated by a board of conservative older women.

History Built in 1937 for $307,000, this Territorial Revival style public structure with hand-carved wood interiors was built by the Works Progress Administration. The state of New Mexico issued bonds of $175,000 to pay for its portion of the construction costs, and a tax of $2.50 was levied on each civil case docketed. During the Cold War in the 1950s, the building doubled as a fallout shelter. Renovations The original two elevators and a third elevator added in the 1960s have been upgraded to current standards. Over the decades, piping and court seating were upgraded, as were the electrical and heating systems, water pipes, communications lines, and emergency/fire alarm system. The building now has a digital telephone system. Structural and interior design renovations have brought the building up to date.

Biography In 1979, Benjamin Holmes was an auto repairman in Cleveland working on his master's degree in engineering. Holmes was approached by Italian Mafia members and was asked to make a muffler for a gun. He refused, and took the story to the police; however, Holmes was approached by a cop who also began to pressure Holmes to outfit his guns with suppressors. In October 1979, Holmes returned to his home from work and discovered the lights in his house were off, including a light that he had always left on. When he entered his home and hit the light switch, he was engulfed in a fiery explosion. The light switch had been connected to a bomb. During hospitalization for treatment of the burns he suffered, Holmes was visited by someone who accused him of attempting to burn down his own house to collect insurance money. Upon leaving the hospital, Holmes saw the news that he was wanted for several violent crimes he did not commit, and that a shoot on sight order was announced. It was then Holmes realized that someone was setting him up. Out of desperation, Holmes came to the conclusion he had no choice but to fake his own death. He set the stage for a murder inside his car using a syringe from his medicine cabinet to withdraw and splatter his own blood around the car in an attempt to make it look like he was shot. He left the car running on a deserted road and headed for Lorain, Ohio, where a friend was waiting for him. Over the next several months, Holmes grew a beard and let his hair grow long. He bought a fraudulent driver's license and tattooed himself to cover the burns on the backs of his hands. He eventually found work in an auto shop. In 1988, seven years after his disappearance, Holmes was presumed dead and his wife was issued a death certificate. She then collected a $100,000 life insurance check for the presumed loss of her husband. With the extra money, Holmes moved with his wife and young daughter to a new neighborhood in Youngstown, Ohio. Twenty years after his presumed \\"death\\", Holmes caught his wife having an affair, confronted her, and was shot by his wife twice in his midsection.http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1355/is_23_98/ai_67185248/ He was rushed to the hospital, where a high school classmate working as a nurse recognized him. Holmes was then found out, but no charges were filed against him. Holmes still lives in Youngstown and is currently writing a book about his life. Television appearance In September 2011 Holmes was featured on the first episode of the Discovery Channel show I Faked My Own Death.

Dr. David Dwight is the Senior Pastor. It is a member of the Evangelical Presbyterian Church (United States), within the Mid-Atlantic Presbytery. Purpose statement Hope's purpose statement, according to its website, is to \\"offer experiences, relationships and places where people can find life and purpose through Jesus Christ.\\" Community involvement Hope Church is actively involved in its community in several ways. On a monthly basis it collects non-perishable food items to donate to the Goochland Food Pantry. It runs the Hope Thrift Store to provide clothing, furniture and other household goods to local low-income families, avid thrifters, or any local shopper. Additionally, Hope Church has conducted community events such as a 5K run. As a member of a global community, Hope regularly participates in mission activities around the world, such as medical/dental trips to the Dominican Republic. Programs There are five services each weekend on Sundays at 8:00 a.m. 9:30 a.m. 11:00 a.m, and 5:00 p.m. Child care is available at all services except the 5:00 p.m. Additionally there are programs for middle- and high-school students. Thrive and Thrive @ Night are the teaching ministries for women. Other ministries target young adults, college students, men, or anyone interested in small group Bible studies. History of Hope Church Hope started in 1997, a \\"small band of people dreaming about what the church could be if we are honest, relevant, and authentic\\". According to the website, \\"We believe the Bible and we’re grateful for its stability and guidance in the midst of a world of change. At the same time we kind of like things on the creative side.\\" For the first two years the church met at Ruby Carver Elementary School, then moved to Godwin High School. Hope bought its current property across from West Creek in Goochland County and moved into the building in September 2008. An expansion to the campus was completed in 2016 to include an updated and expanded Hope Kids wing and the Lodge (used for Hope Students, weddings, and more). Hope Midtown and additional locations In 2013, with the West Creek auditorium filled to capacity over multiple weekend services, Hope's leadership made a strategic decision not to expand its current auditorium capacity, but instead to launch additional locations in the Richmond metro area, effectively becoming a multisite church. Hope's first campus location was selected – the \\"Midtown\\" area of Richmond, a loosely defined geographical area East of Libbie Avenue, West of the Boulevard, North of the James River, and South of the Lakeside area of Richmond. The \\"Hope Midtown\\" community was organized to offer a Sunday worship experience in September 2015 at the historic Thomas Jefferson High School. Arts and Hope Church A distinctive element of Hope Church is their commitment to the arts. This value stems from the Christian idea that God as Creator made humans in His image, thereby making them creative and their creations (the arts) a domain of beauty and sacred expression. Hope has a Worship Arts department, whose stated mission is \\"to expand the worship of God by empowering a community of artists\\" toward the end of seeing \\"a movement of redemptive art\\" in Richmond, Virginia. They attempt to empower local artists by hosting an art gallery and visual art show series, by helping songwriters and musicians capture their art in their on-site recording studio, and by creating, producing, and releasing original films through their affiliate, Check The Gate Films. In addition, they host a summer program of art classes for children and adults alike.

The bowl game featured the Notre Dame Fighting Irish versus the Texas A&M; Aggies.https://www.nytimes.com/1988/01/02/sports/cotton-bowl-aggies-top-irish- by-35-10.html Played in front of 73,006 people, Texas A&M; won the game by a final score of 35-10. This was the final Cotton Bowl played without a sponsor for the game. Background Texas A&M; won their third straight Southwest Conference championship and as such was invited to their third straight Cotton Bowl. An added bonus to the 1988 Cotton Bowl was Notre Dame's Tim Brown, a Dallas native and the 53rd winner of the Heisman Trophy. Brown's presence marked the third time in four seasons the Heisman winner played in the Cotton Bowl. He also was the Irish's seventh Heisman winner, but the first ever to play in a bowl game. Brown and the Irish were the talk of the town, and the excitement led right up to kickoff. Notre Dame was making its fifth Cotton Bowl appearance. The Fighting Irish won three of those four, including a 38-10 smashing of Texas A&M;'s archrival, Texas, in 1978 to win the 1977 national championship. In its most recent Cotton Bowl appearance prior to this one, Joe Montana overcame hypothermia and a 34-12 Houston lead to win 35-34 with a touchdown on the game's final play. Game summary The game was barely three minutes old when Brown delivered. Having returned the opening kickoff 37 yards, Brown helped Notre Dame gain an early lead when quarterback Terry Andrysiak hit his All-America receiver with a 17-yard scoring pass. Down 7-0, the Aggies countered on Scott Slater's 26-yard field goal on the final play of the first quarter, but at that point the game belonged clearly to Notre Dame. The Irish took the ensuing kickoff and marched 51 yards for Ted Gradel's 36-yard field goal and a 10-3 advantage. Four minutes later, Notre Dame was on the move again. Driving from their own 20. Andrysiak and Brown quickly moved the Irish back into scoring position. On second down at the A&M; 18, Andrysiak dropped back to pass and his target was tight end Andy Heck. A&M;'s Alex Morris read the play and made a leaping interception in the corner of the end zone for what proved to be the key play of the game. The Aggies seized the opportunity and stormed through the Notre Dame defense, needing only six plays to move 80 yards and tie the game. Freshman running back Darren Lewis ended the drive, surprising the Irish defense by throwing 24 yards to Tony Thompson for the touchdown. Things got worse for Notre Dame. On their first play following the A&M; score, the Irish fumbled the ball back to the Aggies. Tony Jones made the recovery at the Notre Dame 21 and four plays later, freshman running back Larry Horton carried two yards for the go-ahead score. A successful two-point conversion pushed the Aggies to an 18-10 half- time lead. Texas A&M; didn't let up in the second half. Quarterback Bucky Richardson, another one of the Aggies’ talented freshmen, scored twice to ice the game, and Slater added another field goal. Taking a cue from the offense, Aggie defenders began to dominate, setting up four of A&M;'s six scores with turnovers. The A&M; “Wrecking Crew,” composed of linebackers Adam Bob, Aaron Wallace, Dana Batiste, and John Roper, and noseguard Sammy O’Brient, smothered the Notre Dame attack. After catching six passes for 105 yards in the game's first 22 minutes, Brown was shut down completely and did not make another reception following Morris’ key interception. In the fourth quarter, he was ejected from the game for unsportsmanlike conduct. It was a decisive victory for A&M;, 35-10. Aftermath Notre Dame would win the national championship a year later, sans Brown, who was drafted by the Oakland Raiders. A&M; was put under probation by the NCAA for a period of two years due to violations and thus could not participate in a bowl game for the 1988 NCAA Division I-A football season. Sherill left the program after the 1988 season, and succeeded by R. C. Slocum, who would go to four Cotton Bowls, but lose all four, two (1993 and 1994) to Notre Dame. After two head coaches and two more Cotton Bowl losses, both to future Southeastern Conference rivals, A&M; at last won the Cotton Bowl again in 2013 with 2012 Heisman Trophy winner Johnny Manziel. The Irish have not played in the Cotton Bowl since their back-to-back victories over the Aggies in the 1990s.

There are two lakes in Benzie County, Michigan based on the name Platte, the other being Little Platte. Platte Lake covers and is long and wide. The average depth of Platte Lake is deep. The deepest point of the lake is measured at deep. The Platte River flows through the lake at a speed of . This means the residence time for the water in Platte Lake is 6 months. Also meaning that every hour of water are passing through Platte Lake. The Platte River flows through Platte Lake and continues downstream through Loon Lake until it finally reaches Lake Michigan.  Geography  Platte Lake is located in Benzie County, which was molded into a land full of sand dunes by the glacial formations. Along with the sand dunes, the glaciers also left many lakes in the area, not only in Benzie but throughout the area. Platte Lake is located at an elevation of 584 feet (178 meters) above sea level. Platte Lake is one of the largest of the lakes located in Benzie Michigan.  Geology  Platte Lake is surrounded by sand dunes that were formed by glaciers and it is believed that these same glaciers also formed the many lakes in the Benzie area, not excluding Platte Lake. These sand dunes and glacial formations have since 1970 been protected under state law. The lakes bottom is filled with sand much like the sand that rolls over the massive dunes that overlook Lake Michigan and that make up Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore.  Lake environment  Seagulls are extremely prevalent in the area, as well as various species of ducks and loons. Hawks and wild turkeys are often seen around the lake. Occasionally spotted is the bald eagle. In the water there are many types of fish as well as water turtles. Around the lake, white-tailed deer, bears, and red-tailed foxes can be found. = Species of fish = Platte Lake has many different species of fish. The types of fish include, small mouth and large mouth bass, rock bass, northern pike, walleye, brown bullhead, chinook salmon, strickbacks, bluegill and perch. = Invasive species = A foreign species of mussel, called the zebra mussel has over the past 20 years inhabited Platte Lake as well as many other lakes in the Great Lake area. These mussels help water clarity, but they are not native to the Northern Michigan area. They have been transported to North America by large vessels from Asia. They are a serious problem because they have nearly eliminated the native clam population in Platte Lake and many other bodies of water in the area. = Climate = The climate around the lake is pretty steady. Winters are dreadfully cold filled with a large amount of snow, and the summers are pretty warm but never too hot. During the winter the average low is 17 degrees F and the average high is 31 degrees F. In the summer the average low is 55 degrees F and the average high is 78 degrees F. It is not unusual for it to be extremely windy on and around the lake.  Tourism  Platte Lake is known for its vacation homes that are visible from every spot on the water. Benzie Michigan is extremely tourist oriented and is known for having a lot to do. There are many shops and restaurants not on the lake, but near the lake. You can go canoeing down Platte River. You are only minutes from the city of Frankfort, Michigan which is packed with cool shops, amazing restaurants and is located on the shores of Lake Michigan. There is also a pier, which you can walk out to view the spectacular lighthouse. Platte Lake is also minutes away from the most photographed lighthouse in Michigan, Point Betsie Light. Platte Lake is also near Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore, which is an amazing mound of sand dunes that over look Lake Michigan from one side, and Glen Lake from the other. There are over a dozen golf courses in the area as well. The things to do in Benzie county are unlimited. = Summer rentals = There are an enormous amount of summer rental homes located on Platte Lake. Many people vacation there. During the summer tourists like to boat, water ski, wake board, tube, and sailboat on the water. Because Platte Lake is known for having such a variety of species of fish, fishing is also very popular on Platte Lake. = Fishing = To legally be able to fish on Platte Lake, you must have a fishing license.

The Commission campaigns to create a culture in Kenya where human rights and democratic culture are entrenched. It does this through monitoring, documenting and publicising rights violations. Organization The KHRC relies on donations from individuals and from organisations such as the Swedish International Development Agency, Christian Aid, Trocaire, Danish International Development Agency, United Nations Development Programme, UNIFEM, Canadian International Development Agency, The Ford Foundation, Swedish International Development Agency and others. A board of directors provides oversight. The commission management is headed by an Executive Director, and Programme Officers are responsible for specific activities. Programs involve Advocacy, Research, Monitoring and Documentation and Media, Publicity and Communication. The KHRC is a member organisation of the International Network for Economic, Social & Cultural Rights. The KHRC is a partner of the Centre for Research on Multinational Corporations (SOMO), a non-profit research and network organisation that works on social, ecological and economic issues related to sustainable development. Action plan The KHRC tries to address the sustainability of the human rights movement, liberation of grassroots groups and organisations, social justice, accountability, and gender mainstreaming. The KHRC has published a roadmap for achieving human rights in Kenya based on a six-point action plan for de- ethnicising Kenyan politics, entrenching the constitution-making process in the current constitution, implementation of Transitional Justice, preserving the independence of democratic institutions, realising gender equality and equity in Kenyan society and empowering the civic commons. Activities Founded at a time when serious human rights abuses were prevalent in Kenya, between 1992 and 1998 the KHRC focused on monitoring, documenting and publicising violations of civil and political rights. The organisation helped strengthen the role of civil society, advocated democratic reforms and helped with the constitution-making process. Between 1999 and 2003 the KHRC began working on a broader range of economic, social and cultural rights. From 2004 onward, KHRC has been focusing on helping communities understand and claim their democratic and Human Rights. In March 2004 the KHRC met with Kenya Police and the Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative to discuss a Strategic plan for Police Reforms in Kenya. After the flawed Kenyan presidential election in December 2007 the Executive Director of the Commission, Lynne Muthoni Wanyeki received death threats due to statements she had made about the elections. She was described as a traitor to the Kikuyu people. Wanyeki had said the Government had used public resources to support its campaign and had failed to guarantee voter security, particularly in areas hit by ethnic conflicts. The commission was compiling a comprehensive report on human rights violations during the elections. In December 2009 Muthoni Wanyeki stated that the KHRC was in favour of having the International Criminal Court (ICC) launch investigations into the post-election violence. However, human rights activists were concerned about the safety of witnesses who provided evidence to the ICC, since the government was unlikely to give them any protection. In 2009 the KHRC filed a representative suit in the British High Court on behalf of survivors of the Mau Mau, an anti-colonialist movement, seeking reparations for abuses during the extended state of emergency between 1952 and 1960. One of the objectives was to implant the tools for comprehensive transitional justice in Kenya by addressing the problems of impunity for past abuse. In May 2011 the commission issued a report in which it called for the government to decriminalise homosexuality. The commission stated that \\"LGBTI individuals in Kenya continue to be some of the most marginalized and discriminated individuals because of their real or perceived sexual orientation or gender identity.\\" It criticized anti-gay violence and discrimination, and even was supportive of gay marriage.

Early life  He was born in Shariatpur, British India (now Bangladesh), to Munshi Mobarak and Maleka Begum. He was the eldest son among nine children. He is married and has three children – two sons and a daughter. Their names are Firoze Shawkat Ali, Khaled Shawkat Ali, and Marina Shawkat Ali. Shawkat Ali completed his LL.B. from Comilla Law College under the University of Dhaka in 1958 before he joined the Pakistan Army as a commissioned officer the following year. = Agartala Conspiracy Case = Shawkat Ali was a captain in 1968 when he was Accused No. 26 of the 35 implicated in the Agartala Conspiracy Case as a conspirator to secede East Pakistan from Pakistan. Initially he was supposed to be tried before a court-martial, but the Government of Pakistan felt they would benefit more from a civil trial. The charges were dropped the next year amidst public protest; Shawkat was still forced to retire in 1969. Although it was largely thought that the case was only meant to frame Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and others, in 2010, and on the anniversary of the withdrawal of the case on 22 February 2011, Shawkat Ali confessed to the Parliament at a point of order that the charges read out to them were accurate, stating that they formed a Shangram Parishad under Sheikh Mujibur for the sedition and secession of East Pakistan.  Time in the Bangladesh Army  After Bangladesh declared independence from Pakistan and the war broke out, Shawkat was reinstated into the army after the formation of the Bangladesh Forces in 1971 to fight the Bangladesh Liberation War. He was forced to retire the second time when he was a colonel in 1975 working as the Director of Ordnance Services following the assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, since he was close to Mujibur.

With four Olympic gold medals, having won both the team pursuit and the omnium at both the 2012 and 2016 games, Kenny is both the most successful female track cyclist in Olympic history (behind only Dutch track and road legend Leontien van Moorsel among all female cyclists), and Great Britain's most successful Olympic female competitor in any sport. Since first appearing at the European Track Championships in 2010, she has won seven World Championship, a record thirteen European Championship and one Commonwealth Games titles, as part of a total of 29 medals. On the road, Kenny won the British National Road Race Championships in 2014, taking the under-23 title in the same race, and has ridden for the team since 2015. Early life Laura Trott was born a month prematurely in Harlow in Essex with a collapsed lung and was later diagnosed with asthma. She was advised by doctors to take up sport in order to regulate her breathing. She enjoyed and competed in trampolining but had to give up due to respiratory problems. She grew up in Cheshunt in Hertfordshire, where she attended Turnford School. Her older sister Emma Trott is a former road racing cyclist. Together with her sister, she began cycling when her mother did so to lose weight. Career She won two junior titles at both the 2009 and 2010 British National Track Championships, and placed third in the individual pursuit at the latter to win a place in the 2010 European Track Championships team pursuit squad aged just 18. After winning gold at the Euros, she went on to take her first world title at the 2011 championships, again as part of the team pursuit squad. In the run-up to the 2012 Olympics she won a further two World and two European golds, in both the team pursuit and the ominum, before securing her place in the Great Britain team as those events made their Olympic debut. At the 2012 Summer Olympics, Trott won a gold medal in the team pursuit with Dani King and Joanna Rowsell. The team set a world record time of 3:14.051 in this event. Including pre-Olympics races and the Olympics final itself, in the six times they had ridden together they had broken the world record in every race. She also won gold in the omnium, two days after winning gold in the team pursuit. For the 2012 road season, Trott joined Team Ibis Cycles, though she competed in only five races. 2013 saw her increase her road racing commitments with new team Wiggle Honda. Her best result was a second place at the British National Road Race Championships, bringing her the under-23 title, though her road racing was intended to function in service of her track preparation, rather than replacing it. Trott took further World and European team pursuit gold medals at the 2013 and 2014 championships, as well as European ominium title and World ominium silver in both those years. After making the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow her focus for this period, she entered the games with a kidney infection and finished well down the field in the scratch race and individual pursuit. Recovering as the Games progressed, she won a gold medal for England, in the points race. On the road she went one better at the national road championships, winning the title for her first senior road race win. In February 2015, Trott failed to win a title at the World Championships for the first time in her career, finishing second in both the team pursuit and omnium. The result was part of a poor Championships for Britain, with the team finishing without a gold for the first time since 2001. Trott moved to the new Matrix Fitness Vulpine team for 2015 as a lead rider, moving to the team in order to better combine her road and track cycling ambitions. After a road season in which her best result was 3rd in National Championships, Trott returned won three gold medals at the 2015 European Championships, in the team pursuit, scratch race and omnium. She followed this with gold medals in the scratch race and omnium at the 2016 World Championships in London, as well as a bronze in the team pursuit. team pursuit gold at the 2016 Olympics At the 2016 Olympics Trott was a favourite for the omnium, and with hopes of a medal in the team pursuit. In the team pursuit, Great Britain took gold setting world records in the qualification and final of the tournament, defeating the American world champions in the final. This made Trott the first British woman to win three golds, though this achievement was matched by Charlotte Dujardin the next day. In the Ominium, Trott dominated from the start and finished in the top two in five of the six events, to take a comfortable gold medal and once again become Britain's most successful female Olympian. Following the end of the track cycling competition at the games, Trott and her fiancé Jason Kenny were lauded in the British press as a 'golden couple', having won five gold medals between them in 2016, to reach a total of ten as a couple. Personal life Trott married track cyclist Jason Kenny at a private ceremony on 24 September 2016. The couple live near Knutsford in Cheshire. On 14 February 2017, it was announced that the couple were expecting their first child. Their son was born on the 23 August 2017. They named him Albert Louie Kenny. Kenny announced the news with a post on Instagram. Laura Kenny's parents are Glenda and Adrian Trott, who live in Cheshunt, and she has an older sister Emma, who lives in Christchurch, New Zealand. Honours and awards Trott was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2013 New Year Honours for services to cycling and Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2017 New Year Honours, also for services to cycling. Both Laura and Jason Kenny received their CBEs on Tuesday 25 April 2017 at an Investiture in Buckingham Palace. She received an Honorary Degree from the University of Essex in 2013. In 2014, the former Grundy Park Leisure Centre in Cheshunt was renamed The Laura Trott Leisure Centre in her honour following a £4 million redevelopment. Trott attended the launch ahead of competing in stage four of the first Women's Tour from Cheshunt to Welwyn Garden City.

It is one of Raleigh's historic Five Points neighborhoods. Like Roanoke Park, its homes reflect the variety of popular architectural styles from the 1920s through the 1950s and are similar to those found in the nearby prestigious suburb of Hayes Barton, but are more modest in scale. Notably, the popular Colonial style was not used due to Vanguard Park's narrower lots. Construction began in this district along its south and west edges in 1920 with modestly sized American Craftsman bungalows and front-gabled houses. Building slowed considerably during the Depression; homes built in the following years were one- and two- story houses in the Minimal Traditional style. During World War II construction stopped abruptly, only to rebound robustly during the post-war housing shortage. Nearly fifty houses went up in Vanguard Park between 1945 and 1952; Pine Avenue was filled with houses in a single year. Most of these early post-war houses continued to use the Minimal Traditional style. The Gothic Revival style Westminster Presbyterian Church, formerly North Vanguard Church, is the sole institutional building in Vanguard Park. Vanguard Park was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2003.

Groves is an American chemist, and Hugh Stott Taylor Chair of Chemistry, at Princeton University. Biography Groves received an undergraduate degree in chemistry at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he worked with Frederick Greene. In 1965, he began his doctoral studies under the direction of Professor Ronald Breslow at the Columbia University. During this time, he focused on the synthesis and characterization of cyclopropenyl cation, the simplest aromatic system and the first aromatic compound prepared with other than six electrons in a ring. Upon receiving his Ph.D., Groves began his independent research career as a member of the chemistry faculty at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor in 1969. In 1985, he moved to Princeton University where he is Hugh Stott Taylor Chair of Chemistry. The major thrust of his research program is at the interface of organic, inorganic, and biological chemistry. Recent efforts have focused on the design of new, biomimetic catalysts and the molecular mechanisms of metal- catalyzed redox processes, the design and assembly of large scale membrane- protein-small molecule constructs, strategies for the assembly of biogenic hard materials, molecular probes of peroxynitrite-mediated protein nitration, pharmaceutical strategies for protection against peroxynitrite-mediated pathologies, and mechanisms by which pathogens acquire metabolic iron from host cells. Groves's many awards include: A. C. Cope Scholar Award (1989), Alfred Bader Award in Bioorganic and Bioinorganic Chemistry (1996), National Science Foundation Extension Award for Special Creativity, (2008-2011), Frontiers in Biological Chemistry Award (2009), and ACS Ira Remsen Award (2010). He is a member of the National Academy of Sciences, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He is also a foreign member of the Royal Society. He is on the Management Committee, of the Center for Catalytic Hydrocarbon Functionalization, at the University of Virginia. Oxygen rebound mechanism Cytochrome P-450 and other oxygenase enzymes catalyze a diversity of oxidations, including hydroxylation of hydrocarbons. In 1976, Groves and coworkers proposed the oxygen rebound mechanism to explain the observations. The central idea is that hydroxylation proceeds, not by direct insertion of O into a C-H bond, but rather by abstraction of H from the hydrocarbon to generate a reactive metal-hydroxide, which subsequently recombines (or rebounds) with the organic radical. Metalloporphyrins as P450 model compounds In 1978, Groves and his collaborators reported the first catalytic alkane hydroxylation and alkene epoxidation catalyzed by a synthetic iron(III) porphyrin complex, Fe(TPP)Cl using an iodosylbenzene (PhIO) oxidant. In the reactions, alkenes and alkanes were oxidized to the corresponding epoxides and alcohols, respectively. The first use of a chiral iron porphyrin to carry out asymmetric epoxidation was reported in 1983 by Groves and Myers. Various substituted styrenes and aliphatic olefins were epoxidized with ee varying between 0% for 1-methylcyclohexene oxide and 51% for pchlorostyrene oxide. The ee was improved to ~70% for epoxidation of cis-β-methylstyrene with a robust chiral vaulted binaphthyl porphyrin. In 1980, Groves reported the first manganese porphyrin catalyzed hydrocarbon oxidation reaction, using a Mn(TPP)Cl catalyst. In that study, oxidation of cyclohexane with iodosylbenzene catalyzed by Mn(TPP)Cl afforded a 2.5 : 1 mixture of cyclohexanol and cyclohexyl chloride in a total 70% yield. Oxidation of a radical clock substrate, norcarane, produced significant amounts of radical rearranged products, suggesting the presence of a long-lived free alkyl radical.

Silvestre was killed because of his reporting about drug trafficking and not government retribution. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, Silvestre was the third journalist murdered in the Dominican Republic since 1992. Personal Data José Agustín Silvestre, age 59 at the time of his murder, was survived by his wife and 11 children. He is buried in the old municipal cemetery in La Romana, Dominican Republic.  Career  Silvestre, a 36-year veteran of journalism and muckraker, hosted a television program \\"La Voz de la Verdad\\" (Translation: Voice of Truth) on regional TV station Caña TV since 1975 and edited the magazine named after the show since 1982. In 2010, he released a video of police brutality and murder that gained public attention. A case of libel had already been brought against Silvestre for his report where he accused political figures and a priest, who were supposed to be part of anti-drug efforts, of being involved in drug trafficking. Silvestre had previously spent 6 days in jail in May and June before making bail. The prosecutor José Polanco Ramírez had brought libel charges against Silvestre and he was to appear in court the day on which he was killed.  Death  Silvestre was abducted and murdered 2 August 2011 in connection with his reports about drug trafficking. The week before an attempt had been made on Silvestre's life. Police allege Matías Avelino Castro, also known as \\"Daniel\\" or \\"Daniel the Big Gun of Samana,\\" ordered his murder. Silvestre was seized by at least four men outside a La Romana hotel near his home and was forced into a Ford Explorer. The attackers shot Silvestre three times to kill him and then dumped his corpse near a highway at a place called \\"El Peñón\\", which is near Sabana del Soco, San Pedro de Macorís, and is located between La Romana and Santo Domingo. Police say Castro, who also goes by the alias Joaquín Espinal Almeyda, wanted to avenge a mention in an article by Silvestre linking him to criminal activity, including the murder of two people in the eastern city of La Romana. Silvestre said before his murder that he would make an announcement on his TV program. The National Police arrested five men and found guns and money around a week later. Police allege the five were responsible for the attack on Silvestre and placed them in preventative custody. At the time, Castro was not found by police. According to a report by Diaro Libre on 28 September 2011, the SUV that the perpetrators used had come from an Avis car rental facility in La Caleta, Boca Chica, and the manager of that facility, who was in custody, died as he was being transferred from a detention center to a medical facility. In December 2011, José Rijo, the Cincinnati Reds pitcher who won the World Series Most Valuable Player Award in 1990, was subpoenaed by the Dominican Republic's Anti-Money Laundering Unit in relation to his business dealings with Castro, who was also a hotel and advertising agency owner, and for any information about Silvestre's murder. German Miranda, who is the head of the unit, said an arrest warrant had been issued for Rijo. The next day, 14 December 2011, Rijo was interviewed by two sections of the Justice Ministry and confirmed his business relationship with Castro. In February 2013, Castro was arrested in Spain by Interpol.  Context  José Agustín Silvestre de los Santos died for reporting about drug trafficking and the suspected person behind his murder, Matías Avelino Castro, has been alleged to belong to the Samaná drug cartel in the Dominican Republic. According to the CIA World Factbook, drug trafficking is an issue in the Dominican Republic. The Dominican Republic is a hub for drugs from South America or ecstasy from The Netherlands and Belgium.

It is the seat of the Diocese of Lake Charles. Immaculate Conception Parish was established in 1869, and it became a cathedral in 1980. The church building, rectory, and a garage are listed together on the National Register of Historic Places. History The canonically crowned image of the Blessed Virgin Mary as presently enshrined within the cathedral's high altar. St. Francis de Sales was the first Catholic church in Lake Charles. with . (with three photos and two maps ) It was built in 1858 as a mission chapel. The parish was organized in 1869 under the same name and it received its first resident priest at that time. The church was damaged by a hurricane in 1879 and the parish decided to build a new building. The parish was renamed Immaculate Conception at that time, and the new church building was completed in 1881. This church, other parish buildings, as well as neighboring buildings and homes were destroyed in a fire on April 23, 1910. Plans for the current church were begun at this time. It was designed by the prominent New Orleans architectural firm of Favrot & Livaudais and it was completed in 1913. The attached rectory and garage, which share the church's historic designation, were completed in the same year. The complex was designed in a regional Romanesque Revival style typical of Lombardy in Italy. The three marble altars in the Gothic style were installed in the church in 1923. They were originally in a church in Salt Lake City and were acquired for Immaculate Conception when the church in Utah was remodeled. The marble wainscot was added to the walls of the side aisles and the chancel around 1950. At the same time, the columns in the nave were sheathed in marble and the marble pulpit were added at this time. A rubble stone grotto that contains a statue of the Blessed Virgin Mary was added to the church property in 1948. A brick wing on the northeast side of the church contains a small chapel and parish life center. It was designed by the architectural firm of Dunn and Quinn and it was completed in 1973. It matches the church's Romanesque architecture. A courtyard is located between the addition and the church. On January 29, 1980, Pope John Paul II established the Diocese of Lake Charles and Immaculate Conception became the cathedral for the new diocese. The church was added to the National Register of Historic Places on October 7, 1994. Its historic significance is attributed to its architectural style. It is the only Romanesque Revival building in Lake Charles, and one of only ten architecturally noteworthy non-residential buildings left in the city after a demolition and modernization champaign from the 1950s to the 1970s. The cathedral church enshrines a century-old image of the Blessed Virgin Mary of the Immaculate Conception made of Carrara marble. The venerated image was granted a Canonical coronation by the Pope Benedict XVI in 2013. A church renovation project was completed in 2019. On August 27, 2020, Hurricane Laura struck the city of Lake Charles. The cathedral and the nearby diocesan chancery building sustained roof damage with the chancery uninhabitable.

Accusations also appeared in the review of Mackay's book by The Washington Post. By Bruce's own count, 285 pages of Mackay's 297-page book Alexander Graham Bell: A Life contained plagiarisms from his book, including Mackay's acknowledging the National Geographic Society and other organizations that had not heard of Mackay.

Soll's work examines the mechanics of politics, statecraft and economics by dissecting the various elements of how modern states and political systems succeed and fail. He studies the philosophies of political and economic freedom with a focus on the relationship of the individual to the state. His first book, Publishing ¨The Prince¨: Reading, History, and the Birth of Political Criticism,\\" (2005) a study of the influence of Machiavelli's theory of prudence from the Enlightenment to the Renaissance, won the 2005 Jacques Barzun Prize in Cultural History. Soll was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in 2009 to write his second book, The Information Master: Jean Baptiste Colbert's State Information System, a history of Louis XIV's famous finance minister, Jean- Baptiste Colbert's use of information in state- building.http://barzun100.blogspot.com/2006/09/jacob-soll-wins-barzun- prize.html In 2011 he was awarded a $500,000 MacArthur Fellowship, known as the \\"Genius Grant\\" for his work on the history of the state. At the University of Southern California, he teaches on the philosophy of economic and political thought and Renaissance and Enlightenment history and has organized forums on European politics.  Early life and education  Soll was born in Madison, Wisconsin. His parents are David Soll, a molecular geneticist, and Beth Soll, née Bronfenbrenner, a modern dance choreographer. His grandfather is child psychologist Urie Bronfenbrenner. Through his maternal Grandmother, Liese Bronfenbrenner, née Price, Soll is the great grandson of the English author and professor, Hereward Thimbleby Price, and a descendant of the Prym family of industrialists and academics from Aachen, Stolberg, Düren and Bonn, Germany. Early hometowns included Cambridge, Massachusetts, Iowa City, and Paris, France. Soll resides in Los Angeles. He earned a B.A. from the University of Iowa in 1991,http://fyi.uiowa.edu/09/20/soll-genius-award/ a D.E.A. in 1993 from École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales, and a Ph.D. in 1998 from Magdalene College, Cambridge, where he was MCR President.  Academic career  After completing his Ph.D., Soll was, previously, a lecturer at Princeton University (1997-1999) and a Professor of History at Rutgers University-Camden (1999-2012). He was a Bolseiro of Portugal's Biblioteca Nacionale de Lisboa; a Fernand Braudel Professor at the European University Institute in Florence in 2007; a Visiting Fellow at Trinity College, Cambridge in 2009; and a Visiting Fellow at the Max Planck Institute in 2018. In 2013, Soll delivered the Huygens-Descartes Lecture at the Akadamie van Wetenschappen in Amsterdam. Soll was named a University Professor at USC in 2018, one of about twenty senior distinguished professors at the University of Southern California. Soll's first book, Publishing The Prince (2005), examines the role of commentaries, editions, and translations of Machiavelli produced by the previously little-studied figure Amelot de La Houssaye (1634-1706), who became the most influential writer on secular politics during the reign of Louis XIV. Grounded in analysis of archival, manuscript, and early printed sources, Soll shows how Amelot and his publishers arranged prefaces, columns, and footnotes in a manner that transformed established works, imbuing books previously considered as supporting royal power with an alternate, even revolutionary, political message. Publishing \\"The Prince\\" was the winner of the American Philosophical Society's 2005 Barzun Prize. In his second book, The Information Master (2009), he investigates the formation of a state-information gathering and classifying network by Louis XIV's chief minister, Jean-Baptiste Colbert, revealing that Colbert's passion for information was both a means of control and a medium for his own political advancement: his systematic and encyclopedic information collection served to strengthen and uphold Louis XIV's absolute rule. With these and other projects in progress including an intellectual and practical history of accounting and its role in governance in the modern world and a study of the composition of library catalogues during the Enlightenment. In 2014, he authored The Reckoning: Financial Accountability and the Rise and Fall of Nations (2014). A history of the role of accounting in political and financial accountability from the Ancient world to the modern age was a worldwide best-seller, particularly in Asia where it received numerous positive reviews. The Financial Times noted that in: > Soll's wry and lucid book ... accountability and accountancy become a way of > investigating the rise and fall of nations. The book has sold more than 100,000 thousand copies and has been a best-seller in Japan and other Asian countries. It also led to Soll taking an active role in advising the Greek government during its debt crisis. He addressed the Hellenic Parliament about the history of public financial management in June 2018, on the eve of the end of the Greek bailout. He has worked closely with and advises a number world leaders. Soll has also advised the Portuguese government, the Spanish government, as well as the European Commission. Recently the government of Beijing recommended that Chinese citizens read the book. The recipient of two NEH Fellowships, Soll is currently completing his new books, Free Market: The History of a Dream; The Enlightenment Library and the Collection of Liberty; and the first English edition of Jean-Baptiste Colbert's financial writings.  Journalistic contributions  Soll is a regular contributor to Politico, The New Republic, the New York Times, the Boston Globe, and the Chronicle of Higher Education.

The unit was originally organized from volunteer companies raised from the Arkansas State Militia in the Southern Arkansas Counties in the winter of 1863–1864 after the fall of Little Rock. It was originally organized as Pettus Battalion, Arkansas State Troops but was later enrolled in Confederal Service and Robert Crittenden Newton was elected Colonel.  Organization  Netwon's 10th Arkansas Cavalry Regiment was originally organized as a group of Volunteer Companies raised from the militia regiments of southern Arkansas, immediately following the fall of Little Rock, Arkansas, to Union forces in September 1863. Governor Harris Flanagin began organizing a new force of state troops issuing a proclamation on August 10, 1863, just a month before the capitol fell, announcing that he had been authorized to raise new regiments of state troops and that by special agreement these new units could not be transferred out of the state by Confederate authorities. After the fall of Little Rock, recruiting was far more difficult than it had been in the first years of the war. The constant transfer of Arkansas troops into the eastern theater of the war, across the Mississippi River from their homes, was a major objection by the remaining population of men eligible for military service. With Federal forces now occupying the state capitol, the Confederate state government had no way of enforcing conscription laws in the counties behind the Union lines, except during raids by Generals Price and Shelby in 1864. The remaining Confederate regiments were plagued by desertions. On September 16, 1863, in the immediate aftermath of the fall of the state capitol, Governor Flanagin issued General Order No. 6 from Arkadelphia, which called into service the militia regiments of the counties of Clark, Hempstead, Sevier, Pike, Polk, Montgomery, La Fayette, Ouachita, Union, and Columbia in order to resist the Federal army. The Governor's order directed the regiments to march to Arkadelphia at the earliest possible day. Companies were to be mounted and commanders were to compel persons evading the call to come to the rendezvous. The intent was to form companies of twelve-month mounted volunteers. Only six physicians, one druggist, millers to supply the wants of the country, clerks, sheriffs, postmasters, and persons in the employ of the Confederate States were exempted from the order. In describing this call in a letter to General Holmes dated October 18, 1863, from Washington, Arkansas, the new Confederate state capitol, Flanagin stated that he issued the order calling out the militia, as an experiment, expecting to get volunteers. The order succeeded so well as to get companies organized in the counties where the call for the militia was enforced which resulted in seven companies being collected under the call. Flanagin also stated that \\"the troops raised by the State are more than double all the troops raised by volunteering, or by the conscript law, within the past few months\\". On October 26, 1863 Governor Flanagin directed his Adjutant General Gordon N. Peay to: These new units of Arkansas State Troops were placed under the overall command of Col. William H. Trader who was detailed to Governor Flanagin by General E. Kirby Smith. Col. Trader remained in command of the state troops until he resigned in June 1864. = Pettus Battalion, Arkansas State Troops = On January 14, 1864, Governor Flanagin, through General Peay, issued General Orders, No. 8. which directed the following named companies of Arkansas mounted volunteers, which had been called into the service of the State under the proclamation of the August 10, A.D. 1863, compose and be designated as the 1st Battalion, Arkansas State Troops: * Company A – of Hempstead County, Captain E. K. Williamson, commanding. * Company B – of Clark County, Captain Reuben C. Reed, commanding. * Company C – of Sevier County, Captain Allen T. Pettus, commanding. * Company D – of Polk County, Captain G. A. Hale, commanding. * Company E – of Hot Spring County, Captain John W. Dyer, commanding. Allen T. Pettus was elected Lieutenant Colonel of this battalion. The unit participated in the battle of Marks Mill on April 25, 1864, as a part of Brigadier General William L. Cabell's Division. Lt. Col. Pettus was killed during the battle and Capt. P.K. Williamson of Company A commanded the battalion until the unit was increased to a regiment and transferred to Confederate service. = Newton's 10th Arkansas Cavalry Regiment = In August 1864 when the term of enlistment for these state troops was about to expire, Adjutant General Peay issued an order which directed that companies be allowed to vote on the subject of being transferred into Confederate service. However, the chance to vote on being transferred was merely a matter of form because Peay's order also had directions for those who refused transfer to Confederate service: On September 5, 1864, the State Troop companies, including Pettus Battalion, were formed into one regiment of cavalry to be designated as the 3rd Regiment of Arkansas Cavalry, with Col. Robert C. Newton assigned to the command of the regiment until an election could be held for field officers. The companies of this regiment included: * Company A — Capt. Reuben C. Reed, composed of men from Clark County.

Constitution Even before the Norman Conquest the Bishops of Durham appear to have claimed palatinate or quasi-palatinate rights and jurisdiction. This prescriptive franchise was confirmed by charters of William the Conqueror, William Rufus, Henry I and Henry II.4 Co Inst 216. See also Bishop William de St Carileph's charter to convent of Durham (1082); Registrum Palatinum Dunelmense, Vol I, pp lxvi to lxviii. See also Williamson, Palatine Court of Durham Act 1889, pp 3 to 14. In the reign of Edward I, Anthony Bek, the then Bishop was summoned to appear before the King's Justices under the Statute of \\"Quo Warranto\\" (18 Edw 1)Statute \\"De quo Warranto\\" (1289 to 1290) to show how he held his franchise, and on his refusal to appear his franchise was seized into the King's hands in the name of distress. The Bishop appealed to the King and his council in Parliament, who held that he was entitled to jura regalia between Tyne and Tees, and in Norhamshire and Bedlington. In 1836 the jura regalia of the Bishop of Durham were transferred to the Crown.The Durham (County Palatine) Act 1836 (6 & 7 Will 4 c 19). The jurisdiction of the Chancery Court and the Court of Pleas was not altered by this Act. The jurisdiction of the Court of Pleas was transferred to the High Court by the Judicature Act 1873 (36 & 37 Vict c 66), s 16., The last one surviving was the Court of Chancery of the County Palatine of Durham, the exercise of the jurisdiction being assimilated to that of the High Court of Justice from 1889.The Palatine Court of Durham Act 1889 (52 & 53 Vict c 47) Halsbury's Laws of England, First Edition, 1909, vol 9, pp 124 & 125, para 263 Jurisdiction The jurisdiction of the court was unlimited in amount, but limited in area to the county palatine which, as of 1909, certainly included the whole of what was then the county of Durham, and possibly other districts.Halsbury's Laws of England, First Edition, 1909, vol 9, p 125, para 264 The Durham (County Palatine) Act 1836 (6 & 7 Will 4 c 19), defined \\"county of Durham\\" as \\"including the detached parts of Craikshire, Bedlingtonshire, Norhamshire, Allertonshire, and Islandshire, and all other places heretofore within the jurisdiction of the Bishop of Durham, in right of the said county palatine.\\" By 1909 it had not been decided what the effect upon this was of the enactment of the Counties (Detached Parts) Act 1844 (7 & 8 Vict c 61), annexing detached parts of counties to the county of which it formed part for the purposes of parliamentary elections. The First Edition of Halsbury's Laws of England, however, suggested that an Act of this nature would not affect the jura regalia without express enactment. The Palatine Court of Durham Act 1889 (52 & 53 Vict c 47) did not define the area over which the court had jurisdiction.Halsbury's Laws of England, First Edition, 1909, vol 9, p 125, footnote i.

With the increased performance of network interfaces, there is a corresponding need for faster packet processingD. Cerović, V. Del Piccolo, A. Amamou, K. Haddadou and G. Pujolle, Fast Packet Processing: A Survey, in IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials, vol. 20, no. 4, pp. 3645-3676, Fourthquarter 2018. doi: 10.1109/COMST.2018.2851072. There are two broad classes of packet processing algorithms that align with the standardized network subdivision of control plane and data plane. The algorithms are applied to either: :* Control information contained in a packet which is used to transfer the packet safely and efficiently from origin to destination :or :* The data content (frequently called the payload) of the packet which is used to provide some content-specific transformation or take a content-driven action. Within any network enabled device (e.g. router, switch, network element or terminal such as a computer or smartphone) it is the packet processing subsystem that manages the traversal of the multi-layered network or protocol stack from the lower, physical and network layers all the way through to the application layer.  History  The history of packet processing is the history of the Internet and packet switching. Packet processing milestones include: * 1962–1968: Early research into packet switching * 1969: 1st two nodes of ARPANET connected; 15 sites connected by end of 1971 with email as a new application * 1973: Packet switched voice connections over ARPANET with Network Voice Protocol. File Transfer Protocol (FTP) specified * 1974: Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) specified * 1979: VoIP – NVP running on early versions of IP * 1981: IP and TCP standardized * 1982: TCP/IP standardized * 1991: World Wide Web (WWW) released by CERN, authored by Tim Berners-Lee * 1998: IPv6 first published Historical references and timeline can be found in the External Resources section below.  Communications models  For networks to succeed it is necessary to have a unifying standard for which defines the architecture of networking systems. The fundamental requirement for such a standard is to provide a framework that enables the hardware and software manufacturers around the world to develop networking technologies that will work together and to harness their cumulative investment capabilities to move the state of networking forward. In the 1970s, two organizations, the International Organization for StandardizationInternational Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International Telegraph and Telephone Consultative CommitteeInternational Telecommunication Union) (CCITT, now called the International Telecommunication Union (ITU-T) each initiated projects with the goal of developing international networking standards. In 1983, these efforts were merged and in 1984 the standard, called The Basic Reference Model for Open Systems Interconnection,ISO/IEC 10731:1994. Information technology -- Open Systems Interconnection -- Basic Reference Model -- Conventions for the definition of OSI services was published by ISO and as standard X.200ITU-T X.200-199407, X.200 : Information technology - Open Systems Interconnection - Basic Reference Model: The basic model by the ITU-T. The OSI Model is a 7 layer modelTech-FAQ. The OSI Model – What It Is; Why It Matters; Why It Doesn’t Matter describing how a network operating system works. A layered model has many benefitsComputer Networking Notes. Advantages of OSI 7 Layer Model including the ability to change one layer without impacting the others and as a model for understanding how a network OS works. As long as the interconnection between layers is maintained, vendors can enhance the implementation of an individual layer without impact on other layers. In parallel with the development of the OSI model, a research network was being implemented by the United States Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). The internetworking protocol developed to support the network, called ARPAnet,Living Internet. ARPANET -- The First Internet was called TCP or Transmission Control Program. As research and development progressed and the size of the network grew, it was determined that the internetworking design that was being used was becoming unwieldy and it did not exactly follow the layered approach of the OSI Model. This led to the splitting of the original TCP and the creation of the TCP/IP architectureW3 Schools, TCP/IP Tutorial \\\\- TCP now standing for Transmission Control Protocol and IP standing for Internet Protocol.  Advent of packet processing  Packet networksSheldon, Tom. Packets and Packet Processing Networks. Linktionary, 2001. came about as a result of the need in the early 1960s to make communications networks more reliable. It can be viewed as the implementation of the layered model using a packet structure. Early commercial networks were composed of dedicated, analog circuits used for voice communications. The concept of packet switching was introduced to create a communications network that would continue to function in spite of equipment failures throughout the network. In this paradigm shift, networks are viewed as collections of systems that transmit data in small packets that work their way from origin to destination by any number of routes. Initial packet processing functions supported the routing of packets through the network, transmission error detection and correction and other network management functions. Packet switching with its supporting packet processing functions has several practical benefits over traditional circuit- switched networks:Copeland, Lee. QuickStudy: Packet-Switched vs. Circuit- Switched Networks. Computerworld, March 2000. * An all-digital environment supporting multiple data types (such as voice, data and video) not only enriched the lives of users,Negroponte, N. Being Digital. Vintage, Jan. 1996.Reding, Viviane. Digital convergence: a whole new way of life. Digital Lifestyle Exhibition, May 2006. it significantly increased the efficiency of network providers who previously had to implement different networks to support different data types. * Greater bandwidth utilization, with multiple ’logical circuits’ using the same physical links * Communications survivability due to multiple paths through the network from any origin to any destination * Added-value information services can be introduced using packet processing functions to provide the necessary processing  Packet structure  A network packet is the fundamental building block for packet-switched networks.Peterson, L. and Davie, B. Computer Networks (5th Edition): A Systems Approach. Morgon Kaufmann, March 2011. When an item such as a file, e-mail message, voice or video stream is transmitted through the network, it is broken into chunks called packets that can be more efficiently moved through the network than one large block of data. Numerous standardsRFC Sourcebook. IP, Internet Protocol. cover the structure of packets, but typically packets are composed of three elements: * Header – contains information about the packet, including origin, destination, length and packet number. * Payload (or body) – contains the data that comprises the packet * Trailer – indicates the end of the packet and frequently include error detection and correction information In a packet-switched network, the sending host computer packetizes the original item and each packet is routed through the network to its destination. Some networks used fixed length packets, typically 1024 bits, while others use variable length packets and include the packet length in the header. Individual packets may take different routes to the destination and arrive at the destination out of order. The destination computer verifies the correctness of the data in each packet (using information in the trailer), reassembles the original item using the packet number information in the header, and presents the item to the receiving application or user. This basic example includes the three most fundamental packet processing functions, packetization, routing, and assembly. Packet processing functions range from the simple to highly complex. As an example, the routing function is actually a multi-step processStreenstrup, M. Routing in Communications Networks. Prentice Hall, April 1995. involving various optimization algorithms and table lookups. A basic routing function on the Internet looks something like: :1. Check to see if the destination is an address ‘owned’ by this computer. If so, process the packet. If not: ::a. Check to see if IP Forwarding is set to ‘Yes’. If no, the packet is destroyed. If yes, then :::i. Check to see if a network attached to this computer owns the destination address. If yes, route the packet to the appropriate network. If no, then ::::1. Check to see if there is any route to the destination network. If yes, route the packet to the next hop gateway. If no, destroy the packet. More advanced routing functions include network load balancingAnderson, P. and James, L. Performance soars, features vary - Review: Load Balancers. NetworkWorldFusion, June 1999. and fastest route algorithms.Murthy,S. Routing in Packet-Switched Networks Using Path-Finding Algorithms. UC Santa Cruz, 1996. These examples illustrate the range of packet processing algorithms possible and how they can introduce significant delaysU. of Maryland. Introduction, Rate and Latency. 2009 into the transmission of an item. Network equipment designers frequently use a combination of hardware and software accelerators to minimize the latency in the network.  Network equipment architecture  IP-based equipment can be partitioned into three basic elements: data plane, control plane and management plane.Nokia Communications Framework Guide. What are Planes?. February 2010. = Data plane = The data plane is a subsystem of a network node that receives and sends packets from an interface, processes them as required by the applicable protocol, and delivers, drops, or forwards them as appropriate. = Control plane = The control plane maintains information that can be used to change data used by the data plane. Maintaining this information requires handling complex signaling protocols. Implementing these protocols in the data plane would lead to poor forwarding performance. A common way to manage these protocols is to let the data plane detect incoming signaling packets and locally forward them to the control plane. The control plane signaling protocols can update the data plane information and inject outgoing signaling packets into the data plane. This architecture works because signaling traffic is a very small part of the global traffic. = Management plane = The management plane provides an administrative interface into the overall system. It contains processes that support operational administration, management or configuration/provisioning actions such as: * Facilities for supporting statistics collection and aggregation, * Support for the implementation of management protocols, * Command line interface, graphical user configuration interfaces through Web pages or traditional SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) management. More sophisticated solutions based on XML (eXtensible Markup Language) can also be included.  Examples  The list of packet processing applicationsVin, H. Packet Processing Applications: An Overview. Univ. of Texas, Fall 2003. is usually divided into two categories. The following are a few examples selected to illustrate the variety in use today. = Control applications = * Forwarding, the basic operation of a router * Encryption/Decryption, the protection of information in the payload using cryptographic algorithms * Quality of Service (QOS), treating packets differently, such as providing prioritized or specialized services depending upon the packet’s class = Data applications = * Transcoding, the transformation of a particular video encoding to the particular encoding used by the destination * Transrating & Transizing,Reddy, M. Video Transcoding & Transrating - Video in 31 Flavors!. Vela, Sep. 2011. transforming an image size and density appropriate to the destination device * Image or Voice Recognition, the detection of a particular pattern (image or voice) that is matched to those in a database with some attending action taken when a match occurs * Advanced applications include areas such as security (call monitoring and data leak prevention), targeted advertising, tiered services, copyright enforcement and network usage statistics. These, and many other content-aware applications, are based on the ability to discern specific intelligence contained within packet payloads using Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) technologies.  Packet processing architectures  Packet switchingElhanany, I. and Hamdi, M. High Performance Packet Switching Architectures. Springer, November 2011. also introduces some architectural compromises. Performing packet processing functions in the transmission of information introduces delays that may be detrimental to the application being performed. For example, in voice and video applications, the necessary conversion from analog-to-digital and back again at the destination along with delays introduced by the network can cause noticeable gaps that are disruptive to the users. Latency is a measure of the time delay experienced by a complex system. Multiple architectural approaches to packet processing have been developedSelissen, M. Packet Processing Needs Balanced Between Architecture, Network. EE Times, Aug 2002. to address the performance and functionality requirements of a specific network and to address the latency issue. = Single threaded architecture (standard operating system) = A standard networking stack uses services provided by the Operating System (OS) running on a single processor (single threaded). While single threaded architectures are the simplest to implement, they are subject to overheads associated with the performance of OS functions such as preemptions, thread management, timers and locking. These OS processing overheads are imposed on each packet passing through the system, resulting in a throughput penalty. = Multi-threaded architecture (multi-processing operating system) = Performance improvements can be made to an OS networking stack by adapting the protocol stack processing software to support multiple processors (multi-threaded), either through the use of Symmetrical Multiprocessing (SMP) platforms or multicore processor architecture. Performance increases are realized for a small number of processors,Foong, A., Fung, J. and Newell, D. Improved Linux SMP Scaling: User-directed Processor Affinity. Intel Software Network, October 2008. but fails to scale linearly over larger numbers of processors (or cores) and a processor with, for example, eight cores may not process packets significantly faster than one with two cores. = Fast path architecture (operating system by-pass) = In a fast path implementation, the data plane is split into two layers. The lower layer, typically called the fast path, processes the majority of incoming packets outside the OS environment and without incurring any of the OS overheads that degrade overall performance. Only those packets that require complex processing are forwarded to the OS networking stack (the upper layer of the data plane), which performs the necessary management, signaling and control functions. When complex algorithms such as routing or security are required, the OS networking stack forwards the packet to dedicated software components in the control plane. A multicore processor can provide additional performance improvement to a fast path implementation.CDC Innovation. 6WIND Provides 10x Acceleration of Packet Processing Functions on New multicore Intel® Platforms. March, 2010. In order to maximize the overall system throughput, multiple cores can be dedicated to running the fast path, while only one core is required to run the Operating System, the OS networking stack and the application’s control plane. The only restriction when configuring the platform is that, since the cores running the fast path are running outside the OS, they must be dedicated exclusively to the fast path and not shared with other software. The system can also be reconfigured dynamically as traffic patterns change. Splitting the data plane into two layers also adds complexity as the two layers must have the same information to ensure system consistency.  Packet processing technologies  In order to create specialized packet processing platforms, a variety of technologies have been developed and deployed. These technologies, which span the breadth of hardware and software, have all been designed with the aim of maximizing speed and throughput while minimizing latency. = Network processors = A network processor unit (NPU) is similar in many respects to general purpose processors (GPP) that power most computers but with its internal architecture and functions tailored to network-centric operations. NPUs commonly have network- specific functions such as address lookup, pattern matching and queue management built into their microcode. Higher level packet processing operations such as security or intrusion detection are often built into NPU architectures.NetLogic Microsystems. Advanced Algorithmic Knowledge-based Processors. Network processor examples would include: * Intel - IXP2xxx family * Netronome - NFP-6xxx/4xxx/32xx families * PMC Sierra – Winpath family * EZChip – NP-x family = Multicore processors = A multicore processor is a single semiconductor package that has 2 or more cores, each representing an individual processing unit, capable of executing code in parallel. General purpose CPUs such as the Intel XeonIntel. Packet Processing with Intel® multicore Processors. 2008. now support up to 8 cores. Some multicore processors integrate dedicated packet processing capabilities to provide a complete SoC (System on Chip). They generally integrate Ethernet interfaces, crypto-engines, pattern matching engines, hardware queues for QoS and sometimes more sophisticated functions using micro-cores. All these hardware features are able to offload the software packet processing. Recent examples of these specialized multicore packages, such as the Cavium OCTEON II, can support from 2 up to 32 cores. * Tilera - TILE-Gx Processor Family * Cavium Networks - OCTEON & OCTEON II multicore Processor Families * Freescale – QorIQ Processing Platforms * NetLogic Microsystems – XLP, XLR and XLS Processor Families = Hardware accelerators = For clearly definable and repetitive actions, creating a dedicated accelerator built directly into a semiconductor hardware solution will speed up operations when compared to software running on a general purpose processor.Cheerla, R. Architecture Comparison For High Performance WAN Optimization Systems. Infineta, Cardinal Directions, March 2011. Initial implementations used FPGAs (field-programmable gate array) or ASICs (Application-specific Integrated Circuit), but now specific functions such as encryption and compression are built into both GPPs and NPUs as internal hardware accelerators. Current multicore processor examples with network-specific hardware accelerators include the Cavium CN63xx with acceleration for security, TCP/IP, QOS and HFA pattern matchingCavium. OCTEON II CN63XX multicore MIPS64 Internet Application Processors and the Netlogic Microsystems XFS processor family with networking and security acceleration engines.NetLogic Microsystems. multicore Processor Solutions = Deep packet inspection = Being able to make decisions based on the content of individual packets enables a wide variety of new applications such as Policy Charging and Rules Functions (PCRF) and Quality of Service. Packet processing systems separate out specific traffic types through the use of Deep Packet Inspection (DPI)dpacket.org Introduction to Deep Packet Inspection/Processing. technologies. DPI technologies utilize pattern matching algorithms to look inside the data payload to identify the contents of each and every packet flowing through a network device. Successful pattern matches are reported to the controlling application for any appropriate further action to be taken. = Packet processing software = Operating system software will contain certain standard network stacks that will operate in both single and multicore environments.Multicore Packet Processing Forum To be able to implement operating system by-pass (fast path) architectures requires the use of specialized packet processing software such as 6WIND's 6WINDGate. This type of software provides a suite of networking protocols that can be distributed across multiple blades, processors or cores and scale appropriately.

He was the son of activist Muriel Draper and the brother of dancer Paul Draper. When his engine failed over a school after take-off from RAF Hornchurch, Draper chose to guide his aircraft into the ground outside of the school to protect the students and faculty present. The school changed its name to Sanders Draper School in 1973, and was renamed Sanders School in 2014. The crash Flying Officer Raimund Sanders Draper, known as \\"Smudge\\", was an American volunteer World War II Royal Air Force (RAF) pilot of No. 64 Squadron. He deliberately crashed his Spitfire aircraft, to avoid hitting a school, after losing control on take-off from RAF Hornchurch, and was killed. The plane's engine cut out at an estimated altitude of and the plane went into a spin. As the plane headed for Suttons School, just from the airfield perimeter, Draper put the nose down and forced the aircraft into the ground short of the main building. The aircraft bounced and a wing stuck the building. Only one student, 13-year-old Richard (Dick) Barton (sometimes Barten,) was injured, with 5 other students treated for minor shock. One of the students who witnessed the accident recalled:Sanders Draper History > At 10.45 am an aircraft crashed on the playing field, the main parts being > ricocheted onto the drive, fragments breaking a total of 9 windows in three > classrooms.

Remembrance by students An annual memorial service is held at his grave by men who were pupils at the school at the time of his death. Services at St Andrew's church, where the American pilot was buried, were begun by a group of the students from that time, in the 1980s. The last service was on the 70th anniversary, due to the age of the participants. They recall that the school had 650 students at the time of the crash. School renamed in pilot's honour In 1973, the school was renamed The Sanders Draper School and Specialist Science College in his honour and then changed in 2014 to Sanders School. The school will return to its rightful name of Sanders Draper in September 2021 following a drive for this from new Headteacher Mr Brooks and the Success For All Educational Trust which had the full backing of the locak community. Personal life and family Sanders Draper was American, but born in London, England. He attended Avon Old Farms school in USA . They continue to pay homage to Sanders and the sacrifice he made as per the article here. Sadly he died age 29, on 24 March 1943 when he crashed his plane. His birth date is shown as 27 December 1913 on the Royal Aero Club Aviator's Certificate, which he received from the Airwork School of Flying on 16 June 1936 in Great Britain. He lived mainly in Manhattan, New York, in the USA. He was the younger son of American interior decorator, writer, and hostess Muriel Draper, the wife of a socially prominent lieder singer, Paul Draper. His parents married in 1909 in New York, then travelled in Europe; his father died in 1925 at age 38. His biological father was reputedly the pianist Artur Rubinstein. His father's sister was actress Ruth Draper while one uncle, George Draper, a prominent doctor, was married to American interior decorator Dorothy Draper. His older brother was Paul Draper, a noted dancer and actor. In 1940, Sanders, Paul and their mother Muriel lived in New York City, per the 1940 US Census, National Archives and Records Administration. In 1934, he married Marcia Anne Myers Tucker (later Mrs Charles Carroll Fulton Bagley). Later divorced, they had one daughter, Marcia Anne Draper.

Background From 1946, the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) had been experimenting with rocket planes such as the supersonic Bell X-1. In the early 1950s, there was challenge to launch an artificial satellite for the International Geophysical Year (1957–58). An effort for this was the American Project Vanguard. After the Soviet space program's launch of the world's first artificial satellite (Sputnik 1) on October 4, 1957, the attention of the United States turned toward its own fledgling space efforts. The U.S. Congress, alarmed by the perceived threat to national security and technological leadership (known as the \\"Sputnik crisis\\"), urged immediate and swift action; President Dwight D. Eisenhower and his advisers counseled more deliberate measures. This led to an agreement that a new federal agency mainly based on NACA was needed to conduct all non-military activity in space. The Advanced Research Projects Agency was also created at this time to develop space technology for military application. Transition of NACA to NASA From late 1957 to early 1958, the already existing National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) began studying what a new non-military space agency would entail, as well as what its role might be, and assigned several committees to review the concept. On January 12, 1958, NACA organized a \\"Special Committee on Space Technology\\", headed by Guyford Stever. Stever's committee included consultation from the Army Ballistic Missile Agency's large booster program, referred to as the Working Group on Vehicular Programs, headed by the World War II German scientist Wernher von Braun, brought to the US in Operation Paperclip. Explorer 1 installed in 1958 On January 14, 1958, NACA Director Hugh Dryden published \\"A National Research Program for Space Technology\\" stating: Launched on January 31, 1958, Explorer 1, officially Satellite 1958 Alpha, became the U.S.'s first Earth satellite. The Explorer 1 payload consisted of the Iowa Cosmic Ray Instrument without a tape data recorder which was not modified in time to make it onto the satellite. On March 5, President's Science Advisory Committee (PSAC) Chairman James Killian wrote a memorandum to President Dwight D. Eisenhower, entitled \\"Organization for Civil Space Programs\\", encouraging the creation of a civil space program based upon a \\"strengthened and redesignated\\" NACA which could expand its research program \\"with a minimum of delay.\\" In late March, a NACA report entitled \\"Suggestions for a Space Program\\" included recommendations for subsequently developing a hydrogen fluorine fueled rocket of thrust designed with second and third stages. In April 1958, Eisenhower delivered to the U.S. Congress an executive address favoring a national civilian space agency and submitted a bill to create a \\"National Aeronautical and Space Agency.\\" NACA's former role of research alone would change to include large-scale development, management, and operations. The U.S. Congress passed the bill, somewhat reworded, as the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958, on July 16. Only two days later von Braun's Working Group submitted a preliminary report severely criticizing the duplication of efforts and lack of coordination among various organizations assigned to the United States' space programs. Stever's Committee on Space Technology concurred with the criticisms of the von Braun Group (a final draft was published several months later, in October). On July 29, 1958, Eisenhower signed the National Aeronautics and Space Act, establishing NASA. When it began operations on October 1, 1958, NASA absorbed the 46-year-old NACA intact; its 8,000 employees, an annual budget of US$100 million, three major research laboratories (Langley Aeronautical Laboratory, Ames Aeronautical Laboratory, and Lewis Flight Propulsion Laboratory) and two small test facilities. Elements of the Army Ballistic Missile Agency, of which von Braun's team was a part, and the Naval Research Laboratory were incorporated into NASA. A significant contributor to NASA's entry into the Space Race with the Soviet Union was the technology from the German rocket program (led by von Braun) which in turn incorporated the technology of Robert Goddard's earlier works. Earlier research efforts within the U.S. Air Force and many of ARPA's early space programs were also transferred to NASA. In December 1958, NASA gained control of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a contractor facility operated by the California Institute of Technology.

The unit is also some times referred to as Pettus' Battalion or Trader's Battalion, Arkansas State Troops. The unit was eventually consolidated with other units in late 1864 to form the Newton's 10th Arkansas Cavalry Regiment.  Organization  1st Battalion, Arkansas State Troops was originally organized as a group of Volunteer Companies raised from the militia regiments of southern Arkansas, immediately following the fall of Little Rock, Arkansas, to Union forces in September 1863. Governor Harris Flanagin began organizing a new force of state troops issuing a proclamation on August 10, 1863, just a month before the capitol fell, announcing that he had been authorized to raise new regiments of state troops and that by special agreement these new units could not be transferred out of the state by Confederate authorities. After the fall of Little Rock, recruiting was far more difficult than it had been in the first years of the war. The constant transfer of Arkansas troops into the eastern theater of the war, across the Mississippi River from their homes, was a major objection by the remaining population of men eligible for military service. With Federal forces now occupying the state capitol, the Confederate state government had no way of enforcing conscription laws in the counties behind the Union lines, except during raids by Generals Price and Shelby in 1864. The remaining Confederate regiments were plagued by desertions. On September 16, 1863, in the immediate aftermath of the fall of the state capitol, Governor Flanagin issued General Order No. 6 from Arkadelphia, which called into service the militia regiments of the counties of Clark, Hempstead, Sevier, Pike, Polk, Montgomery, La Fayette, Ouachita, Union, and Columbia in order to resist the Federal army. The Governor's order directed the regiments to march to Arkadelphia at the earliest possible day. Companies were to be mounted and commanders were to compel persons evading the call to come to the rendezvous. The intent was to form companies of twelve-month mounted volunteers. Only six physicians, one druggist, millers to supply the wants of the country, clerks, sheriffs, postmasters, and persons in the employ of the Confederate States were exempted from the order. In describing this call in a letter to General Holmes dated October 18, 1863, from Washington, Arkansas, the new Confederate state capitol, Flanagin stated that he issued the order calling out the militia, as an experiment, expecting to get volunteers. The order succeeded so well as to get companies organized in the counties where the call for the militia was enforced which resulted in seven companies being collected under the call. Flanagin also stated that \\"the troops raised by the State are more than double all the troops raised by volunteering, or by the conscript law, within the past few months\\". On October 26, 1863 Governor Flanagin directed his Adjutant General Gordon N. Peay to: These new units of Arkansas State Troops were placed under the overall command of Col. William H. Trader who was detailed to Governor Flanagin by General E. Kirby Smith. Col. Trader remained in command of the state troops until he resigned in June 1864. On January 14, 1864, Governor Flanagin, through General Peay, issued General Orders, No. 8. which directed the following named companies of Arkansas mounted volunteers, which had been called into the service of the State under the proclamation of the August 10, A.D. 1863, compose and be designated as the 1st Battalion, Arkansas State Troops: *Company A – of Hempstead County, Captain E. K. Williamson, commanding. *Company B – of Clark County, Captain Reuben C. Reed, commanding. *Company C – of Sevier County, Captain Allen T. Pettus, commanding. *Company D – of Polk County, Captain G. A. Hale, commanding. *Company E – of Hot Spring County, Captain John W. Dyer, commanding. Allen T.

However, the chance to vote on being transferred was merely a matter of form because Peay's order also had directions for those who refused transfer to Confederate service: On September 5, 1864, the Arkansas State Troops, including Pettus' 1st Battalion were consolidated with other units into one regiment of cavalry to be designated as the 3rd Regiment of Arkansas Cavalry, with Col. Robert C. Newton assigned to the command of the regiment until an election could be held for field officers. The companies of this regiment included: *Company A — Capt. Reuben C.

The authorities have won convictions in only one of those cases, and that was for Daniel Pearl, a US reporter, in 2002. Impunity was the issue that journalists' groups focused on. A seven-day mourning period in the Dadu district was announced for all press clubs and journalist organisations, and a procession was held by Birhamani's colleagues to protest his murder and call for the punishment of his killers. Political parties like the Pakistan People's Party also participated. Afterward, two Lasharis were arrested for Birhamani's murder.

Built in 1892, the house was home to Martin Bushnell, a prominent civic leader, businessman, and politician, and it has been named a historic site. Bushnell One of the pairs of columns on the porch Born in 1837, Martin Bushnell was a member of one of Richland County's oldest families; his ancestors were pioneers who arrived in 1820. His father William served three terms in the Ohio House of Representatives,Baughman, A.J. History of Richland County Ohio from 1808 to 1908. Vol. 2. Chicago: S.J. Clarke, 1908. and Martin himself served one term in the Ohio Senate, beginning in 1897. Before entering into public office, Bushnell attended Denison University and worked for a succession of Mansfield companies, soon building himself into one of the city's leading businessmen. Erected in 1892, Bushnell's house became known as the home of the city's most prominent civic figures: Bushnell occupied the position of superintendent of city schools and served as a trustee for the Columbus State Hospital, and he further perpetuated his name by giving the city a Johnny Appleseed statue for placement in a public park.Owen, Lorrie K., ed. Dictionary of Ohio Historic Places. Vol. 2. St. Clair Shores: Somerset, 1999, 1188. Architecture Bushnell's house is a Richardsonian Romanesque structure built primarily of stone: besides the various stone types composing the foundation and walls, the house features a slate roof and elements of granite. A large porch is placed at the front of the house, with a semicircular bow window above the porch and a two-story octagonal tower to the side. The roofs are of various types: that of the tower rises to a steep point, while other sections are gabled. Vertical elements include numerous chimneys, placed at widely separated points on the roofline, as well as the paired columns that support the porch roof. Small oculi are built into several sides of the tower, above the second-story windows, while a semicircular window in the front gable overlooks the roof of the bow window., Ohio Historical Society, 2007. Accessed 2013-12-11. These elements combine to convey a sense of sheer mass, typical of houses built in the Richardsonian Romanesque style. Preservation In 1974, the Bushnell House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. One of more than ninety locations with this designation in Richland County, it qualified both because of its architecture and because of its place as the home of a prominent local resident.

The technique usually involves exsanguination of the target region, which forces blood out of the extremity, followed by the application of pneumatic tourniquets to safely stop blood flow. The anesthetic agent is intravenously introduced into the limb and allowed to diffuse into the surrounding tissue while tourniquets retain the agent within the desired area. History August Bier The use of tourniquets and injected anesthesia to induce localized anesthesia was first introduced by August Bier in 1908. He used an Esmarch bandage to exsanguinate the arm and injected procaine between two tourniquets to rapidly induce anesthetic and analgesic effects in the site. Though it proved effective, IVRA remained relatively unpopular until C. McK. Holmes reintroduced it in 1963. Today, the technique is common due to its economy, rapid recovery, reliability, and simplicity. Methods Protocols vary depending on local standard procedures and the extremity being operated on. A vast majority of practitioners begin by exsanguinating the limb as Bier did with an elastic bandage (Esmarch bandage), squeezing blood proximally toward the heart, then pneumatic tourniquets are applied to the limb and inflated 30mmHg above arterial pressure to occlude all blood vessels and then the elastic bandage is removed. A high dose of local anesthetic, typically lidocaine or prilocaine without adrenaline, is slowly injected as distally as possible into the exsanguinated limb. The veins are filled with the anesthetic, with the anesthetic setting into local tissue after approximately 6–8 minutes, after which the surgery, reduction, or manipulation of the region may begin. It is important that the region is isolated from active blood flow at this time. Analgesic effect typically remains for up to two hours depending on the dosage and type of anesthetic agent being used. The wait time and isolation of blood flow from the region is important for avoiding an overdose of the anesthetic agent in the blood which can lead to hypotension, convulsions, arrhythmia and death. Cardiotoxic local anesthetic agents like bupivacaine and etidocaine are strictly contraindicated. Safety The safety and effectiveness of IVRA is well established in clinical literature. However, cardiotoxic local anesthetic agents like bupivacaine and etidocaine are contraindicated. Shorter procedure times (for up to 2 hours) are preferred when IVRA is applied on the distal limb, especially on the forearm, except when the patient is contraindicated for tourniquet use (such as in sickle cell anemia, where there is a risk of massive hemolysis due to low oxygen tension or hemolytic crisis due to restricted blood flow). A systematic review of IVRA-related complications found 64 cases reported between 1964 and 2005, which compares favorably against other techniques. The type of anesthetic agent, improper equipment use or selection, and technical error are prominent factors in most cases of morbidity related to IVRA. Modern practice now includes various safeguards to improve patient safety. =Equipment= Reports from anesthesiologists and surgeons cite proper selection, inspection, and maintenance of equipment as important safety measures. The safest tourniquet equipment should have IVRA-specific features such as independent limb occlusion pressure measurements for each channel, as well as dual-bladder tourniquet cuffs combined with dedicated safety lockouts that reduce human error. Additionally, IVRA protocols should include procedures for regular preventative maintenance of the equipment and performance testing, whether manual or automated, prior to surgery. =Drug additives= Adjuvants improve the safety of IVRA by promoting anesthetic action and minimizing side effects. For example, benzodiazepine and fentanyl are often added to prevent seizures and to improve nerve blockage, respectively. =Procedural safeguards= Improved protocols, including adherence to standardized practice, may also help ameliorate the chance and the effect of complications. For example, limb protection padding and a snug tourniquet application prevents tissue damage, while sufficient but not excessive tourniquet pressure ensures that anesthetics remain within the limb without risking injury. Care should be taken to avoid the premature release or a lack of inflation in the cuff. Should complications occur, constant physiological monitoring and ready access to resuscitative drugs and equipment facilitates a speedy response.

The Flex last played in the Midwest Professional Basketball Association (MPBA) in 2015.  History  Formed in 2011 as the Central Illinois Drive, they were a member of the Premier Basketball League (PBL) for three seasons. =2012 season= The Flex played the 2012 PBL season as the expansion Central Illinois Drive. The Drive finished the 2012 regular season 18–1 and swept the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Steamers in the first round of the PBL playoffs. On April 14, 2012, the Drive completed a two-game sweep of the defending PBL champions, the Rochester RazorSharks, at U.S Cellular Coliseum to win the 2012 PBL Championship. Despite their success, Drive owner Jim Bob Morris decided he no longer wanted to own the team after just one season. Scott Henderson, the executive vice president of the Drive, wanted to take over the team, but he and Morris could not come to an agreement about the use of name and logo for the Drive. Henderson and his management team then decided to reboot the entire operation. On December 1, 2012, Henderson announced the new franchise as the Bloomington Flex. =2013 season= The Flex logo, uniform prototype and colors were announced at a news conference on January 18, 2013. Prior to the start of the 2013 season, the PBL merged with the Independent Basketball Association (IBA), to create the IBA-PBL. The Flex opened the 2013 season on March 15 against the Sauk Valley Predators, losing on the road 100–94. The Flex then dropped their home opener on March 29 to the Gary Splash, spoiling their championship banner-raising ceremony. But the team went on to win ten of its next twelve regular season games. As the season continued, the owners of the PBL's franchises became increasingly unhappy with either playoff structure suggested by Barry Bradford, the IBA-PBL commissioner who owns the IBA's Kankakee County Soldiers franchise and who had served as the IBA commissioner before the leagues merged. The PBL teams were also displeased about instances of IBA teams failing to appear for scheduled games against PBL teams over the final two weeks of the season. With less than two weeks left in the regular season, on May 24, 2013, the four top former PBL teams (Bloomington, Rochester, Indiana Diesels and Sauk Valley) broke away from the IBA to re-establish the PBL and hold a four-team playoff, identical to the PBL's 2012 format. In the 2013 playoffs, the Flex swept the Indiana Diesels in two games and then completed another two-game sweep of the Rochester RazorSharks, 106–86 and 88–77, winning the first game in Bloomington and clinching the PBL title at Blue Cross Arena in Rochester. In the two wins, the Flex defense held in check the RazorSharks high-scoring offense, which had averaged 118.5 points per game in the regular season. =2014 season= The Flex finished the 2014 season with a perfect 18–0 record, winning the PBL Midwest Division championship and earning the top seed and home-court advantage throughout the playoffs. When league officials realized the championship series was scheduled to take place over Easter weekend, Flex owner Henderson requested a schedule change and the league moved the playoff schedule up by one week. The change resulted in a facility conflict for the second place team in the East Division, the Carolina Pee Dee Vipers. Carolina had no available dates in its arena, the Florence Civic Center. The league proposed the entire series be played in Rochester, but Carolina refused. The league canceled the entire first round of the playoffs, including the Midwest series between the Indianapolis Diesels and Bloomington Flex, and announced the finals would start April 6 in Rochester. However, Bloomington was contractually locked into two dates at its arena, U.S. Cellular Coliseum, on April 4, which had originally been scheduled as a regular season game against the Lima Express, and April 6, which the team had booked when the playoff schedule was announced. Henderson balked at having to play what was amounting to an exhibition game Friday, travelling Saturday, and then playing Sunday afternoon in Rochester, even though the league offered to pay all expenses to fly Bloomington to Rochester on Saturday. While the two sides were still negotiating for a way for Bloomington to appear in Rochester the league abruptly announced on April 3 that Bloomington was disqualified from the playoffs and suspended for the entire 2015 season \\"due to its unwillingness and inability to participate in the championship series.\\" The league also announced that Bloomington would be replaced in the finals by second place Indianapolis despite refusing to consider having the third place Buffalo 716ers replace Carolina in the first round. On April 28, 2014, the PBL terminated its agreement with the Flex due to actions detrimental to the league allegedly caused by owner Scott Henderson and his contract with the U.S. Cellular Coliseum, despite the owner of the league having a similar contract in Rochester, which was honored. = 2015 = The Flex played in 2015 as a founding member of the new Midwest Professional Basketball Association (MPBA). On December 27, the team announced that Carlnel Wiley, Jr. would replace Guyton as the team's head coach. In October 2015, it was reported that the franchise would sit out the 2016 season due to the instability of the available leagues.

The first American naval ranks consisted of simply captain, lieutenant (navy), and midshipman. Shipboard warrant officer ranks, such as sailing master, boatswain, carpenter, gunner, and purser, were also copied from the British system. The earliest form of U.S. Navy enlisted ratings may be traced to the petty officers assigned as assistants to the shipboard warrant officers. The oldest such ratings, still in use today, are boatswain's mate, quartermaster, and gunner's mate. The rating of armourer was also in use as an assistant to the gunner, as was the rating of carpenter's mate for members of the ship's carpenter's crew. Informally, the shipboard title of yeoman was also frequently used, even though this would not be an official rating of the United States Navy until 1835.Naval Historical Society The remainder of a Continental Navy ship's crew were simply referred to as \\"seamen\\", who were \\"signed on\\" to the ship for the duration of a campaign and \\"paid off\\" once the ship had returned to port.Not until the 1850s did the U.S. Navy adopt the practice of a permanently assigned ship's company =21st Century Navy= On September 29, 2016, the United States Navy announced a plan to discontinue the enlisted ratings system.

While some sociologists argue that these advertisements are ways in which behavior and attitudes towards society are influenced, others merely argue that the image of family in advertising mirrors reality and therefore holds only a representative or symbolic role. Regardless, different members of the family are portrayed in different ways within advertising and such portrayals often reflect the traditional roles of each member during the time in history in which the advertisement is presented. History The family symbol in advertising may be observable before the industrial revolution, but it was not until after the industrial revolution that advertising boomed and the use of family images in advertising became prevalent. The industrial revolution changed advertising from informative flyers marking the availability of goods in 17th and 18th century Europe, whose audience were those within physical propinquity, to multimillion-dollar campaigns that attempted to instantly connect and persuade peoples from across the world. After the industrial revolution, large companies emerged as mass- producers, products became branded, and customers began establishing brand loyalties. Thus, persuading customers to purchase one brand rather than another became vital to advertising. An advertisement was responsible for making products and services salient in order to earn consumer attention in competitive industrial markets. During this period, not only did the immensity of the advertising industry drastically change, but so did its marketing strategies as it began to incorporate images and specify an audience. This change from largely informative to largely persuasive strategies and from general to specific audiences explains the increase in presence and usage of symbols, representations, and stereotypes in advertising—including those of the family. Different societies and cultures have used family symbols in advertising to varying extents of success. Because family life stresses in- group benefits, preferences, and successes over those of the individual, collectivist societies tend to use more family symbols in advertising than individualist societies. For example, Korea, which is reputably collectivistic, has more success with family advertisements than the United States, which is reputably individualistic. The modern post-industrial era in advertising was one of reaffirming widely held social values, such as heterosexuality and the middle-class, while neglecting alternative values or lifestyles. The advertising industry was conservative and did not deviate from images that were socially acceptable. Some countries, such as Japan, continue to present the family stereotypically, especially in their television advertisements. In the past decade, however, many advertising agencies have begun to more accurately capture reality and the diversity of lifestyles and family types of consumers. An advertisement for Cheney's Expectorant, 1906, asking the consumer \\"Why Let Your Children Suffer?\\" Function 'Family' is a popular symbol in commercial advertising that is commonly used to persuade audiences into consuming one's business' goods or services over a competitors. Consequently, the symbol of family as used in advertisements is functional – it both increases profit and builds a positive reputation among customers. The family symbol functions on three levels of persuasion: social, psychological, and personal. Social persuasion appeals to one’s role in a group and corresponding expectations; it appeals to reference groups, social class, culture, and subculture. The family symbol is socially persuasive in that it appeals to one’s role within the family and their corresponding expectations. One does not only feel a social or external pressure to fulfill roles and expectations of being a good parent, sibling, or child, however. There is a distinctly emotional and internal pressure to be ‘good’ due to psychological attachments in spousal, sibling and/or parent-children relationships. Psychological persuasion in advertisements appeals to one's motives, attitudes and personalities. The family symbol is psychologically persuasive in that it appeals to the emotional attachments between spouses, siblings, or parent- child relationships. To continue the above example, the mother not only wants to purchase a product that purportedly limits irritation or harm for her child due to her social role and expectations, but also because she feels an emotional attachment to her child. The attempt to activate the emotions of audiences and to psychologically persuade is popular among advertisements. Family affects us significantly on this psychological level – the level at which advertisements are most effective. Personal persuasion appeals to one’s demographic identity or consumer behaviors. The family symbol is personally persuasive because families make buying decisions together as a unit. Furthermore, one person in a family may make the majority of the buying decisions. To target that person in advertising, referencing their location within the family and their responsibility to make purchasing decisions for the family, will be more profitable than targeting others. For an example of personal persuasion, the McDonald's corporation in India has had great marketing success in designating themselves as the \\"McDonald's Family Restaurant\\". =Sociological interpretations= Advertisements are used to attract customers to a business’ products or services. In doing so, they are also making statements regarding race, social class, gender, values, and family. They not only describe these social categories, they prescribe behaviors or show one how it is that they should act in accordance with social ideals or norms. According to Belk and Pollay, “not only do [advertisements] show us the ideal life, they instruct us [on] how to live.” Through targeting specific groups of people for products and services, advertisements both reflect changes of social norms and are changers of social norms regarding acceptable behavior. Some argue that the image of family only plays a symbolic role by reflecting the current cultural values. Advertisements may not only reflect changes in social norms, but also be asserting that such behavior is acceptable. As a result, sociologists have challenged the public to study ads containing images of the family not just as marketing messages but also as vehicles for behavior and attitudes towards society. Advertisements, specifically ones that show the family, commentate on the transition from modernity to postmodernity. This transition is the transition of middle class nuclear families where heterosexuality is the norm to the recognition and acceptance of a variety of different family types, an embracing of societal polysexuality and plurality; it is furthermore the transition from mass culture to the prevalence of sub-cultures and multiculturalism. Literary critic Fredric Jameson says that \\"our advertising...is fed by postmodernism in all the arts, and is inconceivable without it.\\" Family members in advertising =Wives= In general, advertisements tend to reflect the popular attitudes surrounding the appropriate gender roles of the time. For example, in the 1920s, when such a tiny proportion of wives were working for economic gain outside of their homes, it was rare to see wives portrayed within advertising in a role in which they were working for monetary gain. Instead, women were primarily portrayed doing household tasks. The exceptions to this rule came about in times of economic hardship when wives were thrown into the labor force to ensure a families’ economic survival. One of these times was the Great Depression during the 1930s. Since then, as housekeeping becomes less and less important of a family role, the amount of advertisements portraying women solely as performing household tasks have been on the decline. =Husbands= Just as the image of the wife in advertising has reflected the general views of the appropriate roles of a wife, images of the husband also reflect the cultural values surrounding what role was believed a husband should be engaged in. For example, over time, it is common find images of the husband as performing work outside of the home and taking care of the family finances. It has been noted that this role has been especially prevalent during 1920, 1936, and 1970. On the other hand, one is not likely to find an advertisement depicting husbands engaged in household chores, except when they are depicted as particularly bad at performing the housework. In addition, it has been noted that over time, the portrayal of husbands and wives in an intimate, romantic relationship has been on the rise. =Mothers and fathers= A German advertisement for Hacavon, 1920 Throughout history, mothers have been portrayed as the primary physical caregivers of children. Physical caregiving includes tasks such as breast-feeding and changing diapers. Some theorize that this has to do with the idea of women as having a natural instinct towards motherhood. Fathers, on the other hand, have been more likely to be portrayed in play activities with their children and are often more likely to be shown interacting with sons than daughters. Similar to the decline over time in wives as being portrayed solely as housekeepers, the portrayal of mothers as the primary physical care takers of children has been on the decline. Instead, there has been an increase in the portrayal of mothers as facilitating recreational activities with their offspring. =Other family members= Much like fathers are depicted primarily in recreational activities with their children, other male members of the family, including sons and male grandchildren, are portrayed in play activities the majority of the time. Young female members of the family are depicted similarly in play activities, but nevertheless tend to be more likely shown in activities related to chores and child-care. In addition, the image of the grandparent has been largely nonexistent in advertising. It is important to also note that images of the family depend upon the specific source in which the image is found and the type of audience that the source aims to reach. For example, in a women’s magazine such as Good Housekeeping, one can expect to find women in the family portrayed solely as domestic housewives.

It can be further split into an internal and an external OAM. The internal OAM is an origin-independent angular momentum of a light beam that can be associated with a helical or twisted wavefront. The external OAM is the origin-dependent angular momentum that can be obtained as cross product of the light beam position (center of the beam) and its total linear momentum.  Introduction  Different columns show the beam helical structures, phase fronts, and corresponding intensity distributions. A beam of light carries a linear momentum \\\\mathbf{P}, and hence it can be also attributed an external angular momentum \\\\mathbf{L}_e=\\\\mathbf{r}\\\\times\\\\mathbf{P}. This external angular momentum depends on the choice of the origin of the coordinate system. If one chooses the origin at the beam axis and the beam is cylindrically symmetric (at least in its momentum distribution), the external angular momentum will vanish. The external angular momentum is a form of OAM, because it is unrelated to polarization and depends on the spatial distribution of the optical field (E). A more interesting example of OAM is the internal OAM appearing when a paraxial light beam is in a so-called \\"helical mode\\". Helical modes of the electromagnetic field are characterized by a wavefront that is shaped as a helix, with an optical vortex in the center, at the beam axis (see figure). The helical modes are characterized by an integer number m, positive or negative. If m=0, the mode is not helical and the wavefronts are multiple disconnected surfaces, for example, a sequence of parallel planes (from which the name \\"plane wave\\"). If m=\\\\pm 1, the handedness determined by the sign of m, the wavefront is shaped as a single helical surface, with a step length equal to the wavelength \\\\lambda. If m\\\\geqslant 2, the wavefront is composed of m distinct but intertwined helices, with the step length of each helix surface equal to m\\\\lambda, and a handedness given by the sign of m. The integer m is also the so-called \\"topological charge\\" of the optical vortex. Light beams that are in a helical mode carry nonzero OAM. In the figure to the right, the first column shows the beam wavefront shape. The second column is the optical phase distribution in a beam cross-section, shown in false colors. The third column is the light intensity distribution in a beam cross-section (with a dark vortex core at the center). As an example, any Laguerre-Gaussian mode with rotational mode number l e 0 has such a helical wavefront.  Mathematical expressions for the orbital angular momentum of light  The classical expression of the orbital angular momentum in the paraxial limit is the following: :\\\\mathbf{L}=\\\\epsilon_0\\\\sum_{i=x,y,z}\\\\int \\\\left(E^i\\\\left(\\\\mathbf{r}\\\\times\\\\mathbf{ abla}\\\\right)A^i\\\\right)d^{3}\\\\mathbf{r} , where \\\\mathbf{E} and \\\\mathbf{A} are the electric field and the vector potential, respectively, \\\\epsilon_0 is the vacuum permittivity and we are using SI units. The i-superscripted symbols denote the cartesian components of the corresponding vectors. For a monochromatic wave this expression can be transformed into the following one: :\\\\mathbf{L}=\\\\frac{\\\\epsilon_0}{2i\\\\omega}\\\\sum_{i=x,y,z}\\\\int \\\\left({E^i}^{\\\\ast}\\\\left(\\\\mathbf{r}\\\\times\\\\mathbf{ abla}\\\\right)E^{i}\\\\right)d^{3}\\\\mathbf{r} . This expression is generally nonvanishing when the wave is not cylindrically symmetric. In particular, in a quantum theory, individual photons may have the following values of the OAM: :\\\\mathbf{L}_z=m\\\\hbar . The corresponding wave functions (eigenfunctions of OAM operator) have the following general expression: :\\\\langle \\\\mathbf{r}m\\\\rangle\\\\propto e^{i m \\\\phi} . where \\\\phi is the cylindrical coordinate. As mentioned in the Introduction, this expression corresponds to waves having a helical wavefront (see figure above), with an optical vortex in the center, at the beam axis.  Production of OAM states Orbital angular momentum states with l = \\\\pm 1 occur naturally. OAM states of arbitrary l can be created artificially using a variety of tools, such as using spiral phase plates, spatial light modulators and q-plates. Spiral wave plates, made of plastic or glass, are plates where the thickness of the material increases in a spiral pattern in order to imprint a phase gradient on light passing through it. For a given wavelength, an OAM state of a given l requires that the step height —the height between the thinnest and thickest parts of the plate— be given by s = l\\\\lambda/(n-1) where n is an integer. Although the wave plates themselves are efficient, they are relatively expensive to produce, and are, in general, not adjustable to different wavelengths of light. Another way to modify the phase of the light is with a diffraction grating. For an l=0 state, the diffraction grating would consist of parallel lines. However, for an l=1 state, there will be a \\"fork\\" dislocation, and the number of lines above the dislocation will be one larger than below. An OAM state with l>1 can be created by increasing the difference in the number of lines above and below the dislocation. As with the spiral wave plates, these diffraction gratings are fixed for l, but are not restricted to a particular wavelength. A spatial light modulator operates in a similar way to diffraction gratings, but can be controlled by computer to dynamically generate a wide range of OAM states. = Recent advances = Theoretical work suggests that a series of optically distinct chromophores are capable of supporting an excitonic state whose symmetry is such that in the course of the exciton relaxing, a radiation mode of non-zero topological charge is created directly. Most recently, the geometric phase concept has been adopted for OAM generation. The geometric phase is modulated to coincide with the spatial phase dependence factor, i.e., e^{i m \\\\phi} of an OAM carrying wave. In this way, geometric phase is introduced by using anisotropic scatterers. For example, a metamaterial composed of distributed linear polarizers in a rotational symmetric manner generates an OAM of order 1. To generate higher-order OAM wave, nano-antennas which can produce the spin-orbit coupling effect are designed and then arranged to form a metasurface with different topological charges. Consequently, the transmitted wave carries an OAM, and its order is twice the value of the topological charge. Usually, the conversion efficiency is not high for the transmission-type metasurface. Alternative solution to achieve high transmittance is to use complementary (Babinet-inverted) metasurface. On the other hand, it is much easier to achieve high conversion efficiency, even 100% efficiency in the reflection- type metasurface such as the composite PEC-PMC metasurface. Potential use in telecommunications Research into OAM has suggested that light waves could carry hitherto unprecedented quantities of data through optical fibres. According to preliminary tests, data streams travelling along a beam of light split into 8 different circular polarities have demonstrated the capacity to transfer up to 2.5 terabits of data (equivalent to 66 DVDs or 320 gigabytes) per second. Further research into OAM multiplexing in the radio and mm wavelength frequencies has been shown in preliminary tests to be able to transmit 32 gigabits of data per second over the air. There is an ongoing discussion as to whether this will add any capacity on top of other schemes, such as MIMO.  Measuring the orbital angular momentum of light  Determining the spin angular momentum (SAM) of light is simple – SAM is related to the polarization state of the light: the AM is, per photon, in a left and right circularly polarized beam respectively. Thus the SAM can be measured by transforming the circular polarization of light into a p- or s-polarized state by means of a wave plate and then using a polarizing beam splitter that will transmit or reflect the state of light. The development of a simple and reliable method for the measurement of orbital angular momentum (OAM) of light, however, remains an important problem in the field of light manipulation. OAM (per photon) arises from the amplitude cross-section of the beam and is therefore independent of the spin angular momentum: whereas SAM has only two orthogonal states, the OAM is described by a state that can take any integer value N. As the state of OAM of light is unbounded, any integer value of l is orthogonal to (independent from) all the others. Where a beam splitter could separate the two states of SAM, no device can separate the N (if greater than 2) modes of OAM, and, clearly, the perfect detection of all N potential states is required to finally resolve the issue of measuring OAM. Nevertheless, some methods have been investigated for the measurement of OAM. = Counting spiral fringes = Beams carrying OAM have a helical phase structure. Interfering such a beam with a uniform plane wave reveals phase information about the input beam through analysis of the observed spiral fringes. In a Mach–Zender interferometer, a helically phased source beam is made to interfere with a plane-wave reference beam along a collinear path. Interference fringes will be observed in the plane of the beam waist and/or at the Rayleigh range. The path being collinear, these fringes are pure consequence of the relative phase structure of the source beam. Each fringe in the pattern corresponds to one step through: counting the fringes suffices to determine the value of l. = Diffractive holographic filters = Computer- generated holograms can be used to generate beams containing phase singularities, and these have now become a standard tool for the generation of beams carrying OAM. This generating method can be reversed: the hologram, coupled to a single-mode fiber of set entrance aperture, becomes a filter for OAM. This approach is widely used for the detection of OAM at the single- photon level. The phase of these optical elements results to be the superposition of several fork-holograms carrying topological charges selected in the set of values to be demultiplexed. The position of the channels in far- field can be controlled by multiplying each fork-hologram contribution to the corresponding spatial frequency carrier. = Other methods = Other methods to measure the OAM of light include the rotational Doppler effect, systems based on a Dove prism interferometer, the measure of the spin of trapped particles, the study of diffraction effects from apertures, and optical transformations. The latter use diffractive optical elements in order to unwrap the angular phase patterns of OAM modes into plane-wave phase patterns which can subsequently be resolved in the Fourier space. The resolution of such schemes can be improved by spiral transformations that extend the phase range of the output strip-shaped modes by the number of spirals in the input beamwidth.  Quantum-information applications OAM states can be generated in coherent superpositions and they can be entangled, which is an integral element of schemes for quantum information protocols. These states can be generated using parametric down-conversion, and correlations measured using spatial light modulators (SLM). Using qudits (with d levels, as opposed to a qubit's 2 levels) has been shown to improve the robustness of quantum key distribution schemes. OAM states provide a suitable physical realisation of such a system, and a proof-of-principle experiment (with 7 OAM modes from l = -3 to l = 3) has been demonstrated.  Radio astronomy  In 2019, a letter published in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society presented evidence that OAM radio signals had been received from the vicinity of the M87* black hole, over 50 million lightyears distant, suggesting that optical angular momentum information can propagate over astronomical distances.

The Club is based at Cross Green, Otley. The Club runs 3 Senior Sides and a full Junior Section ranging from Under 17 to Under 9. History One of the County's oldest Cricket Clubs, Otley CC was formed in 1820 although there are records that suggest that cricket was played in the town even before this date. Initially the club played on a ground now occupied by the cemetery and moved to its present Cross Green ground in 1862. For the first 73 years of the club's existence it played friendly matched but in 1893 the Club took a huge step forward by becoming founder members of the Airedale & Wharfedale Cricket League. The Club continued to play cricket in the League until after the First World War when in 1919 the Club joined the Yorkshire Council League. The Club played in this Competition until 1936 when they joined the re-formed AWSCL. Otley instantly made their presence felt by winning the first of its league titles the following year. In 1942, Otley won the AWSCL for the 2nd time, and also got their maiden win in the League's Cup competition with victory over Menston CC in the Waddilove Cup. During this period the Club had many successful players; H. Daphne, W. Bishop, J. Warburton, H. Bolton & R. Scarr to name a few. The latter two would go on to write their names into the League record books. In 1943 the Club retained the Waddilove Cup with H. Daphne taking match winning figures of 7-22. From 1950 to 1980 saw the Club win 5 more Waddilove Cups, starting the careers of some of the finest cricketer's the Club has seen such as Mike Bailey, Barrie Crighton, Ray Beadle, John Harker, Steve Davies and Chris Smith. Smith has been at the forefront of everything going on at the Club ever since, with a hugely successful playing career spanning four decades and his more recent off field efforts with fundraising events and serving as the Club's current Chairman. During the period of the 1980s and the early '90s, the likes of Beadle, Smith, Davies and Wadkin led the Club's most successful period with numerous league and Cup triumphs. Thanks to a crop of highly talented juniors coming through such as Hill, Hunt, Conway, Davey, Chaplin and the Wolfenden brothers who pushed onto the 1st XI saw the Club win both 1st & 2nd Team League titles, the Waddilove Cup and the Burmah Oil Trophy in 1988. The trophies have dried up over the last 20 years, with defeats in the 2006 and 2008 Waddilove Cup Finals against Bilton and Kirkstall Educational and defeats in the Birtwhistle Cup Final in 2008 and 2009 both against Kirkstall.

Edison was developing an iron ore milling process and discovered a market in the sale of waste sand to cement manufacturers. He decided to set up his own cement company, founding it in New Village, New Jersey in 1899, and went on to supply the concrete for the construction of Yankee Stadium in 1922. Beginnings In 1881 Edison formed the Edison Ore-Milling Company and tried for many years to make that business a success. The demand was not existant, though new technological innovations that Edison brought to the industry the company could not compete with operations in the Midwest.The Life of Thomas A. Edison. American Memory. Accessed September 24, 2011.Edison and Ore Refining. IEEE Global History Network. August 3, 2009. Accessed September 24, 2011. Despite continual investment, with Edison selling shares in General Electric, the company suffered huge losses. Eventually, the ore-crushing technology was sold to other mine owners. The manufacturing process used by the Edison Ore- Milling Company produced a large quantity of waste sand which he would sell to cement manufacturers. The properties of the fine sand were particularly suitable for concrete,Thomas Alva Edison And The Concrete Piano. American Heritage. August/September 1980. Volume 31, Issue 5. Accessed September 25, 2011. leading to a harder, more durable product. In 1899, Edison decided to join the cement business, reusing some of the technology he had developed for ore-milling.Cement, The Edison Papers. March 31, 2010. Accessed September 24, 2011. Early developments Edison made significant improvements to the production process of cement. His mill in the valley of the Delaware River in New Jersey featured the first long, rotating kilns in the world. While the standard length was between 60 and 80 feet, Edison's kilns were up to 150 feet.A History of Cement. Rumford.com. Accessed September 24, 2011. To improve his financial stability he licensed the kilns to other manufacturers, but this helped his competitors to improve their production. Eventually, the industry became saturated and Edison's business was not particularly profitable. Concrete housing One of Edison's concrete houses under construction in 1919 Somewhat ahead of his time Edison believed that concrete would have a wide range of applications, but in the early 20th century its production was not sufficiently economical. He envisioned a future with concrete houses filled with concrete furniture, refrigerators, and pianos.Concrete Housing. IEEE Global History Network. July 14, 2010. Accessed September 24, 2011. While none of these items were made Edison did create concrete phonograph cabinets. Edison investigated the use of formwork molds that could repeatedly be used to create concrete houses, experimenting in 1910 by casting a garage and a gardener's cottage at his mansion in New Jersey. He decided to donate the patented information to qualified builders rather than charge for it, generating significant publicity in the process. Philanthropist Henry Phipps, Jr. saw the potential of these affordable houses and considered them to be the solution to New York's housing shortage. He had already invested $1 million into affordable housing projects by setting up Phipps Houses, an organization that continues to this day.About Us , The Phipps Houses Group. Accessed September 25, 2011. Phipps declared his intention to build an entire city for working-class families using the concrete casting technique but Edison was never able to provide the plans. One of the main difficulties facing the project was its complexity. Each house would be constructed using a mold that comprised 2,300 pieces, and the cost to a builder purchasing the molds was excessive. Nonetheless, some houses were built when investor Charles Ingersoll financed Frank Lambie's plans. Lambie constructed several concrete houses in Union, New Jersey, where they are currently still in use. Yankee Stadium The entrance to Yankee Stadium not long after being built in the 1920s The Edison Portland Cement Company was barely surviving financially until a new contract was won in 1922. Production began on the original Yankee Stadium on May 5, 1922, and was completed in just 284 working days.Nack, William. This Old House. Sports Illustrated. June 7, 1999. Accessed September 24, 2011.Verducci, Tom. Yankee Stadium, it's gone! Goodbye!. Sports Illustrated. September 18, 2008. Accessed September 24, 2011. Built in The Bronx, New York City, New York, the stadium was home to the New York Yankees until 2008. During the course of the construction 45,000 barrels of cement, 30,000 cubic yards of gravel, and 15,000 cubic yards of sand were mixed by 500 men who produced 35,000 cubic yards of concrete. When the building underwent renovations from 1973 the walls were left untouched because Edison's concrete mix was seen to be hard and durable enough to remain intact. The stadium was closed for several years of renovations from 1973, reopening in 1976. From then it remained in use until 2008; the new Yankee Stadium opened the following April. It was demolished in 2010. Bankruptcy The company only lasted a few years after the construction of the Yankee Stadium, falling victim to the Great Depression.
