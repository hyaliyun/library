An 11th-century poem Gein Branduib maic Echach ocus Aed√°in maic Gabr√°in (The Birth of Brandub son of Eochu and of Aed√°n son of Gabr√°n) mentions that Echu was expelled from Leinster by his brother F√°el√°n and went to the court of Gabr√°n mac Domangairt, king of D√°l Riata in Scotland. The king list in the Book of Leinster mentions a F√°el√°n mac S√≠l√°in as king prior to Echu from a rival line descended from Crimthann mac √ânnai (died 483). Echu later returned to take the throne though it is not mentioned in what manner he did so. The poem goes on to relate that Echu's wife, named Feidelm agreed to exchange one of her twin sons at birth for one of the twin daughters of Gabran so that Gabran could have a son. These boys were Brandub mac Echach (died 603) and √Åed√°n mac Gabr√°in. The date of the poem coincides with a period of Scottish and Leinster cooperation and could be political propaganda. A foster- brother relationship may be implied. Echu's son Brandub would go on to become King of Leinster and halt the expansion of the southern Ui Neill.

Her husband was politician Kazuo Hatoyama. Early life Haruko Hatoyama was born in Matsumoto, the youngest of seven children (five girls and two boys). Her father, Tsumu, was a samurai. He changed the family name from Watanabe to Taga after the Meiji Restoration in 1868. Her education began at home with her mother, and was supplemented by the lessons from local teachers of Chinese classics. Her education was different from her sisters because she was allowed to pursue the same curriculum as a boy. She was among the first students to enroll when a small, all-girls school opened in Matsumoto in 1873. However, her knowledge was so advanced that her father decided to pull her out of the small school and take her to Tokyo to be educated. She attended the Takebashi Girls' School, which had been opened by the government in 1872 for the purpose of training female teachers. Her lessons were held both in her native Japanese dialect and in American English. After the government closed the school in 1877, the Education Ministry transferred her and her classmates to a newly established English section within the Tokyo Women's Normal School. She graduated in 1878. She continued her education by enrolling the Tokyo Women's Higher Normal School. In 1879, she was one of three students selected by the Ministry of Education to study in the United States. She graduated in July 1881, and briefly joined the faculty until she got married, at which point she resigned.  Family  Haruko married Kazuo Hatoyama in an arranged marriage on November 16, 1881. Her behavior was different from that of a typical bride of that period because she held a job outside the home and engaged in translating legal documents. Kazuo Hatoyama was speaker of the House of Representatives of the Diet of Japan from 1896 to 1897 during the Meiji era.\\"Japan on the brink of a new era\\", Asia Times, August 29, 2009. Kazuo later served as the president of Waseda University. Haruko died at home on July 12, 1938 of arteriosclerosis. Bronze bust of Kazuo paired with bronze seated figure of Haruko Hatoyama in the garden of Hatoyama Hall in Tokyo. =Politician progeny= Her son was former Prime Minister Ichir≈ç Hatoyama, who founded and was the first president of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). Her grandson was former Foreign Minister Iichir≈ç Hatoyama. Her great-grandson Kunio Hatoyama served as Minister of Internal Affairs and Communications under Prime Minister Taro Aso until June 12, 2009. Her great-grandson Yukio Hatoyama represents the 9th district of Hokkaid≈ç in the House of Representatives and is a former leader of the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ). Yukio was Prime Minister of Japan between September 16, 2009 and June 8, 2010. Modern Femininity and Education Haruko was one of the leaders of the strong Westernizing trend, Bunmei Kaika. She wrote several essays for women's magazines on the importance of raising the level of women's education in Japan. After helping found the Kyoritsu Women's University, she became head of the newly created home economics department. In December 1922, she became president of the school, and held this position until her death. She was a member of the Japanese Women's Hygiene Association, Women's Patriotic Association, and the Japanese League of Women Association, among others. She received awards from the Imperial Household Ministry, the Tokyo prefecture, Tokyo City, the Tokyo League of Women's associations, and the Koishikawa Young Women's Association.

Appearing in the film's underscore as well as in source music as an instrumental theme song without lyrics, it was turned over to Ned Washington, who wrote the lyrics for it in 1946. The title had to be incorporated into the lyrics, which resulted in its unusual placement: the phrase appears about three quarters of the way through the song, rather than at the beginning or the end. At one point in the film, the main character, Rick (Ray Milland) tells Stella (Gail Russell) that he is playing a serenade, \\"To Stella by Starlight\\".  Recording history  \\"Stella by Starlight\\" is one of the most popular standards, ranked number 10 by the website jazzstandards.com. Its May 1947 recording by Harry James and his orchestra reached the 21st place in the pop charts. Two months later, the recording by Frank Sinatra with Axel Stordahl and his orchestra also rose to the 21st position. Alto saxophonist Charlie Parker accompanied by a large studio orchestra including strings made the first jazz recording of the song in January 1952. This was followed by a recording by tenor saxophonist Stan Getz in December 1952, trumpeter Chet Baker in 1954. a piano version by Bud Powell, and a rendition by the big band of Stan Kenton, featuring bass trombonist George Roberts. Nat King Cole recorded an instrumental version for his 1955 album The Piano Style of Nat King Cole. A recording by Miles Davis was included on his 1958 album Jazz Track. Davis revived the song in 1963 performing it live many times through 1965. Other jazz recordings have been made by Red Garland, Earl Grant, Joe Pass, Bill Evans, Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers, Lou Donaldson Charlie Rouse and Dexter Gordon with vocal versions sung by Billy Eckstine, Dick Haymes, Ray Charles, Anita O'Day, Helen Reddy, Tony Bennett, Ella Fitzgerald, italian singer Mina in 1964 and many others.

In 1993, guitarist Larry Coryell included the song on his album Fallen Angel. The Italian-born American tenor/actor Sergio Franchi had strong connections with this romantic ballad. His first venue was the song's performance on Meredith Willson's CBS variety show (Texaco Star Parade) broadcast on June 5, 1964.\\"CBS Wire Photo\\" released June 15, 1964 Franchi then recorded the song on his 1965 RCA Victor album Live at The Coconut Grove.

Thereby, artists such as Hozier have hinted at this song.

It is the only species of its genus, Erpeton, and the two tentacles on its snout are a unique feature among snakes. Description left The tentacled snake is a relatively small snake, averaging about in length.http://www.siam- info.de/english/snakes_homalopsinae.html#Erpeton%20tentaculumhttp://www.torontozoo.com/Animals/details.asp?AnimalId=580 They are known to come in two color phases, striped or blotched, with both phases ranging from dark gray or brown to a light tan. It lives its entire life in murky water. The tentacled snake is the only species of snake to possess twin \\"tentacles\\" on the front of its head, which have been shown to have mechanosensory function. Its diet consists solely of fish. Although it does have venomous fangs, the tentacled snake is not considered dangerous to humans. The fangs are small, only partially grooved, and positioned deep in the rear of the mouth. The venom is specific to the fish that the tentacled snake eats. Distribution A native of South-East Asia, the tentacled snake can be found in Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam. The snake lives its entire life in the murky water of lakes, rice paddies, and slow moving streams, and can be found in fresh, brackish, and sea water. A prime example of its habitat is the Tonl√© Sap lake in central Cambodia. The water there contains much silt and has a large fish population. Tonl√© Sap lake, Cambodia Reproduction The young develop ovoviviparously and are born live underwater. Behavior Tentacled snakes spend their whole life in the water and can stay underwater for up to 30 minutes without coming up for air. They can only move awkwardly on land. In dry times and at night, the snake may burrow itself in the mud. Hunting is accomplished via a unique ambush method. Tentacled snakes spend much of their time in a rigid posture. The tail is used to anchor the animal underwater while its body assumes a distinctive upside-down \\"J\\" shape. The striking range is a narrow area downwards from its head, somewhat towards its body. Once a fish swims within that area the snake will strike by pulling itself down in one quick motion towards the prey. Through the use of high- speed cameras and hydrophones, the snake's method of ambush is revealed in greater detail. The snake anticipates the movements of the fish as it attempts to escape. As the fish swims into range, the snake creates a disturbance in the water by moving part of its body posterior to the neck. This disturbance triggers an escape reflex in the fish called the C-start, in which the fish contorts its body into a \\"C\\" shape. Normally at this point the fish would swim quickly away from the disturbance by quickly straightening its body, but the snake grabs it, usually by the head, anticipating its movement. The snake catches fish by tricking them into reflexively attempting to escape in the wrong direction. Unlike most predators, the snake doesn't aim for the fish's initial position and then adjust its direction as the fish moves, it heads directly for the location where it expects the fish's head to be.Discovery of a Water Snake That Predicts the Direction Its Prey Will Flee Newswise, Retrieved on June 24, 2009.http://news.vanderbilt.edu/2009/06/video-tentacled- snake-in-action-82827/ Video of a Tentacled Snake in Action, Retrieved on December 16, 2010. The ability to predict the position of its prey appears to be innate. The tentacled snake retracts its eyes when it begins to strike.

History  The Grand Mosque of Constan»õa stands on the site of the former Mahmudia Mosque (Geamia Mahmudia), built in 1822 by Hafƒ±z H√ºsseyin Pa»ôa and named after Ottoman Sultan Mahmud II. The Grand Mosque of Constan»õa was commissioned in 1910 by Romanian King Carol I. Construction began on 24 June 1910 with the first cornerstone laid in the presence of Spiru Haret, contemporary Romanian Minister of Religious Affairs; Sefa Bey, contemporary Ottoman ambassador in Bucharest; and the Ottoman consul in Constan»õa. The project was funded by the Romanian Government and entrepreneur Ion Neculcea, and finished construction in 1912. The mosque was officially inaugurated by Carol I on 31 May 1913. During the ceremony, Sultan Mehmed V bestowed the Order of the Medjidie upon chief architect Victor »òtefƒÉnescu. King Carol I also rewarded »òtefƒÉnescu with a watch.  Architecture  The mosque was built in Neo-Egyptian and Neo- Byzantine styles with elements of Neo-Romanesque architecture. Its designer, George Constantinescu, modeled the mosque after the Konya Mosque in Anatolia (Turkey). Victor »òtefƒÉnescu served as the chief architect for the project. Contractors used brick and stone materials for the mosque proper, and reinforced concrete for the dome and minaret. The mosque was the first structure in Romania to be built using reinforced concrete. The main portal was constructed using stone from Dobrogea, while the door beneath was constructed from black marble inlaid with bronze. The interior columns were constructed from marble from C√¢mpulung. The minaret was built in Neo-Moorish style and has a height of 47 metres. The dome has a height of 25 metres and a diameter of 8 metres.

In New Zealand they played a major role in forestry, industry, law and philanthropy. They had originally worked as foresters and timbermillers in their homeland and buttressed by their staunch Presbyterian faith and a regimented ethic for hardwork, they established what was to become one of New Zealand's largest industrial enterprises. The Encyclopedia of New Zealand recognises the Henry family as being one of the three great Scottish industrialist families that settled in New Zealand in the 19th Century. The others were the Fletchers (founders of Fletcher Construction, see James Fletcher (industrialist) ) and the Todds (founders of Todd Motor Company and Todd Petroleum, see Todd Corporation Ltd). New Zealand Forest Products New Zealand Forest Products (NZFP) was New Zealand's largest industrial company from its creation (following the consolidation of the New Zealand timbermilling sector) in 1936 until the privatisation of state-owned Telecom New Zealand in 1990. The Henrys on arriving in New Zealand founded a timbermilling operation near Riverton in Southland . By the 1930s they had expanded with several other operations around the country and were responsible for processing felled logs into timber for export. In 1936 there was substantial consolidation in the New Zealand timber industry when the Henry's milling assets were combined with those of New Zealand Perpetual Forests, a bond-selling forestry company that had gone bankrupt with 150,000 hectares of plantations. Sir David Henry KBE was responsible for negotiations and this saw the creation of New Zealand Forest Products (NZFP). Another member of the family, Jack Henry, was the Director of the Kinleith Division and the Forests Division. He pioneered new methods in silviculture which saw the company achieve major efficiency gains that turned NZFP into one of the largest forestry companies globally. He was the last Henry to sit on the board of NZFP retiring in 1986 as corporate raiders circled. In 1986, the conglomerate Elders IXL, headed by Australian corporate raider John Elliot, made a successful hostile takeover bid for NZFP. This effectively ended the Henry family's 110 years of involvement in New Zealand industry. Law Following the family's success in becoming one of New Zealand's leading industrialists, several members of the Henry extended family became involved in law, playing a pivotal role over several generations. The Hon. Sir Trevor Henry graduated from law school at the University of Auckland in 1922 and went on to found the Auckland law firm Wilson Henry which continues as Hesketh Henry. He was appointed to the bench of the Supreme Court of New Zealand in 1955 and was knighted in 1971 for his services to Her Majesty's legal system. His son, the Rt Hon Sir John Henry KNZM QC followed his father into the law and was senior partner of Wilson Henry for many years before he was appointed Queen's Counsel. He continued in private practice as a barrister until 1984 when he was appointed to the bench of the High Court of New Zealand. He was later appointed a Privy Counsellor (see Privy Council of the United Kingdom), and was knighted as a Distinguished Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit in 2001. Another brother, Clive Henry, also graduated in law from the University of Auckland and went on to found the Hamilton legal firm of Harkness Henry which continues. He was a key figure in the Waikato legal community and provided the future Dame Silvia Cartwright PCNZM (former Governor General of New Zealand) with her first job. Brian Henry graduated from the University of Canterbury in 1973 and became a senior partner at Wilson Henry in Auckland (now Hesketh Henry) before establishing his own practice as a barrister. He has maintained a high public profile, undertaking major litigation including the Royal Commission of Inquiry into Taxation (commonly referred to as the \\"Winebox Inquiry\\"), being successful in the subsequent Judicial Review of the Winebox Inquiry, representing directors in litigation following the collapse of the Equiticorp conglomerate in 1987, and pro bono work such as representing victims of the RSA murders in their litigation against the New Zealand Parole Board and Polynesian immigrant families who were the victims of unscrupulous buyback financial schemes. Philanthropy, Relations with Maoridom and Community Involvement In keeping with their role as one of New Zealand's largest industrialist families, the Henry's became philanthropists. Their focus on charity and giving reflected their Presbyterian faith. This continues in different guises. The most well known member of the family is Sir David Henry KBE. He used his business success in Auckland, which had become the commercial heart of New Zealand by the 1930s, to become involved with a range of organisations. This included the Rotary Club of Auckland, becoming its President, the Boy Scouts‚Äô Association, and the Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA). He was a member of the Auckland Manufacturers‚Äô Association which led to his election as President of the National Manufacturers' Association. He also stood for public office and was elected a Councillor of the Auckland City Council from 1931‚Äì33. He believed passionately in education, endowing in 1956 a forestry scholarship bearing his name to provide overseas training for employees of NZFP. On his death he left a substantial Trust to the Auckland Presbyterian Orphanages and Social Service Association. The funding provided by this Trust with later contributions from the Henry family and other sources continues as Presbyterian Support, one of New Zealand's largest charitable organisations. At a time when indigenous relations in New Zealand were poor, the Henry Family were outspoken in their views of indigenous rights and pioneered relations with several tribes in Maoridom. Sister Annie Henry MBE JP was the embodiment of the family's views in this regard. Originally a teacher, she graduated from Deaconess College in 1920 and devoted her life to the education and betterment of the Maori people as a missionary in the Urewera Ranges of New Zealand. She was a pioneer of indigenous issues, protected Maori from exploitation by other New Zealand settlers and had a strong belief in the benefits of education and health for Maori at a time when this was neglected by the Colonial Government. Several Maori became prominent ministers in the Presbyterian Church of New Zealand as a result of her work [from Dictionary of NZ] and the family dedicated a wing of the Whakatane Museum in her memory. The Hon. Sir Trevor Henry was a justice in the Supreme Court of New Zealand and was also involved following his retirement in a number of public service roles including being Chairman of the War Pensions Review Board, a member of the New Zealand Parole Board and a member of the New Zealand Olympic Games Selection Committee of 1936. The modern family The Henry family have often been described as reserved and they continue to shun publicity. Following the hostile takeover of NZFP, the family have largely retreated from the public business community and have maintained an even lower public profile. Much of their activities are now believed to be based in Australia, headquartered in Brisbane, but they still retain business interests in New Zealand and remain large land owners. The most public face of the family today is Brian Henry, but this public profile is limited to the large pro bono legal cases that his corporate legal practice handles. He was involved as legal counsel for Winston Peters in the Royal Commission of Inquiry into Taxation that was established in 1990 to hear allegations of widespread tax fraud in New Zealand during the 1980s, the so- called \\"Winebox Inquiry.\\" Other prominent New Zealanders to be involved in this case include the merchant bankers Sir Michael Fay and David Richwhite (of the NZ investment bank Fay Richwhite). Other large pro bono legal cases undertaken include representing Susan Couch in suing the New Zealand Parole Board following the RSA murders, and representing Polynesian immigrants who lost their homes in controversial buyback financial schemes. The family has also now established a capital management business, Goldman Henry Capital , which raises funds from the New Zealand investing public under prospectus to invest in various international investment vehicles. Very little is known about the next generation of the family apart from biographical references and rare media mentions. In 1993 for instance, it was reported in newspapers and in Ian Wishart's book, the Paradise Conspiracy, that David Henry Jr., Brian Henry's son, was the subject of a failed kidnap attempt from the King's School).

It is often called the oldest continuously operating gay bar in New York City. Its management, however, was actively unwilling to operate as such, and harassed gay customers until 1966. The April 1966 \\"Sip-In\\" at Julius, located a block northeast of the Stonewall Inn, established the right of gay people to be served in licensed premises in New York. This action helped clear the way for gay premises with state liquor licenses. Newspaper articles on the wall indicate it was the favorite bar of Tennessee Williams, Truman Capote and Rudolf Nureyev. In 2016, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.  History  According to bar lore it was established around 1867 ‚Äì the same year as the Jacob Ruppert Brewery in the Yorkville neighborhood. Per the current owner, the establishment opened in 1864. Barrels stamped \\"Jacob Ruppert\\" are used for tables. Vintage photos of racing horses, boxers and actors are on the wall include drawings of burlesque girls as well as an image signed by Walter Winchell saying that he loves Julius. The bar became a popular watering hole in the 1930s and 1940s due to its proximity to the jazz club Nick's in the Village. By the late 1950s, it was attracting gay patrons. At the time the New York State Liquor Authority had a rule that ordered bars not to serve liquor to the disorderly, and homosexuals per se were considered \\"disorderly.\\" Bartenders would often evict known homosexuals or order them not to face other customers in order to avoid cruising. Despite this, gay men continued to be a large part of the clientele into the early 1960s, and the management of Julius, steadfastly unwilling for it to become a gay bar, continued to harass them. = The Sip-In = On April 21, 1966 members of the New York Chapter of the Mattachine Society staged a \\"Sip-In\\" at the bar which was to change the legal landscape. Dick Leitsch and Craig Rodwell, the society's president and vice president respectively, and another society activist, John Timmons, planned to draw attention to the practice by identifying themselves as homosexuals before ordering a drink in order to bring court scrutiny to the regulation. The three were going to read from Mattachine stationery \\"We are homosexuals. We are orderly, we intend to remain orderly, and we are asking for service.\\" The three first targeted the Ukrainian-American Village Restaurant at St. Mark's Place and Third Avenue in the East Village, Manhattan which had a sign, \\"If you are gay, please go away.\\" The three showed up after a New York Times reporter had asked a manager about the protest and the manager had closed the restaurant for the day. Secondly, they targeted a bar called Dom's, which was also closed.. They then targeted a Howard Johnson's and a bar called Waikiki where they were served in spite of the note with a bartender saying later, \\"How do I know they're homosexual? They ain't doing nothing homosexual.\\" Raid sign (from Stonewall) exactly as it would have appeared at Julius' in 1966Frustrated, they then went to Julius, where a clergyman had been arrested a few days earlier for soliciting sex. A sign in the window read, \\"This is a raided premises.\\" The bartender initially started preparing them a drink but then put his hand over the glass, which was photographed. The New York Times ran the headline \\"3 Deviates Invite Exclusion by Bars\\" the next day. The Mattachine Society then challenged the liquor rule in court and the courts ruled that gays had a right to peacefully assemble, which undercut the previous SLA contention that the presence of gay clientele automatically was grounds for charges of operating a \\"disorderly\\" premise. With this right established a new era of licensed, legally operating gay bars began. The bar now holds a monthly party called Mattachine. = Subsequent history = Michael Kors, left, in January 2015, at Julius's, with a fan. Scenes from the movie Boys in the Band (1970) were shot at the bar. Julius was the site of a scene shot in the movie Next Stop, Greenwich Village (1976). The scene included Lenny Baker and Christopher Walken. In August 2007, the bar was closed briefly after being seized for non- payment of taxes.EaterWire AM Edition: Julius Closed, Seized For Nonpayment of Taxes ‚Äì eater.com ‚Äì August 29, 2007 Julius was the site of a scene in Ira Sachs' gay indie movie Love is Strange (2014). The scene included John Lithgow and Alfred Molina. The wrap party also took place at the bar. Julius was also featured prominently in the 2018 film Can You Ever Forgive Me?, starring Melissa McCarthy and Richard E. Grant. In 2012, in response to research and a request from the Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation, the New York State Division for Historic Preservation determined Julius eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places. The letter of eligibility stated, \\"The building meets the criteria for listing in the area of social history for its association with the LGBT civil rights movement.\\" It mentioned that the building's interior \\"remains remarkably intact from the 1966 era of significance.\\" It was listed in 2016.  In fiction  The Julius's denial of service was dramatized in the film Stonewall (1995). However, filmmakers moved the denial of service from Julius to the Stonewall Inn.

It is also adopted by many related file systems, including the ext3 file system, popular with Linux users. Structure In the past, the structure may have consisted of eleven or thirteen pointers, but most modern file systems use fifteen pointers. These pointers consist of (assuming 15 pointers in the inode): * Twelve pointers that directly point to blocks of the file's data (direct pointers) * One singly indirect pointer (a pointer that points to a block of pointers that then point to blocks of the file's data) * One doubly indirect pointer (a pointer that points to a block of pointers that point to other blocks of pointers that then point to blocks of the file's data) * One triply indirect pointer (a pointer that points to a block of pointers that point to other blocks of pointers that point to other blocks of pointers that then point to blocks of the file's data) Key features =Fixed logical block size= The structure is partially illustrated in the diagram accompanying this article. The structure allows for inodes to describe very large files in file systems with a fixed logical block size. Central to the mechanism is that blocks of addresses (also called indirect blocks) are only allocated as needed. For example, a 12-block file would be described using just the inode because its blocks fit into the number of direct pointers available. However, a 13-block file needs an indirect block to contain the thirteenth address. =Ease of data location= The inode pointer structure not only allows for files to easily be allocated to non-contiguous blocks, it also allows the data at a particular location inside a file to be easily located. This is possible because the logical block size is fixed. For example, if each block is 8 kB, file data at 112 kB to 120 kB would be pointed to by the third pointer of the first indirect block (assuming twelve direct pointers in the inode pointer structure). =Indirect blocks= Unlike the inodes, which are fixed in number and allocated in a special part of the file system, the indirect blocks may be of any number and are allocated in the same part of the file system as data blocks. The number of pointers in the indirect blocks is dependent on the block size and size of block pointers. Example: with a 512-byte block size, and 4-byte block pointers, each indirect block can consist of 128 (512 / 4) pointers.

But, unfortunately, his parents forgot to enroll him in the dorm, and the apartment he was planning on staying in burnt down as he arrived. While complaining about his current situation, he is mistaken for a panty thief and attacked by a girl, Asumi Hirota, who happens to be his former childhood acquaintance. After realizing who he is, Asumi assumes that he is there to threaten her, and becomes uneasy. Asumi, believing Yusuke has something on her, decides to do something for him under one condition: he must not tell anyone her secret. However, Yusuke does not know what the secret is, but decides to pretend he does. After Asumi explains her condition, Yusuke asks if Asumi can give him a place to stay, Asumi agrees and takes him to the girl's dorm, but, because the dorm doesn't let males in the dorm, she must sneak him in. After meeting the roommates, he is accepted (with some debates) into their room.  Characters  * The main character, whom the player takes the role of.

It premiered at 20:00 BST on 28 June 2008 and was hosted by Ben Shephard and Denise Van Outen. Only seven episodes have been shown in one series. Tickets were offered for a Christmas special, but this has not aired and will probably never do so. Format The studio audience of 100 people all attempt to sing to win a potential jackpot of ¬£50,000. In the first round, all 100 people sing along to a song, but five performances of the song are selected at random and judged by a super computer called SAM (short for Sound Analysis Machine). The two that score the highest go through to a \\"pitch battle\\", for a place in the semi- final round. These two will then pick a song each from a \\"karaoke songbook\\", and will then perform it. The main idea of the game it to hit and hold the \\"hot notes\\", as close to the original song as possible. The one who scores the highest out of 100 goes through to the semi-final round. This is repeated for both the second pitch battle and the semi-final round. The winner of the semi- final round, then goes forward to the final. They are given a choice of five songs and can sing at maximum three of them. For the first song, they'll score 40 or more to win ¬£5,000, the second song is worth ¬£25,000 if they score 60 or higher, and the third song is worth the ¬£50,000 jackpot, if they score 80 or more. After the second and third songs, the finalist is given the choice to take the money they've got at that stage or gamble. If they gamble and fail to reach the score target, they'll leave with nothing. The design of the studio set was very similar to the set of Catchphrase during years when Roy Walker was the presenter. Show winners As of the end of episode 4, there have been no ¬£50,000 winners. Cancellation The second series of Who Dares, Sings! did not broadcast in 2009 or subsequent years.

It was managed by the North Essex Partnership University NHS Foundation Trust. History =Early history= The hospital was designed by Frank Whitmore and William Town using an echelon formation layout. The foundation stone was laid by Sir Thomas Barrett-Lennard in June 1910 and it opened as the Second Essex County Asylum in May 1913. Villas were constructed around the main hospital building as accommodation blocks and there was a detached building for the medical superintendent. The nurses' home was extended and the whole facility was renamed the Essex and Colchester Mental Hospital in the 1930s. In August 1942 the hospital was subjected to a bombing by the Luftwaffe. Three 500lb bombs were dropped on the west wing of the hospital and 38 patients were killed, many of which were buried in nearby Colchester Crematorium. Immediately after the bombing a 21-year-old nurse of the hospital, Murial Jackson, attempted to save patients and was able to direct doctors to the injured using just a torch. =Psychiatric experiments= In the 1950s psychiatrists experimented with new treatments on patients using practices now considered unsuitable such as the use of frontal lobotomy. A project was subsequently initiated by the North East Essex Mental Health Trust to research this. Joan Busfield, Professor of Sociology at the University of Essex, proposed a former research student of hers, Diana Gittins. Funding was secured by the Trust and the study commenced in May 1995 for a two-year period. In her book Madness in Its Place: Narratives of Severalls Hospital, 1913‚Äì1997, Gittins, summarised her research, noting that often women were admitted by their own family, sometimes as the result of bearing illegitimate children or because they had been raped. As they would not always (or were unable to) carry out daily tasks, they were considered to be insane and some were even subjected to electroconvulsive therapy and lobotomy. =Closure and redevelopment= The hospital joined the National Health Service in 1948. After the introduction of Care in the Community in the early 1980s the hospital went into a period of decline and eventually closed in March 1997. The North Essex Partnership University NHS Foundation Trust announced the sale of the site to a consortium of Bellway, Taylor Wimpey and Bloor Homes in February 2016. The consortium submitted plans to redevelop the site for residential use in July 2018.

The plan was to ship soldiers out of the U.S. state of California, instead of New York. Although there were exceptions since the 11th Airborne Division was transferred from Fort Campbell, Kentucky to Augsburg and Munich Germany in 1955 out of New York to Bremerhaven by troop ships as part of Operation Gyroscope.  Reasons  = German reconstruction = The rebuilding process of Germany post‚ÄìWorld War II was extreme, and much reconstruction support was needed. Because of this, the need to ship soldiers and supplies from the United States into occupied Germany was great. Troops were trained in bases in many states, even in states as far as California. After being trained, the troops were flown or sent on trains to New York. Before Gyroscope, most, if not all, troops left on ships for Germany from New York. Operation Gyroscope proved worthy as an option for shipping troops out of California and involved steering the ships out and around North America, through the Panama Canal, and then across the Atlantic Ocean.Operation Gyroscope in the United States Army, Europe = Cold War = Though the Gyroscope trip was often longer than the average trip via train or plane to New York, it proved more cost effective. Another reason for Gyroscope that was kept from the public and the soldiers, was the growing tension with the Soviet Union. Having the ability to send troops out of California would greatly benefit the United States in a time of war. Sending troops out of the previous main port, New York, might have proved impractical and useless in a war with the Soviets. California also is directly on the other side of the Pacific Ocean as China, a country that at that time had recently undergone a Communist revolution.  Status  Planners of the operation envisioned improving three areas with their program. The new system was expected to raise the morale of troops and their families, increase the combat effectiveness of the army, and lower the cost of maintaining the military establishment.

Plot Mary Doone (Theda Bara) is a poor British girl who runs away from her adopted family because the father made a pass at her. She lives at a parish house, and at the outbreak of World War I, she becomes a Red Cross nurse. At the front she meets war correspondent Lloyd Stanley (Stuart Holmes). Stanley tries to have his way with her but she is saved when the hospital tent is bombed. To get away from Stanley, she takes on the clothes and identity of an (apparently) dead girl, Ethel Wardley (Madeleine Le Nard). Ethel was on her way to live with Lady Clifford (Lucia Moore), an aunt she has never seen. So that's where Mary goes. There she meets and falls in love with Ethel's cousin Elliott (A.H. Van Buren). They become engaged. But Ethel is not dead and she recovers from her wounds. She and Stanley head to the Clifford estate to blow Mary's cover. It doesn't matter, however, because Mary has already admitted the ruse, and the family has forgiven and accepted her anyhow.

The poignant drama unfolds in 40 minutes and reaches poignant outcome in a work of value. The interpretation by all Fox -Film artists is, if not flawless, very good. The photographic work is perfect and brings an absolute clarity, being led for a truly artistic way. :The actress Theda Bara, besides excellent artist, is a striking figure of woman. Two children which has been featured in film (Jane Lee and Katherine Lee) are two lovely, wonderful creatures of naturalness and grace.

History After World War II, the Mauser firearms factory was captured by French Forces and restarted to supply the French. Mauser's Department 37 development group was placed under control of the French War Department's armament group, Direction des Etudes et Fabrication d'Armement (DEFA). The Mauser factory was renamed the DEFA Development Center, Oberndorf. The French continued work there through 1946, when German workers and equipment began to be transferred to the Mulhouse area of Alsace. The Alsace region was chosen because most of the people were bilingual in French and German. The new facility became the Centre d'Etudes et d'Armement de Mulhouse (CEAM). The transfer of operations to Mulhouse was complete by March 1948. The Mauser factory itself was ultimately destroyed by the French. In February 1948, former Mauser engineers Ludwig Vorgrimler and Theodor L√∂ffler were assigned the development of roller-delayed carbines for the French. They worked separately on carbines for the experimental 7.65√ó35mm cartridge, developed by Cartoucherie de Valence. Their carbines were patterned upon the prototype StG45, which had been under development at Mauser prior to the end of the war. The French ultimately abandoned their 7.65√ó35mm cartridge in favor of the US .30 carbine cartridge. Vorgrimler and L√∂ffler then went to work on roller delayed carbines for the latter cartridge. Ultimately, L√∂ffler's designs won out. Vorgrimler then devoted his efforts to improving L√∂ffler's designs. Eventually, Vorgrimler tired of this and left CEAM at the end of June, 1950. Months later, Vorgrimler joined CETME in Spain. L√∂ffler's design, designated the Carabine Mitrailleuse Mod√®le 1950 (CEAM Mod√®le 1950), was retained for trials among 12 different prototypes designed by CEAM, MAC and MAS. By 1952, the French dropped the idea of making their own carbine, and decided to concentrate on full-power rifles in 7.5√ó54mm and 7.62√ó51mm NATO. Accordingly, L√∂ffler began work on roller-delayed rifle designs in these calibers. These included both conventional layout and bullpup configurations. Also in 1952, CEAM took control of the former Fabrique d'Objets M√©talliques du Haut-Rhin (FOMHAR) metalworking factory. Now with manufacturing capability, CEAM gained its independence from MAC, and was renamed Atelier M√©canique de Mulhouse (AME). L√∂ffler ultimately abandoned the roller-delayed principle for conventional gas-operation. By the 1960s, he had left to return to Germany, where he found employment at Rheinmetall. In 1964, AME's Small Calibre Department was closed. The rest of the factory was closed in 1967.

It was the twelfth fort on Hadrian's Wall counting from the east, between Banna (Birdoswald) to the east and Uxelodunum (Stanwix) to the west. It was almost west of Birdoswald, on a high bluff commanding the Cambeck Valley. It guarded an important approach to the Wall and also watched the east bank of the Cambeck against raiders from the Bewcastle area. The site was drastically levelled in 1791 when the gardens of Castlesteads House were laid over it. The name ‚ÄúCamboglanna‚Äù is believed to mean ‚ÄúCrook Bank‚Äù, or \\"Bent Valley\\" because it overlooks a bend in the river Irthing; the name is Brythonic, made of cambo- \\"curved, bent, crooked\\" and glanna \\"steep bank, steam/river side, valley with a stream\\". There was some confusion over the Roman name for the fort. At one time Camboglanna was the accepted name for Birdoswald, but this is now believed to be an error in the Notitia Dignitatum. The Roman name for Birdoswald is now thought to be Banna. Description The fort was approximately square, measuring about and covering approximately . It faces roughly north-west by south-east and overlooks the gorge of the Cambeck. Erosion of the gorge has destroyed the north-west face of the fort. The fort lies within the Vallum, but is not adjacent to the Wall. It is the only fort on Hadrian's Wall in this position. It appears that the Wall had already been built at the most convenient point to cross the Cambeck and so, when the fort was built, the strongest point was chosen rather than one adjacent to the Wall. Garrison The 2nd-century garrison was the First Cohort of Batavians, followed by Cohors IV Gallorum equitata. The 3rd-century garrison was the Cohors II Tungrorum, part-mounted. Excavations In 1934 the fort was partly excavated and the walls, apart from the missing north-east wall were uncovered. The north-east and south-west double gates, and the tower at the southern corner were also uncovered. It was also established that the fort was defended by a single ditch. Several altars have been found at the site and have been preserved. Previously, in 1741, an external bath-house was located and partly dug by Susanna Appleby, a local antiquarian. References * J.

It is designed for large community gatherings and families. The park has many different areas for children and barbecue areas for families. The park went through a major redevelopment and was re-opened by the Premier of Queensland, Anna Bligh, on 23 August 2009. Southport Broadwater Parklands has become a popular family attraction.  Getting here  = Public parking = The Southport Broadwater Parklands is situated parallel to the Gold Coast Highway and opposite Australia Fair Shopping Centre. The park has several onsite car parks for visitors and on-street parking is also available along the Gold Coat Highway. Both on-street parking and onsite parking are managed by the City of Gold Coast and require a fee. = Public transport = The public park is accessible by several forms of public transport. The most convenient form of transport is the G:link. This is a light rail line operating from Broadbeach South to Gold Coast University Hospital via Surfers Paradise and Southport. There is a G:link station located just a few hundreds meters from the entrance to the parkland. Trams run every 8 minutes during peak times. Southport Bus Station is only a few minutes' walk from the entrance to the park and provides bus connections to neighboring suburbs. History The Southport Pier in 1915 The Southport Broadwater Parklands was first declared a public space in November 1928. At the time the area featured a pier and a series of enclosed public baths. Over several years the original pier deteriorated and was eventually removed. In the 1960s the Southport Pool was constructed. In 2005 and 2006, the Queensland Government and the Gold Coast City Council began background consultation for the redevelopment of the parklands. By late 2006 a draft master plan was developed. Throughout July and August 2007 community consultation was held on the plan. From August to November 2007 design development took place by EDAW. After some discussions with key stakeholders in October 2007, the final master plan was released in December. The contractor, Abigroup, was appointed shortly after. Construction of stage 1 began in March 2008. After close to one and a half years' construction, the Southport Broadwater Parklands opened on 23 August 2009. Construction of stage 2 began shortly after the opening of stage 1 and was completed by the end of 2010. Redevelopment Part of Southport Broadwater Parklands' redevelopment master plan The Queensland Government and Gold Coast City Council invested over $42 million on stage 1 of the redevelopment of the Southport Broadwater Parklands. The main objectives of the design were to: * Re-connect the Gold Coast central business district with the Gold Coast Broadwater * Celebrate 150 years of Queensland as a separate entity from New South Wales * Generate a sense of community, regional identity and celebrate the history of Southport * Provide an events space to attract large events such as the Yugambeh Corroboree Food, Art and Language Festival, Gold Coast Marathon, the Pan Pacific Games, the World Championship Triathlon, and the 2018 Commonwealth Games only two stages have been constructed and opened; however, additional development was proposed in the master plan. =Stage 1= Construction of stage 1 began in March 2008. After close to one and a half years' construction, the Southport Broadwater Parklands opened on 23 August 2009.

Wendling was born in Mannheim. There were four musicians in the original Idomeneo from the Wendling family.Mark Everist, \\"Madame Dorothea Wendling is arcicontentissima: the performers of Idomeneo\\", in Julian Rushton, W.A. Mozart: Idomeneo, Cambridge Opera Handbooks, 1993 She usually sang with her sister-in-law Dorothea Wendling, after her d√©but in 1762 in Sofonisba by Tommaso Traetta. Later, she occasionally sang as the prima donna, most famously as Anna in G√ºnther von Schwarzburg (1777) by Ignaz Holzbauer. In a letter, Mozart says he has been introduced to her by Cannabich and that she was very good-looking, and a good musician. Wendling had been greatly praised by Mozart's father and thus was chosen for the role of Electra. In 1785 she was engaged to sing in Armida abbandonata, but fell ill and had to hand the role to her niece ; she never sang in public again.B.

Despite lacking any formal schooling, Qumaq published two seminal works to the Inuit culture: a 30,000-word comprehensive Inuktitut dictionary and an encyclopedia on Inuit traditional customs and knowledge. He was fluent in Inuktitut only. He understood Canadian and Quebec institutions and worked for their integration into Inuit lifestyle for the betterment of his community. He was a founding member of the first non-governmental coop in the Canadian Arctic, in 1956 in Puvirnituq. After spending some time to the establishment of Rankin Inlet in the Northwest Territories, he returned to Puvirnituq in 1960 and founded its first village council and acted as its chair from 1962 to 1968. From 1972 to 1977, he was a vocal opponent of the James Bay and Northern Quebec Agreement and the leader of Inuit Tungavingat Nunamini, a movement opposing the signature of the land claims settlement by the Northern Quebec Inuit Association. In 1983 he took part to the Quebec commissions on Aboriginal rights and on Nouveau-Qu√©bec‚Äôs self-government. In 2010, Presses de l'Universit√© du Qu√©bec published his autobiography, Je veux que les Inuit soient libres de nouveau (I want Inuit to be free again). Name The name Qumaq was originally an inuit mononym. In 1917, he was baptised and given the Christian name Taamusi (Thomas). Qumaq eventually became registered as his family name. Early Life Qumaq was born on Niqsiturlik island near Inukjuak sometime in January 1914 to his nomadic parents. The family travelled by dog sled between Kuujjuarapik and Puvirnituq and hunted game such as walrus, seal and fish. Qumaq's family also collected fox pelts to trade for European supplies at trading posts near Inukjuak and Puvirnituq. In 1920, his mother participated in the filming of Nanook of the North. His father died in a boating accident when Qumaq was 13 years old. Without this teaching figure, Qumaq had to rely on other inuit families to learn how to hunt and construct an igloo. He settled in 1931 in Puvirnituq with his siblings and mother. Adult Life In 1937, he married his wife, Maina Milurtuq. Over the next few years, there were few animals and starvation abounded in his community, which was exacerbated by the concomitant closing of trading posts, the drop in value of fox pelts and the decrease in availability of commodities due to World War II.However, Qumaq was able to sustain his family and elders with the help of other hunters. Mail would be flown in from Moose Factory to Inukjuak, and Qumaq was responsible from ferrying all the mail to Puvirnituq, Akulivik, Ivujivik and Salluit on a single dog sled. He would bring the mail to Puvirnituq, after which is was picked up by another courrier to be transported further north. Following the relocation of Inuit near Akulivik and Puvirnituq to Puvirnituq proper in 1952, and the establishment of social welfare, Qumaq began to work at the new Hudson Bay Company store for 150$ per month. He travelled with members of the Hudson Bay Company in 1958 to establish a general goods store to the north of Churchill, Manitoba, but instead landed in Rankin Inlet due to bad weather, where he lived for 2 years. 1958 was also the beginning of prefab wooden houses in Puvirnituq. Previously, Inuit lived in igloos during the winter and tents during the summer. Upon his return to Puvirnituq, Qumaq constructed his house in 1960 and never built another igloo. Political Life In 1961, an administrator of the department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development Canada mandated that a village council be elected. Nobody campaigned for the position and no names were pre-written on the ballot. To his own surprise, Qumaq was elected as head of the village council. He lobbied against the federal residential school that was established in 1958, eventually replacing it in 1969 by public vote 89 to 9 with a school run by the Quebec government where Inuktitut and Inuit culture would be taught, in addition to the primary topics in English or French. He also supported the new Inuit cooperative general store founded in 1963, which would eventually become a federation of cooperatives across Nunavik in 1966. The cooperatives made money by selling soapstone carvings in the south and by selling commodities to the local Inuit. Qumaq and representatives from all the other villages in Nunavik met with Ren√© L√©vesque in Fort Chimo in 1964, where they discussed Inuit autonomy and place in Quebec society. He oversaw the construction of houses to ensure everyone had a permanent residence to stay, and witnessed the gradual appearance of motor boats, skidoos and alcohol in the community.

West of North Geneva Road the route continues on to connect with the northern end of 1700 West and then starts curving slightly north. Next it connects with the north end of 2000 West and then crosses the Lindon-Pleasant Grove line at the south end of 1300 West. Heading northwest in Pleasant Grove, SR‚Äë129 crosses Pleasant Grove Boulevard (SR‚Äë135), which runs southwest to connect with Interstate 15 (and on to 2800 West in Lindon). After connecting with the northeast end of Grove Parkway, SR‚Äë129 continues its curve to the north and becomes North County Boulevard (2000 West). Before completing is curve to the north, the route connects with the west end of 250 South and then continues through residential area. Now heading due north, SR‚Äë129 connects with the east end of 390 North before crossing State Street (US‚Äë89). North of State Street, the road becomes 1100 East as it runs along the border of American Fork and Pleasant Grove. After crossing Pacific Drive (American Fork)/680 North (Pleasant Grove) and Bamberger Drive (American Fork)/ 800 North (Pleasant Grove) it connects with the west end of 930 North (Pleasant Grove) before reaching 50 South (American Fork)/1100 North (Pleasant Grove). Intermountain Healthcare's American Fork Hospital, with Mahogany Mountain in the background, August 2010 North of that intersection, now entirely within American Fork, SR‚Äë129 connects with the east end of 30 North, the west end of 50 North, the east end of 70 North, the west end of 80 North, and the west end of 120 North. It then passes between the Dan Peterson School (on the west) and Intermountain Healthcare's American Fork Hospital (on the east). SR‚Äë129 then connects with the west end of 180 North and the east end of 220 North before crossing 300 North. Continuing north the route connects with the east end of 380 North, the west end of 400 North, the east end of 490 North, the west end of 530 North, the east end of 560 North, the west end of 580 North Circle, and the east end of 600 North before crossing 700 North. LDS Church's Mount Timpanogos Utah Temple in American Fork, October 2008 North of 700 North, SR‚Äë129 passes between the LDS Church's Mount Timpanogos Utah Temple (on the west) and the private American Heritage School (on the east) before curving briefly northwest. After connecting with the west end of 770 North the route crosses 900 East/1000 North and curves back to a due north heading to become 900 East. Passing by the west side of the Utah State Developmental Center, the route connects with the east end of center's primary access, 980 North (as well as the connection to SR‚Äë296). SR‚Äë129 then connects with the west end of 1100 North, the west end of 1300 North, and the west end of Murdock Drive, before becoming 4800 West as it runs along the Highland-American Fork line. Looking west across SR‚Äë129 at Lone Peak High School in Highland, June 2016 Continuing due north, SR‚Äë129 connects with the west end of 1520 North Circle before crossing over the Murdock Canal Trail, which runs along the (now buried) Murdock Canal. It then connects with the west ends of Harvey Boulevard, 1750 North, and 1800 North, before leaving American Fork and running along the Highland-Cedar Hills line. Just before entirely entering Highland, SR‚Äë129 crosses Cedar Hills Drive. As SR‚Äë129 fully enters Highland, it passes by the west side of Lone Peak High School. It then connects with the west ends of 10370 North and Killarney Drive before crossing Knight Drive/Old Bish Lane. After connecting with the west end of Caddie Lane, it crosses over the American Fork (river) and then connects with the west end of Canyon View Drive and Vista Drive. Finally, it crosses Country Club Drive and West Panorama Drive before reaching its northern terminus at the Timpanogos Highway (11000 North/SR‚Äë92). (4800 West continues north into Alpine, where it becomes South Canyon Crest Road. Legal definition The legal definition of State Route 129 is as follows: 72-4-118. State highways‚ÄîSR-121 to SR-130. (9) SR-129. From Route 89 in Lindon westerly on 700 North; then northerly on North County Boulevard to Route 92 in Highland. Traffic The Utah Department of Transportation (UDOT) collects data for the State Highways and Local Federal-Aid roads. Traffic is measured in both directions and reported Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT). AADT is collected for major intersections and ‚Äúsections where traffic volumes show a substantial increase or decrease.‚Äù The busiest section of SR‚Äë129 is between Geneva Road (SR‚Äë114) and Pleasant Grove Boulevard (SR‚Äë135), with an average of 21,000 vehicles per day. The least busy section of SR‚Äë129 is between 700 North and Cedar Hills Drive, with an average of 10,000 vehicles per day. Since 2008, traffic along the busiest section has increased an incredible 2,000 percent and traffic on the least busy section has increased only 8 percent. In addition to the travel restrictions for oversized vehicles that UDOT has established that apply to all state highways in Utah, SR‚Äë129 has additional restrictions which also apply to rush hour travel along most of the Wasatch Front. Specifically, travel by oversized vehicles is restricted on all highways in Utah County north of the North Springville/South Provo Interchange (Exit 361) Monday through Friday from 6:00 am to 9:00 am and from 3:30 pm to 6:00 pm. History The original SR‚Äë129 was established in 1931 as a road between Moab and Castleton (via Castleton Junction) in southeastern Grand County. However, just a few years later, in 1933, the roadway that ran (mostly along the Colorado River) northeast from Castleton Junction to Cisico was completed. The greater part of SR‚Äë129 was then added to SR‚Äë128, which continued north- northeast from Castleton Junction along the new road to Cisico The section that ran southeast from Castleton Junction to Castleton was deleted from the state highway system. The original SR‚Äë129 was immediately replaced (in 1933) with a road in east-central Beaver County, which was referred to as the loop off SR‚Äë21 southeast of Milford. The second SR‚Äë129 began on SR‚Äë21 about south- southeast of Milford and ran due east along East 4500 South (Cates Road) for about and then due north for about to reconnect with SR‚Äë21 in southeast Milford. The second SR‚Äë129 was deleted in 1969, along with nearly a hundred other Utah state highways and the SR‚Äë129 designation remained unused until 1982. In that year a third SR‚Äë129 was established in northeastern Box Elder County. That iteration of SR‚Äë129 connected I‚Äë15 west of Riverside with SR‚Äë30 at Collinston Junction (north of Collinston). Less than a decade later, that section of highway was added to SR‚Äë30 and the SR‚Äë129 designation again remained unused, this time for 25 years. By 2014, the third and final phase of North County Boulevard was completed in northeastern Utah County. (The first phase was completed in 2011, the same year second phase began.) While much of the Boulevard was built upon existing roads, the project connected the roads and created a five-lane corridor from the west end of 700 North in Lindon to the Timpanogos Highway (SR‚Äë92) in Highland. Once the project was finalized, it was designated, along with an improved 700 North in Lindon, as SR‚Äë129\\\\. In exchange of mileage, SR-146, a road parallel to SR-129, was cancelled. Since its establishment in 2014, the only significant change along SR‚Äë129 has been the designation of Pleasant Grove Boulevard (west of North County Boulevard) as SR‚Äë135.

It is commonly formed by repeating a freeze-thaw process. This is most easily done by bringing liquid hydrogen near its boiling point and then reducing pressure using a vacuum pump. The decrease in pressure causes the liquid hydrogen to vaporize/boil - which removes latent heat, and ultimately decreases the temperature of the liquid hydrogen. Solid hydrogen is formed on the surface of the boiling liquid (between the gas/liquid interface) as the liquid is cooled and reaches its triple point. The vacuum pump is stopped, causing an increase of pressure, the solid hydrogen formed on the surface partially melts and begins to sink. The solid hydrogen is agitated in the liquid and the process is repeated. The resulting hydrogen slush has an increased density of 16‚Äì20% when compared to liquid hydrogen.Christopher P.

Fuller (10 August 1886 ‚Äì 18 September 1966) was an American soldier and general in the first half of the 20th century. He is best known for his command of the 41st Infantry Division in the South West Pacific Area during World War II. Education and early life Horace Hayes Fuller was born on 10 August 1886 in Fort Meade, South Dakota, the son of Major Ezra B. Fuller. He was appointed to the United States Military Academy at West Point -- where his father had graduated with the class of 1873 -- by President Theodore Roosevelt in 1904. He graduated 59th in the class of 1909, a distinguished class that also included future generals George S. Patton (46), Jacob L. Devers (39), John C. H. Lee (12), Edwin F. Harding (74), Robert L. Eichelberger (68), and William H. Simpson (101). He was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant in the 11th Cavalry. He was stationed with the 11th Cavalry at Fort Oglethorpe until April 1914 when he transferred to the 7th Cavalry which was then based at Fort William McKinley. He remained in the Philippines until 1916, transferring to the 8th Cavalry. He was promoted to First Lieutenant on 12 June 1916. He transferred to the field artillery on 1 July 1916 but returned to United States to serve with the 17th Cavalry at Fort Bliss. He was promoted to captain on 15 May 1917. Great War Fuller transferred to the 11th Field Artillery in July 1917, and attended a course of instruction at Fort Sill. He was promoted to temporary Major on 8 January 1918. He sailed for France in October 1918 and joined the 108th Field Artillery at V√©ronnes. He participated in the Meuse-Argonne Offensive and commanded the 108th Field Artillery in the Battle of the Sambre, earning promotion to temporary Lieutenant Colonel on 11 September 1918. He commanded the 109th Field Artillery until March 1919 and then served with the Motor Transport Corps and Graves Registration Service. Interwar years Fuller reverted to his permanent rank of captain on 15 April 1920 but was promoted to major on 1 July 1920. On returning to the United States he was posted to the 83rd Field Artillery at Fort Benning. He attended the Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth from 1922 to 1923 and, a distinguished graduate, stayed on as an instructor until 1927, when he left to attend the U.S. Army War College. Regimental duty followed with the 76th Field Artillery at the Presidio of Monterey, California but he returned to Washington, D.C. in 1929 for duty on the War Department General Staff. In 1933 he was posted to the 6th Field Artillery at Fort Hoyle, Maryland. He was finally promoted to lieutenant colonel on 1 May 1934. After attending a chemical warfare course at Edgewood Arsenal, Maryland, Fuller was posted to Paris as military attach√© to France. He remained there until August 1940, watching the Fall of France first hand. While there he was promoted to colonel on 1 July 1938. World War II On returning to the United States, Fuller attended a refresher course at Fort Sill before being posted to command the artillery of the 3rd Infantry Division at Fort Lewis. As such, he was promoted to the temporary rank of brigadier general on 1 October 1940. Fuller returned to the Command and General Staff College as its commandant in June 1941, but, in December 1941, following the sudden death of Major General George A. White, he became commander of the 41st Infantry Division. He was promoted to the temporary rank of major general on 15 December 1941. Fuller led the 41st Infantry Division in the attacks on Salamaua, Hollandia, and Biak. At Biak, tenacious defence by well-dug-in Japanese defenders frustrated his attempt to rapidly secure the island. Running afoul of General Douglas MacArthur's need to have the island secured quickly, Fuller found himself superseded in command at Biak by Lieutenant General Robert L. Eichelberger, a West Point classmate. Fuller then asked to be relieved of his command, becoming the only divisional commander to be relieved in the Western New Guinea campaign. He was awarded the Army Distinguished Service Medal. His citation read: Fuller became commander of the U.S. Army Forces Far East in August 1944. In November he became deputy chief of staff at South East Asia Command. Later life Fuller retired from the army in August 1946 and died on 18 September 1966.

As a composer he was active from 1935 to 1969. An associate of the Canadian Music Centre, he was appointed a Knight of the National Order of Quebec in 1991. Life Born in Montreal, Vallerand began studying the violin at age 5 with Lucien Sicotte, with whom he continued to study until he was 20. He entered the Universit√© de Montr√©al in 1934 where he studied classical literature, earning a diploma there in 1938. While there he pursued private studies in music theory and music composition with Claude Champagne from 1935‚Äì1942.Jean Vallerand at canadianencyclopedia.ca Vallerand began his career as a music critic in 1941 when he succeeded L√©o-Pol Morin as critic at Le Canada. He remained there through 1946, going on to hold posts as music critic at Montr√©al-Matin (1948‚Äì1949), Le Devoir (1952‚Äì1961), Le Nouveau Journal (1961‚Äì1962), and La Presse (1962‚Äì1966). He also reviewed cultural events for CBC Radio and CBC Television during the 1940s through the 1960s. He contributed articles to numerous periodicals and journals, including L'Action universitaire, Am√©rique francaise, Culture vivante, Gants du ciel, Libert√©, Maclean, Musical America, Relations, and Vie musicale. He also worked as the program annotator for the Montreal Symphony Orchestra for many years appeared numerous times as a host for the French-language version of the Metropolitan Opera radio broadcasts. In 1942 Vallerand was appointed Secretary General of the newly formed Conservatoire de musique du Qu√©bec √† Montr√©al (CMQM) by Wilfrid Pelletier.

The plant, operated by Apache Energy, which normally supplied a third of the state's gas, was shut down for almost two months while a detailed engineering investigation and major repairs were carried out. Gas supply from the plant partially resumed in late August. By mid-October, gas production was running at two-thirds of normal capacity, with 85% of full output restored by December 2008. In a state heavily reliant on continuous supply of gas for industrial processing, manufacturing, residential use and electricity generation, the sudden loss of almost 35% of gas supply had immediate social impacts, and significant short and long-term economic effects. Many businesses were forced to curtail or cease operations, resulting in workers being stood down or forced to take annual leave, and the government requested that businesses and householders conserve energy usage. An emergency coordination committee of government and industry representatives rationed and redirected remaining gas supply sources. When many large gas users switched to diesel for power generation, the risk of a shortfall in transport fuel led to the federal government authorising the release of emergency fuel reserves stored at the Garden Island naval facility. The incident raised significant public and political issues related to energy security, adequacy of existing infrastructure, contingency planning, and the role of regulatory agencies. The plant took three months to repair, although partial supplies were restored within six weeks of the explosion. A major investigation was launched by the National Offshore Petroleum Safety Authority (NOPSA), with separate investigations conducted by the plant operator and several other government agencies. NOPSA's report was published on 10 October 2008, and confirmed early suggestions that the explosion was caused by structural failure of the export pipeline due to significant corrosion. A Senate Committee inquiry was established to investigate the economic impacts and the state government's response to the crisis. The committee's report was handed down on 3 December 2008. Background Location of Varanus Island and related gas infrastructure Since 1996, Varanus Island, from the Western Australian coast, has operated as a hub for oil, condensate and gas gathering infrastructure belonging to several petroleum joint ventures, including Harriet JV and John Brookes JV. The island's facilities include large tanks where condensate is stored prior to being offloaded onto tankers, and five gas plants. Condensate, water and other impurities are removed from the gas arriving from the offshore platforms connected to the island. Most of the carbon dioxide is removed so the gas can meet the specifications of the onshore pipelines and end users. Gas from the plant is sent via two subsea pipelines to the mainland, where the pipelines connect to the Goldfields Gas Pipeline and the Dampier to Bunbury Natural Gas Pipeline. Before the incident, the plant produced 365 terajoules of gas per day for the state market. The gas plant is licensed under the WA Petroleum Pipelines Act 1969. Safety and health regulation under this Act is the responsibility of the Department of Mines and Petroleum (DMP), which engaged National Offshore Petroleum Safety Authority (NOPSA) to provide inspections and reporting. Incident At 1:40pm on Tuesday 3 June 2008, an export gas pipeline ruptured near the gas plant, causing a fire in a large section of the plant. No one was injured and all employees on the island were moved to a safety point within 20 minutes of the explosion. One hundred and fifty-three staff were evacuated later that day, with 13 staff staying on the island to monitor the situation. Chief Executive Officer G. Steven Farris said, \\"Our priorities are the safety of our personnel, securing the facilities, assuring that the environmental impact is limited to the island and resuming throughput of oil and gas production...No-one was injured, all personnel are safe, and the rupture and fire appear to be contained on the island.\\" The explosion and resulting fire caused a full plant shutdown, reducing Western Australia's supply of energy by up to 35%. Apache's managing director, Tim Wall, said, \\"It's pretty easy to say there is a lot of damage here and we are looking at alternatives to try to get gas to market as soon as possible but it will be at least several months before we have partial sales.\\" He estimated it would be at least three months until the plant was at least partially operational, when the less-damaged processing plants for John Brookes and East Spar are brought back online. The John Brookes and East Spar plants produce 150-200 terajoules of gas daily, compared to 370 terajoules when all plants, including the significantly damaged Harriet plant, were fully operational. Approximately 80-90% of the island's gas is used by industrial customers, with small amounts provided to Synergy, the state's largest electricity retailer. Political response The explosion was investigated separately by Apache Energy, the National Offshore Petroleum Safety Authority (NOPSA) and other agencies. The WA State Opposition called for a Royal Commission, with Energy Spokesperson John Day saying, \\"It's a matter of making sure that this major disaster, which is now facing WA, does not happen again\\". Western Australian Premier Alan Carpenter said this was unnecessary because the National Offshore Petroleum Safety Authority was investigating and it could compromise their inquiry. Carpenter said their investigation will take 10‚Äì12 weeks to complete and its findings will be released to the public. State Opposition Leader, Troy Buswell, said that NOPSA had a conflict of interest as it helped perform safety inspections on the island, and therefore \\"are conducting an investigation which will in part be an investigation into themselves\\". Premier Carpenter held a meeting on Sunday 8 June with key stakeholders in WA's gas industry and announced that gas would be sourced from alternative suppliers, and a coal-fired power station, which was shut down for maintenance, would be brought back online. He also asked domestic users to save energy where possible, as the saved energy could be used by industries in need. Premier Alan Carpenter On 11 June, Carpenter warned he might need to invoke emergency powers and take control of all of WA's gas and electricity supplies, which would result in rolling stoppages, blackouts and brownouts. He also said he had discussed accessing emergency diesel supplies stored by the Department of Defence at Garden Island with Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard. The state's Energy Minister, Fran Logan, said the decommissioned Muja AB coal-fired power station at Collie would be returned to service to supply 25 terajoules to industry. He estimated it would take up to six weeks before the plant was operational, and said, \\"These units are old and not as environmentally friendly as new generators. However, the state is facing a significant gas shortage and we need to look at all avenues\\". Power consumption will be reduced from 22 megawatts to four megawatts a day at the State Government's water desalination plant in Kwinana, announced Carpenter on 12 June. He said this \\"will save around about five to six terajoules of energy a day which can be redirected to where it's needed...The decision will not jeopardise water supplies. We are able to switch the desalination plant back on to full production within a few hours ... four to five hours.\\" On 17 June, two weeks after the explosion, Carpenter made an unprecedented public address on television and radio. > \\"Gas is not only a direct fuel source for industry, we use it in our homes > and it's used to generate a large proportion of our electricity. While the > State Government has the power to guarantee gas supplies to essential > services and households, some industries and business have been hit hard. A > number of them are being forced to scale back operations and others have > temporarily closed.... We need your help. By continuing to work together we > can lessen the impact of the gas shortage on our state, on our businesses > and our families.\\" ‚Äì Carpenter, 17 June 2008 David Black, a political analyst, said Carpenter's address shows that the situation is serious: \\"Probably in terms of the total amount of gas and electricity being used, the community is a relatively small player...But politically, it is so important that they share the burden and that they be aware of the fact that they should be sharing the burden.\\" Opposition Leader Buswell called for daily publication of a gas supply allocation for businesses. After Carpenter's address, power consumption fell 2% the next morning, on the coldest day since September 2007. Carpenter said, \\"The saved consumption was very, very significant, enough to power the city of Geraldton\\". Prime Minister Kevin Rudd On 18 June, Prime Minister Kevin Rudd told Federal Parliament that Premier Carpenter had established a Gas Supply Coordination Group, involving government agencies and industry representatives. Rudd said the Royal Australian Navy was supplying six megalitres of diesel fuel to WA, and the Federal Government would consider invoking the Liquid Fuel Emergency Act if necessary, enabling federal Minister for Resources and Energy, Martin Ferguson, to control production, transfer and stock levels of crude oil and other liquid fuel. > \\"This is a serious matter for Western Australia therefore it is a serious > matter for all Australians... We believe that is an appropriate level of > coordination between the two governments... I think people in the east have > not quite caught up with the severity of the impact which this is having > across the WA economy. It is huge... If there is a significant impact on WA > economic activity and growth and on exports from that state, given the > significance to the overall Australian economy, there will be wash through > from us all on this over time.\\" ‚Äì Rudd, 18 June 2008 On 21 June, it was revealed that the state-owned electricity generator Verve Energy continued to use hundreds of terajoules of gas each week, despite having access to diesel fuel. A spokesperson said the company had not been instructed to cut back its gas usage, and there was \\"no intention to use very expensive diesel instead of gas, especially when supplies and deliveries of diesel are stretched and Verve Energy continues to receive its supplies of gas from the North West Shelf\\". Opposition Leader Troy Buswell said, \\"This is arrogance and hypocrisy of the highest order... They should be substituting gas for diesel, given the fact their plants can run on diesel. Gas could be re-directed to businesses which don't have choice about using gas or diesel.\\" The State Government had also delayed approval of a new gas processing plant for Apache Energy by over six months, only allowing Apache to proceed after the gas crisis commenced and worsened. The lack of a State Government contingency plan was criticised by Robert Amin, Curtin University's chair of Petroleum Engineering and chair of the Woodside Research Foundation, who said the Government should have stored enough gas in underground reservoirs to power the state for at least one month, to mitigate a potential crisis. Amin said gas could be stored in parts of the Perth Basin depleted of gas, like Dongara, and companies could be offered tax incentives. Federal Opposition spokesperson for trade, Ian Macfarlane, called for a national audit of all gas pipelines, and highlighted the vulnerability of the single pipeline that carries WA's gas from the North West Shelf. Macfarlane said, \\"At the very least this event comes as a wake-up call for the construction of a second pipeline from the North West shelf to supply gas to industry especially in the south-western part of Western Australia.\\" Professor Dong-ke Zhang, Director of the Centre for Petroleum, Fuels and Energy at the University of Western Australia, said, \\"I would have thought it was quite silly for a very advanced state like WA that we are not able to cope with an incident like this by not having the ability to divert gas from an LNG plant to the domestic pipeline. At a policy level, the infrastructure needs to be longer term and the Government should encourage major players like Woodside and Chevron to invest in the infrastructure and give the incentives for the industry to come to the party because they get much bigger margins by selling LNG overseas.\\" Restoration of supply A statement released by Apache Energy on 13 June 2008 said the company had sourced pipe and valves needed to repair the pipeline. Apache said it was increasing the number of staff on the island conducting integrity checks, with over 140 staff expected on site the following week. On 18 June, Apache Energy said it had commenced demolition and restoration of the damaged pipeline and expected this to be finished by the end of the following week. The pipe was already in Karratha and valves and fittings from the United Kingdom were expected to arrive in early July. Gas supply from the plant partially resumed in late August. By mid-October, gas production was running at two-thirds of normal capacity, with 85% of full output restored by December 2008. Muja Power Station On 23 June 2008, Apache Energy released a statement that said limited production of 200 terajoules of gas from the East Spar Joint Venture would start by 15 August, with full production expected by December. Also on 23 June, the Muja power station came back online. Western Power spokesperson Ken Brown said the plant will provide \\"very minimal megawatts because it has been out for many months, not just for pure maintenance, it's had a complete overhaul of the machine and the control, and it's going to take quite a while to commission that, but by next week it will be producing some significant coal megawatts and that's really good.\\" Kwinana Unit 1, a power station located at Kwinana closed for maintenance before the explosion, was reactivated on 8 July. The 110 megawatt station operated at 60% capacity for the first few days before running at full capacity. Kwinana Unit 1 is expected to free up to five terajoules of gas daily. Impact The WA Government's July 2008 projection of how the energy shortfall would be filled While household gas supplies were largely unaffected, some businesses faced higher energy prices, most notably in the manufacturing and mining sectors. The supply disruption was partially mitigated by the availability of alternative fuel sources such as diesel (for power generation), additional supplies of gas from the North West Shelf plant, and the return to service of coal-fired power generation units. Overall, the gas shortage had a large impact on Western Australian industries, particularly mining, construction, and hospitality. Some affected companies declared force majeure, and others are expected to make large insurance claims. If Apache Energy was found responsible for the pipeline explosion, compensation claims could be made against the company. State Premier Alan Carpenter said the Government will not offer compensation to businesses affected by the energy shortage, because \\"I don't think that the ordinary West Australian taxpayer would take too kindly to the State Government taking on a massive compensation bill for an interruption to a supply contract between commercial partners\\". A survey of 301 businesses conducted by the Chamber of Commerce and Industry showed on 18 June 2008 that nearly 630 employees had already been, or could be, stood down or made redundant - nearly 1% of the workforce surveyed. Almost 50% were affected by the gas shortage, with 11 companies already completely shut down. Up to 15% of companies surveyed could potentially close after three months of energy shortages. Chief Economist John Nicolaou said \\"To the extent that WA represents about 20 percent of the growth in the national economy over the past year, then that means it is going to have broader implications for the national economy. So it's important people around Australia understand the issue is significant from a national perspective, not just WA's perspective.\\" Macquarie Group economists estimated the energy crisis could reduce gross domestic product growth by 0.25 percentage points in the third quarter, as gas prices increased and the percentage of gas production allocated to export reduced. Natural gas sales were worth $5.2 billion in the 2006/2007 financial year, and its five-year trend growth rate is 16.8%. Chief Macquarie economist Richard Gibbs said, \\"WA supplies the lion's share of the gas exports. The effect on exports is that as there is a shortage of gas in the system, the capability to export will be diminished because the gas that there is will be directed towards domestic use... The gas exports have been pretty healthy. In the next couple of quarters that will be moderated dramatically if not stalled altogether. I think this will have an impact on the broader commodities side and the trade gap could widen\\". Modelling undertaken by the WA Department of Treasury and Finance estimated that the gas crisis would affect Western Australia's exports of chemicals, metal products, textiles, clothing, footwear and rubber and plastic products. Treasurer Eric Ripper said, \\"In the long term, the disruption is estimated to reduce WA's economic value by $1.8 billion between 2007-08 and 2011-12... this $1.8 billion figure (estimated at 2008‚Äì09 values), only equates to 0.2 percent of the economy over the same five-year period.\\" The WA Chamber of Commerce and Industry (CCI) released its quarterly report on 10 July, which said, \\"The gas crisis has already cost the Western Australian economy in the vicinity of $2.4 billion... With gas supply expected to be restricted until December 2008, CCI estimates the overall cost to be around $6.7 billion\\". The Reserve Bank reported in September that \\"the disruption is expected to result in a temporary reduction in national GDP growth of around 0.25%, with the impact spread across the June and September quarters\\". =Mining industry= Western Australian-based mining companies could have potentially lost hundreds of millions of dollars, because the state is the world's largest producer of iron ore and one of the largest producers of gold and nickel, exporting $48.4 billion of minerals and energy in 2006. Three days after the blast, the world's largest mining company, BHP Billiton, said it was assessing the gas shortage's impact, but its iron ore mines at Mount Newman and Nickel West were running normally. On 13 June, BHP Billiton brought forward the closure of its nickel smelter in Kalgoorlie by four months, which increased its gas supplies for its Worsley Alumina refinery. A spokesperson for Rio Tinto, the world's third-largest mining company, said the company was prioritising its power usage and using diesel and other alternative fuels for its mines, shipping terminals and railways. The world's third-biggest gold producer, Newmont Mining, said it was \\"investigating alternative gas and energy sources\\", and Iluka Resources, the largest zircon producer, shut down its Western Australian operations on 5 June and said it was awaiting advice from power supplier Alinta Gas. Oxiana Limited, soon to be the world's second-largest zinc producer, used standby diesel power at its Golden Grove mine until 6 June, when they obtained an alternative source. Newcrest Mining, a gold mining company located at Telfer, switched to its limited stockpile of diesel fuel. Fonterra Co-operative Group also switched to diesel power. Minara Resources, the country's second-largest nickel producer, was \\"using the time opportunistically on plant maintenance\\", as natural gas was its Murrin Murrin mine's only energy source. Minara Resources predicted that its full-year production would be reduced by 8%. Alcoa, which operates bauxite mines and alumina refineries with Alumina, declared force majeure as a precaution on 11 June. A spokesperson said, \\"We are continuing production, which is down a bit, and we are fuelling our energy needs with diesel supply... we have enough diesel to last us for weeks, but not months\\". Alcoa's United States parent company said it expects the company's second-quarter earnings to be reduced by $12‚Äì17 million due to the extra cost of gas and diesel. Woodside Petroleum's North West Shelf Venture increased production of natural gas to meet Apache Energy's shortfall. Apache's managing director Tim Wall said it was a small quantity of relief; Premier Carpenter said Woodside was providing an extra 50 terajoules of gas per day for the domestic energy grid. =Other industries, businesses and domestic customers= The construction and hospitality industries were strongly affected by the energy shortage. Brick producers Midland Brick and Austral closed their kilns within the first week after the blast, and on 11 June, the Chamber of Commerce and Industry warned that 14% of local businesses could close. UnionsWA said thousands of workers were being stood down or made to take annual leave, and the secretary Dave Robinson said mining, timber, beef, pork, laundries and transport industries workers were worst affected. Supplies of gas and electricity to residential customers are protected by state government legislation introduced in 2006. The impact of the crisis on Wesfarmers' subsidiaries caused a slump in the company's share prices. Wesfarmers managing director, Richard Goyder, said, \\"At this stage, our best estimate is that the pre-tax impact on group profit will be up to $20 million per month at the current level of gas supply. A portion of that loss is expected to be recovered from insurance\\". The subsidiaries affected are CSBP, which can no longer produce ammonium nitrate, Wesfarmers LPG, which has delayed commissioning of a new liquid natural gas plant in WA, and Premier Coal, whose sales have been reduced due to the closure of some of its customers, such as Iluka Resources. There was speculation in the media on whether the AFL football game at Subiaco Oval on 21 June between the West Coast Eagles and Geelong Football Club should be moved from night to daytime, to avoid using the oval's lights. According to Western Power, the electricity used by the oval's lights for four hours of operation could power more than 1,300 homes, but a spokesperson from the Office of Energy said, \\"Effectively the amount of energy used to light a game at night is less than what would be used if those thousands of people were at home with lights and other services operating\\". Western Australian Trotting Association chief executive, Rob Bovell, said if they were forced to move races at Gloucester Park from night to day, they would \\"probably lose half a million dollars in turnover and our customers would drop by 70 percent. Clearly this would cause major damage to us financially because our business is set up to race at night time. However if we are using energy that is affecting emergency services we will close down tomorrow.\\" Central Park Fifty representatives from shopping centres and office towers met on 16 June to discuss energy-saving ideas. The WA Property Council said \\"Non essential power including decorative lighting in shopping centres will be switched off. We'll also be looking at chillers and heating systems to ensure they use less power. At the moment we are in winter mode and they are running to heat the buildings so we will have to lower them, while main buildings will look at switching off non essential lifts\\". Perth's tallest building, Central Park, turned off its heating on 17 June, with General Manager Tim Ward saying, \\"We're not expecting anyone to be anything but compliant\\". Royal Perth Hospital's plans for coping with decreased gas supplies were leaked to the media at the end of June, which showed a 30% reduction in gas would cause phase 1, changing linen \\"only when soiled\\" and having \\"one towel per patient\\". Phase 2, a further 20% decrease, would result in \\"reductions in elective surgical procedures\\", \\"prioritisation of equipment for sterilisation\\", sourcing oxygen supplies from interstate and restricting patients' showers to \\"four minutes, second daily\\". Further reductions could lead to cancellations in elective surgery, rationing food and transporting \\"infectious linen\\" interstate for laundering. Industrial gas provider BOC reduced its supply of carbon dioxide to pubs for draft beer, whilst the shortage also threatened WA's wineries, who use carbon dioxide for bottling. BOC gave priority to the health industry, which uses carbon dioxide to sterilise equipment and in anaesthesia. The state's other major carbon dioxide supplier, Air Liquide, also shut down production, leading to fears that WA's largest pork abattoir would close. Westpac offered help to personal customers affected by the gas crisis, by allowing customers to defer home loan repayments for up to three months and restructure loans at no fee, increasing credit card limits and speeding up insurance assessments. Other banks and credit-lenders offered similar assistance to their customers. Official inquiries =Technical investigation by NOPSA= Following a four-month investigation, the National Offshore Petroleum Safety Authority (NOPSA) handed down its report into the causes of the incident on 10 October 2008. Numbered copies of the 92-page report were made available to members of the public upon request to the Department of Mines and Petroleum. According to the report, the plant was operating normally up until the incident. The immediate cause was the rupture of the 12\\" Sales Gas Pipeline at the NNE beach crossing, and that \\"the gas released from the ruptured pipeline ignited very soon after the rupture\\". The rupture of the pipeline was caused by corrosion of the external surface of the pipe \\"resulting in excessive stresses of the pipe wall\\". The report provides the likely sequence of events following the initial rupture, including the failures of other pipelines located near the 12\\" Sales Gas line, contributing to the intensity of the fire and damage to the gas plant. According to evidence available to NOPSA, the main causal factors in the incident were: *ineffective anti-corrosion coating at the beach crossing section of the sales gas pipeline *ineffective cathodic protection of the wet- dry transition zone of the beach crossing section of the pipeline, and *ineffective inspection and monitoring by Apache Energy of the beach crossing and shallow water section of the pipeline. A section of the report titled \\"Impediments to the Investigation\\" refers to the investigation team's frustrated attempts to interview staff of Apache Energy in relation to pipeline inspection, monitoring, and the company's maintenance and repair regime. The company declined to make its key personnel available for questioning by NOPSA. The investigators' efforts were also hampered by Apache's delays in releasing the results of laboratory analysis of pipeline materials related to the incident. Apache produced a comprehensive \\"corporate response\\" to a set of written questions provided by NOPSA, seven weeks after receiving the request. The report notes that \\"these matters directly impacted on the ability of the investigation team to develop its findings within the agreed time period and resulted in aspects of some lines of inquiry not being fully settled\\". The report identified that Apache and its co-licensees may have committed offences under the Petroleum Pipelines Act and associated regulations, and that there may have been non-compliance with pipeline license conditions. =Senate inquiry= On 28 August 2008, the Senate referred a number of matters relating to the gas crisis to its Standing Committee on Economics. The inquiry focussed on the economic impact of the crisis (losses faced by business and industry; relevance of contractual arrangements) and government responses (crisis management; emergency measures; alternative energy sources). Written submissions were made by numerous business and industry bodies, and six days of public hearings in Perth, Bunbury and Canberra were held during October. Written submissions to the inquiry included claims of unfair allocations of gas, inadequate communication of important information during the crisis, and the scale of the impact on individual businesses and industries. The committee was initially expected to report by 13 November 2008. The Committee tabled its 84-page report on 3 December 2008, listing six key recommendations to minimise the impacts and risks of future supply disruption, including developing a comprehensive energy security plan, and changing the methods of allocating remaining supplies during a major disruption. In terms of the macroeconomic impact of the gas crisis, the Committee relied heavily upon State Treasury forecasts provided during its inquiry, including that \\"the June 2008 disruption in gas supplies... is expected to cost the Western Australian economy around $2 billion in Gross State Product (GSP) terms, with roughly half of this impact in each of the June and September quarters of 2008. This translates to approximately a 0.5 percentage point reduction in estimated GSP growth in 2007-08, from 7.5% at budget-time to 7.0%.\\" The report refers to the Reserve Bank's modelling of the national impact of the crisis, \\"that the disruption is expected to result in a temporary reduction in national GDP growth of around 0.25 percentage point, spread across the June and September quarters... as national GDP is around a trillion dollars, a 0.25 percentage point represents about $2¬Ω billion, so the Reserve Bank estimate is broadly consistent with that of the Western Australian Treasury.\\" In assessing the state government's response to the crisis, the report recommended that the newly elected state government honour the Carpenter government's pledge on 6 August 2008 to develop an energy security plan. The plan should include possible contingency options, but warned any contingency option that would be of sufficient scope to mitigate significantly the impact of a gas shortage on the scale of that experience after the Varanus Island incident would be very expensive and could present significant technical and environmental challenges.\\" The inquiry examined the mechanisms and emergency supply protocols established by the WA government to mitigate the effects of the crisis. According to the committee, the protocols were appropriate, and the residential supply \\"was crucial to ensure that negative health impacts were minimised, particularly as the incident occurred in winter.\\" The Committee said it received submissions that the campaign to reduce household gas consumption \\"was misplaced as (households) only directly account for around three to five per cent of overall gas consumption.\\" However, the Committee concluded that the campaign was appropriate under the circumstances. The document contained a 15-page dissenting report written by the five Coalition members of the Committee. This report directly criticised the Labor government's lack of a contingency gas supply plan, despite two previous supply disruptions in 2006 and early 2008. The government \\"ignored these precedents, as well as industry advice, to develop an appropriate contingency response plan to deal with such a crisis and accordingly deserves strong criticism\\". The government's communication with industry and customers was \\"sporadic at best\\", and it should have declared a state of emergency to control gas distribution, rather than leaving distribution to market forces and a bulletin board system. =Joint Commonwealth-State inquiry= On 23 December 2008, the State Government formally announced a joint inquiry (funded by the Commonwealth) into the Varanus Island gas disaster. To be set up as a 2-person expert panel inquiry and expected to conclude by April 2009, it will \\"focus on the effectiveness of the regulatory system and the regulators for upstream petroleum operations and recommend improvements to the existing system.\\" According to the new WA Premier, Colin Barnett, the original inquiry focussed solely on the cause of the explosion, rather than considering surrounding issues. The Premier said that any recommendations arising from the report would ultimately be referred to the Ministerial Council on Mineral and Petroleum Resources (MCMPR) for implementation. 2012 report release On 24 May 2012, the Western Australian government's minister for Mines and Petroleum Norman Moore tabled in parliament the Bills-Agostini Report, and further public comment has come from lawyers representing Apache in response.Optus Zoo Closure Notice References External links * Varanus Island Pipeline Incident Apache Energy * Media Releases National Offshore Petroleum Safety Authority * Varanus Island Pipeline Incident Department of Mines and Petroleum (Western Australia) * Energy Update Information Office of Energy (Western Australia) * Senate Inquiry Federal Senate Category:Natural gas in Western Australia Western Australian Gas Crisis, 2008 Western Australian gas crisis, 2008 Category:Energy crises in Australia Category:Economic history of Western Australia ","title":"2008 Western Australian gas crisis"},{"id":"18189943","text":"In algebraic number theory, the genus field G of an algebraic number field K is the maximal abelian extension of K which is obtained by composing an absolutely abelian field with K and which is unramified at all finite primes of K.

Ideally this recollection of events is detailed; however, this is not always the case. This recollection is used as evidence to show what happened from a witness' point of view. Memory recall has been considered a credible source in the past, but has recently come under attack as forensics can now support psychologists in their claim that memories and individual perceptions can be unreliable, manipulated, and biased. As a result of this, many countries, and states within the United States, are now attempting to make changes in how eyewitness testimony is presented in court. Eyewitness testimony is a specialized focus within cognitive psychology. Reliability Psychologists have probed the reliability of eyewitness testimony since the beginning of the 20th century. One prominent pioneer was Hugo M√ºnsterberg, whose controversial book On the Witness Stand (1908) demonstrated the fallibility of eyewitness accounts, but met with fierce criticism, particularly in legal circles. His ideas did, however, gain popularity with the public. Decades later, DNA testing would clear individuals convicted on the basis of errant eyewitness testimony. Studies by Scheck, Neufel, and Dwyer showed that many DNA-based exonerations involved eyewitness evidence. In the 1970s and '80s, Bob Buckhout showed inter alia that eyewitness conditions can, at least within ethical and other constraints, be simulated on university campuses, and that large numbers of people can be mistaken. In his study, \\"Nearly 2,000 witnesses can be wrong\\", Buckhout performed an experiment with 2,145 at-home viewers of a popular news broadcast. The television network played a 13-second clip of a robbery, produced by Buckhout. In the video, viewers watched a man in a hat run up behind a woman, knock her over, and take her purse. The perpetrator's face was only visible for about 3.5 seconds. The clip was followed by the announcer asking participants at home for cooperation in identifying the man who stole the purse. There was a lineup of six male suspects, each having a number associated with them. The people at home could call a number on their screen to report which suspect they believed was the perpetrator. The perpetrator was suspect number 2. Callers also had the option of reporting if they did not believe the perpetrator was in the lineup. Roughly the same percentage of participants chose suspects 1, 2, and 5, while the largest group of participants, about 25 percent, said they believed the perpetrator was not in the lineup. Even police precincts called in to report the wrong man as the one they believed committed the crime. A key purpose of this experiment was aimed toward proving the need for better systems of getting suspect descriptions from eyewitnesses. The question at hand is what about an event makes it so easy for eyewitness testimonies to be misremembered. As it pertains to witnessing crime in real time, ‚Äúuniqueness is overshadowed by the conditions for observations‚Äù. The surprise or shock of a crime taking place makes it difficult to accurately pay attention to every detail aside from the sensory experiencing or task an individual is already attending to. Anything that a witness or victim could potentially remember is crowded by a number of factors: time of day, was there enough light to really see the event, number of people surrounding them, what would have made the perpetrator's features stand out in crowd? Potential noises, stress or anxiety induced by the situation, and other distractions all play a huge role in what our mind is perceiving, processing, and remembering. The mechanisms by which flaws enter eyewitness testimony are varied and can be quite subtle. One way is a person's memory being influenced by things seen or heard after the crime occurred. This distortion is known as the post-event misinformation effect (Loftus and Palmer, 1974). After a crime occurs and an eyewitness comes forward, law enforcement tries to gather as much information as they can to avoid the influence that may come from the environment, such as the media. Many times when the crime is surrounded by much publicity, an eyewitness may experience source misattribution. Source misattribution occurs when a witness is incorrect about where or when they have the memory from. If a witness cannot correctly identify the source of their retrieved memory, the witness is seen as not reliable. While some witnesses see the entirety of a crime happen in front of them, some witness only part of a crime. These witnesses are more likely to experience confirmation bias. Witness expectations are to blame for the distortion that may come from confirmation bias. For example, Lindholm and Christianson (1998) found that witnesses of a mock crime who did not witness the whole crime, nevertheless testified to what they expected would have happened. These expectations are normally similar across individuals due to the details of the environment. Evaluating the credibility of eyewitness testimony falls on all individual jurors when such evidence is offered as testimony in a trial in the United States. Research has shown that mock juries are often unable to distinguish between a false and accurate eyewitness testimony. \\"Jurors\\" often appear to correlate the confidence level of the witness with the accuracy of their testimony. An overview of this research by Laub and Bornstein shows this to be an inaccurate gauge of accuracy. Research Research on eyewitness testimony looks at systematic variables or estimator variables. Estimator variables are characteristics of the witness, event, testimony, or testimony evaluators. Systematic variables are variables that are, or have the possibility of, being controlled by the criminal justice system. Both sets of variables can be manipulated and studied during research, but only system variables can be controlled in actual procedure. =Estimator variables= Memory conformity When a crime occurs and multiple people are around to witness it, the first reaction is usually to go to the person next to you to confirm what you just saw. If you and other witnesses are required to stay at the scene of the crime, you are more likely to talk to more and more people about their perspective. This can lead to memory conformity. Memory conformity is when you report another person's experience as your own. Of course, in some cases this can be a positive thing if enough people saw the right thing and were able to report it accurately. However, most memory conformity comes from wanting your personal experience to match others. Individuals who identified a suspect with blonde hair, but two other people reported they had brown hair, the person who identified blonde hair would most likely change their answers. ‚ÄúPeople may agree with another person because of normative pressures to conform even when they believe the response is in error.‚Äù (Gabbert, Wright, Memon, & Skagerberg, 2012). Short-term memory In the event of witnessing a crime, it happens so quickly one can be susceptible to being in a state of shock. Once the initial surprise wears off, an individual can be left wondering what just happened? The problem with witnesses trying to recall such specific information is that short-term memory only keeps items in the brain for about 10 to 15 seconds. This means that if someone is not repeating everything they just witnessed over and over again to convert it over into their working or long-term memory, there is a good chance they can only remember the basic facts of the situation. Age of witness Among children, suggestibility can be very high. Suggestibility is the term used when a witness accepts information after the actual event and incorporates it into the memory of the event itself. Children's developmental level (generally correlated with age) causes them to be more easily influenced by leading questions, misinformation, and other post-event details. Compared to older children, preschool-age children are more likely to fall victim to suggestions without the ability to focus solely on the facts of what happened. In addition, a recent meta-analysis found that older adults (over age 65) tend to be more susceptible to memory distortion brought about by misleading post- event information, compared to young adults. Source monitoring Source monitoring refers to the hypothetical cognitive processes by which people identify the sources of their recollections. \\"Most of the time, source monitoring attributions are performed very rapidly and without phenomenal awareness of decision making. Sometimes, however, these rapid, nonreflective processes fail to identify one or more dimensions of source.\\" Applied to an eyewitness' memory of a crime, there are automatic consolidations taking place. There were events that occurred before and after the crime. They also have the influence of what others may have reported about the events of the crime. There are many things a witness might claim or believe to remember, but they may fail to recognize the source of that information.  Reconsolidation  Every time a witness reflects on an event, it is only natural that the memory can begin to fade or be changed due to reconsolidation. Reconsolidation is where reactivated memories enter a transient state of instability in which they are prone to disruption or change. Schacter and Loftus (2013) cited that \\"Reconsolidation may be a mechanism for updating memories with current information to keep them relevant. In so doing, however, this updating mechanism may also contribute to changes and distortions in memory over time as a consequence of memory reactivation.\\" Reconstructive memory Many of the early studies of memory demonstrated how memories can fail to be accurate records of experiences. Because jurors and judges do not have access to the original event, it is important to know whether a testimony is based on actual experience or not. In a 1932 study, Frederic Bartlett demonstrated how serial reproduction of a story distorted accuracy in recalling information. He told participants a complicated Native American story and had them repeat it over a series of intervals. With each repetition, the stories were altered. Even when participants recalled accurate information, they filled in gaps with information that would fit their personal experiences. His work showed long- term memory to be adaptable. Bartlett viewed schemas as a major cause of this occurrence. People attempt to place past events into existing representations of the world, making the memory more coherent. Instead of remembering precise details about commonplace occurrences, a schema is developed. A schema is a generalization formed mentally based on experience. The common use of these schemas suggests that memory is not an identical reproduction of experience, but a combination of actual events with already existing schemas. Bartlett summarized this issue, explaining Further research of schemas shows memories that are inconsistent with a schema decay faster than those that match up with a schema. Tuckey and Brewer found pieces of information that were inconsistent with a typical robbery decayed much faster than those that were schema consistent over a 12-week period, unless the information stood out as being extremely unusual. The use of schemas has been shown to increase the accuracy of recall of schema-consistent information but this comes at the cost of decreased recall of schema-inconsistent information. Misinformation effect Elizabeth Loftus is one of the leading psychologists in the field of eyewitness testimony. She provided extensive research on this topic, revolutionizing the field with her bold stance that challenges the credibility of eyewitness testimony in court. She suggests that memory is not reliable and goes to great lengths to provide support for her arguments. She mainly focuses on the integration of misinformation with the original memory, forming a new memory. Some of her most convincing experiments support this claim: #In one of her experiments, Loftus demonstrates that false verbal Information can integrate with original memory. Participants were presented with either truthful information or misleading information, and overall it showed that even the false information verbally presented became part of the memory after the participant was asked to recall details. This happens because of one of two reasons. First, it can alter the memory, incorporating the misinformation in with the actual, true memory. Second, the original memory and new information may both reside in memory in turn creating two conflicting ideas that compete in recall. #Loftus conducted more experiments to prove the reliability of expert psychological testimony versus the accepted basic eyewitness testimony. It was found that jurors who hear about a violent crime are more likely to convict a defendant than of one from a nonviolent crime. To reduce this tendency for a juror to quickly accuse, and perhaps wrongly accuse, choosing to utilize expert psychological testimony causes the juror to critically appraise the eyewitness testimony, instead of quickly reaching a faulty verdict. #Also, it has been shown that intelligence and gender has a role in the ability of accurate memory recall. Participants were measured in eyewitness performance in two areas: 1) the ability to resist adding misinformation to the memory and 2) accuracy of recalling the incident and person. It showed that when a woman was recalling information about a woman, the resistance to false details was higher and the recall was more accurate. If a man was recalling an incident involving a man, similarly the recall was more accurate. However, when dealing with opposite genders, the participants gave into the suggestibility (misinformation) more easily and demonstrated less accuracy. #Facial recognition is a good indicator of how easily memories can be manipulated. In this specific experiment, if a misleading feature was presented, more than a third of the participants recalled that detail. With a specific detail, almost 70% of people claimed that it had been there, when it had not been present. =Systematic variables= Type of questioning As early as 1900, psychologists like Alfred Binet recorded how the phrasing of questioning during an investigation could alter witness response. Binet believed people were highly susceptible to suggestion, and called for a better approach to questioning witnesses. A prime example of this is in the initial questioning process conducted by authorities. As an official investigation launches, police ask many questions ranging from race to weight of the perpetrator. All the information collected can be used to pull photographs of prime suspects or lead to a line up. If police suggest their own opinions, whether verbal or non-verbal, it can encourage a witness to change their mind or lead to guessing. Studies conducted by Crombag (1996) discovered that in an incident involving a crew attempting to return to the airport but were unable to maintain flight and crashed into an 11-story apartment building. Though no cameras caught the moment of impact on film, many news stations covered the tragedy with footage taken after impact. Ten months after the event, the researchers interviewed people about the crash. According to theories about flashbulb memory, the intense shock of the event should have made the memory of the event incredibly accurate. This same logic is often applied to those who witness a criminal act. To test this assumption, participants were asked questions that planted false information about the event. Fifty-five percent of subjects reported having watched the moment of impact on television, and recalled the moment the plane broke out in flames-even though it was impossible for them to have seen either of these occurrences. One researcher remarked, \\"[V]ery critical sense would have made our subjects realize that the implanted information could not possibly be true. We are still at a loss as to why so few of them realized this.\\" A survey of research on the matter confirm eyewitness testimony consistently changes over time and based on the type of questioning. The approach investigators and lawyers take in their questioning has repeatedly shown to alter eyewitness response. One study showed changing certain words and phrases resulted in an increase in overall estimations of witnesses. Improving eyewitness testimony Law enforcement, legal professions, and psychologists have worked together in attempts to make eyewitness testimony more reliable and accurate. Geiselman, Fisher, MacKinnon, and Holland saw much improvement in eyewitness memory with an interview procedure they referred to as the cognitive interview. The approach focuses on making witness aware of all events surrounding a crime without generating false memories or inventing details. In this tactic, the interviewer builds a rapport with the witness before asking any questions. They then allow the witness to provide an open ended account of the situation. The interviewer then asks follow up questions to clarify the witness' account, reminding the witness it is acceptable to be unsure and move on. This approach guides the witness over a rigid protocol. When implemented correctly, the CI showed more accuracy and efficiency without additional incorrect information being generated. Currently, this is the U.S. Department of Justice's suggested method for law enforcement officials to use in obtaining information from witnesses. Programs training officers in this method have been developed outside the U.S. in many European countries, as well as Australia, New Zealand, and Israel. While some analysis of police interviewing technique reveals this change towards CI interviewing is not put into effect by many officials in the US and the U.K., it is still considered to be the most effective means of decreasing error in eyewitness testimony. = Innocence Project = Over the last decade, the Innocence Project, has been gaining notoriety for its work within the judicial system providing help in exonerating those who have been wrongfully accused of various crimes. To do their part, the following are specific ways that they have suggested eyewitness identification can be more reliable. The \\"double-blind\\" procedure or use of a blind administrator A blind administrator lineup setting is where the person administering the lineup, i.e. an officer, does not know who the suspect actually is. By doing this, the officer is unable to give verbal indication to the eyewitness. Instructions Instructions can be key for eyewitness identifications. Proper instructions, such as telling them it is okay to not identify anyone, should be given before eyewitnesses try to identify an individual. Composing the lineup Composing the lineup is straight forward. If the suspect is in the lineup, the goal is to make he/she blend in with the people next to them. All people chosen to participate in the lineup should look like the initial descriptions of eyewitnesses. Confidence statements Confidence statements are statements provided by the eyewitness that will tell how confident they were in the choices they made in the lineup. The lineup procedure should be documented The lineup procedure should be documented by any means available. Most commonly video surveillance is used during the procedure. In some instances it may be helpful to have written documents providing descriptions of the procedure. Procedural reforms Experts debate what changes need to occur in the legal process in response to research on inaccuracy of eyewitness testimony. =Jury guidelines= It has been suggested that the jury be given a checklist to evaluate eyewitness testimony when given in court. R. J. Shafer offers this checklist for evaluating eyewitness testimony: :* How well could the eyewitness observe the thing he reports? Were his senses equal to the observation? Was his physical location suitable to sight, hearing, touch? Did he have the proper social ability to observe: did he understand the language, have other expertise required (e.g., law, military)? :*When did he report in relation to his observation? Soon? Much later? :*Are there additional clues to intended veracity? Was he indifferent on the subject reported, thus probably not intending distortion? Did he make statements damaging to himself, thus probably not seeking to distort? Did he give incidental or casual information, almost certainly not intended to mislead? :*Do his statements seem inherently improbable: e.g., contrary to human nature, or in conflict with what we know? :*Remember that some types of information are easier to observe and report on than others. :*Are there inner contradictions in the testimony? =Judge guidelines= In 2011, the New Jersey Supreme Court created new rules for the admissibility of eyewitness testimony in court. The new rules require judges to explain to jurors any influences that may heighten the risk for error in the testimony. The rules are part of nationwide court reform that attempts to improve the validity of eyewitness testimony and lower the rate of false conviction.

He was disciple of Nicol√°s Ach√∫carro and Santiago Ram√≥n y Cajal and one of the most brilliant examples of the Spanish Neurological School (or Cajal School). He was best known now for describing (in 1911) the intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies in \\"Lafora disease\\". In total, he published approximately 200 papers covering a wide range of subjects in neurology, psychiatry, and neuropathology. He made seminal contributions not only to the clinical and scientific literature but also to the training of many noted disciples who paid him due homage as a true \\"maestro.\\" Throughout his intellectual endeavors, Lafora manifested a singular purpose and intensity and a burning devotion to scientific honesty. In 1910, Fritz Heinrich Lewy discovered what became known as Lewy bodies, and compared them to earlier findings by Lafora. In 1913, Lafora described another case, and acknowledged Lewy as the discoverer, naming them cuerpos intracelulares de Lewy (Lewy bodies). Konstantin Nikolaevich Tr√©tiakoff found them in 1919 in the substantia nigra of PD brains, called them corps de Lewy and is credited with the eponym.

The boom was largely due to the rising demand from emerging markets such as the BRIC countries, particularly China during the period from 1992 to 2013, as well as the result of concerns over long-term supply availability. There was a sharp down-turn in prices during 2008 and early 2009 as a result of the credit crunch and sovereign debt crisis, but prices began to rise as demand recovered from late 2009 to mid-2010. Oil began to slip downwards after mid-2010, but peaked at $101.80 on 30 and 31 January 2011, as the Egyptian revolution of 2011 broke out, leading to concerns over both the safe use of the Suez Canal and overall security in Arabia itself. On 3 March, Libya's National Oil Corp said that output had halved due to the departure of foreign workers. As this happened, Brent Crude surged to a new high of above $116.00 a barrel as supply disruptions and potential for more unrest in the Middle East and North Africa continued to worry investors.Libya: US warships enter Suez Canal on way to Libyan waters.

A commodity price bubble, known as the 2000s commodities boom, was created following the collapse of the mid-2000s housing bubble. Commodities were seen as a safe bet after the bubble economy surrounding housing prices had gone from boom to bust in several western nations, including the UK, USA, Ireland, Greece and Spain. Advisers claimed that commodity prices could be predicted better than stocks, since they are traded for actual usage and the price is based on supply and demand, while stocks are bought for speculation and news immediately influence prices. Still commodity prices have fluctuated outside predictions. The renewed interest in coal by China's and Taiwan's energy companies and the rise of alternative power sources like wind farms helped modify coal prices over the 2000s. Chlorine price steadily increased throughout 2007 and early 2008 as demand for PVC and some metals like copper, neodymium and tantalum rose due to the increased growth of the BRIC countries' demand for electrical goods. Russia increased production, but the US offset this with production cuts in the late 1990s and mid-2000s.

During 2003, the price rose above $30, reached $60 by 11 August 2005, and peaked at $147.30 in July 2008. Commentators attributed the heavy price increases to many factors, including reports from the United States Department of Energy and others showing a decline in petroleum reserves, worries over peak oil, Middle East tension, and oil price speculation. For a time, geo- political events and natural disasters indirectly related to the global oil market had strong short-term effects on oil prices, such as North Korean missile tests, the 2006 conflict between Israel and Lebanon, worries over Iranian nuclear plans in 2006, Hurricane Katrina, and various other factors. By 2008, such pressures appeared to have an insignificant impact on oil prices given the onset of the global recession. The recession caused demand for energy to shrink in late 2008, with oil prices falling from the July 2008 high of $147 to a December 2008 low of $32. Oil prices stabilized by October 2009 and established a trading range between $60 and $80. The price of oil nearly tripled from $50 to $147 from early 2007 to 2008, before plunging as the financial crisis began to take hold in late 2008. Experts debate the causes, which include the flow of money from housing and other investments into commodities to speculation and monetary policy or the increasing feeling of raw materials scarcity in a fast-growing world economy and thus positions taken on those markets, such as Chinese increasing presence in Africa. An increase in oil prices tends to divert a larger share of consumer spending into gasoline, which creates downward pressure on economic growth in oil importing countries, as wealth flows to oil-producing states. In January 2008, oil prices surpassed $100 a barrel for the first time, the first of many price milestones to be passed in the course of the year. In July 2008, oil peaked at $147.30 a barrel and a gallon of gasoline was more than $4 across most of the US. The high of 2008 may have been part of broader pattern of spiking instability in the price of oil over the preceding decade. This pattern of instability in oil price may be a product of peak oil. There is concern that if the economy was to improve, oil prices might return to pre-recession levels.Oil prices and future economic stability https://www.thestar.com/business/article/535378 In testimony before the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation on 3 June 2008, former director of the CFTC Division of Trading & Markets (responsible for enforcement) Michael Greenberger specifically named the Atlanta-based IntercontinentalExchange, founded by Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and British Petroleum as playing a key role in the speculative run-up of oil futures prices traded off the regulated futures exchanges in London and New York.

There was a sharp shift in the prices of gold and, to a lesser extent, both silver and platinum. Prices were at or near an all-time high in late 2010 due to people using the precious metals as a safe haven for their money as both the de facto value of cash and the stock market prices became more erratic in the late 2000s.

Rhodium is mainly mined as a by-product of other metals such as platinum, so the production is based on production of other metals and therefore on demand of them, and less on the demand of rhodium. Palladium Most palladium is used for catalytic converters in the automobile industry. It is also used for some medical, high grade steel, industrial, dental and electronic purposes. Palladium prices rose sharply during the millennium period due to increased demand, then collapsed to nearly their original starting price by the end 2002, only to start to rise less dramatically in the year 2006. Palladium prices in 1992 and 2002‚Äì04 was about $200/oz.

In the run up to 2000, Russian supply of palladium to the global market was repeatedly delayed and disrupted because the export quota was not granted on time, for political reasons. The ensuing market panic drove the palladium price to an all-time high of $1,100 per troy ounce in January 2001. Around this time, the Ford Motor Company, fearing auto vehicle production disruption due to a possible palladium shortage, stockpiled large amounts of the metal purchased near the price high. When prices fell in early 2001, Ford lost nearly US$1 billion. World demand for palladium increased from 100 tons in 1990 to nearly 300 tons in 2000. The global production of palladium from mines was 222 metric tons in 2006 according to the USGS.

Unfortunately the high prices have caused a heavy increase in theft of copper cables, causing interruptions in electrical supply. During 2013-2014 there has been a slow decline to below $7,000. Iron The prices of iron ore rose sharply from around $10 per metric ton in 2003 to around $170 in April 2009 (transported to China). After that (written September 2013) the price was between $100 and $150; in September 2014 it started dropping precipitously, and was below $70 per ton in December 2014. The price of steel (at steel plants in Japan) has risen from around $300 per metric ton in 2003 to $1,000 in late 2008, stabilizing at $800 in 2012. The rise in prices made abandoned mines to reopen and new ones to open. It took some years to open mines, so some got a scaled up production around the time the prices dropped (drop partly caused by such production). Furthermore, started construction projects had to be finished so demand only reacted slowly to the rising prices. Lead The price of lead rose sharply in early 2007, then collapsed to nearly their original starting price by the end of the next year. Lead prices began to rise in early 2007 due to increased worldwide demand.

Other producers were considering bringing the total price increase for the 1997 product year to date of up to $80 per short and fob ton, from $45‚Äì$50 per short and fob ton in May 1996. This occurred as both rapidly ascending demand from the vinyl polymer chain market and the unusually strong seasonal demand and no new production capacity on the immediate horizon coincided.

Late-2000s economic fallout Many firms, individuals, and hedge funds went bankrupt or suffered heavy losses due to purchasing commodities at high prices only to see their values decline sharply in mid to late 2008. Many manufacturing companies were also crippled by the rising cost of oil and other commodities such as transition metals. The food and fuel crises were both discussed at the 34th G8 summit in July 2008. =The 2008 price glitch= In the second half of 2008, the prices of most commodities fell dramatically on expectations of diminished demand in the world recession and credit crunch. Prices began to rise again in late 2009 to mid-2010 (as supply could not meet demand), triggering another round of boom that lasted until 2014, when fossil fuels and metals prices collapsed in a far more prolonged fashion that looks to far eclipse that of 2008. =Mine closures= The heavy price volatility caused a sudden boom then bust in the mining industry across the world, e.g. in Democratic Republic of the Congo, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Canada, China, Sweden and Australia.

In February 2008, analyst Gary Dorsch wrote: Economist James D. Hamilton has argued that the increase in oil prices in the period of 2007 to 2008 was a significant cause of the recession. He evaluated several different approaches to estimating the impact of oil price shocks on the economy, including some methods that had previously shown a decline in the relationship between oil price shocks and the overall economy. All of these methods \\"support a common conclusion; had there been no increase in oil prices between 2007:Q3 and 2008:Q2, the US economy would not have been in a recession over the period 2007:Q4 through 2008:Q3\\".Hamilton, James D. \\"Oil prices and the economic recession of 2007‚Äì08.\\" Voxeu.org. 16 June 2009. Hamilton's own model, a time-series econometric forecast based on data up to 2003, showed that the decline in GDP could have been successfully predicted to almost its full extent given knowledge of the price of oil. The results imply that oil prices were entirely responsible for the recession; however, Hamilton himself acknowledged that this was probably not the case but maintained that it showed that oil price increases made a significant contribution to the downturn in economic growth.Did rising oil prices trigger the current recession?  vox ‚Äì Research-based policy analysis and commentary from leading economists.

It is an assessment criterion for how \\"repeatable, controllable and bankable\\" a firm's earnings are, amongst other factors, and has variously been defined as the degree to which earnings reflect underlying economic effects, are better estimates of cash flows, are conservative, or are predictable. Rationale The concept of earnings quality has roots in the judgmental nature of accounting, which can be seen in the fact the different parties may interpret the economics underlying a transaction differently, and different firms may have different business characteristics. =Interpretation of underlying economics= The interpretation of the economics underlying a transaction and even the wording of the accounting standards can vary between firms. This, along with the fact that a firm's financial statements are the responsibility of the firm's management, allows management to structure transactions to achieve desired accounting results,Knechel, W Robert, Salterio, Steven E, Ballou, Brian (2007), Auditing: Assurance & Risk, 3e. Canada, Thompson South-Western. by choosing an interpretation of the economics underlying the transactions that may be different from another party's. This use of judgment by management thus increases the chances that the earnings presented in a firm's financial statements may have been manipulated. =Differing business characteristics= Furthermore, the fact that firms have different fundamental business characteristics increases the possibility of error in or manipulation of presented earnings. For example, companies that operate in different industries may use a given machine for entirely different purposes or wear out a given machine at dramatically different rates, which makes it appropriate to allow management to choose between alternative depreciation methods and useful lives to be applied to the use of the machine. This discretion, however, increases the possibility for firms to make both honest mistakes, such as the accidental use of a wrong useful life, or to manipulate earnings.Financial Education. (n.d.) What is Earnings Quality?. Retrieved June 29, 2008, from http://financial-education.com/2007/02/22/what- is-earnings-quality/ =Earnings quality and ways to lower it= The above factors lead to investors needing to assess the extent to which a firm's reported earnings are free from mistake or manipulation, i.e. the quality of the firm's earnings. Other ways accounting choices can lower a firm's earnings quality include *Recording revenue too soon or of questionable quality, *Recording fictitious revenue, *Boosting income with one-time gains, *Shifting current expense to a different period, *Failing to record or improperly reducing liabilities, *Shifting current revenue to a later period, and *Shifting future expenses to the current period as a special charge Assessing earnings quality While the criteria for earnings to be considered high-quality differs between authors, sustainability of earnings may be the underlying concept. =Conservative accounting policies= Earnings quality has usually been associated with the use of conservative accounting policies. It has, however, been noted that conservatism in the current financial periods may allow aggressiveness in future financial periods. For example, choosing an \\"accelerated\\" depreciation method, or one that allocates a large amount of depreciation expense at the beginning of an asset's useful life, allows the firm to present abnormally high expenses for a given financial period and abnormally low expenses for future financial periods: conservatism, followed by aggressiveness. In other words, conservative decisions by management in a single period should not be used as sole proof of earnings quality. =Other factors= An assessment of earnings quality would therefore be based on other factors, such as #A correlation between reported earnings and underlying economic activity, #The permanence and sustainability of reported earnings, #The relationship between reported earnings and market valuation, #The extent and impact of discretionary accruals, #The transparency and completeness of disclosures, #The impact of low reported earnings on corporate image, #The company's handling of \\"bad news,\\" and #The degree to which earnings are good estimates of cash flows. =Sustainability of earnings= One author claims, simply, that earnings are considered to be of high quality when they are sustainable.Revsine, Collins, Johnson. (2005) Financial Reporting and Analysis, 3e. Pearson-Prentice Hall. =Methods of assessment as conflicting= Different definitions of earnings quality, and hence the different methods of assessment, sometimes lead to contradictions between methods. For example, using only the criteria of correlation between reported earnings and underlying economic activity, accelerated depreciation may give rise to higher-quality earnings than straight-line depreciation, while the converse is true if one uses only the criteria of predictability of earnings.

C√¥tes de Bourg is an Appellation d'origine contr√¥l√©e (AOC) for Bordeaux wine situated around the small town of Bourg-sur- Gironde near Bordeaux, France. The first vineyards in the area were founded by the Romans. In the Middle Ages, Bourg was a major port for wine and the vineyards developed at the same tempo as the estuary traffic. The C√¥tes de Bourg appellation, in the north of the patchwork of Bordeaux wines, took its first steps on the east bank of the Gironde. At the time, the inhabitants of Bourg were fishermen, sailors or winemakers and the latter benefited from the perfect combination of a commercially minded town and a soil made for the vine.http://www.cotes-de-bourg.com History Remnant of some of the fortification along the Gironde in the C√¥tes de Bourg. Historians date the first vineyards from the 2nd century AD, when the Roman occupants planted the first ‚ÄúVitis Biturica‚Äù. They understood that the combination of rich soil, climate and exposition of the east bank were ideal for cultivating the grape. Until the 9th century, the wine trade operated alongside the tin trade which in turn complemented quarrying. Nowadays, the area has many abandoned limestone quarries that provided stone for building the city of Bordeaux. All of this makes up the history of the growth of winemaking in the area since the appellation has a range of gravel, alluvium, clay and limestone soils.E. McCarthy & M. Ewing-Mulligan \\"French Wine for Dummies\\" pg 64-65 Wiley Publishing 2001 Geography Bourg is located north-west of Bordeaux, at the confluence of the rivers Dordogne and Garrone with an average altitude of 20 m above sea level. Wine Merlot grapes growing in a C√¥tes de Bourg vineyard. Red C√¥tes de Bourg are garnet in colour and are predominantly based on the Merlot grape, blended with smaller quantities of Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc. Some Chateaux still use Malbec as part of the blend. A small amount of white wine is made from Semillon, Sauvignon blanc, Muscadelle, Merlot blanc, Ugni blanc and Colombard grapes.P. Saunders Wine Label Language pgs 63 Firefly Books 2004 There are around 200 Chateaux producers in the appellation. Terroir A wine labeled from the C√¥tes de Bourg AOC. The vine has been established in le Bourgeais for centuries and the current varieties have been selected because of their performance in relation to the soil. The C√¥tes de Bourg are characterized by the diversity and richness of their soils. Although the C√¥tes de Bourg is composed of mainly clay and limestone soils, their make-up is so rich that there is a veritable mosaic of sand and gravel in the area around Pugnac. Three types are predominant. Firstly, the Sienna- red Quaternary alluvium that is quite specific to the region and situated more on the heights: Merlot and Malbec are widely cultivated. Merlot and Cabernet are planted on clay and sandy gravel soils while Merlot is also grown on the widespread areas of clay and limestone. The Atlantic Ocean plays an important role in the temperate climate of le Bourgeais and this accentuates the expression of terroir, aided by the regulation of temperatures by the effects of the Gironde estuary. According to scientists, especially Jean Duteau, the C√¥tes de Bourg benefits from 10% additional sunlight, 1¬∞ to 2¬∞ less extreme temperatures and a 10% to 25% lower rainfall depending on the year, in comparison with Bordeaux.

When writing his Life of Rossini, Stendhal tells of the time in 1813 when he met Bassi in Dresden and spoke of \\"Mr Mozart;\\" Bassi said he was entranced that someone should still refer to him as \\"Mr\\" Mozart. The affection he felt for the great master was thus clear to the casual visitor, but can also be understood from the importance of the roles he gave Bassi towards the end of his life. At the age of just twenty, he sang the role of Count Almaviva at the Prague premiere of Mozart's Le nozze di Figaro, after which contemporaries said, The people of Prague were so happy with this performance of the opera composed by \\"Mozard\\"Prager Oberpostamstzeitung, 3 November 1787 that they asked Domenico Guardasoni, impresario of the Prague National Theatre, to organise another opera. Guardasoni wrote to Da Ponte and work began on Don Giovanni. It was only natural that Bassi was called upon to sing again, and the role of Don Giovanni was written specially for him (with several joking references to the performance given the previous year). He did not like Finch'han dal vino, and asked Mozart to write another number where he could show off his vocal talents to the best; Mozart wrote L√† ci darem la mano for Bassi, who is said to have forced five re-writes until he was satisfied. Bassi moved to Leipzig, and there he sang Papageno in the Magic Flute in 1793, but shortly afterwards his singing ability had deteriorated (although his acting ability was as great as ever). A newspaper article said of him: Bassi moved to Prague, but the war forced him to seek protection from Prince Lobkowitz and he occasionally travelled to Vienna to sing. In 1814 he moved to Dresden, where he worked for the Italian company. He still sang Mozart roles, and he was popular with audiences, although his voice was beginning to fail. Until his death he would occasionally travel to Italy for singing engagements, but in later life only sang sacred works. Further reading * Freeman, Daniel E.

He was a Royalist leader during the English Civil War. Family and early life Vaughan was the sixth son of Walter Vaughan of Golden Grove, and his first wife Mary, daughter of Griffith Rice of Newton, Llandefaisant, Carmarthenshire. His date of birth is unknown, but assuming him to have been at least 21 in 1607, when he is recorded to have been appointed a deputy-coroner, he had been born by at least 1586. He was a younger brother of John Vaughan, 1st Earl of Carbery, and William Vaughan. Henry Vaughan married, at some point between 1609 and 1610, Sage, the daughter and heiress of John Gwyn William of Derwydd, Llandybie in Carmarthenshire, and the widow of Edward Rice of Newton. Vaughan settled at his wife's estates at Derwydd. Member of Parliament In 1620, he was High Sheriff of Carmarthenshire.Dictionary of Welsh Biography - Vaughan Family In 1621 he was elected Member of Parliament for Carmarthen, and was returned again in 1624. The 1625 election was a confused affair. Vaughan was returned for the third time for Carmarthen, as witnessed by the mayor and members of the common council. But shortly afterwards another return was made out in favour of Sir Francis Annesley, the Principal Secretary of Ireland. Vaughan was one of those who witnessed Annesley's return, probably indicating that he intended to stand aside on Annesley's behalf. Vaughan's name in the Crown Office list, which had been entered after his initial return, was duly erased on receipt of Annesly's return, but Annesley's name did not replace it. This was presumably because parliament was dissolved before a final judgement could be made. Vaughan was returned without incident at the 1626 election, and again in 1628, sitting until 1629 when King Charles decided to rule without parliament. Military service In April 1640, Vaughan was elected MP for Carmarthenshire in the Short Parliament and again in November 1640 for the Long Parliament. From November 1642, Vaughan began raising a regiment in Carmarthenshire to fight for the Royalist cause under his nephew, the Earl of Carbery. He was knighted by the King at Oxford on 14 January 1643, and was disabled from sitting in parliament on 5 February 1644. He was Sergeant-Major- General of the Royalist forces in Pembrokeshire from 1643 until he was defeated at Pill in February 1644 by the Parliamentarian leader, Rowland Laugharne. He established his headquarters at Haverfordwest, but abandoned the town in March 1644, supposedly after a stampede of cattle was mistaken for an attack by Laugharne's troops. Vaughan moved to Carmarthen, but was again forced to move on after this town fell to Parliamentarian forces a few weeks later. Imprisonment and later life Vaughan returned to Oxford, and was captured at the Battle of Naseby on 14 June 1645, and brought before the House of Commons on 18 June. From there he was sent to the Tower of London and imprisoned there until 1 October 1647, when he was removed to the Fleet Prison. He was given nominal fines of ¬£160 on 27 April 1644, and then ¬£500 on 20 August 1645 by the Committee for Compounding with Delinquents, after his estate was valued at ¬£600 a year. Vaughan was however in dire financial straits, claiming that he had debts of ¬£3,600, and that the most valuable parts of his estate were part of his wife's inheritance. He remained in prison for some years, being excluded from pardons as part of the Newcastle propositions in 1644, and the general pardon of 13 October 1648, on account of his apparent brutal conduct during the war. Vaughan's fellow prisoner, Sir Francis Wortley, in his \\"Loyall Song of the Royall Feast kept by the Prisoners in the Towre\\" (1647), described Vaughan: ::Sir Harry Vaughan looks as grave As any beard can make him, Those [who] came poore prisoners to see Do for our Patriarke take him, Old Harry is a right true blue, As valiant as Pendraggon, And would be loyal to his king Had King Charles ne'er a rag on. Vaughan was a prisoner allegedly as late as 1659, although he was reported on as a potential Royalist activist in Carmarthenshire in 1658, and had some role in the 1659 elections in Carmathen. He made his will when living at Derwydd on 27 November 1660 and was dead before a probate inventory of his estate was made on 5 January 1661, prior to proof of his will at Carmarthen on 22 January.Article by Lloyd Bowen. Vaughan had three sons, one of whom was illegitimate, and seven daughters. His eldest son, John, predeceased him and his estates descended to his second son, Sir Henry Vaughan the younger, who was MP for Carmarthenshire for some years after the Restoration.

It is part of the Diocese of Aberdeen and Orkney in the Scottish Episcopal Church. Since October 2003, the Episcopal congregation has been sharing the church building with another congregation from Cove Congregational Church. While the two congregations worship separately they do share many aspect of church life.  History of the Church  When the Church was opened as an Episcopalian mission hall by Dr Alexander Forbes, Bishop of Brechin, in 1864, the fishing village of Cove Bay (which is now a suburb of Aberdeen) was largely made up of imported English fishermen and their families for whom the Episcopal (Anglican) faith was a central feature of life. The building originally served a dual purpose as a church and a boys' school, and has been an important part of the village's life for over a century. From the very beginning there was a strong connection to St Peter's Episcopal Church in Torry. Often when there was no priest at St Mary‚Äôs, members would walk along the coastal path to St Peter's for baptisms, confirmations, weddings or funerals. The church building is a granite building with a slate roof and a bell. The interior pitched roof, is open, i.e., the wooden rafters and wooden roof boards are visible. It can seat approximately 100 persons. The Church was built with a rose window at the east end where the boys‚Äô school met, and a raised, three-sided apse at the west end, where the original altar was situated. In the 1890s a new school was built in Cove, and the building became solely a church. The apse walls are thought to have been originally painted in 1870. The paintings were subsequently covered up, about 1924, when it was thought they were too \\"Catholic\\". In 1929 six stained glass windows were put into the building. At some point in its history, the interior was re-oriented to face east, reflecting the traditional layout of an Episcopal church. The rear of the church was partitioned off and became a storage area for many years. About 1990, the original vestry, situated off the south side, was converted to a kitchen, disabled toilet and a Church entrance. Disabled access was made via a ramp leading to the new side door. At that time an emergency door was established through the north wall. By the late 1990s, through cultural changes and shifts in population, the congregation had dwindled to a handful of faithful members, and St Mary‚Äôs building was in a sad state of disrepair. St Mary‚Äôs Church is now the last remaining public building of the old village. The church building is now listed as category B by Historic Environment Scotland.  Cove Congregational Church  In October 2003, it was agreed that Cove Congregational Church should share the building. Since then the physical church has seen on-going repairs, detailed below, and the spiritual Church has found new life. The two congregations, Episcopal and Congregational, have very different styles of worship but share many other aspects of the church‚Äôs life‚Äîfellowship meetings, fund-raisers, decisions about the property. Cove Congregational Church began as a church plant in 1995. Cove Congregational Church is affiliated to the Congregational Federation; the Scottish Area has 29 member churches that are independent but share fellowship together, working together for mutual support.  Historic paintings  As part of the building restoration works, panelling at the west end of the building was removed, revealing five paintings of various sizes. These paintings have been described as \\"decorative panels of real historical interest\\". There is also a painting of Madonna. Advice has been taken from members of Episcopal Diocese, Aberdeen City Council, and The Conservation Studio, Edinburgh. All have indicated that the paintings are unusual, worth restoring and preserving for the Community. Christmas Eve 2004 saw the first public showing of the first three restored paintings. Christmas 2005 saw the return of all the paintings. A special service was held in September 2005 to commemorate the unveiling of the restored artwork.

It extends southward into the Hvar Channel, a body of water in the Adriatic Sea between the islands of Braƒç and Hvar, which is home to strong currents. The landform itself is mostly composed of a white pebble beach, with a Mediterranean pine grove taking up the remainder. Zlatni Rat has been regularly listed as one of the top beaches in Europe. Its distinctive shape can be seen in many travel brochures, which made it one of the symbols of Croatian tourism. In 2008 Red Bull organized Red Bull Golden Jump, a unique kiteboarding competition in jumping/flying over the beach.https://www.slobodnadalmacija.hr/mozaik/zivot/clanak/id/8499/red-bull- golden-jump-preskocili-zlatni-rat Description Eastern bank of the Zlatni Rat The beaches on either side of the spit extend for some altogether,Naklada Naprijed, The Croatian Adriatic Tourist Guide, p. 267, Zagreb (1999), . but the exact shape and length of the landform varies with regard to changes in tide, current, and wind. The spit points directly south. The farthest end, which is usually turned slightly towards the east, will often shift to the west in certain weather conditions, esp. a strong south-easterly wind known in Croatia as the Jugo. Changes in the shape of the beach occur once in every two to three years, and have been observed in 2010, 2016 and 2018. The surrounding waters are usually cool and clear, due to the current in the Hvar Channel. The current is mildly hazardous for swimmers who venture far southwards from the tip towards the open sea, as it could be difficult to swim back west towards the beach (the swimmer being well over from the coast); the danger is not severe, however, as the standard current would carry the swimmer back east towards the harbor of Bol (and the beaches on the promontory of land that lies between Zlatni Rat and the town). A reliable afternoon westerly wind known as a Maestral has made the beach a destination for windsurfers. The pine tree grove which borders the beach is home to the remnants of a Roman villa rustica, which included a swimming pool. The westernmost edge of the beach, and several coves to the west of the main beach, are traditionally clothing- optional. The promontory is protected as a geomorphological phenomenon.

Birnbaum entered the nascent field of video art in the mid-to-late 1970s challenging the gendered biases of the period and television‚Äôs ever-growing presence within the American household. Her oeuvre primarily addresses ideological and aesthetic features of mass media through the intersection of video art and television.\\"Dara Birnbaum, The Dark Matter of Media Light\\", ed. Karen Kelly, Barbara Schr√∂der, and Giel Vandecaveye, DelMonico Books, 2010, p.10. She uses video to reconstruct television imagery using materials such as archetypal formats as quizzes, soap operas, and sports programmes. Her techniques involve the repetition of images and interruption of flow with text and music. She is also well known for forming part of the feminist art movement that emerged within video art in the mid-1970s. Landmarks, the public art program of The University of Texas at Austin, exhibited Technology/Transformation: Wonder Woman(1978-1979) and archived an essay dedicated to Birnbaum and her work on their website. Birnbaum lives and works in New York. Early life and education Dara Birnbaum was born in 1946 in New York.\\"Birnbaum Biography\\", Marian Goodman Gallery, Retrieved 31 October 2018. In 1969 she received her BA in architecture at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. She subsequently worked in the Lawrence Halprin & Associates architectural firm in New York City. Her work with the firm instilled a lifelong consideration of civic space and exploration of the relationship between private and public spheres in mass culture. In 1973 Birnbaum attained a BFA in painting from the San Francisco Art Institute. Career and artistic practice In 1975 Birnbaum moved to Florence for a year and was introduced to video art by the Centro Diffusione Grafica, a gallery that pioneered video art exhibitions. Shortly after her return to New York City in 1976, Birnbaum met Dan Graham, an artist/critic who greatly impacted her artistic development. He introduced her to Screen (journal), a British film-theory journal, which provided a critical analysis of mainstream cinema during the 1970s. Birnbaum was very interested in the journal‚Äôs discussion of an emerging feminist context in the critique of cinema but found Screen (journal) to be flawed in its failure to consider television‚Äîa medium she believed to have replaced film as the dominant force of American mass culture.Demos 2010, p. 11. During the mid-1970s, the poet Alan Sondheim lent Birnbaum his Sony Portapak, which enabled her to create her first experimental video works, such as Control Piece and Mirroring. These works explored the separation between the body and its representation through the use of mirrors and projected images. The presence of mirrors continued into her late-1970s video works which focused primarily on the appropriation and of television's conventions. Through the fragmentation and repetition of TV conventions, she used borrowed images to examine the medium's technical structures and bodily gestures.Demos 2010, p. 11‚Äì12. These explorations laid a foundation for her most prominent work, the 1978 - 1979 video art piece Technology/Transformation: Wonder Woman. In this work she used appropriated images of Wonder Woman to subvert ideological subtexts and meanings embedded in the television series.Margot Lovejoy, Digital Currents: Art in the Electronic Age, Routledge, 2004, p108. \\"Opening with a prolonged salvo of fiery explosions accompanied by the warning cry of a siren, Technology/Transformation: Wonder Woman is supercharged, action-packed, and visually riveting... throughout its nearly six minutes we see several scenes featuring the main character Diana Prince... in which she transforms into the famed superhero.\\"Demos 2010, p. 1. Her citational use of Wonder Woman illustrates the efforts she made into exploring \\"television on television,\\" which indicates a consciousness of analyzing the television/video medium within its own terms, an exploration of the structural elements of television content, and an attempt to talk back to television.Demos 2010, p. 14‚Äì16. In 1979 she started to make fast-edited video collages from footage appropriated while working for a TV post-production unit.Catherine Elwes, Video Art: A Guided Tour, I.B.Tauris, 2005, p108. In 1982 Birnbaum created the piece titled PM Magazine/Acid Rock with appropriated video from the nightly T.V. Show, PM Magazine, and a segment of a Wang Computers commercial. Created for Documenta 7 as part of a four channel video installation, PM Magazine/Acid Rock underscores the themes of consumerism, T.V., and feminism in Birnbaum's work through the use of pop images and a recomposed version of \\"L.A. Woman\\" by the Doors. She participated in the 1985 Whitney Biennial.Margot Lovejoy, Digital Currents: Art in the Electronic Age, Routledge, 2004, p129. In her 1990 single channel video work Cannon: Taking to the Street the political act of taking to the street is framed through an iconic evocation of the Paris uprising of May 1968, interspersed with amateur footage from a Take Back the Night march held at Princeton University in April, 1987.Dot Tuer ' Mirrors and Mimesis: An Examination of the Strategies of Image Appropriation and Repetition in the Work of Dara Birnbaum' issue 3 May 1997 n.paradoxa: international feminist art journal online pp.4-16 Her 1994 six channel video installation Hostage has as its subject the kidnapping of Hanns-Martin Schleyer in 1977.Dot Tuer, Mining the Media Archive: Essays on Art, Technology and Cultural Resistance, YYZ Books, 2006, p45.

Despite its promising antibiotic activity, the clinical development of clinafloxacin has been hampered by its risk for inducing serious side effects. Medical uses Clinafloxacin has not been approved for any indication. The investigational new drug application was withdrawn by the manufacturer in 1999, citing safety concerns. =Available forms= Clinafloxacin is available in both oral and intravenous formulations. =Specific populations= There is a warning against using clinafloxacin in pregnant patients, due to possible damage to the developing fetus. Adverse effects The use of clinafloxacin is associated with drug-induced light sensitivity (phototoxicity) and low blood sugar. Diarrhea has also been reported. The phototoxicity with clinafloxacin has been more associated with oral dosing as compared to intravenous dosing, though the studies that described this were subject to confounding by study site (that is, patients that received intravenous clinafloxacin were less mobile, and thereby received less sunlight exposure). The mechanism for clinafloxacin's phototoxicity involves the chlorine atom at position 8. In the presence of ultraviolet light, the chemical structure of clinafloxacin is degraded, resulting in the formation of toxic, reactive oxygen species that can damage cellular structures‚Äîincluding DNA. For this reason clinafloxacin can also be classified as a photocarcinogen (a chemical that can cause light- induced cancer), though the risk of developing cancer in humans taking the medication is small. The mechanism for clinafloxacin's effect on blood glucose is thought to involve stimulation of the pancreatic beta cells, which produce insulin (a hormone that lowers blood glucose levels). The symptoms of clinafloxacin overdose are unknown.  Interactions  =Drug-drug interactions= Clinafloxacin inhibits multiple CYP450 drug metabolizing enzymes, especially CYP1A2. Clinafloxacin has induced the accumulation of CYP1A2 substrates, including theophylline, at therapeutic doses. This can also affect the metabolism of caffeine, another CYP1A2 substrate. Caffeine consumption must be limited while taking clinafloxacin to prevent caffeine accumulation and overdose. There is also a known interaction of clinafloxacin with phenytoin, resulting in a decrease in the clearance of phenytoin from the body. The increase in INR seen in patients taking both clinafloxacin and the anticoagulant warfarin has yet to be fully elucidated. =Food-drug interactions= There are no known food-drug interactions with clinafloxacin. Pharmacology =Mechanism of action= Clinafloxacin's antibiotic mechanism of action, like other fluoroquinolones is derived from its activity against type II topoisomerases DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV. Clinafloxacin has been described as a broad-spectrum antibiotic due to its activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. In addition, clinafloxacin has antibiotic activity against anaerobic bacteria, including the facultative anaerobe Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Clinafloxacin's activity against anaerobic bacteria is higher than that of most other fluoroquinolones, including ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, and moxifloxacin. =Pharmacokinetics= The time that it takes for serum concentrations of clinafloxacin to reach the maximum concentration (Cmax) in healthy volunteers after taking a dose by mouth is 0.7 hours. The elimination half-life in humans is 6.1 hours. Steady state levels of clinafloxacin are achieved in 3 days of twice daily dosing by mouth in healthy volunteers. About half of an administered clinafloxacin dose is found unchanged in the urine, meaning that the drug is cleared from the blood stream roughly equally by hepatic metabolism (liver-induced degradation) and renal elimination (kidney-mediated removal). Chemistry Clinafloxacin is a fluoroquinolone, structurally related to other fluoroquinolones like ciprofloxacin. It is soluble in methanol (about 2 mg/mL at 25 ¬∞C) and water. History In the 1990s, clinafloxacin showed promise as a novel, broad- spectrum fluoroquinolone antibiotic. However, further clinical trials raised serious concerns regarding its safety in humans, citing dangerously low blood sugar, drug-induced light sensitivity, and multiple drug-drug interactions. Research Clinical trials have been done to assess its efficacy in sepsis and other serious and potentially life-threatening infections.

It is the largest Robinsons Mall ever built. Robinsons Place Manila is located beside the University of the Philippines Manila and the Philippine General Hospital, and is built at the site of the former Ateneo de Manila Campus before it moved to Loyola Heights, Quezon City. The first major expansion of the mall happened when it opened its Padre Faura Wing in June 2000. The mall was further expanded in 2006 when the nearby Midtown Hotel was demolished to make way for the construction of its Midtown Wing and the Adriatico Place Residences. It is also known as Robinsons Ermita, Robinsons Manila and Robinsons Place Ermita. Robinsons Place Manila is connected to two high-rise residential condominiums: the 37-storey twin tower Robinsons Place Residences, and the triple tower Adriatico Place Residences.  History  Robinsons Place Manila and Robinsons Place Residences as seen from Padre Faura Street. Robinsons Place Manila was built in the 1980s, on the site of the former Ateneo de Manila University Campus and Assumption Convent located beside the University of the Philippines Manila and the Philippine General Hospital. Ateneo transferred to Loyola Heights, Quezon City while the Convent relocated to San Lorenzo Village, Makati. This seven-level shopping complex has 330 local shops, dining outlets, entertainment facilities and service centers. In June 2000, the mall was expanded with the opening of the Padra Faura Wing which contains additional shopping and dining facilities. It is also anchored by the construction of the 37-storey, twin tower residential condominium Robinsons Place Residences. Further demand in the market expanded the mall with the acquisition of the Manila Midtown Hotel and demolishing it to make way for its Midtown Wing, which is also anchored by another residential condominium project the Adriatico Place Residences. This expansion made the mall larger than Robinsons Galleria and therefore the largest Robinsons Mall. It was reported by BusinessWorld in November 2018 that Robinsons Land Corporation plans to renovate Robinsons Place Manila in 2019. The recently renovated Robinsons Department Store Business Center was opened to the public in March 2019. Cinemas 4-7 in the Pedro Gil Wing have completed their renovation works which also includes a newly-refreshed lobby. Cinema 1 is closed as continuation of the renovation works. Layout =Padre Faura Wing= The historic Jesuit Bell which was on display at the entrance of the mall. The Padre Faura Wing faces Padre Faura Street and is connected to Robinsons Place Residences. The arrangement of its entry point as well as the tower makes the mall the focal point when traversing Ma. Y. Orosa Avenue southwards. It is near the Philippine General Hospital, the Office of the University Registrar of UP Manila, as well as the Department of Justice, Court of Appeals, and the Supreme Court of the Philippines. The Jesuit Bell which was once located on the site of the former Manila Observatory was on display at the entrance. =Midtown Wing= Midtown Wing Atrium Midtown wing was the expansion of the original mall facing Adriatico Street. It was constructed on the adjacent lot located at the former Manila Midtown Hotel which was demolished to make way for this expansion. A lot of high-end shops and boutiques serves as its tenant. The Robinsons Department Store and its Business Center is located here.

Drever is the vocalist and guitarist of the folk trio Lau with Martin Green and Aidan O'Rourke. He has worked with other British folk contemporaries, including Kate Rusby, John McCusker, Ian Carr, Eddi Reader and Julie Fowlis.  Career  Drever was born in Kirkwall, Orkney, where he learned to play guitar and participated in the island's folk festival. In 1995 at age 17 he moved to Edinburgh, where he played at the Tron Ceilidh House several nights a week. He played the double bass for a time but returned to the guitar where his style ‚Äì \\"a highly individual blend of rhythm and harmony, folk, jazz, rock and country inflections\\" ‚Äì made him a sought after session musician. In late 2000 he began playing alongside Nuala Kennedy and Anna-Wendy Stevenson in a weekly session at Sandy Bell's pub in Edinburgh. The trio became known as Fine Friday and toured in the UK, Europe and Australia, releasing two albums before disbanding. Drever went on to collaborate with a number of prominent folk musicians including Cathy Ryan of Irish-American supergroup Cherish the Ladies; Scottish fiddlers John McCusker and Bruce MacGregor; Irish accordionist Leo McCann; Gaelic band Tannas; and the Irish dance show Celtic Fusion. Drever is also a founding member of the folk collective Session A9, has been a member of Kate Rusby's band and has worked with contemporary folk artists Eddi Reader and Julie Fowlis. In 2005 Drever formed the trio Lau with Scottish fiddler Aidan O'Rourke and English accordionist Martin Green. The band has released five studio albums to date and conducted numerous tours throughout the UK and worldwide. He also collaborated with Roddy Woomble, lead singer of Scottish indie band Idlewild, and John McCusker. The trio worked, along with other notable folk musicians, on an album entitled Before the Ruin, which was released in September 2008. Before the release of Black Water, Drever had not considered a solo career. In an interview with Mojo, Drever stated: A live DVD was released 28 July 2008, featuring Drever's \\"Classic Album\\" set at 2008's Celtic Connections. In January 2010, Drever released his second solo album, Mark the Hard Earth, during Celtic Connections.

It is about 1.5 miles long. Clewer Mill Stream is named after the watermill that it once drove. Clewer Mill Stream has provided food, power, fresh water, safe harbour and navigable access to the Thames for the small settlement of Clewer since the 10th century. In 1198 the Knights Templars of Bisham granted a fishery at Clewer to Richard de Sifrewast. The corn mill at Clewer was first mentioned in the Domesday Book with a value of 10 shillings and there has been a building on the site ever since. In 1781 the mill burnt down and its machinery, which had been visited by George III as it was so \\"singular and curious\\", was destroyed. The mill was rebuilt after the fire, and although the water level was affected by the building of the weirs at Romney and Boveney Locks, Clewer Mill was operational until the late 19th century. In the 1920s Clewer Mill House was the home of a Mrs Moscockle who used to dress like Queen Mary and wave regally to pedestrians from her Rolls- Royce as she was driven around Windsor. Clewer Mill Stream was once a popular haunt of schoolboys from nearby Eton College although it was, along with the Thames itself, officially out-of-bounds and a punishment of 100 lines could be given by a sixth former to any \\"lower boy\\" (roughly the first two years) caught \\"shooting [water birds] in the Clewer Stream\\". An account from the 1840s of life at Eton describes the thrill of sculling up the backwater to the mill and waiting until the \\"miller was at dinner\\" to carry one's skiff around the mill wheel and launch it into the \\"mill-stream where it was really dangerous, above the wheel\\". The tract of land between Clewer Mill Stream and the main channel of the Thames is a meadow called The Rays which has been used for horse racing meetings since 1866. It is now the site of Royal Windsor Racecourse. The upstream part of Clewer Mill Stream from Bush Ait forms the entrance channel to Windsor Racecourse Marina, providing a maximum draft of , but much less during drought. The downstream section, below the marina is unnavigable by powered craft except for a short reach from the mouth of the stream upstream to Clewer Boatyard. At the downstream end, just before the stream rejoins the main river Thames, is White Lilies Island.

T.), 5, boulevard Malesherbes, Paris (8e)\\" History The airline was founded in 1949 by a group of technicians and the shipping line Chargeurs R√©unis. This was the same company which had founded the original A√©romaritime in 1934 to supplement its shipping operations around West Africa. The new postwar A√©romaritime continued under the wing of UAT until the rise of African nationalism required the creation of a more user-friendly Air Afrique, and other local companies.Davies, 1964, P. 277 Former head office of UAT On 1st May 1955, the company took over Far East subsidiary of Aigle Azur, Aigle Azur Extr√™me-Orient, and continued running routes in that livery until 1961. The fleet included three Boeing 307 Stratoliners. Operations Early in 1950 Douglas DC-4 Skymaster scheduled services were started to Dakar, Pointe Noire and Saigon. In 1951 the Dakar service was extended to Abidjan. UAT ordered the De Havilland Comet 1A and placed it in service on 19 February 1953 on certain routes to West Africa and by November 1953 the Comets were serving Johannesburg. In September 1954 the first of a fleet of Nord Noratlas aircraft was put into service and in 1955 the Douglas DC-6 replaced the Comets after their problems with BOAC.Davies P.277 UAT ran services under contract to the International Control Commission, linking Saigon, Phnom Penh, Vientiane and Hanoi, with: F-BELU, F-BELX & F-BHHR.

It is commonly found in large numbers in fresh to brackish estuarine environments. It feeds on tiny crustaceans, mosquito larvae, small worms, and mollusks. It can reach up to 62 mm (2.44 inches). Description Coloration: Body not barred (Hubbs et al. 1991). Back silvery to light green, with a narrow, dark middorsal stripe. Scales on sides outlined in melanophores, creating cross-hatched pattern, which is especially prominent in breeding males. Forward and upper surfaces of the head speckled with melanophores, which also extend onto the underside of the lower jaw. Belly and undersides of body are silver. Fins generally lack pigmentation, except for some melanophores along the rays. In breeding males, dorsal fin has a black anterior blotch and dark marginal and basal bands that may include orange pigmentation. Caudal, anal, and pelvic fins red to orange, with black marginal bands (Gunter 1950; Simpson and Gunter 1956; Ross 2001). Counts: 10+ dorsal fin rays; 8-13 scale rows from pelvic origin to isthmus; 30 or fewer longitudinal scale rows (Hubbs et al. 1991); 27 (26-28) lateral scales; 11 (9-13) dorsal fin rays; 13 (12-14) pectoral fin rays; 6 (4-7) pelvic fin rays; 9 (8-13) anal fin rays; 16 (15- 18) caudal fin rays; 8 (5-9) gill rakers on 1st arch (Sublette et al. 1990). Body shape: Body deep, rather compressed; head flattened above, tapering to vertically rounded, blunt snout (Hardy 1978). Body depth contained four times in standard length (Hubbs et al. 1991). Body axis straight (Sublette et al. 1990). Mouth position: Supraterminal, oblique; mouth small; obliquely sloped, protruding lower jaw (Sublette et al. 1990). External morphology: Distance from origin of dorsal fin to end of hypural plate more than distance from origin of dorsal fin to preopercle (Hubbs et al. 1991); dorsal and caudal fins rounded; pectorals, pelvic, anal fins rounded at apex (Sublette et al. 1990). Males develop prickly contact organs on top and sides of head and on side of body between dorsal and anal fin bases (Foster 1967; Collette 1977). Female with membranous sheath surrounding genital opening (Sublette et al. 1990). Internal morphology: Teeth conical and simple (Hubbs et al. 1991). Premaxillary and mandibular teeth uniserial or irregular, occasionally with a few strong inner teeth (Sublette et al. 1990). Diet Simpson and Gunter (1956) and Harrington and Harrington (1961) reported diet items including larval crustaceans (mainly cyclopoid and harpacticoid copepods), mosquito larvae, small worms, and mollusks. Harrington and Harrington (1961) noted that the species heavily predates both larvae and pupae of saltmarsh mosquitoes. Habitat Found in salt marshes, bays, and lagoons from Cape Cod, Massachusetts to Tampico, Mexico (Duggins 1980a); common in freshwaters of St. John's River system, Florida (Burgess 1977), and Rio Grande and Pecos River in Texas and New Mexico (Duggins 1980a). Lucania parva is a schooling species (Hardy 1978). Reproduction and life cycle Spawning season: In Texas, females began ripening in February, and a few were gravid in July; peak spawning in May and June (males displayed breeding coloration from February into June, or July, with greatest color intensity in May; Gunter 1950); may occur in earlier in the spring (Simpson and Gunter 1956). Sublette et al. (1990) reports spawning in New Mexico from spring ‚Äì fall, at least in southern portion of state. Spawning location: During spawning, male and female swim into vegetation with fine leaves; there eggs are released and fertilized; eggs have mucous threads with which they are attached to plant material (Foster 1967). McLane (1955) noted that male courtship behavior was observed near clumps of Naias and Vallisneria. Reproductive strategy: A courting male swims in loops slightly below the female, waiting for the female to respond by stopping; after a female stops, the male moves under her flicking his head against her throat; pair moves slowly toward surface of the water, while male continues to rub his head against underside of the female; when they are near surface, female swims into vegetation having fine leaves or algal masses, and the male follows; using his dorsal and anal fins, the male then clasps female, and eggs are released and fertilized (Foster 1967). Fecundity: 7-46 ripe ova (mean 24.5 per fish) plus numerous smaller ova (McLane 1955); maximum reported count 104 (Hildebrand and Schroeder 1928; Hardy 1978). Freshly laid eggs are spherical, nearly colorless, having chorionic threads; live eggs averaging 1.23 mm in diameter; eggs hatch in 6 days at water temperature of 23.9 degrees C (Foster 1967). More than one brood may be produced per year by a single female (Hardy 1978). Distribution Native to coastal waters from Massachusetts to Tampico, Mexico (Hubbs et al. 1991). Introduced into California, Nevada, Oregon, and Utah (Hubbs and Miller 1965). Locally abundant in lower Pecos River drainage, New Mexico, not ascending tributary streams far above mouth (Cowley and Sublette 1987). Species description and etymology The rainwater killifish was formalle described by Spencer Fullerton Baird and Charles Fr√©d√©ric Girard as Cyprinodon parvus with the type locality given as Beesley's Point, New Jersey and as Greenport, Long Island, New York. The name of the genus, Lucania, is a Native American word from an unknown language and of unknown meaning which presumably Girard liked the sound of. Girard named this species as the type species of the genus Lucania in 1859 but using the junior synonym Limia venusta. The specific name is Latin for \\"small\\".

A full review by the magazine in 1992 criticized Team Yankees lack of infantry (making the machines guns useless) or air power (despite the aircraft on the box art).

In February 2006 his play Steam performed to sold out houses and positive reviews at the White Bear Theatre. The play was revived the following year at the Barons Court Theatre where it did equally well. In April 2007 his play Rupture opened at the Kings Head Theatre, and in January 2008 his follow- up was Counterfeit Skin. The play starred Jamie Kristian, the son of New Seekers singer Marty Kristian, and Chris Grezo, and became one of the fastest selling shows at London's Courtyard Theatre. The play was revived there six months later with a cast including Garry Jenkins, Charlie Hollway and Gil Sutherland. Estranged, the first play Charles wrote, received its premiere at the same theatre in 2009 and starred Harry Macqueen in his first stage role after leaving drama school. Charles then adapted one of his unpublished novels for his next production, Beyond Flesh and Blood, a dark psychological piece that opened at London‚Äôs Tabard Theatre just one month after Estranged closed. In February 2014 Brett Garland staged a revival of \\"Estranged\\" at the Tap Gallery Theatre in Sydney, Australia. In October 2017 his debut novel The Claws of Time was published. The following year he published a collection of his short stories and poetry entitled The Flesh of God. In 2019 he published Throne of Thorns which is a play set in 1483 about Richard III becoming King of England after the death of his brother, Edward IV. His work to date includes *Steam at the White Bear Theatre, London (2006) *Steam at the Barons Court Theatre, London (2007) *Rupture at the Kings Head Theatre, London (2007) *Counterfeit Skin at the Courtyard Theatre Studio Space, London (2008) *Counterfeit Skin at the Courtyard Theatre Main House, London (2008) *Estranged at the Courtyard Theatre Main House, London (2009) *Beyond Flesh and Blood at the Tabard Theatre, London (2009) *Estranged at the Tap Gallery Theatre, Sydney (2014) *The Claws of Time, novel (2017) *The Flesh of God, collection of short stories and poetry (2018) *Throne of Thorns, theatre play about King Richard III set in 1483 (2019) *The Human Cage, anthology of poetry (2020) Beyond Flesh and Blood, was a dark psychological study of a woman living with Dissociate Identity Disorder, exploring the themes of salvation, love, memory, sex, God and identity. Jason Charles translated and adapted the musical Better Than Sex for the London stage which opened at the Courtyard Theatre on 3 August 2010. The following month it was performed at Budapest's Pince Theatre. Estranged opened at the Tap Gallery theatre in Sydney, Australia, on 13 February 2014 for a ten night run. His novel The Claws of Time is set in 2012 and concerns the plights of a former mistress of King Richard III and a tortured female singer-songwriter. The Flesh of God is a collection of short stories and poems that centre around the themes of obsession, insanity, sexuality, and fleshly redemption. Throne of Thorns is a play set in 1483 exploring how Richard III took the throne after the death of his brother. To date it is the only play written by Jason Charles that has never been performed. The Human Cage is a collection of Jason Charles's poetry, described as abstract lyrical poems, focussing on disastrous relationships and the dark side of religion. Critical reaction =Steam= Charles' first play, Steam, received favourable reaction: \\"Charles has a strong academic background in playwriting and it shows - Steam‚Äôs structure is neat and nicely balanced, even if he occasionally struggles to get his characters on and off stage with the naturalism the set-up otherwise demands. He has a fine ear for dialogue, and for all the sex talk the play is never crass.\\" While The Spectator described it as \\"a powerful d√©but, a psychological thriller with moments of high comedy\\" =Counterfeit Skin= Charles' second play was Counterfeit Skin. Natalie Bennett at MyLondonYourLondon gave it a positive review stating: \\"It may be some time before I see a show like this on Shaftesbury Avenue, which is a pity.\\". Rainbow Network were also positive, praising the skilled writing \\"what starts out as a light comedy soon takes a dark turn - skeletons come clattering out of closets and before you know it Counterfeit Skin has become a tale of infidelity, rampant masochism and potential violence - certainly not a show for the faint hearted.\\". And BOYZ described the play as \\"so observant that it‚Äôs not a matter of identifying with one character, but with aspects of all of them. Jason Charles has created characters that are believable and tragic without allowing them to become caricatures. Overall Counterfeit Skin takes a bunch of unhealthy and destructive relationships and throws them under the microscope before picking them to pieces.\\" Another favourable reaction came from Sheila Cornelius in My Cultural Life magazine: \\"Sparkling dialogue is the trademark of Jason Charles, whose previous play ‚ÄòSteam‚Äô played to sold-out houses and rave reviews. If the first half of the play seems to be a light-hearted comedy, the second part darkens into a psychological thriller as Jake allows full rein to his fantasies, which Mach is only too happy to indulge as he increasingly falls for the handsome idler. Things escalate to breaking point as Mach realises that Jake‚Äôs commitment phobia is not about to change. After a nerve-wracking denouement, adjustments are made all round and Leo is arguably set for a future which may be bleak but is more firmly rooted in reality. \\" =Estranged= Reviews for Estranged were on the whole positive. In its four star review the Pink Paper praised the play for being a \\"sharp, snappy observation on family dysfunction, played out against frequently cringing laughs and wincing one-liners\\". Phil Willmott for Rainbow Network praised Charles' writing technique noting that \\"Jason Charles is an obviously talented writer. He has the rare ability to detonate the scenarios he sets up in funny and engaging ways. His last play, Counterfeit Skin, was a top seller at this same venue and I always look forward to seeing his work. He‚Äôs also a romantic at heart and you always leave one of his plays with a belief in the redemptive power of love, even when it eludes the central characters.\\" While Extra Extra recommended the play as a fun night out \\"Jason Charles has successfully created six individual characters with such different motives, backgrounds and relationships that it is astonishing how much we are able to learn about each character in such a short period of time. Just like some of the outlandish characters, this play was a lot of fun. It was funny yet tense and touched upon some incredibly important issues such as being tied down by family and needing to desperately be free. For a night when you want to get away from your own family problems, Estranged can show you a family that is bound to be more dysfunctional than your own.\\" QX Magazine gave the play a 4 star rating describing it as \\"unaccountably satisfying\\" and enjoying the \\"killer one- liners\\" and the Islington Gazette enthused that the play is \\"bursting with talent\\" and that \\"Jason Charles turns the microscope on the fear and the inner turmoil of his characters and just like the cast he is fresh on the London stage.\\" In February 2014 the play was enjoyed by an Australian audience at Sydney's Tap Gallery theatre - \\"The plot twists in Estranged make the family dramas of Dallas look like the Brady Bunch. Nothing is sacred, and it makes for very entertaining theatre. A fun night out, try not to miss this.\\" =Beyond Flesh and Blood= Richard Langton from the Chiswick Times praised Beyond Flesh and Blood which he described as a \\"play of ideas.\\" He recommended that the audience: \\"Expect the unexpected, leave some prejudices behind and you'll have a rewarding eighty minutes.\\" References Category:British dramatists and playwrights Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:Writers from London Category:English male dramatists and playwrights ","title":"Jason Charles"},{"id":"18191950","text":"Christine Kozlowski is an American beauty pageant titleholder who was crowned Miss Mississippi on June 28, 2008.

But while they are highly diverse, they are not particularly speciose, with nearly 20 described and a few undescribed species compared to the more than 150 Hawaiian species of Proterhinus of the Aglycyderini. The fossil record shows that the three Oxycoryninae tribes were well distinct by the mid-Paleogene, about 50 million years ago (mya). The belids as a whole are of Jurassic origin, and the Oxycorynini must thus have evolved in the Late Cretaceous or perhaps Paleocene, roughly some 100-60 mya.Marvaldi et al. (2006), Ming et al. (2006) Description The adult Oxycorynini have a number of fairly characteristic traits, but they are not present in all members of this tribe. Many have a pronotum whose hind margin is at least as wide as the elytra bases, often wider. Except in the rather primitive Oxycraspedus, the first tarsomere is smaller than the second, and microscopically the lack of spermatheca, with the spermathecal duct directly inserting on the common oviduct, is conspicuous. Adults of Parallocorynus and Rhopalotria are peculiarly soft-bodied and possess several characteristic traits: their gular sutures are fused to a single suture, their elytra cannot be locked in open position and have round tips between which the pygidium can be seen. The sternite of their mesothorax slants forward, but the part protruding between the second leg pair is not raised. Finally, their spermathecal gland and spermathecal duct form a common tube. Alloxycorynus and Hydnorobius adults have two gular sutures which form a semicircle at the head base and end in distinct tips; their elytra are ribbed lengthwise. Adults of Balanophorobius and Oxycorynus have a flattened hindside of the metathoracal sternite. More characteristic are the larvae. Their labrum has two sensilla at the base and two more towards the center of the forward maring. They have a typical body shape with recurved hindparts; the anus opens on the underside. Except in Oxycraspedus, the dark forehead is bordered by a ridge towards the back, where the cuticle attaches, and the body is widest in the middle of the abdomen. And of course, Oxycorynini larvae differ from other belids in that their larvae do not feed on dead or decaying wood but on flowers and fruits. Systematics The Oxycorynini are tentatively divided into 3 subtribes: Oxycraspedina * Oxycraspedus Allocorynina * Parallocorynus * Rhopalotria Oxycorynina * Hydnorobius * Alloxycorynus * Oxycorynus * Balanophorobius However, most of this subdivision, in particular the monophyly of the Oxycorynina, is by no means reliably established. Oxycraspedus seems to be simply a very basal genus. What seems probable is that Parallocorynus and Rhopalotria as well as Balanophorobius and Oxycorynus are sister genera, with the other genera are of rather uncertain position in regard to these two clades. But while the Allocorynina are quite surely a good clade, the biogeography of the Oxycorynina is puzzling, because Balanophorobius does not occur anywhere near its presumed sister taxon Oxycorynus, which instead ranges adjacent to the other two members of the proposed subtribe. Neither are all species of Oxycorynini discovered yet, nor is the knowledge about their distribution considered satisfactory by entomologists. Distribution Oxycraspedus, apparently the most ancient living genus of Oxycorynini, has three described species limited to Chile between the Maule and Araucan√≠a Regions and adjacent Argentina where they have been found in Neuqu√©n Province. Parallocorynus with one and Rhopalotria with three described species - several undescribed species are known in each genus - occur across Central America and in some adjacent regions. The former only occurs in Mexico and Honduras, while the latter is widespread from Mexico to Panama, also occurring on Cuba and in Florida, and probably in northern South America too. The two Alloxycorynus species are found from southern Peru (Cusco Region) to eastern Bolivia and northern Argentina. Hydnorobius with three species occurs to the southeast of Alloxycorynus south to central Argentina (Mendoza to Buenos Aires Provinces). Oxycorynus occurs with 5 known species northwards of Hydnorobius, from northern Argentina and southern Bolivia north into Brazil (Santa Catarina state). The monotypic Balanophorobius, described only in 2005, has not yet been found outside the Osa Peninsula of Costa Rica. Ecology Oxycraspedus utilizes the cones of the Monkey-puzzle tree (Araucaria araucana). Adults seek shelter in the cones - usually female one but occasionally male ones too - and larvae feed on the parenchymatous tissue but not the seeds. Indeed, by the time the larvae have finished their development to pupation, the host cones are typically already discarded by the plant and have shed their seeds. Very old cones that are slowly rotting on the forest floor are also taken, demonstrating the evolutionary link between Oxycorynini and the other Belidae which also feed on decaying woody tissue, but of twigs and stems. Parallocorynus has to date only been collected from the cycad genus Dioon. Similarly Rhopalotria is associated with various species of Zamia cycads, though one of the as yet undescribed species was collected from Dioon spinulosum. It seems that the species of Rhopalotria are monophagous - like R. slossoni on Coontie (Z. pumila) or R. mollis on Cardboard Cycad (Z. furfuracea) - but more research in Zamia species in necessary to verify this. These two belid genera are very important pollinators of their host cycads; the larvae feed primarily on the sporophylls. Alloxycorynus, Balanophorobius, Oxycorynus have been recorded from Balanophoraceae. Specific beetle-plant association are A. bruchi with Ombrophytum,Probably O. subterraneum; originally given as O. peruanum (a lapsus for O. peruvianum) the location given is outside that species' range: Marvaldi et al. (2006). and O. nigripes and O. armatus with Lophophytum. B. gamezi was apparently collected from Helosis cayennensis. Hydnorobius larvae are recorded from flowers and fruits of Prosopanche (Hydnoraceae). P. americana is host to H. hydnorae and H. helleri; H. parvulus is found on P. bonacinae. Balanophoraceae and Hydnoraceae are root parasitic rather primitive dicots but not closely related. Possibly, the Oxycorynini which feed on them shifted to these plants from the ones parasitized. It is likely that the initial host switch was to Balanophoraceae, but these parasitize a wide range of trees so little more can be said at present. =Gallery of Oxycorynini host plants= Image:Araucaria araucana cones.jpgFemale cones of Monkey-puzzle (Araucaria araucana) Image:Dioon spinulosum 2.jpgDioon spinulosum Image:Lophophytum+Sarcophyte sp vMH373.jpgLeft: Lophophytum mirabile Image:ProsopancheAmericanaCatamarcaArgentinaMusselman.jpgProsopanche americana inflorescence Footnotes References * (2006): Phylogeny of the Oxycoryninae sensu lato (Coleoptera: Belidae) and evolution of host-plant associations.

The Artificial Passenger is equipped to engage a vehicle operator by carrying on conversations, playing verbal games, controlling the vehicle's stereo system, and so on. It also monitors the driver's speech patterns to detect fatigue, and in response can suggest that the driver take a break or get some sleep.The New York Times, December 27, 2001. A passenger whose chatter is always appreciated by A. Eisenberg. Retrieved on June 29, 2008Kanevsky, D., Telematics: Artificial Passenger and beyond, Human Factors and Voice Interactive Systems, Signals and Communications Technology Series, Springer US, pp. 291-325. https://doi.org/10.1007%2F978-0-387-68439-0_10 The Artificial Passenger may also be integrated with wireless services to provide weather and road information, driving directions, and other such notifications systems. Voice control interface According to Dimitri Kanevsky, a former IBM researcher, currently at Google, The Artificial Passenger was developed using the Conversational Interactivity for Telematics (CIT) speech system which counts on the driver's natural speech instead of the use of hands. The CIT relies on a Natural Language Understanding (NLU) system that is difficult to develop because of the low-powered computer systems available inside cars. IBM suggests that this system be located on a server and accessed through the cars' wireless technologies. IBM also says they are working on a \\"quasi-NLU\\" that uses fewer resources from the CPU and can be used inside the car. The CIT system includes another system called the Dialog Manager (DM). The DM takes the load of the NLU system by interacting with the vehicle, the driver, and external systems such as weather systems, email, telephones and more. The NLU system receives a voice command from the driver and looks through a file system to come up with an action to be performed and executes that action. The DM works with questions asked by the driver such as \\"How far is The Gallatin Field Airport from here?\\" The NLU system will still not be able to understand everything a driver says. Reasons for that are the different idioms and dialects of different regions. IBM is working on developing a system that recognizes where the driver is and acknowledge the regional diction used in that area. Another system used within this technology is the Learning Transformation (LT) system which monitors the actions of the occupants of the car and of the cars around it, learns patterns within the driver's speech and store that data, and learns from such data to try to improve the performance of the technology as a whole. Speech recognition The speech recognition process relies on three steps. The front-end filters out any unwanted noise such as noise from the car, background music, or background passengers. It gets rid of all low energy and high variability signal being recognized. The labeler breaks apart the speech and searches in a data base to recognize what is being said. It starts broad by seeing what subject the driver is speaking of. Then goes into more details of what the driver is truly asking. The decoder next takes all this information and formulates a response to the driver. IBM states through much experimentation that the speech recognition is very accurate but the process has not fully been refined and still has kinks with in it. The main part of the Artificial Passenger is the disruptive speech recognition. This technology keeps a conversation with the driver and analyzes what the driver is saying and how s/he is saying it. It can recognize fluctuations in the driver's voice to determine if the driver is sleepy, upset, or in a good mood through different vibration patterns in the driver's speech. It also record the time it takes for a driver to respond in the conversation and from that determine if the driver is nodding off or being distracted by something. Driver drowsiness prevention When the computer recognizes that the driver is dozing off, it sends a signal to interfere. The computer will step in by changing the radio, trying to play games with the driver, or by opening window to wake the driver up. The computer wants to improve their alertness by doing these. If it finds that the driver is nodding off over and over, the computer system is programmed to ask to call a nearby hotel and book a room or suggest the driver take a break. The Artificial Passenger will try to read jokes, play games, ask questions or read interactive books to stimulate the driver. Drivers that show more drowsiness will be given content that is more stimulating than a driver who is not as drowsy. Distributive user interface between cars IBM recognizes that there are more dangers to a driver than him/herself. Artificial Passenger is proposed to work between cars by relaying information to one another. The information could include driving records to show if they have a history of being a bad driver or on-time analysis of all drivers to show which ones are becoming drowsy and can interfere through this information. It can also show if a driver is being distracted by games or wireless devices and interfere with all surrounding drivers.

Shooting spree In the evening of 9 February 2002 29-year-old Bulelani Vukwana, who worked as a security guard for Gray Security Services, arrived at the home of his girlfriend Noluvuyo Mbenya, who apparently had ended their relationship earlier, to persuade her to come back to him. As she refused to see him, enraged Vukwana went to a nearby shebeen, arriving there at about 8:30pm, and wounded the owner Nosisi Skweyiya, by shooting her in the buttocks when she opened the door.

Vukwana promised Mrs. Phantsi he would not kill her, but forced her to go to the shebeen to look for someone who he believed had been interfering in his relationship with Noluvuyo, but when no one opened they went back to her car, where he dragged out the body and demanded Phantsi's gun and mobile phone. With his newly obtained pistol the gunman sped off in Phantsis' pick-up truck, driving to Ma Radebe's shebeen about 50 meters from the Mbenya home, where he killed one man, injured another person and finally started shooting randomly at motorists and pedestrians killing several people including the driver of a passing car and two passengers in another.

Rana, and was intended to be a rival organisation to the British Committee of the Indian National Congress that was the main avenue of the loyalist opinion at the time. Founded on 18 February 1905, the IHRS was a metropolitan organisation modelled after Victorian public institutions of the time. It had a written constitution and the stated aims to \\"secure Home Rule for India, and to carry on a genuine Indian propaganda in this country by all practicable means\\". The IHRS was open for membership \\"to Indians only\\", and found significant support amongst Indian students and other Indian populations in Britain. It recruited from amongst young Indian activists, collected money, and may have been collecting arms and maintaining close contact with revolutionary movements in India. The society was foundations of the India House and, along with Krishna Varma's journal The Indian Sociologist, was the foundation of the militant Indian nationalist movement in Britain. After Krishna Varma's shift to Paris in 1907, the society gave way the secret nationalist society of Abhinav Bharat Mandal, founded by V.D. Savarkar.

The highway runs from MD 107 in Poolesville north to MD 355 in Hyattstown. MD 109 connects the northwestern Montgomery County communities of Poolesville, Beallsville, Barnesville, and Hyattstown with each other and with Interstate 270 (I-270). The highway was built between Beallsville and Barnesville by 1910. MD 109 was extended to Poolesville in the early 1920s and to Comus in the late 1920s. The route was extended north through its early 1950s interchange with I-270 to Hyattstown in the late 1950s. Route description View north along MD 109 at Comus Road in Comus MD 109 begins at the intersection of Elgin Road and Fisher Avenue in the town of Poolesville. The intersection also serves as the western terminus of MD 107, which heads east along Fisher Avenue through the Poolesville Historic District. MD 109 heads north along two-lane undivided Elgin Road, which becomes Beallsville Road when it leaves the town. The highway passes by the historic homes Chiswell's Inheritance and Dowden's Luck before passing through the village of Beallsville, where the route intersects MD 28 (Darnestown Road). MD 109 continues northeast and passes under CSX's Metropolitan Subdivision south of Barnesville; next to the railroad bridge is the Barnesville station serving MARC's Brunswick Line. The highway continues through the town of Barnesville, where the route turns east onto Barnesville Road then north onto Old Hundred Road. MD 109 crosses a branch of the Little Monocacy River and intersects Comus Road in the hamlet of Comus; Comus Road leads west to Sugarloaf Mountain. The highway veers east at the Montgomery-Frederick county line, which the route briefly follows, and meets I-270 (Eisenhower Memorial Highway) at a partial cloverleaf interchange. MD 109 closely parallels Little Bennett Creek and crosses it within the interchange. The highway reaches its eastern terminus at MD 355 (Frederick Road) in the village of Hyattstown, a short distance south of MD 355's intersection with MD 75 (Green Valley Road) on the opposite side of the county line. History The first segment of the highway that became MD 109 was constructed as a macadam road by Montgomery County with state aid by 1910. The modern road was built from the southern edge of Beallsville to the center of Barnesville. As of 1910, the improved road was proposed to be extended to Poolesville; however, the Beallsville-Poolesville segment of the macadam road was not completed until 1923. The highway was extended north from Barnesville to Comus in two sections. The first segment was built in 1925 and 1926; the road was completed to Comus in 1927 and 1928. A disjoint segment of MD 109 was built as a concrete road along Westerly Road between Edwards Ferry Road and Willard Road on the southern edge of Poolesville in 1929 and 1930. The county highway between MD 95 at Comus and U.S. Route 240 (now MD 355) at Hyattstown was reconstructed as a macadam road by the Maryland State Roads Commission between 1936 and 1938. MD 109's bridge across Little Bennett Creek and its interchange with Washington National Pike (now I-270) were constructed between 1951 and 1953.

More recently he has been prominent as a cricket administrator, serving as president of Somerset County Cricket Club from 2004 to 2015. Early career Kerslake was a middle to lower order right-handed batsman and a right-arm off-break bowler. Educated at Kingswood School, Bath, where he topped the batting and bowling averages in 1961, he played for Somerset's second eleven in the Minor Counties that season, being part of the team that won the Minor Counties Championship for the first time. He batted in the middle order and took 16 wickets for less than seven runs each. In 1962, he was at Cambridge, but made little impression in three first-class matches for the university. In August of the same year, he played for Somerset's first team in six matches as a middle-order batsman, but did not bowl. Regular player The following season, he played regularly for Cambridge and won his blue. He headed the Cambridge bowling averages with 26 wickets at a cost of only 13.30 each and made 259 runs in the lower order, without reaching 50. In the second half of the season, he played again for Somerset, making only a few runs and failing to take a single wicket as the county relied for off-spin on the established Brian Langford. The 1964 season was Kerslake's best in first-class cricket. The honorary secretary at Cambridge (and captain in one match in the absence of regular captain Mike Brearley), he finished second in both batting and bowling averages, with 576 runs at 32 runs per innings and 36 wickets. Against the Australians he featured in an eighth wicket stand of 109 in 85 minutes. Against Surrey at The Oval he made 80, which remained the highest score of his career. His career- best bowling performance was also for Cambridge University in this season: six for 77 against Worcestershire in the first first-class match ever played at Halesowen. In the second half of the 1964 season, Kerslake again appeared regularly for Somerset. His batting was not successful, but he took 39 wickets with his off-spin, including his best county return, six for 83 against Hampshire at Bournemouth. His full season figures were 757 runs and 75 wickets. Somerset captain After the 1964 season, Kerslake went into legal practice and did not play first-class cricket at all in the following three seasons. In 1968, however, following the retirement as Somerset captain of Colin Atkinson, Kerslake reappeared as captain of the side. With the side in transition, it was not an easy appointment, and an injury before the start of the season did not help, as he was able to play in only one of the opening six matches. Thereafter, Wisden wrote, \\"it seemed his innate modesty prevented him from developing his skills to the full. His brilliant fielding never wavered, but his batting and bowling, both of value on occasions, were not given full rein.\\" The Somerset cricket historian David Foot wrote: \\"It simply wasn't in his nature to parade his skills when there were more experienced county cricketers around.\\" The statistics support these opinions. Kerslake made 525 runs at an average of exactly 15 runs per innings, with just one innings over 50, and he bowled fewer than 40 overs, taking only six wickets. In 24 matches, however, he held 34 catches. Somerset's early dismissal from the Gillette Cup that season, while Kerslake was injured, meant that he never played one-day cricket. At the end of the season, he returned to the law and did not play first-class cricket for the county side again. Later career Kerslake continued to play Minor Counties cricket for Somerset's second eleven until the late 1970s and twice, in 1974 and 1976, was picked for the Minor Counties representative side against the touring team. In more recent years, he has been involved in administrative roles in Somerset cricket as chairman of cricket and latterly as president. He was, according to Foot, a highly influential figure in Somerset's years of success in the early 1980s and a \\"father confessor\\" figure to the top players. In his professional life, he is now a consultant on probate and tax issues to the legal company Clarke Willmott, based in the Taunton office.

The highway was constructed from MD 124 to MD 28 in the late 1920s and early 1930s. Route description View west along MD 115 at Avery Road in Redland MD 115 begins at an intersection with MD 124 (Woodfield Road) adjacent to the industrial area surrounding the Montgomery County Airpark near the unincorporated area of Redland. The west leg of the intersection is county- maintained Snouffer School Road, which heads toward Montgomery Village. MD 115 begins as a four-lane divided highway but rapidly reduces to a two-lane undivided road as it head southeast toward the center of Redland. The highway temporarily widens as it passes a large church. MD 115 expands to a four-lane divided highway just west of its intersection with Shady Grove Road and Airpark Road. The highway becomes undivided and reaches the center of Redland at its intersection with Redland Road and Muncaster Road. MD 115 drops to two lanes with a center left-turn lane, which disappears just west of another large church. East of Redland Middle School, the highway crosses Rock Creek and passes Colonel Zadok A. Magruder High School. Southeast of the high school, MD 115 crosses over MD 200 (Intercounty Connector) and the parallel ICC Trail. The highway and the freeway are connected by a pair of emergency ramps; the southern ramp connects MD 115 with the hiker-biker trail that parallels the freeway. MD 115 crosses the North Branch of Rock Creek on its way to Norbeck, where the highway intersects MD 28 (Norbeck Road) just west of MD 28's intersection with MD 97 (Georgia Avenue). MD 115 continues a very short distance beyond the MD 28 intersection to its terminus at MD 655 (Old MD 28), which is an L-shaped service road that parallels MD 28 and MD 97. History The first segment of MD 115 was a macadam road built from MD 124 to Redland Road in 1928. This segment was extended east to Rock Creek in 1929 and 1930. In addition, a separate portion of MD 115 was constructed as a macadam road from MD 28 at Norbeck west to Emory Lane near the North Branch of Rock Creek. The eastern and western segments were unified between 1931 and 1933. MD 28 was relocated and expanded to a divided highway at Norbeck in 1983; however, MD 115's eastern terminus remained old MD 28. MD 115 was expanded to a four-lane divided highway at its western terminus in 1991 and at the intersection with Shady Grove Road and Airpark Road by 1999.

Human trafficking and Child prostitution are problems in the country. Prostitutes are known locally as \\"motyo\\". UNAIDS estimate there to be 2,228 prostitutes in the country. Although prostitution is illegal, the country issues temporary work permits to migrant prostitutes travelling through Suriname en route to another country. Prostitutes often rent rooms in hotels and attract clients in the hotel's bar or outside the hotel. Law enforcement Prostitution is generally tolerated and the laws forbidding it are not enforced. Laws that tend to be enforced, at least to some degree, are those prohibiting human trafficking, child prostitution and soliciting outside unofficially tolerated areas. Brothels are usually tolerated unless there is trouble or if women are working there against their will. Police regularly visit the brothels and may act as intermediaries in disputes between the prostitutes and brothel owners. The police sometimes work as 'advisors' to the brothels and assist in getting work visas for the women. Red-light districts In the capital Paramaribo, the red-light district is located in the area of Watermolenstraat, Timmermanstraat, Hoek Hogestraat, Zwartenhovenbrugstraat and Crommelinstraat. These streets are known for their street walkers. The sex workers, mainly from Guyana are fully visible and practice their work relatively undisturbed. Gold Mining In the interior of Suriname there are a number of official and unofficial gold mines. A lot of men work at the mines, especially Brazilians. In the mining areas there are a large number of prostitutes to service the needs of the miners. There are many foreign women who come to work in the gold fields (Brazilians, Dominicans, Guyanese and French) as well as native Surinamese prostitutes. Brazilian prostitutes can earn three times the amount in the mining area than they can at home. Some women will take payment in gold nuggets. There is evidence of Child prostitution in the area. Prostitutes generally live in \\"women's camps\\", a series of huts, near the mining camps where the women live and receive their clients. There are also some bars around the mining camps, the prostitutes in these bars are generally recruited and employed by the owner. Some miners have a prostitute as a \\"temporary wives\\" for a period of 3 months. The women look after the miner's domestic needs as well as their sexual ones. This arrangement is usually made through a mining foreman who recruits and pays women from Brazil in return for 10% of the miner's wages. In 2011, the government introduced a scheme to register all workers in the mining areas, including sex workers. The object was to enable the government to collect taxes from the workers. Sex Trafficking Suriname is principally a destination and transit country for men, women, and children trafficked transnationally for the purposes of commercial sexual exploitation and forced labor. It is also a source country for underage Surinamese girls, and increasingly boys, trafficked internally for sexual exploitation. Some of these children are trafficked into the sex trade surrounding gold mining camps in the country's interior. Foreign girls and women from Guyana, Brazil, the Dominican Republic, and Colombia are trafficked into Suriname for commercial sexual exploitation; some transit Suriname en route to Europe. According to 'Trafficking in Persons Report' , Some Chinese women engage in prostitution in massage parlors and brothels in Suriname. The United States Department of State Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons ranks Suriname as a 'Tier 2 Watch List' country. References External links *Wide Angle . Dying to Leave .

Through his becoming the Leader of the Dublin Nazi chapter, and later broadcasting propaganda from Germany, he became a highly controversial figure in twentieth-century Irish history, and was not allowed to return to his job after the war. Life =Early life= Mahr was born in May 1887 in Trent in the southern reaches of the Habsburg Empire. His father, Gustav Johann Mahr, and grandfather, Franz Anton Mahr (1830‚Äì1891), were military bandmasters and well-known composers. His mother, Maria Antonia Schroll, like his father, was a German from the Sudetenland. Mahr was brought up as a Roman Catholic, later becoming an atheist, and later still (at least nominally) Protestant. =Early career and university= Mahr served in the Austrian Army in 1906, attaining the rank of lieutenant, and then studied geography and prehistory at the University of Vienna, where he also sustained a long-term arm injury while duelling. =Professional career= Mahr went to work for a museum in Linz, Austria's third city, and then the Natural History and Prehistoric Museum of Vienna, where he rose to the ranks of curator and deputy director of a section. His excavation work included early exploration of the salt mine and Iron Age Celtic cemetery at Hallstatt. Mahr arrived in Ireland in 1927 to work as Senior Keeper of (Irish) Antiquities in the National Museum of Ireland in Dublin, succeeding Walther Bremer. Mahr implemented the recommendations of Professor Nils Lithberg on reorganisation of the collections, and otherwise worked to bring order to the museum's holdings. One of his key achievements was the production of a card index of excavations and finds, and he also drove a return to active archaeological dig work, after an interval of decades. In 1934 √âamon de Valera appointed Mahr as the director of the museum, for which he built an international reputation through creativity and dedication. de Valera was so impressed with his commitment that he wrote him a personal cheque for one excavation project, in Drimnagh, Dublin, for what was then a considerable sum. During a stay for an archaeology congress in Berlin and family visit to Austria, on September 1, 1939, he was kept by Nazi Germany (\\"Heim ins Reich\\") (the ship did not leave the harbourpersonal communication of Mahr's daughter Hilde) due to the outbreak of the war, and could not return to his directorship, from which he took a leave of absence. At the time, he still expected to be back in Dublin by early 1940. =Nazi activities= As the Nazi Party rose to power in Germany in the 1930s, Mahr had joined in 1933 and became the Local Group Leader (Ortsgruppenleiter) of the official Nazi Party in Ireland - the Auslandsorganisation (NSDAP-AO). During his spell as Nazi leader he recruited roughly 23 Germans. Later, Mahr was arrested and (falsely) accused of being a Nazi spy, using his position as Director of the National Museum to plan Hitler's invasion of Ireland. After his release, Mahr tried to return to his director‚Äôs position in Ireland, but was not allowed to do so. =Late life= Mahr sought to return to his directorship, and the Taoiseach was originally in favour, given his achievements, but there was opposition from the Head of Military Intelligence, and a vocal TD. In the end, Mahr was left in Germany, but given some pension, and derived some income from occasional lectures. He died of heart failure in Bonn while preparing for a new job, on 27 May 1951. Family In 1921 Mahr married Maria van Bemmelen (1901-1975), daughter of the Dutch university professor and zoologist . They had four children, two born in Ireland, and all were raised in Dublin in the 1930s but stranded in Germany or German-occupied Austria in September 1939 and were unable to travel back to Ireland, eventually ended up settling down in post-war (West) Germany. His marriage deteriorated from 1941. One daughter (Ingrid) later moved back to Ireland for a time. The eldest daughter, Hilde, is the subject of Chapter 7, ‚ÄúHilde‚Äôs Journey 1945‚Äù, in Mullin‚Äôs book. It describes how the 18-year old girl, in the attempt to re-unite her parents, \\"comes through a defeated Germany, a land in ruins, to safety.\\" From the prologue: \\"History has known few more terrifying places than Berlin in April 1945. [...] the city was under such heavy attack [...] that hospital officials were no longer able to keep count of the dead. [...] Perhaps the cruellest twist was the German government‚Äôs decree that any civilian leaving the city would be considered ‚Äòdefeatist‚Äô, a crime that was punishable by death. [...] Into this appalling scene, stepping over dead people and horses, and the rubble of Berlin‚Äôs once-magnificent buildings, came Hilde Mahr, an eighteen-year-old from Dublin. Dismissed from a labour camp north-east of the city the day before, she had arrived in the German capital at 2.30 a.m. on 17 April, in the aftermath of yet another air raid. Standing in the blazing chaos of this strange place, she pondered her next move. She knew Ireland better than she knew Germany, the English language better than the German one; and recognised Berlin hardly at all.\\" (Mullins, 2007) References Further reading * * Gerry Mullins: ‚ÄúThe Mahrs of Dublin‚Äù.

Prostitution law is antiquated and dates from the colonial era. Law enforcement is inconsistent and sex workers report violence and abuse by the police. Many turn to prostitution for economic reasons and the lack of other job opportunities. Prostitution continues to receive greater public attention due to the high incidence of HIV/AIDS among prostitutes.2008 Human Rights Report: Guyana. State.gov (25 February 2009). Retrieved on 2011-03-30. Prostitution in the country is separated into three types: \\"uptown\\", servicing affluent clients, \\"downtown\\", servicing the working classes, and mining sites. UNAIDS estimate there to be 6,000 prostitutes in the country. Prostitutes often rent rooms in hotels and attract clients in the hotel's bar or outside the hotel. Dancers in lap dancing and striptease establishments sometimes offer sexual services as a sideline. In the capital, Georgetown, prostitutes sometimes visit moored freighters, with the captain's permission, to service the crews. Legal situation Prostitution is not specifically prohibited by Guyanese law, but \\"common nuisance\\" in section 356 of the Criminal Law (Offences) Act of 1893 is interpreted to include prostitution. Section 357 makes it illegal to keep or manage a \\"common bawdy house\\" (brothel) The Combating Trafficking of Persons Act of 2005 prohibits all forms of trafficking and prescribes sufficiently stringent penalties ranging from three years to life imprisonment. =Calls for decriminalization= In 2014, the sex workers organisation \\"Guyana Sex Worker Coalition\\" and several NGOs called for prostitution to be legalised and regularization of sex work. The aims was to end discrimination and abuse towards sex workers and to give them full access to health services. The NGOs included Youth Challenge Guyana and the Society Against Sexual Orientation Discrimination. Mining There is a gold mining industry in the interior of Guyana. Women, often from Maroon and Amerindian villages, come to the area to service the gold miner's sexual needs. The women work in \\"kiamoos!, temporary structures of wood, zinc or tarpaulin, that consist of a series of rooms, just big enough for a bed, where the women live and entertain clients. Women from the coast also travel to the mines, usually for a two or three month period. When there is a \\"shout\\" (significant find), the number of prostitutes around that mine increases. There are also bauxite and diamond mines in the country which also attract prostitutes. However, the downturn in the bauxite industry in the early 2000s, and resulting in less employment and spending power of the men, led to a large decline in the number if sex workers around these mines. There is evidence of women being trafficked to work as prostitutes at the mines HIV HIV is a problem in the country, however due to the efforts of the Guyanese government and international organisations, the situation is being controlled. The epidemic peaked in around 2006, and in 2016 it was estimated that 1.6% of the adult population were affected. Amongst other measures, including education about HIV, a condoms distribution programme has been initiated. Sex workers are a high risk group. The incidence of HIV amongst sex workers has fallen over the years: 47% in 1997, 27% in 2004, 16% in 2010 and 6.1% in 2016. Sex trafficking Guyana is a source and destination country for men, women, and children subjected to sex trafficking. Women and children from Guyana, Brazil, the Dominican Republic, Suriname, and Venezuela are subjected to sex trafficking in mining communities in the interior and urban areas. While sex trafficking occurs in interior mining communities, limited government presence in the country's interior renders the full extent of trafficking unknown. Children are particularly vulnerable to sex trafficking. Guyanese nationals are subjected to sex trafficking in Jamaica, Suriname, and other Caribbean countries. Some police officers are complicit in trafficking crimes, and corruption impedes anti-trafficking efforts. In 2017, the United States Department of State Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons upgraded Guyana from a Tier 2 country to Tier 1 country following the Guyanese governments increased efforts to combat human trafficking.

It stars Brad Johnson, Keith Scaduto, Brad Greenquist, Wendy Carter, Gabriel Womack, and Billy Drago. The film aired on the Sci Fi Channel on June 28, 2008 and the sister company from Universal Pictures. Plot The film begins with an outlaw named Wild Bill (Brad Johnson) riding onto an apparent battlefield, he finds an elderly Mexican who asked him \\"what happened\\" in Spanish \\"Qu√© pasa aqui?\\" he replies, \\"La Serpienta Del Diablo.\\" Bill then walks to a carriage, a woman falls out, a copperhead slithers out, and Bill shoots it with his gun. He then rides away. The Next Day, Bill arrives in a town in New Mexico. He walks into the saloon to get a drink, and asks for John Murphy. The bartender named Garrett (Brad Greenquist) tells him that Murphy is dead. After he finishes, a cowboy named Jesse (Billy Drago) demands a poker game with Bill. Jesses' men Will (Keith Scaduto), Roscoe (Gabriel Womack), and Ponce (George Zlatarev) hold Bill at gunpoint when Bill tries to tell Jesse that an swarm of highly aggressive snakes are headed straight for the town. Jesse says that if the snakes do not come they will have a gunfight, which they do. Jesse is shot in the chest. Bill is shot in the arm. Jesses' men start shooting at Bill, and Garrett, doctor Josiah (Atanas Srebrev), and blacksmith Tannen (Nick Harvey) stop them at gunpoint. Jesse is told to leave, and takes Bill's horse and rides off to Lincoln. Josiah patches Bill's arm, and they discover the horses, and Henry (Nathan Bautista) in the stable have been killed by the snakes. The snakes attack the saloon, and they kill them. They see the swarm coming from over a mountain, and Bill's horse shows up dying, and Bill shoots his horse. Bill tells Sheriff Mercer (Todd Jensen) to give all men every weapon he has in his office. Will, his girlfriend Jane (Wendy Carter), and saloon girl Darla (Violeta Markovska) put school teacher Ms. Murphy (Marta Kondova), the women and children into the bank safe for safety. Tannen introduces them to his Blacksmith shop, and shows them a Gatling gun, and a flamethrower from the war. They create a pool to corner the snakes. At night the snakes do come, and they start shooting them. Suddenly, a massive swarm shows up, Tannen is killed, and they cover in the saloon. Bill, Will, Roscoe, and Ponce go up into Murphy's room. They find blood on his bed, and his gold watch. Ponce is killed by snakes by the window. Bill, and Will discovers that Roscoe is responsible for murder of Murphy. They lock him in the room. The snakes emerges from the floor, and Darla is killed. They discover a wall (that isn't very thick enough) that leads to the hotel, and break through. Will, and Garrett go and get the dynamite from the shed in the ally, and kill a snake hiding behind the door. They kill another snake by square dancing on it. The snakes break through the window in the room, they run through the wall to the hotel for safety. Bill gives Will his gun, and Will shoots the dynamite, and destroys the snakes. In the morning, Bill, Will, Garrett, Jane, Josiah, and Mercer celebrate a drink for Murphy. Josiah realize the snakes are just babies. They encounter Roscoe (who has survived the explosion) holding a pair of guns at them. Suddenly, a giant 40 foot mother copperhead emerges from the ground and eats Roscoe. They run for the Sheriffs' office to take cover from the snake. Mercer tells them to tie the dynamite to Jane, leave her in the street when the snake comes to eat her, kaboom!. Bill punches him and throws him in the cell and locks him in. Bill comes up with a plan to kill the snake. They run for the Blacksmith, Bill finds a length of chain, and Will finds fireplace pokers, they can use to shoot the snake with the Gatling gun. As Mercer inside the cell reaches the keys to free himself, the snake emerges from the ground, and chases Will. Bill throws the chain onto the snakes' neck. Bill finds his boots caught in the chain, and the snake drags him. Garrett starts shooting the fireplace pokers into the snakes' neck, and Jane fires a shotgun at the snakes' side. The snake almost eats Jane, and then destroys the Gatling gun with her head. Bill grabs the shotgun, shoots the snake in the back, then shoots the snake in the mouth, and kills it. Mercer comes out holding a gun and Bill's wanted poster and the snake crushes him. The Pinkertons arrive looking for Bill, and Garrett tells them a secret that Bill is Murphy. Bill tells the Pinkertons that there's some women and children lock in the bank safe inside. As the Pinkertons go inside to get the women and children out, Bill, Will, Garrett, Jane, and Josiah steal their horses. Bill rides off west, and the others ride off to Lincoln. The Pinkertons start shooting at their escapers and Ms. Murphy finds her fathers' gold watch. She turns and sees Bill on his horse in the sunset.

Bir Tawil (; , ) is a area along the border between Egypt and Sudan, which is uninhabited and claimed by neither country. When spoken of in association with the neighbouring Hala'ib Triangle, it is sometimes referred to as the Bir Tawil Triangle, despite the area's quadrilateral shape; the two \\"triangles\\" border at a quadripoint. Its terra nullius status results from a discrepancy between the straight political boundary between Egypt and Sudan established in 1899, and the irregular administrative boundary established in 1902. Egypt asserts the political boundary, and Sudan asserts the administrative boundary, with the result that the Hala'ib Triangle is claimed by both and Bir Tawil by neither. In 2014, author Alastair Bonnett described Bir Tawil as the only place on Earth that was habitable but was not claimed by any recognised government. History On 19 January 1899, an agreement between the UK and Egypt relating to the administration of the Sudan defined \\"Soudan\\" as the \\"territories south of the 22nd parallel of latitude\\". It contained a provision that would give Egypt control of the Red Sea port of Suakin, but an amendment on 10 July 1899 gave Suakin to Sudan instead. On 4 November 1902 the UK drew a separate \\"administrative boundary\\", intended to reflect the actual use of the land by the tribes in the region. Bir Tawil was grazing land used by the Ababda tribe based near Aswan, and thus was placed under Egyptian administration from Cairo. Similarly, the Hala'ib Triangle to the northeast was placed under the British governor of Sudan, because its inhabitants were culturally closer to Khartoum. Egypt claims the original border from 1899, the 22nd parallel, which would place the Hala'ib Triangle within Egypt and the Bir Tawil area within Sudan. Sudan, however, claims the administrative border of 1902, which would put Hala'ib within Sudan, and Bir Tawil within Egypt. As a result, both states claim the Hala'ib Triangle and neither claims the much less valuable Bir Tawil area, which is only a tenth the size, and has no permanent settlements or access to the sea. There is no basis in international law for either Sudan or Egypt to claim both territories, and neither nation is willing to cede Hala'ib. With no third state claiming the neglected area, Bir Tawil is one of the few land areas of the world not claimed by any recognised state. Egypt arguably still administers the territory, but it is not marked as Egyptian on government maps. Geography Bir Tawil is in size. The length of its northern and southern borders are and respectively; the length of its eastern and western borders are and respectively. In the north of the area is the mountain Jabal Tawil (), with a height of . In the east is Jebel Hagar ez Zarqa, with a height of . In the south is the Wadi Tawil (), also called Khawr Ab≈´ Bard. Climate Bir Tawil's climate is, according to the K√∂ppen climate classification, a very hot desert climate (Bwh). During the summer months, approximately three-quarters of the year, temperatures can exceed , while its hottest three months (June‚ÄìAugust) can see it as high as . During the brief winters, however (December and January being its mildest months), Bir Tawil can experience milder temperatures with as its usual temperature peak. Because the territory is far from the ocean (being at least away from the Red Sea), the diurnal temperature range throughout the region is large, varying from , year-round.\\"Climate: Bir Tawil Claims Due to its status as de jure unclaimed territory, a number of individuals and organizations have attempted to claim Bir Tawil as a micronation. However, none has been taken seriously by the international community, and due to the remoteness and hostile climate of the region, the vast majority of these claims have been by declarations posted online from other locations. None of these claims, or any others, have been recognized, officially or otherwise, by any government or international organization.

Produced by the band, it was written by member Eric Stefani and released as the album's second and final single in late 1994. The band recorded \\"Doghouse\\" in their garage following Interscope Records's refusal to provide them funding and professional studio time. No Doubt used the proceeds from their concerts to create a 7\\" single for \\"Squeal\\" and \\"Doghouse\\". 1,000 copies of the single were distributed as part of the group's Beacon Street Records label. The song is a blues-inspired ska pop track similar to the other songs on The Beacon Street Collection. Its beat is accompanied by a saxophone, trombone, and trumpet. The lyrics detail a struggling relationship between a man and a woman; it uses the metaphor of a dog and its master to illustrate the female's desire for control and dominance. It is the first release by No Doubt to feature several musicians, including touring member Gabrial McNair. Critically, \\"Doghouse\\" was deemed in desperate need of a tune-up by music journalist and author Jeff Apt.  Background and recording  Following the release of No Doubt's self-titled debut album in 1992, Interscope Records was disappointed in the project's lack of success, both commercially and critically. Despite the underwhelming performance, the label refused to drop No Doubt and revoked funding for their future releases. The group started creating their own songs from a makeshift recording studio in their garage. Guitarist Tom Dumont recalled that they \\"didn‚Äôt have any music to sell to [the] people coming to our shows\\", so \\"Doghouse\\" was recorded specifically to be handed out to their fans; it was also one of the first songs recorded for The Beacon Street Collection, the group's second studio album. In 1994, No Doubt created a two-part series of 7\\" singles in support of The Beacon Street Collection titled ND Beacon Street Singles. The first single released as part of the collection was \\"Squeal\\", earlier in 1994, followed by \\"Doghouse\\" in late 1994. According to the single's liner notes, the songs were recorded at the band members' homes on Beacon Street, a local road in Fullerton, California. The \\"Doghouse\\" 7\\" single release was limited to 1,000 copies and each single is individually numbered. The B-side song was \\"You Can't Teach an Ol' Dog New Tricks\\", a previously unreleased track written by Eric Stefani. The Beacon Street Collection was independently released by No Doubt's Beacon Street Records label on March 25, 1995; \\"Doghouse\\" serves as the album's closing track. Following the sale of all 1,000 7\\" singles for \\"Doghouse\\", the record went out of print.  Composition and lyrics  alt=A color picture of ska musician Gabrial McNair performing. Musically, \\"Doghouse\\" is a blues- influenced ska pop track. It contains a progressive sound that author Jeff Apter considered a common element within The Beacon Street Collection. Like the majority of the parent album, it contains synth arrangements and new wave- style influences to create a rawer sound than the music from its predecessor, No Doubt. Lead vocals are performed by Gwen Stefani. With an ensemble of instruments, Dumont plays the guitar, Tony Kanal performs bass guitar, Eric Stefani uses the keyboards, and Adrian Young handles the drums. Additional instrumentation is provided by Gerard Boisse on saxophone, Phil Jordan on trumpet, and touring member Gabrial McNair on trombone. \\"Doghouse\\" is set in common time and has a very fast tempo of 158 beats per minute. The key of the song is in B minor, with Stefani's vocal range spanning nearly an octave and a half. During the song's bridge leading up the final iteration of the chorus, she reaches the high note of D6, in scientific pitch notation. Lyrically, it is about a man who is bullied and dominated by his girlfriend and is unwilling to force the situation to change. The song uses the metaphor of a dog and its master to illustrate the nature of the relationship, saying that she had got him \\"by the reins\\" and he has been \\"conditioned\\" by her. In the refrain, Stefani sings: \\"You're just a doggy / In a snap, you're fetching the bone / And you're barking when she calls / You're hiding behind the fence / You've been disobedient.\\"  Critical reception  Jeff Apter, music journalist and author of the 2009 biography Gwen Stefani and No Doubt: A Simple Kind of Life, suggested that \\"Doghouse\\" was another song on The Beacon Street Collection that was in desperate need of a tune-up for a more satisfying sound. However, he attributed the progressive sound of the single to the band's first collaboration with outsider musicians, such as Boisse, Jordan, and McNair.

It is located at 389 Congress Street, and is set in a prominent rise, anchoring a cluster of civic buildings at the eastern end of Portland's downtown. The structure was built in 1909-12 and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. Architecture Portland City Hall occupies much of an entire city block, bounded by Congress, Myrtle, and Chestnut Streets, and Cumberland Avenue. Its original main portion is a U-shaped granite structure, the U open to Congress Street. A modern ell extends along Myrtle Street, behind the right leg of the U. The central portion is three stories in height, with a dormed mansard roof fronted by a low balustrade. A tower, in height rises from the center of this section. Ground floor windows are set in rounded openings, a feature continued around the wings. There are three entrances, accessed via a broad set of stairs; the central one is topped by the city seal. The wings are two stories in height, with projecting colonnades of Tuscan columns facing the inside of the U. The wings are covered by hip roofs, with a bracketed cornice extending around. The interior of the building houses the city's offices. The addition on Myrtle Street also includes Merrill Auditorium, a 1,908 seat performance venue. The organ it houses, the Kotzschmar Memorial Organ, was the second largest in the world at the time of its construction in 1912. Portland's City Hall was first built on this site in 1862, a building that was destroyed in the city's Great Fire of 1866. Rebuilt to a design by Francis H. Fassett, its replacement burned in 1908. The present City Hall was designed by the New York City firm of Carrere & Hastings, with local assistance provided by John Calvin Stevens and John Howard Stevens. It was inspired by New York City Hall, and was considered by John M. Carrere to be one of his finest works. History During the Portland Rum Riot on June 2, 1855, opponents of the state's Prohibition law stormed City Hall because they thought Mayor Neal Dow was keeping liquor in the basement. Newspapers reported that Dow ordered rioters to be fired upon, killing one and wounding seven. File:Portland City Hall Night.jpgPortland City Hall at night in September 2011.

Large earthquakes have been recorded along this zone since the 7th century, with a recurrence time of 100 to 200 years. Earthquake The 1946 Nankaido earthquake was unusual in its seismological perspective, with a rupture zone estimated from long-period geodetic data that was more than twice as large as that derived from shorter period seismic data. In the center of this earthquake rupture zone, scientists used densely deployed ocean bottom seismographs to detect a subducted seamount thick by wide at a depth of . Scientists propose that this seamount might work as a barrier inhibiting brittle seismogenic rupture.

It may involve any combination of stormwater control, erosion control, and watertable control. Classification Classification of agricultural drainage systems. While there are more than two types of drainage systems employed in agriculture, there are two main types: (1) surface drainage and (2) sub-surface drainage. Crop yield (Y) and depth of water table (X in dm) Data provided by various authors on banana, cotton, sugarcane and wheat response to shallow water tables Figure 1 classifies the various types of drainage systems. It shows the field (or internal) and the main (or external) systems.Agricultural Drainage Criteria. Chapter 17 in: H.P.Ritzema (ed. 1994), Drainage Principles and Applications, ILRI Publication 16, p.635-690. International Institute for Land Reclamation and Improvement (ILRI), Wageningen, The Netherlands. . Free download from : , under nr. 1, or directly as PDF : The function of the field drainage system is to control the water table, whereas the function of the main drainage system is to collect, transport, and dispose of the water through an outfall or outlet. In some instances one makes an additional distinction between collector and main drainage systems. Field drainage systems are differentiated in surface and subsurface field drainage systems. Sometimes (e.g., in irrigated, submerged rice fields), a form of temporary drainage is required whereby the drainage system is allowed to function only on certain occasions (e.g., during the harvest period). If allowed to function continuously, excessive quantities of water would be lost. Such a system is therefore called a checked, or controlled, drainage system. More usually, however, drainage systems are meant to function as regularly as possible to prevent undue waterlogging at any given time and it is this regular drainage system that is most often employed. In agricultural literature, this is sometimes also called a \\"relief drainage system\\". =Surface drainage systems= The regular surface drainage systems, which start functioning as soon as there is an excess of rainfall or irrigation applied, operate entirely by gravity. They consist of reshaped or reformed land surfaces and can be divided into: * Bedded systems, used in flat lands for crops other than rice; * Graded systems, used in sloping land for crops other than rice. The bedded and graded systems may have ridges and furrows. The checked surface drainage systems consist of check gates placed in the embankments surrounding flat basins, such as those used for rice fields in flat lands. These fields are usually submerged and only need to be drained on certain occasions (e.g., at harvest time). Checked surface drainage systems are also found in terraced lands used for rice.Oosterbaan, R.J., H.A. Gunneweg and A. Huizing 1987. Water control for rice cultivation in small valleys of West Africa. In: ILRI Annual Report 1986 pp. 30-49. International Institute for Land Reclamation and Improvement (ILRI), Wageningen, The Netherlands. Download from : , under nr. 8, or directly as PDF : In literature, not much information can be found on the relations between the various regular surface field drainage systems, the reduction in the degree of waterlogging, and the agricultural or environmental effects. It is therefore difficult to develop sound agricultural criteria for the regular surface field drainage systems. Most of the known criteria for these systems concern the efficiency of the techniques of land leveling and earthmoving.R.J.Sevenhuijsen, 1994. Surface Drainage Systems. In: H.P.Ritzema (ed.), Drainage Principles and Applications, ILRI Publication 16, p.799-826. International Institute for Land Reclamation and Improvement ( ILRI), Wageningen, The Netherlands. Similarly, agricultural criteria for checked surface drainage systems are not very well known... =Subsurface drainage systems= Mug and sole drain (Scotland, 18th century) Like the surface field drainage systems, the subsurface field drainage systems can also be differentiated in regular systems and checked (controlled) systems. Controlled drainage system When the drain discharge takes place entirely by gravity, both types of subsurface systems have much in common, except that the checked systems have control gates that can be opened and closed according to need. They can save much irrigation water.Qorani, M., M.S. Abdel Dayem and R.J. Oosterbaan 1990. Evaluation of restricted subsurface drainage in rice fields. In: Symposium on land drainage for salinity control in arid and semi-arid regions, Vol. 3. Drainage Research Institute, Cairo, pp. 415-423 A checked drainage system also reduces the discharge through the main drainage system, thereby reducing construction costs. When the discharge takes place by pumping, the drainage can be checked simply by not operating the pumps or by reducing the pumping time. In northwestern India, this practice has increased the irrigation efficiency and reduced the quantity of irrigation water needed, and has not led to any undue salinization.Rao, K.V.G.K., D.P. Sharma and R.J. Oosterbaan 1992. Sub-irrigation by groundwater management with controlled subsurface drainage in semi-arid areas. International Conference on Supplementary Irrigation and Drought Management, Bari, Italy Parameters of horizontal drainage Parameters of vertical drainage The subsurface field drainage systems consist of horizontal or slightly sloping channels made in the soil; they can be open ditches, trenches, filled with brushwood and a soil cap, filled with stones and a soil cap, buried pipe drains, tile drains, or mole drains, but they can also consist of a series of wells. Modern buried pipe drains often consist of corrugated, flexible, and perforated plastic (PE or PVC) pipe lines wrapped with an envelope or filter material to improve the permeability around the pipes and to prevent entry of soil particles, which is especially important in fine sandy and silty soils. The surround may consist of synthetic fibre (geotextile). The field drains (or laterals) discharge their water into the collector or main system either by gravity or by pumping. The wells (which may be open dug wells or tubewells) have normally to be pumped, but sometimes they are connected to drains for discharge by gravity. Subsurface drainage by wells is often referred to as vertical drainage, and drainage by channels as horizontal drainage, but it is more clear to speak of \\"field drainage by wells\\" and \\"field drainage by ditches or pipes\\" respectively. In some instances, subsurface drainage can be achieved simply by breaking up slowly permeable soil layers by deep plowing (sub-soiling), provided that the underground has sufficient natural drainage. In other instances, a combination of sub-soiling and subsurface drains may solve the problem. =Main drainage systems= Deep collector drain The main drainage systems consist of deep or shallow collectors, and main drains or disposal drains. Deep collector drains are required for subsurface field drainage systems, whereas shallow collector drains are used for surface field drainage systems, but they can also be used for pumped subsurface systems. The deep collectors may consist of open ditches or buried pipe lines. The terms deep collectors and shallow collectors refer rather to the depth of the water level in the collector below the soil surface than to the depth of the bottom of the collector. The bottom depth is determined both by the depth of the water level and by the required discharge capacity. The deep collectors may either discharge their water into deep main drains (which are drains that do not receive water directly from field drains, but only from collectors), or their water may be pumped into a disposal drain. Disposal drains are main drains in which the depth of the water level below the soil surface is not bound to a minimum, and the water level may even be above the soil surface, provided that embankments are made to prevent inundation. Disposal drains can serve both subsurface and surface field drainage systems. Grave, the Netherlands Deep main drains can gradually become disposal drains if they are given a smaller gradient than the land slope along the drain. The technical criteria applicable to main drainage systems depend on the hydrological situation and on the type of system.M.G.Bos, 1994. Subsurface Drainage Systems. In: H.P.Ritzema (ed.), Drainage Principles and Applications, ILRI Publication 16, p.725-798. International Institute for Land Reclamation and Improvement (ILRI), Wageningen, The Netherlands. =Main drainage outlet= The final point of a main drainage system is the gravity outlet structure W.S. de Vries and E.J. Huyskes, 1994. Gravity Outlet Structures. In: H.P.Ritzema (ed.), Drainage Principles and Applications, ILRI Publication 16, p.965-1000. International Institute for Land Reclamation and Improvement, Wageningen (ILRI), The Netherlands. or the pumping station.J.Wijdieks and M.G.Bos, 1994. Pumps and Pumping Stations. In: H.P.Ritzema (ed.), Drainage Principles and Applications, ILRI Publication 16, p.965-1000. International Institute for Land Reclamation and Improvement (ILRI), Wageningen, The Netherlands. Applications Surface drainage systems are usually applied in relatively flat lands that have soils with a low or medium infiltration capacity, or in lands with high-intensity rainfalls that exceed the normal infiltration capacity, so that frequent waterlogging occurs on the soil surface. Subsurface drainage systems are used when the drainage problem is mainly that of shallow water tables. When both surface and subsurface waterlogging occur, a combined surface/subsurface drainage system is required. Sometimes, a subsurface drainage system is installed in soils with a low infiltration capacity, where a surface drainage problem may improve the soil structure and the infiltration capacity so greatly that a surface drainage system is no longer required.De Jong, M.H. 1979. Drainage of structured clay soils. In: J. Wesseling (ed.), Proceedings of the International Drainage Workshop. ILRI Publication 25, pp. 268-280. International Institute for Land Reclamation and Improvement (ILRI), Wageningen, The Netherlands. On the other hand, it can also happen that a surface drainage system diminishes the recharge of the groundwater to such an extent that the subsurface drainage problem is considerably reduced or even eliminated. The choice between a subsurface drainage system by pipes and ditches or by tube wells is more a matter of technical criteria and costs than of agricultural criteria, because both types of systems can be designed to meet the same agricultural criteria and achieve the same benefits. Usually, pipe drains or ditches are preferable to wells. However, when the soil consists of a poorly permeable top layer several meters thick, overlying a rapidly permeable and deep subsoil, wells may be a better option, because the drain spacing required for pipes or ditches would be considerably smaller than the spacing for wells. Drainage design procedures When the land needs a subsurface drainage system, but saline groundwater is present at great depth, it is better to employ a shallow, closely spaced system of pipes or ditches instead of a deep, widely spaced system. The reason is that the deeper systems produce a more salty effluent than the shallow systems. Environmental criteria may then prohibit the use of the deeper systems. In some drainage projects, one may find that only main drainage systems are envisaged. The agricultural land is then still likely to suffer from field drainage problems. In other cases, one may find that field drainage systems are ineffective because there is no adequate main drainage system. In either case, the installation of drainage systems is not recommended.

Sex trafficking Bulgaria once maintained a reputation as a transit country for sex trafficking, but subsequently, it has become known as a destination where the sex trade takes place. The country remains one of the primary source countries of human trafficking in the EU. Bulgarian women and children are subjected to sex trafficking within the country, as well as in Europe, and the Middle East. Romanian girls are subjected to sex trafficking in Bulgaria. Government corruption creates an environment enabling some trafficking crimes, and officials have been investigated for suspected involvement in trafficking. The Bulgarian government has stepped up its efforts to eradicate human trafficking. Authorities launched 66 sex trafficking investigations in 2016, compared with 71 investigations in 2015. Authorities prosecuted 72 defendants with sex trafficking in 2016 (55 in 2015). The government convicted 34 sex traffickers in 2016 (47 sex traffickers convicted in 2015). Only 12 of the 34 convicted traffickers, 34 percent, received a prison sentence that was not suspended, a similarly low rate as in the previous three years.

Besides numerous photos of Ingo Bartussek, the book also contains a chapter about raising raccoon kits written by the veterinarian Bernhard B√∂er. Working now for the Forschungsanstalt f√ºr Wald√∂kologie und Forstwirtschaft Rheinland- Pfalz, Ulf Hohmann has recently concentrated on the research of boars, mainly of those living in the Palatinate Forest. His research on raccoons has been continued by Frank-Uwe Michler, who first worked together with Hohmann for his diploma in a study of urban raccoons in Kassel from 2001 to 2002. Since March 2006, Frank-Uwe Michler is the leader of the first study of the range and behavior of the raccoons living in the eastern parts of Germany in the M√ºritz National Park.

They take their name from a pair of organizations known as the Fenians dedicated to the establishment of an independent Irish Republic in the 19th and early 20th centuries, as well as the Fianna of Irish mythology. Their stated influences include Elvis Costello, U2, The Pogues, and Bob Dylan. History The Fenians were formed in 1990 in Orange County, California. Since that time, they have released five studio albums, one greatest hits album, and a live DVD. They have toured throughout the United States and Ireland. They perform regularly at Yucaipa's Concert in the Park. In 2009, the Fenians were named best world act at the Orange County Music Awards. The Fenians were formed in 1990 in Orange County, California by the son of Irish immigrants, mandolin player- singer Terry Casey, as an outlet for his love of the Irish folk songs that were sung in his childhood home. The Fenians played in local Irish pubs, infusing Irish folk tunes with the rock and roll-punk energy Terry absorbed in his teen years with Patrick \\"Murph\\" Carey on acoustic guitar and Gordon McGrath on bass. McGrath was replaced within a few years by Brendan Harkins on bass and vocals, who contributed to the first cassette recording, \\"Sons of Ireland\\". Rob Williams, at the time a member of The Bold Fenian Men, an Irish folk quartet, then replaced Carey on guitar and vocals. This lineup was to become the core of the Fenians' sound, in addition to Casey's mandolin tone, as Williams' baritone and Harkins' tenor rounded out the vocal harmonies to Casey's lead vocals. Matt Jones soon joined the band as its first drummer but was replaced after a short time by Andy Mendoza, who recorded the first two albums, 1993's Live at the Harp and 1994's Distant City Street, with the band. He left the band soon after to join Ozomatli and was replaced by drummer Chris \\"the Animal\\" Pierce. Around the same time, the Fenians expanded their sound by adding a whistle and saxophone player, Tardu Yegin. (Saxophonist Ian Jones had played pub gigs with the Fenians for many years previously but did not perform on any recordings). This incarnation of the Fenians produced the albums Band of Rogues (1999), a live blend of original, traditional, and contemporary Irish tunes and Have Fun or Get Out (2001), a restating of back catalog favorites with the new lineup. These recordings also marked vocal contributions from Williams and Harkins. Yegin left the band in 2002 and was replaced by Dave Burnett, who played whistle, flute and saxophone on \\"Every Day's a Hooley\\", the Fenians' most eclectic offering to date. The band went through several subsequent lineup changes, Casey and Pierce being the only constants, enlisting Stuart Martz on guitar/fiddle/vocals, Kenny Cosca on bass and vocals, and Nate Light- bass/vocals with no recorded output apart from a cover of Steve Earle's \\"Galway Girl\\" that was added to the 2007 Varese Sarabande/Universal release The Best of the Fenians. Pierce left the band in 2010. The current lineup consists of Terry Casey, Rob Williams, Brendan Harkins, Tardu Yegin and drummer Bryon Holley and released in June 2013 their follow-up to \\"Hooley\\", Take Me Home.

However, because they were very slow with a top speed of , the design was modified and the so- called GtL 4/5 was built with an additional trailing axle, that was linked to the final coupled axle by a Krauss-Helmholtz bogie.

History  Bavarian GtL 4/4 locomotives were supplied by Krauss to the state railway. In 1911, two were delivered and, in 1914, they were followed by a further eleven engines. As a result of their positive experience with the GtL 4/4 the Bavarian Group Administration (Gruppenverwaltung Bayern) of the Deutsche Reichsbahn decided to procure more examples of this locomotive. From 1921 to 1927 Krauss supplied another 108 engines that were somewhat heavier and differed from the original versions in the design of the driver's cab. The last 17 locomotives from 1927 were even heavier than the previous engines, which was due to the increased size of water and coal tanks. Boiler, drive and power remained unchanged over the entire procurement period. The locomotives were designated as DRG Class 98.8-9 by the Reichsbahn, and were given the numbers 98 801 to 98 917.  GtL 4/5  Although the GtL 4/4 proved very successful, the Deutsche Reichsbahn decided to order a modified, faster version. This resulted in the DRG Class 98.10, unofficially called the GtL 4/5, which had a trailing axle in the shape of a Krauss-Helmholtz bogie. A total of 45 were built between 1930 and 1933. Despite the trailing axle the top speed could only be raised to 45 km/h so the Reichsbahn decided to rebuild existing GtL 4/4s, this time adding a leading Bissel axle. Confusingly the unofficial Bavarian notation for these was also GtL 4/5, but the Reichsbahn classified them as the DRG Class 98.11, which had a top speed of 55 km/h. A total of 29 were converted in this way.  Lokalbahn AG locomotives  The Lokalbahn Company (Lokalbahn Aktien-Gesellschaft or LAG) had also bought two GtL 4/4 machines in 1922, that were identical to the state railway versions from 1921. The vehicles, with running numbers 80 and 81, were stabled at Thalkirchen shed on the Isar Valley line (Isartalbahn). They remained there even after being taken over by the Reichsbahn. They were later converted to a 1'D1' configuration, but unlike the other GtL 4/4 locos, were grouped into DRG Class 98.16 and given numbers 98 1601 and 98 1602.  Retirement  During the Second World War five locomotives were destroyed, a further three remained with the Czechoslovakian State Railways (ƒåSD). The remaining machines went into the Deutsche Bundesbahn, which began retiring them in the 1950s. The two LAG engines were sent to Rosenheim shed in 1950 and were retired in 1957 and 1958.  Preserved locomotives  Two locomotives, numbers 98 812 and 98 886, were given EDP operating numbers in 1968, but were retired shortly thereafter. Both locomotives have been preserved: number 98 812 is a working museum locomotive with the Ulm Railway Society (Ulmer Eisenbahnfreunde). Number 98 886 has been made operational again and hauls the Little Rh√∂n Train (Rh√∂n-Z√ºgle) from Mellrichstadt to Fladungen.

His art education and career began when Taiwan was under Japanese rule. Most of his paintings were realistic, but he also created some cubist works in his mid- life. He contributed significantly to art in Taiwan, as an artist and educator. The Lee Shih-chiao Museum of Art was established in 1992, three years before his death. Early life Lee Shih-chiao was a Taiwanese oil painter born in Xinzhuang Township, Taipei County, on 13 July 1908. Lee was the third of seven children born to his parents, who were farmers. Education In 1923, he entered Taipei Normal School (Âè∞ÂåóÂ∏´ÁØÑÂ≠∏Ê†°), and began to receive formal art education under Ishikawa Kinichiro. Lee was also a student of Yoshimura Yoshimatsu. After the normal school was divided, Lee transferred to the Taipei Second Normal School. In 1927, his watercolor painting entitled Taipei Bridge was selected for the first Taiwan Art Exhibition (Taiten). In 1929, he went to Japan seeking admission into the Western Painting Division (renamed Oil Painting Division in 1933) of the Tokyo School of Fine Arts in 1931; he was accepted after taking the entrance examinations three times, and began to study under Okada Sabur≈çsuke. Lee graduated from the Tokyo School in 1935 and stayed in Japan until 1944. Work and public life Lee married Chou Lai-fu (Âë®‰æÜÂØå) in 1928. In 1933, Lee's work Garden of Lin Benyuan was selected for the Imperial Art Exhibition (Teiten), and his Interior was selected for the 7th Taiwan Art Exhibition with special selection status and received the exhibition's Asahi Prize. In 1934, he co-founded the Tai-Yang Art Society alongside seven others: Chang Ching-fen, , Li Mei-shu, Liao Chi-chun, Tan Ting-pho, Yang San-lang, and Yen Shui-long. After graduating in 1935, he remained in Tokyo and continued to develop his skills. During this period, he earned a living by painting portraits for wealthy and influential Taiwanese families. His 1936 work The Family of Yang Zhaojia is a representative work from this period in his life, and was selected for the first Shin Bunten Exhibition. In lieu of having been selected twice for Japan's official exhibition, Lee became the first Taiwanese painter to receive review exemption status for the Shin Bunten Exhibition. Another painting, Reclining Nude was considered pornographic and barred from the 1936 Taiyang Art Exhibition. In 1944, Lee returned to settle in Taiwan. He painted Market Entrance in 1945. It was exhibited in the first Taiwan Provincial Art Exhibition held in 1946, where he also served as a juror. The painting depicted Yungle Market in Taipei and emphasized socioeconomic inequality in Taiwan shortly after the end of World War II. Lee considered Market Entrance among his best work. He continued painting scenes of daily life in Taiwan throughout the 1940s, including Happy Farmers. completed in 1946. In 1949, he used his family members as the models for his painting The Joy of Farming. This painting demonstrates the artist's adept handling of group images as well as his skillful use of realist style. In 1948, he opened a private art studio and began to teach art for free. In 1958, students that Lee had taught in his studio founded the Association of Taiwan Artists. After 1950, Lee's style began to move away from realism, and he started using Picasso-esque techniques or reverse perspective in order to manifest the subjects of his works. In this period, Lee was particularly focused on Cubism. These changes can be seen in his works such as Still Life with Glass Vessel Metaphysical, and Painting Studio (Lily) (1958). In 1963, Lee began to teach arts at National Taiwan Normal University as an associate professor. He left NTNU in 1974, and became a professor of the National Taiwan Academy of Arts (now National Taiwan University of Arts) and Chinese Culture University. Lee closed his studio, retired from art education and moved to Seattle to live with his daughter in 1982. The Lee Shih-chiao Museum of Art opened in Taipei on 11 July 1992. He died in Syracuse, New York, USA. Lee's former residence At 15 years old, Lee Shih-chiao moved out of his house in Xinzhuang. The house was bought by a timber-factory-running family surnamed Huang. The Huang family built factories around the house and continued to maintain the residence. They did not know the house belonged to Lee Shih- chiao's family until they found his name in the land ownership certificate. Subsequently, the Huang family decided to register the house as a historical site to protect it from redevelopment.‰∏≠ÂúãÊôÇÂ†±2015Âπ¥09Êúà22Êó•Ôºå„ÄàËóè107Âπ¥ ÊùéÁü≥Ê®µÂè§ÂéùÈáçË¶ãÂ§©Êó•„Äâ References *Taiwan Digital *Yen, Chuan-ying.

Biography He was born in Maihingen, near N√∂rdlingen to teacher Alban Haas from his second marriage, being half- brother to the theologian and historian Alban Haas. At an early age he came into contact with music. He became a teacher himself and taught from 1897 to 1904 in Lauingen near the Danube. In his effort to pursue his musical inclination, he met Max Reger, with whom he took private lessons from 1904 in Munich. He later followed him to Leipzig in 1907 to study music at the Leipzig Conservatory. Among his teachers were Karl Straube and Adolf Ruthardt. In 1909 Haas finished his studies. In 1911, having had his first success as a composer and having won an Arthur Nikisch scholarship, he became teacher of composition at the Stuttgart Conservatory, where he was named professor in 1916. From 1921 he taught at the Akademie f√ºr Tonkunst in Munich (today Hochschule f√ºr Musik und Theater M√ºnchen); he was professor there from 1924 to 1950. In 1921, together with Paul Hindemith and Heinrich Burkard, he established the Donaueschinger Kammermusikauff√ºhrungen zur F√∂rderung zeitgen√∂ssischer Tonkunst. In 1930, he became a member of the Prussian Academy of Arts in Berlin. After the Second World War, he became president of the Munich Hochschule f√ºr Musik und Theater, a position which he held until he became Emeritus Professor in 1950 and led the school's reconstruction after 1945. He died in Munich and was buried in the Munich Waldfriedhof. Importance =As a composer= The work of Haas was entirely based on tonality. At first, he was strongly influenced by his mentor Max Reger, whose language of polyphony and harmony also featured in Haas's music. During his lifetime, Haas was a successful and well known composer. In 1954, for his 75th birthday, numerous celebratory festivals took place in both West and East Germany.

General description  Longevity annuities are like \\"reverse life insurance\\", meaning premium dollars are collected by the life insurance company by its policy holders to pay income when a policy holder lives a long life, instead of collecting premium dollars and paying a death claim on a policy holder's short life in ordinary life insurance. Longevity annuities use mortality credits to pool money and pay out the remaining policy holders' claims, this being living a long life. The term \\"longevity insurance\\" comes from this type of annuity being insurance against unusually long life. It may seem odd to insure against an event that most people would welcome. However, living a very long time would strain many people's financial resources, just as a fire which destroys their house would strain many people's finances if they didn't have fire insurance. The logic that makes fire insurance a prevalent means for coping with the financial risk of house fires would seem to argue for greater use of longevity insurance for retirement planning: Few people will live to a very old age, so it doesn't make sense for everyone to try to cover that possibility with savings and investments. (The same type of reasoning applies to house insurance: because few people will experience house fires, therefore it is not realistic to expect everyone to save and invest specifically for purposes of house replacement.) Longevity insurance is not designed for the early retirement years, so it is not intended as a complete retirement plan by itself. Summer of 2014, the IRS and Treasury Department finalized the creation of qualifying longevity annuity contracts, or QLACs, under the required minimum distribution (RMD) rules of Internal Revenue Code section 401(a)(9). Providing an exception to the RMD rules allowing an IRA owner to use the lesser of 25% of account owners total IRA account balance or $125,000 to deferred income annuity or longevity annuity that provides no cash value and promises income payments no later than age 85. This amount was subject to inflation adjustment in the coming years. Starting in January 2018 the QLAC limit was raised to $130,000. For example, a person might pay $20,000 from his or her retirement savings at age 60 to purchase longevity insurance that would pay $11,803 per year starting at age 85 and continuing until death. These numbers are made up, but are based on actual terms offered by at least one major insurance company in February 2019. Thus, in this example, if the person lived to 95, they would receive $118,030 on their $20,000 investment (10 years at $11,803/year). This is a rate of return that far exceeds that available at prevailing interest rates on government bonds. The economic reason for the high return at low risk is that one is giving up any claim on that initial $20,000 investment on behalf of one's heirs. If the person dies before 85, the insurance company pays nothing to them or their estate. (Some companies offer optional features that would modify this, so there would be a death benefit or so they would have the option of starting payments sooner, but taking these options would substantially reduce the annual income the policy would pay at age 85.) The benefit is generally paid in the form of a guaranteed income stream for the remainder of the individual's life (as in the above example), though alternative benefit forms may be provided depending on the terms of the actual policy. The main use of these products is to provide retirees with a way to stretch their retirement resources to cover the possibility of living to a very old age. The likelihood that many buyers of such an annuity will not live to collect on it allows the insurance company to pay relatively high returns, higher than are available on low-risk investments, to the fraction of buyers who do live that long, i.e., mortality credits.

Commissioned by 250 Nashville residents in 1908 and named for Andrew Jackson's estate, The Hermitage near Nashville,Hotel History , Hermitage Hotel website the hotel opened in 1910. It was built in the Beaux- arts style and is the only remaining example of this style of architecture in a commercial building in Tennessee. The Hermitage Hotel was designated a National Historic Landmark on August 28, 2020 for its important role in the final victory of the 19th Amendment dealing with voting rights for women. The hotel was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975, primarily for architectural reasons. It is also a member of Historic Hotels of America, an official program of the National Trust for Historic Preservation. History The Hermitage Hotel was constructed in the heart of downtown Nashville, two blocks from the state capitol, where Nashville's finest residential neighborhood evolved into a business district early in the 20th century. Commissioned by 250 locals in 1908, The Hotel Hermitage opened its doors on Saturday, September 17, 1910. It was Nashville's third \\"skyscraper\\" to be built downtown. In 1910, the new hotel advertised its rooms as \\"fireproof, noise proof, and dust proof, rooms $2.00 and up.\\" The hotel opened with every possible modern convenience, including a telephone and circulating ice water in all guest rooms, and high standards of guest service. The lobby itself was ‚Äî and still is ‚Äî the main focal point of the hotel, a spacious Beaux-Arts masterpiece graced with a profusion of ornamental plaster and a painted glass ceiling. From the street entrance, a grand staircase leads to the lobby with walls distinctively built of golden-hued Sienna Marble. The Main Dining Room (now the Grand Ballroom) was located off the lobby area and was richly detailed with Circassian walnut walls and an ornate ceiling, features that still exist today. A social room to the front of the hotel was elevated above lobby level and named the Loggia (now the Veranda). It was designed in an Italian Renaissance style, clad in ornamental white and poly chrome terra cotta with arched openings and balconies overlooking the street. Downstairs, adjoining the Oak Bar, was the Grille Room (now The Capitol Grille), which was originally designed as a rathskeller (also ratskeller) with vaulted ceilings and wood paneling. Along the street entrance, an array of shops included a pharmacy and clothing store, later a familiar place for many Nashville natives as an American Airlines ticket office. The original hotel included an exhibit hall on the ninth (top) floor, salesmen \\"sample rooms\\" on the eighth floor, a cigar and newsstand in the lobby, and a barbershop on the Grille level. As one of Nashville's leading hotels, it was a national platform for both pro- and anti-suffrage forces in 1920, when Tennessee became the 36th state to ratify the 19th Amendment to the United States Constitution giving women the right to vote. The hotel also had early musical roots and influences in Nashville with its hotel \\"big band\\", the Francis Craig Orchestra. Mr. Craig and his musicians were part of the first day's live radio broadcast of newly formed station WSM in October 1925, the same station that soon developed the Grand Ole Opry programming. Craig, on the eve of retirement in 1947, became a national musical celebrity when a song he had composed and recorded, \\"Near You\\", became America's top selling record. Released on an independent label, the song's success helped compel the major record companies to establish a stronger Nashville presence, cementing its status as a footnote in the evolution story of the newly emerging \\"Music City\\". The Hermitage Hotel has a storied past, including presidential visits that began with a banquet for President Taft in 1911, followed by Governor Woodrow Wilson in 1912 and in more recent decades, John F. Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson, and Richard Nixon. State politics played a large role in the hotel's history, and it was often used as a campaign headquarters and an after-hours meeting place for legislators. Celebrities from Charlie Chaplin to Jack Dempsey have enjoyed the hospitality offered at the Hermitage, which was known for its high levels of elegant service and dining in addition to its distinctive architecture. The grand dame closed at the end of 1977 with its fate uncertain. During that era, the popularity of the inner city had declined, and the hotel's prosperity faltered. Local preservationists (now Historic Nashville, Inc.) and Mayor Richard Fulton were the driving forces behind saving the Hermitage as well as other landmarks in downtown Nashville, including Ryman Auditorium. The hotel changed ownership and underwent a complete renovation, reopening in 1981 as a Park Suite Hotel. Subsequently, the hotel changed hands several more times in the 1980s and 1990s. Legendary pool player Rudolf Wanderone lived in the hotel during part of this era. In June 2000, Historic Hotels of Nashville, LLC, purchased The Hermitage Hotel and completely renovated the guest rooms and public areas. Originally offering 250 guestrooms a century ago, the hotel now provides 122 rooms and five fixture bathrooms to the traveling public. The hotel reopened on Valentine's Day 2003 and received the American Automobile Association (AAA) Five-Diamond rating in 2007. It is currently the only AAA Five-Diamond hotel in Tennessee. A Forbes 5-Star rating (then Mobil 5-Star) was awarded in 2008, and these accolades have also perpetuated. Ties to Nashville music industry The Francis Craig Orchestra performed in the Oak Bar and Grille Room from 1929 to 1945. Craig's orchestra was also the first to broadcast over WSM and enjoyed phenomenal success with a 12-year show that was aired over the entire NBC network. In 1949, he introduced newcomer Dinah Shore, who entertained his audience with a new song entitled \\"Near You.\\" See also * List of Historic Hotels of America * List of National Historic Landmarks in Tennessee * National Register of Historic Places listings in Davidson County, Tennessee References Category:1910 establishments in Tennessee Category:Hotels in Nashville, Tennessee Category:Beaux-Arts architecture in Tennessee Category:Hotel buildings completed in 1910 Category:Hotels established in 1910 Category:Hotel buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in Tennessee Category:National Register of Historic Places in Nashville, Tennessee Category:Preferred Hotels & Resorts Category:National Historic Landmarks in Tennessee ","title":"Hermitage Hotel"},{"id":"18193433","text":"Feynuus FC is a Somali football club based in Mogadishu, Somalia.

Peace Chance did not run in the Preakness Stakes, but defeated Preakness winner High Quest by six lengths in the Belmont Stakes. Following his win in the Belmont, he was being prepared for the Arlington Classic when he suffered a career-ending injury. Retired to stud, Peace Chance produced progeny that had limited success in racing, but he did sire Arbitrator, dam of the very important broodmare Almahmoud.

Companies had been using crude forms of Instant messaging within their own networks for over forty years, but the idea of presence, i.e. who is logged on at any given time, was non existent. It was not until Appelman, and his colleagues at the Thomas Watson Research Center, first began to write programs on the mainframe system letting each other know when they were actually online, that modern day Instant Messaging was born. In 1994 while employed at AOL, Appelman hired a single contract programmer, Stephen D. Williams, and for five months they worked together building a prototype system that allowed AOL subscribers to have an early form of the buddy list. In 1995 AIM was launched internally to AOL employees. It was initially dubbed \\"the stalker feature\\" since many employees were uncomfortable having their co- workers know when they were online. AOL decided to make Appelman's system available to its subscribers in March 1996, then to other Internet users in May 1997. Ten years later, there were over 53 million AIM users worldwide.  Career at AOL  Appelman joined AOL in 1993 to head up all of AOL server and host development efforts. He authored many innovations and patents: an instant messaging system, a highly scalable email system, ad servers, TCP/IP enabled browsers, among many others. Barry Appelman and his former colleagues from T.J. Watson, Matt Korn and Mike Connors who also came to AOL, were crucial to taking AOL from a distant third position in online services to that of a formidable leadership within 2‚Äì3 years.  Career at IBM T.W. Watson Research  Barry Appelman led IBM's foray into TCP/IP at the Thomas Watson Research Center from 1984 until 1993. Appelman was able to turn complicated IBM politics to the advantage of TCP/IP, open systems and Internet standards. This was not an easy endeavor given that at the time IBM was pushing hard a competing family of internal protocols called Systems Network Architecture. In the end, the work of Barry Appelman proved critical to the IBM's adoption of TCP/IP and its early embrace of the Internet. Mr. Appelman and his group were active in the Internet standardization. Yakov Rekhter authored several Internet RFCs in routing protocols. Mr Appelman's team was also active in SNMP standardization. Appelman's small team of developers produced TCP/IP stacks for all IBM operating systems. Dean Hiller authored MVS TCP/IP. Jay Elinsky authored TCP/IP for VM/CMS. Yakov Rekhter authored TCP/IP for AIX. Oleg Vishnepolsky authored TCP/IP for OS/2 and IBM POS terminals. Appelman was one of the first in the industry to recognize the importance of security in the world of open systems. He was the first one to make Kerberos security system out of MIT's Project Athena a commercial product by having Galina Kofman port this security software to various OS. Kofman also did FTP for VM/CMS. Dick Ryniker authored NFS for VM/CMS and MVS. Appelman's innovation included offloading of TCP/IP processing from IBM mainframes to OS/2 servers, graphical TCP/IP clients, SNMP and FTP APIs, fastest terminal emulator MYTE, S2 Spreadsheet that connected via TCP to IBM DB2, and many others. Particularly noteworthy was the innovation by Appelman and one of his development managers Matt Korn to get voice and video flowing over IP back in 1987.  Patents  Barry Appelman authored 77 patents.

He committed suicide after arguing with Dickens over the illustrations for Pickwick. Early years An 1829 political caricature of Thomas Peel by Robert Seymour Seymour was born in Somerset, England in 1798, the second son of Henry Seymour and Elizabeth Bishop. Soon after moving to London Henry Seymour died, leaving his wife, two sons and daughter impoverished. In 1827 his mother died, and Seymour married his cousin Jane Holmes, having two children, Robert and Jane. After his father died, Robert Seymour was apprenticed as a pattern-drawer to a Mr. Vaughan of Duke Street, Smithfield, London. Influenced by painter Joseph Severn RA, during frequent visits to his uncle Thomas Holmes of Hoxton, Robert's ambition to be a professional painter was achieved at the age of 24 when, in 1822, his painting of a scene from Torquato Tasso's Jerusalem Delivered, with over 100 figures, was exhibited at the Royal Academy. He was commissioned to illustrate the works of Shakespeare; Milton; Cervantes, and Wordsworth. He also produced innumerable portraits, miniatures, landscapes, etc., as can be seen in two Sketchbooks; Windsor; Eaton; Figure Studies; Portraits at the Victoria and Albert Museum. After the rejection of his second Royal Academy submission, he continued to paint in oils, mastered techniques of copper engraving, and began illustrating books for a living. From 1822‚Äì27, Seymour produced designs for a wide range of subjects including: poetry; melodramas; children's stories; and topographical and scientific works. A steady supply of such work enabled him to live comfortably and enjoy his library and fishing and shooting expeditions with his friends: Lacey the publisher, and the illustrator George Cruikshank. In 1827, the year of his mother's death and his marriage, Robert Seymour's publishers, Knight and Lacey, were made bankrupt, owing Seymour a considerable amount of money. In 1827, Seymour then found steady employment when his etchings and engravings were accepted by the publisher Thomas McLean. Learning to etch on the newly fashionable steel-plates, Seymour then first began to specialize in caricatures and other humorous subjects. In 1830, having mastered the art of etching, Seymour then lithographed separate prints and book illustrations; he was then invited by McLean to produce the 1830 caricature magazine called Looking Glass, as etched throughout by William Heath, for which Seymour produced four large lithographed sheets of illustrations, usually drawn several to a page, every month for the following six years, until his death in 1836. Conflicts with Figaro In 1831, Seymour began work for a new magazine called Figaro in London (pre-Punch), producing 300 humorous drawings and political caricatures to accompany the mundane, political topics of the day and the texts of Gilbert √† Beckett (1811‚Äì56). This cheap weekly reflected the clever but abusive character of the owner and editor, √† Beckett, a friend of Charles Dickens and the publisher of George Cruikshank, who, in 1827, argued against Seymour's parody of his work and nom- de-plume of 'Shortshanks'. Gilbert √† Beckett later in 1834 insulted Seymour by replacing him with Cruikshank's brother. This partnership lasted until 1834, when √† Beckett suffered a heavy financial loss and refused to pay Seymour. A‚ÄôBeckett then launched a public media campaign cruelly libelling Seymour, who resigned, only returning when Henry Mayhew replaced √† Beckett as the Figaro editor. This humiliating public smear was attributed as a cause for the coroner's suicide verdict.Pictorial Pickwickiania by Joseph Grego. Nevertheless, Seymour was now established as pre-eminent an illustrator as George Cruikshank, and as one of the greatest artists since the days of Hogarth, predicted by Sir Richard Phillips, that if he lived, he would become President of the Royal Academy. In 1834, at the height of his prosperity, independently, Seymour launched a new series of lithographs, Sketches by Seymour (1834‚Äì36), all depicting expeditions of over-equipped and under- trained Cockneys pursuing cats, birds and stray pigs on foot and on horseback, as experienced in his 1827 fishing and shooting expeditions with his friend Cruickshank. The Posthumous Papers of the Pickwick Club Mr. Pickwick addresses the Club Seymour's characters were popular, but all were lighthearted sporting or political in theme. The thin and large characters he developed were continued into the early life of the Pickwick Papers. There is however considerable controversy about who is intellectually responsible for the creation of the Pickwick Papers. It is agreed by Seymour's widow, the publisher Chapman and Hall, and Charles Dickens (1812‚Äì70) that the original idea prompting Dickens' writing commission came from Seymour who suggested to his existing publisher (Chapman and Hall) creating a magazine series of sporting illustrations with short written sketches linking them together in some way. The usual method was anecdotal stories. Further he developed the idea of a 'Nimrod Club' of sporting people having adventures as the framework for the sketches and illustrations. This is very much in the line of his already published Seymour's Sketches. The quality of the 'hack' writing (as such writing was known) in this volume is also valuable to provide contrast to Dickens' work. Edward Chapman agreed that the work should be issued in monthly parts, with descriptive text by Dickens. This was a very popular method at the time. However Charles Dickens, then only 22, was not the first choice as writer. From this point differences of opinion are rife. Seymour's widow claims the credit for choosing Dickens as the hack because his 'poverty' would ensure that he would write the sketch links for the illustrations. However a more reliable view is that the senior editor in the publishing house did not have time to complete the work so recommended Dickens on the basis of his recently published and successful 'Sketches by Boz', also in a monthly periodical format. Dr. Slammer's Defiance of Jingle When Dickens was commissioned he made it clear that he was not a sporting person and therefore could not write this kind of sketch. But he liked the idea of a club and would write something the illustrations could be created from, reversing the order of the creative process. His story would have illustrations. It would not be a series of illustrations with a bit of story linking them together. Mr Winkle, the only main character really interested in sports, would be created to showcase Seymour but let Dickens write characters he wanted to. This was done to appease Seymour. It seems probable that Seymour had a set of preliminary drawings for the Nimrod Club. He may have used them when discussing his idea with the publishers. His ideas for the Nimrod Club seem to go back to 1834 but due to his workload it doesn't seem to have been a project pursued until late 1835 or very early 1836 (the latter date is more probable). Reports suggest that Dickens was not commissioned until 10 February 1836 with a publication date of 31 March 1836 as the deadline. This was a very short timescale considering that there were serious disagreements about how the project would be developed after Dickens was appointed. Seymour may have used his previous illustrations to describe his original idea for the Nimrod Club but the creation of Mr Pickwick's character's design would imply that there was a prototype for him made by Seymour. This design seems to have been a thin man and was rejected by both the publisher and Dickens. The credit for the rotund final version was given by Dickens to Edward Chapman, as it was based on his acquaintance. However Seymour certainly had some characters similar to the round Mr Pickwick in his work before this time, although they are quite general in their detail and they appear similar in a number of his sketches. They appear to be more simple caricature observations whereas Mr Pickwick appears to be drawn more sharply into a strong visual image. Dickens had also written the first two chapters for Seymour to work from. From the facts that are known it seems logical then that Mr Pickwick was envisioned as a thin man, rejected and then redrawn on their suggestion of someone they knew and on Dickens writing. It also seems reasonable that Seymour used his previous work to help create the character, and Dickens is reported as saying that he had \\"made him a reality\\". Mr Pickwick seems to be an amalgamation of ideas from all these sources and is therefore not solely Seymour's creation. All the characteristics of the persona and the name appear to belong to Dickens. Mr. Winkle Soothes the Refractory Steed It is not known how much of The Pickwick Papers Seymour created. He committed suicide before the second part of the book was completed and published. He shot himself with a shotgun (fowling piece) in his summer-house behind his home in Liverpool Road, Islington, on 20 April 1836. It is clear that Seymour was not in control of the process of creating The Pickwick Papers and was in fact commissioned on quite meager monetary terms for four illustrations per magazine edition. (This figure does not include the frontage piece which could be reused.) He seems to have received no payment for his idea, and his copyright for his illustrations seems to have been questionable. The frontage illustration that was issued on the first magazine edition reads \\"The Posthumous Papers of the Pickwick Club ‚Äì containing a faithful record of the perambulations, perils, travels, adventures and Sporting Transactions of the corresponding members. Edited by 'Boz'. With Illustrations\\". Seymour isn't even mentioned as a named contributor. The frontage piece includes all sorts of fishing and shooting references and would fit well with the Nimrod Club idea but fits less well with the Pickwick Club. What sporting ideas may have been held as an original notion by Seymour were not realized in the magazine series, and after Seymour's death the focus of the stories becomes much clearer with more emphasis on ideas preferable to Dickens. Dickens himself created controversy by saying that only 24 pages had been written for the second edition when Seymour committed suicide. It was pointed out by Joseph Grego in the 1899 book 'Pictorial Pickwickian' that in fact Seymour had created the draft image of \\"The Pickwickians in Mr. Wardle's Kitchen\\". The discrepancy is in the idea that the last illustration for the story was to go on page '50'. There were only meant to be 48 written pages complete or in draft stage. But the Pickwickians do end up in Mr Wardle's kitchen by the end of the second magazine issue regardless of what page this data was meant to have been published on. This small point has encouraged belief that Seymour was privy to ideas when there is no reliable evidence to suggest that this is true. No images have been found which belong to ideas written later in the series but only ideas which were published in line with commissioned work for the second magazine. The page count may not include illustrated pages (hardcopy reference required) which would increase the count to a total of 56 sides plus index and frontage pages etc. across the first two editions of the magazine. The Pugnacious Cabman The magazine was to be distributed at the end of each month. The second edition was finished with just three Seymour illustrations. Dickens changed the format for the 3rd edition of the magazine increasing the text to 32 pages and reducing the illustrations to two per issue. Seymour's widow argued that the Pickwick Club would have existed without Dickens and this is not the case. It is clear that the Nimrod Club was Seymour's idea and was in effect a more story-driven version of the highly popular Seymour's sketches, but it is not The Pickwick Papers in its published version. It is clear, however, that it would have been much better for Seymour to pursue his idea for his magazine with another publisher or with a writer less interested in being the dominant partner. It is highly unlikely that Dickens would have created a platform like the Pickwick Club without Seymour's prompting idea, but it is clear that the Pickwick Club is Dickens' creative process in terms of content. Seymour's widow received no royalties, and the success of the project created a sense of injustice. The Pickwick Papers wouldn't have existed without Seymour, but the book and style that was popular and made the large fortune it did, wouldn't have existed if Seymour had had creative control and the format had been similar to Seymour's Sketches. Seymour's suicide came after his struggle with mental illness and his breakdown in 1830. It is thought that Dickens had advertised for a new illustrator for The Pickwick Papers and it is clear that Seymour was struggling to design images in line with Dickens' requirements. \\"The Dying Clown\\" is harsh and emotional, a huge way from the funny and lighthearted illustrations which Seymour had envisioned for the series. Until English law changed in 1870 suicide could produce a verdict of felo de se (felon to self). This meant the person did not receive a religious burial and his family were denied any of his estate which would go to the Crown by default. Therefore, no attributed royalties could go to his widow Jane Seymour from his work per se. The commission then passed to Robert William Buss, but, these being judged unsatisfactory, were then passed to Hablot Knight Browne known as PhizCharlesdickenspage.com Charles Dickens Page from issue four of the magazine until its completion in 1837. Phiz also completed illustrations for the book version as well. Death The Dying Clown The incidents leading up to Seymour's death showed that 24 hours earlier, Seymour had called at Dickens's family home where they discussed the artwork for the chapter on the dying clown story. They had a few drinks (grog) then argued, after which Seymour left. On the day of his death, Chapman had returned \\"The Dying Clown\\" (pictured at right) artwork and arranged to meet Seymour later that evening. Dickens' and Edward Chapman's statements of the incident, (albeit without explanation of how they knew) state that Seymour worked on the new plates well into that night and was found shot the next day. Dickens' statement, among others, mentions that he read about the incident in the morning papers. When Chapman re-issued the, by now best-seller, The Pickwick Papers in book form, he included a disclaimer statement from Dickens stating; \\"Mr. Seymour never originated or suggested an incident, a phrase, or a word to be found in this book. Mr. Seymour died when only twenty-four pages of this book were published, and when assuredly not forty-eight were written;\\" that \\"All of the input from the artist was in response to the words that had already been written;\\" and, in continuation of the a‚ÄôBeckett smears, \\"that he took his own life through jealousy, as it was well known that Seymour‚Äôs sanity had been questioned.\\" Pickwick illustrations *Frontispiece *Mr Pickwick addresses the Club. ‚Äì Chapter 1, Issue 1 (31 March 1836) *The Pugnacious Cabman.

Obituary notices Robert Seymour c. 1836 \\"The success of the Pickwick Papers was due more to the artists pencil than the author‚Äôs pen; it is not generally known that the poor Seymour conceived the characters of Sam Weller and Pickwick before a line of the work was written\\". [The Sun, 1836]. \\"Seymour first furnished the idea of Pickwick Papers. Mr. Dickens wrote the first numbers to his plates. / Seymour was one of the greatest artists since the days of Hogarth\\" (1697‚Äì1764). [Franklins Miscellany, 1836]. \\"The head of the production of two clever artists ‚Ä¶the one, a long established favourite; the other, Mr. Seymour, a gentleman of far superior talent. Mr. Seymour will have the management of all future volumes, so far as the engravings are concerned\\". [Odd Volume. 1836]. Seymour's tombstone Seymour's headstone at the Charles Dickens Museum Seymour was buried in 1836 at St Mary Magdalene Church in Islington. Alterations to the church grounds led to Seymour's tombstone being removed from the grave site and considered \\"lost\\" until 2006 when it was discovered in the church's crypt by author Stephen Jarvis. The tombstone has since been acquired by the Charles Dickens Museum at 48 Doughty Street, London where it went on permanent public display from 27 July 2010. Death and Mr Pickwick In his 2014 novel,Stephen Jarvis, Death and Mr Pickwick, Jonathan Cape, London, 2014 () which is part dramatised fictional biography of Seymour, part forensic analysis of the \\"authorial\\" controversy, part socio-literary history of the entire Pickwick phenomenon, Stephen Jarvis puts together a substantial case against Dickens's and Chapman's accepted version of events. This is plausibly based on inconsistencies in Dickens's various prefaces to the book and flaws in Chapman's supporting testimony, as well as a scrupulous examination of other evidential sources, including internal evidence from Seymour's own work on the project. In particular, the idea that he ever suggested a \\"Nimrod Club\\" publication, based on sporting illustrations, comes under strong scrutiny: Jarvis's narrator concludes that not only the idea, but also the name, physiognomy and character of Mr Pickwick originated in Seymour's imagination.

Life Adolf Dietrich was born to poor farmers in the canton of Thurgau as the youngest of seven children. Upon discovering his exceptional graphical talents, his schoolteacher suggested that he become a lithographer. His parents, however, refused: their youngest son was needed as a farmhand. Dietrich would remain in the house of his parents, as a bachelor, for the rest of his life. Because the small farm provided little income, he had to work as a home worker and as a day labourer in a local textile mill as well as in the woods. Only on Sundays was he free to engage in drawing and painting. His first sketchbook dates to 1896, his first paintings to 1900. He created his works without any training or examples; but he did heed the advice of passing landscape painters to trust in his powers of observation. For years, Dietrich tried without success to have his works shown in public. After his works were first shown in Konstanz in 1913, he received some recognition in Germany, where he was associated with the Neue Sachlichkeit movement and called the \\"German Rousseau\\". In 1924, Dietrich was able to cease his home work thanks to the still meager income provided by the sale of his works in Germany. The income from Germany ceased with the Nazi Machtergreifung in 1933 and the flight of his Jewish art dealer, Herbert Tannenbaum. However, Swiss museums and galleries were now slowly growing interested in Dietrich, and his international breakthrough came in 1937‚Äì38, when the exposition Les ma√Ætres populaires de la r√©alit√© in Paris, Z√ºrich und New York City f√™ted him as the principal representative of na√Øve art. Dietrich retained his modest lifestyle in the face of sudden fame and demand for his works. He was, however, industrious in marketing the output of the \\"master painter of Berlingen\\", as he now called himself. At times, he used (upon his clients' wishes) cardboard templates for the serial reproduction of particularly popular motifs. Only Dietrich's few late works prior to his death in 1957 indicated any stylistic development. Works The motives of Dietrich's works are limited to his immediate surroundings in Berlingen, and include rural landscapes, animals, people and still lifes. He created all of his works at home in his room, using pencil sketches, self-made photographs, stuffed animals and books as models. Drawing on his powers of observation, Dietrich imbued his still lifes and animal paintings with a strong sense of materiality and executed them with what was for an untrained painter an exceptional precision. His images of people and scenes of the imagination, on the other hand, appear comparatively plain or even awkward. The artistic merits of Dietrich's works are found in his strong intuitive sense of colour, which intensifies the impact of his brightly coloured works, and in his outstanding power of observation, which allowed him to combine precision with great attentiveness of his subjects. Some of Dietrich's works are exhibited in the Kunstmuseum des Kantons Thurgau, the Kartause Ittingen, the Kunstmuseum Winterthur, the Museum zu Allerheiligen Schaffhausen and the Kunsthaus Z√ºrich.

Struab FAIA Calvin Chester Straub FAIA (March 16, 1920 ‚Äì October 21, 1998) was an American architect who had significant impact on architecture as both a designer and an educator. His modesty, confidence, passion for life, and no-nonsense approach resonated with a generation that, like himself, came of age in the World War II era. His influence extended through four subsequent generations as a popular professor of Architecture. Straub was a professor of architecture at University of Southern California (1946‚Äì1961) and Arizona State University (1961‚Äì1988). As a senior partner at Buff, Straub and Hensman, he joined forces with his former students and USC alumni to produce an important body of work. The lifestyle magazine Sunset often featured his accomplishments, which were considered influential in shaping a post-World War II contemporary Southern California style. His enthusiasm for architecture inspired generations of students, including Frank O. Gehry, Pierre Koenig, and many others ‚Äî common among gifted and committed instructors, some reached pinnacles of success, wealth, or fame that eluded him. Straub lived and worked at the epicentre of the evolving Southern California architecture of his day. He knew Frank Lloyd Wright (1867‚Äì1959), Henry Mather Green (1870‚Äì1954), R.M. Schindler (1887‚Äì1953) personally, and was briefly an employee of Richard Neutra (1892‚Äì1970).Recollections from notes and conversations between Calvin C. Straub and Wm. Mark Parry; Parry was Straub's last associate. (1991‚Äì1998) His architectural work was published extensively, usually with images by famed architectural photographer Julius Shulman. Straub is best known for his Southern California buildings, especially the approximately 30, mostly residential projects produced in his partnership with Conrad Buff III and Donald Hensman: Buff, Straub and Hensman (1956-1961),later named Buff, Smith and Hensman after Straub's departure. This work won numerous awards. Straub and his contemporaries had a common culture ‚Äî a comradeship born through military training and shared wartime experiences ‚Äî that inspired a progressive architectural movement. The community of like-minded architects who were also military veterans included Craig Ellwood (1922‚Äì1992), Alfred Newman Beadle (1927‚Äì1998), Gordon Drake (1917‚Äì1951), Pierre Koenig (1925‚Äì2009), Ralph Haver (1915‚Äì1987). Brandow House Biography Born March 16, 1920, he spent his earliest years in a residence on Nob Hill in San Francisco. In 1934, the family moved to Mamaroneck, New York; in 1935, to Macon, Georgia; and in 1940, to Los Angeles and then Pasadena. His father, Chester Straub, was a businessman who struggled with the economic impact of the Great Depression. Calvin recalled, \\"I have the clearest memory of my father. He had a V-12 Cadillac convertible sedan. It was chocolate brown and all the valve covers were jewel headed. He wore a black Chesterfield coat with a black homburg. It was the Depression and I don‚Äôt think he had a nickel to his name. But, he had a great car and he looked like a million bucks.\\" Upon high school graduation, Calvin enrolled at Pasadena Junior College, where he took courses in architecture and was active in the ROTC (Reserve Officer Training Center) program. While many of his classmates subsequently enrolled in architecture school at USC, its tuition was beyond Chester Staub's means. He could, however, afford to send his son to Texas A&M;, in College Station, Texas, which he did. Just before the war, Straub married Sylvia Gates (1920‚Äì1974), a granddaughter of William Day Gates, founder of the American Terracotta company and its arts-and-crafts line: Gates TEACO. The firm's terra cotta appears on famous Chicago works by Louis Sullivan and Frank Lloyd Wright. Sylvia Gates In the fall of 1941, Straub arrived in College Station for his university and military education. On December 7 of that year, he was in Independence, Texas, with Professor Bill Caudell and two other students looking at old regional buildings when they heard on the radio that Pearl Harbor had been attacked.A Personal History of the Straub Family During the Last Hundred Years, by Calvin C. Struab, 1996. Straub‚Äôs draft board instructed him to return to Pasadena and wait to be drafted; he chose instead to join the V-12 Navy College Training Program, which allowed him to finish his education while awaiting deployment. In a short time, he went from being an A&M; student to a graduate of USC, the school he had originally hoped to attend. He graduated as an Ensign in 1944 and reported to his ship, L.S.T. 602, in New Orleans to prepare for Europe. As he later recalled, \\"I had taken some classes in navigation, and was then handed a navigator's case with maps and instruments and told to take the ship out of port and to Europe.\\" thumbnail In 1974, Sylvia died prematurely at age 51. As her husband later said, \\"She was my wife but also my partner in our career. We made a pretty good team for over thirty years ‚Äî I still miss her.\\" They had two daughters, Kris and Kathrin. Kathrin went on to become a successful potter and artist in the Gates family tradition. Kris had two children. After Sylvia's death, Straub seemed to lose much of his vitality, most notably in his later years. =Professorship at USC, ASU= BSH with USC students In 1946, after his tour of duty, Straub arrived back in Pasadena, California, intent on resuming his architectural career.Hensman, D.C. and J. Steele, Buff & Hensman. 2004, Los Angeles, CA: University of Southern California Guild Press. At USC, he visited Arthur Gallion, who offered him a teaching position there At the time, USC was a hotbed of new ideas brought about by the aftermath of the war. Straub would eventually become dean of the College of Architecture. He and the school became focused on architectural responses to social issues, such as the population boom in Los Angeles and the need for low-cost housing with limited resources. \\"Employment in hand, Straub still faced the problem so common to millions of other returning veterans; the lack of housing ... Straub's circle of friends included a number of individuals that had never had any construction experience, but, who concluded that if they helped each other, they could solve their housing dilemma. To Straub fell the responsibly of the design of several very low-cost houses\\"[5]. After borrowing a set of plans as an example from Richard Neutra he began to design. He built his cottage in 1947. He developed for them a post and beam structural system. Experimenting by trial and error, the final product was lightweight, yet ridge utilizing large expanses of glass. This system was disseminated through the nation by its publication and Julius Shulman's photography. It measured 16'x24', and had been built by war-surplus materials, \\"the cost was $800.00 plus our own labor and bruised thumbs.\\" said Straub. For this invention, Esther McCoy dubbed Calvin. C. Straub the \\"Father of California Post and Beam Architecture\\" Straub Cottage Straub's early design's were most influential in the era recognized as mid century modernism. A design vocabulary birthed in the LA Basin in the late forties through early sixties of the twentieth century. Straub became an \\"heir of the 'woodsy' Arts and Crafts tradition\\" being \\"acquainted with the modernist movement led in the west by Nuetra but initiated by Walter Gropius, Le Corbusier, and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe,\\" and, because of his own interests, ‚Äúaccepted it with enthusiasm.\\"Interviews with Calvin Straub by Richard A.

Unpublished manuscript partially funded by a grant from the Graham Foundation Struab Cottage Case Study House #20 Street Elevation Case Study House #20 Buff, Straub, Hensmen: photographer Jules Shulman thumb In his book, The Man-made Environment: An Introduction to World Architecture and Design, Straub himself refers to Arts and Crafts architecture only obliquely, focusing instead on \\"the small-scale buildings and houses\\" designed by the Bay Region architects \\"who were continuing to evolve forms of modern architecture in the tradition of Maybeck, Gill, and the Greene Brothers.\\"Winter, R., Toward a Simpler Way of Life: The arts & crafts architects of California. 1997, Berkeley: University of California Press. 310 p. This created a synthesis of strongly divergent influences. This synthesis was informed by a principle based design philosophy rather than aesthetics or technological advancements. \\"Using building materials expressive of the naturalist philosophy of the West, the design theories of the 'Arts and Crafts' Movement, and the functional traditions of the Chicago School, they carried on the development of an 'American architecture' ... Although functional in planning and concept, their designs were not overly concerned with expressing technology or mechanical functionalism as in the European 'international style'. It was more committed to humanism, the natural landscape, and the life styles of people than to abstract principles of theory.\\" Calvin C. Straub created an artisan architecture.artisan architecture His designs were born of craft, not technology, inspired by natural materials, informed by a personal artistic expression yet firmly committed to principles of humanism, function, responsive to the patron, context and climate; for the pleasure of use. > \\"Straub was committed to a humanist architecture.

As architect William Wurster suggested, > \\"Architecture is not a goal. Architecture is for life and pleasure and for > people. The picture frame, and not the picture.\\"Straub, C.C., The Man-made > Environment: An Introduction to World Architecture and Design. Prelim. ed. > 1983, Dubuque, Iowa: Kendall/Hunt. In 1961, Straub moved to Arizona and began teaching at Arizona State University and practising architecture in the region. His later works contributed to the development of the Sonoran Desert regional vocabulary yet maintained the same principles of his earlier work. His work was a bridge between the California art's and crafts architects and the desert modernists. He also travelled the world extensively for his World Architecture lecture course. It was attended by over 12,000 students. His travels drooped into the western architectural design vocabulary forms and world architectural influences. The Western Savings and Loan branch bank in Phoenix, Arizona reflects his inventive creativity. Straub said, \\"We created that roof form to hide the mechanical units, it was a smashing Idea.\\" This project was used for his widely utilized architectural text Design Process and Communications. This roof form swept across the architectural landscape and is arguably the first use of this Polynesian inspired roof form in a modern western structure. Statement of Intent or Manifesto As an introduction to a retrospective exhibit of his work assembled in 1987, Straub recalled a \\"Statement of Intent\\" he wrote as a young architect in the 1950s. He felt that the ideals expressed in this youthful manifesto had retained their validity for him into the twilight of his career. A study of his works should reflect these principles again and again:Richard A. Eribes in The California Houses of Calvin C. Straub: A Modern Crafts Legacy.

It should be an inspiring background for living, not a monument * To create order and unity with simplicity as an antidote for the chaos and environmental anarchy of the times * To approach architecture in a direct and honest manner-not to search for the devious and fashionable * To understand the difference between the validity of traditions and the dead end of the clich√© of eclecticism * To participate in the total architectural process; design, construction, landscape and interiors, to bring it all together as a creative whole * To search for refinement and self-development as opposed to sensationalism and self- indulgence * To continue to learn through the process of observation, experimentation, and active participation in architecture. To live and to build Summary of the characteristics of the Western House In Straub's lecture notes prepared for a 1982 College of Architecture, Arizona State University symposium on the American House for \\"The Historical Development of the Western Home,\\" one recognizes his values. These tenets are what he promoted and likely contributed through his life's work as a designer and educator of a unique form of American Architecture. They also summarize much of the work promoted in that era through Sunset Magazine, and many other western publications, including Arts and ArchitectureArts and Architecture and its case study program that made Straub and others famous. * There is a concern for the \\"Total Environment\\" - the integration of House, Site, and landscaped structure into a unified whole that is harmonious with the natural environment. * These houses are more concerned with the human experience within the house rather than with a pre-occupation with the external appearances. * The Western House is more concerned with creating a background for people rather than a dominating formal statement. Criteria are serenity, unobtrusiveness and avoidance of self-conscious pretentiousness. * The use of simple natural material and expressed structure appropriate to climate, function and site. * Planning is open and fluid-both horizontally and vertically., but still respects and celebrates the biological realities of family life and privacy. * In general the absence of formality reflects the traditional western informal way of living. * To summarize: the Western House is a natural house, more concerned with the well being of the people than with formalism, closely involved with the natural environment, and philosophically dedicated to \\"the good life\\". These observations by Calvin C. Straub on the western home perhaps most clearly define his work, his contribution to architecture and that of those contemporaries who shared similar principles. Those Cal Straub and his comrades would have defined as \\"one of us.\\" Projects Andeen House, Scottsdale Arizona *1946 Calvin Straub \\"Cottage,\\" Altadena, CA *1947 Kenneth Brown \\"Cottage,\\" Sierra Madre, CA *1948 Hugh Gates House, Pasadena, CA *1949 Paul Caler Residence, West La Ca√±ada, CA *1950 Henry Hoag Residence, Pasadena, CA *1951 Richard Sedlacheck Residence, Laurel Canyon Los Angeles *1951 Frank McCauley Residence, Bel Air, Los Angeles, CA *1952 Calvin Straub Residence, Altadena, CA *1952 Virginia Fischer Residence, Mandeville Canyon, CA *1953 Milton Farstein Residence, Pacific Palisades, CA *1953 George Brandwo Residence, San Marino, CA *1953 William Robertson Residence, Altadena, CA *1953 W.

It was previously known as the 5th King Edward's Own Probyn's Horse, which was a regular cavalry regiment of the British Indian Army. It was formed in 1921 by the amalgamation of the 11th King Edward's Own Lancers (Probyn's Horse) and the 12th Cavalry. 11th King Edward's Own Lancers (Probyn's Horse) The regiment known as 11th King Edward's Own Lancers (Probyn's Horse) was originally raised on 1 August 1857 by Captain Frederick Wale as Wale's Horse during the Indian Rebellion of 1857 and served at Lucknow. Captain Wale was killed in action on 1 March 1858, while leading the regiment in the pursuit of rebels, and was replaced by Major Dighton Probyn, VC. In 1860 the regiment was dispatched to China to take part in the Second Opium War. It participated in the advance on Peking and returned to India in 1861 with a good reputation. The regiment saw service in the Second Afghan War of 1878-80 and then took part in the Black Mountains Expedition; it went to Chitral and formed part of the Malakand Field Force. During the First World War, the regiment served in Mesopotamia.Boyle, Maj CA. (1929). The History of Probyn's Horse (5th King Edward's Own Lancers).

Shoulder epaulettes were covered with gilt curb-chains, and plus the Mameluke scimitar. Mussullmen were unique in wearing a kulla, a pointed cap under the puggaree. Made of heavy khaki cloth it gave good protection against the sun, and became popular, even with British officers, who's adopted the puggaree as part of their dress. 12th Cavalry The 12th Cavalry was also raised during the Indian Rebellion of 1857, by Captain PR Hockin in October 1857. It formed part of the 1868 Expedition to Abyssinia (Ethiopia) and served in the Second Afghan War of 1878-80. During the First World War, the regiment fought in the Mesopotamian Campaign. *1857 2nd Sikh Irregular Cavalry *1861 12th Regiment of Bengal Cavalry *1901 12th Bengal Cavalry *1903 12th Cavalry Probyn's Horse (5th King Edward VII's Own Lancers) After the First World War, the number of Indian cavalry regiments was reduced from thirty-nine to twenty-one. However, instead of disbanding the surplus units, it was decided to amalgamate them in pairs. This resulted in renumbering and renaming the entire cavalry line. The 11th King Edward's Own Lancers (Probyn's Horse) and the 12th Cavalry were amalgamated at Meerut on 28 August 1921 to form 5th King Edward's Own Probyn's Horse. The uniform of Probyn's Horse was blue with scarlet facings. The new regiment's badge consisted of the Prince of Wales's plumes. Its class composition was one squadron each of Punjabi Muslims, Sikhs and Dogras. The regiment was mechanised in 1940. During the Second World War, the regiment served with great distinction in Burma. On the Partition of India in 1947, Probyn's Horse was allotted to Pakistan. In 1956, Pakistan became a republic and all titles pertaining to British royalty were dropped. The regiment's new designation was 5 Horse, although informally, it continues to be known as the Probyn's Horse.

Divisions in the Sacred College and the main candidates  The Sacred College of Cardinals was divided into several factions. The strongest of them was the Spanish faction with Madruzzo as unofficial leader. They supported the interests of king Philip II of Spain. Their candidate was Giulio Antonio Santori, head of the Roman Inquisition, called Cardinal S. Severina. His candidature was supported also by the \\"Sixtine\\" party, which included the old favourites and circle of Pope Sixtus V; their leader was Sixtus's cardinal-nephew, Alessandro Peretti de Montalto, Vice-Chancellor of the Church. Montalto supported Santori as a tactical manoeuvre and his real candidate was Aldobrandini. There was also a numerous group of cardinals that openly opposed Santori. Most of them were the old circles of Gregory XIII and Pius IV and their leaders were Sforza, Hohenems and Marcantonio Colonna. Since in the previous two conclaves the candidates supported by Spain had won, it was generally thought that also this time only pro-Spanish papabile had any prospects of winning the election. Besides Santori, only Madruzzo, Tolomeo Gallio, Paleotti, Marco Antonio Colonna and Aldobrandini were acceptable to Spain and it seemed clear that the new Pope would be one of these. Aldobrandini's candidacy was secretely engineered by the French ally Ferdinand I, Grand Duke of Tuscany, and Philip II of Spain remained unaware of it.Vatican History Clemente VIII, Enciclopedia dei Papi, Agostino Borromeo, Treccani, 2000  The conclave  The conclave began on January 10, 1592. The next morning Madruzzo and Montalto together with their adherents tried to elect Santori by acclamation, but their plan failed due to strong opposition from Hohenems and his party. Afterwards the normal voting procedures were followed. Every day a vote took place, with the following results: Cardinal Ippolito Aldobrandini was elected Pope Clement VIII. ‚Ä¢ January 11 ‚Äì Santori ‚Äì 28, Aldobrandini - 11 ‚Ä¢ January 12 ‚Äì Santori ‚Äì 23, Aldobrandini - 18 ‚Ä¢ January 13 ‚Äì Santori ‚Äì 23, Aldobrandini - 18 ‚Ä¢ January 14 ‚Äì Santori ‚Äì 24, Aldobrandini - 9 ‚Ä¢ January 15 ‚Äì Santori ‚Äì 21, Aldobrandini - 13 ‚Ä¢ January 16 ‚Äì Santori ‚Äì 22, Aldobrandini - 13 ‚Ä¢ January 17 ‚Äì Santori ‚Äì 23, Aldobrandini - 13 ‚Ä¢ January 18 ‚Äì ? ‚Ä¢ January 19 ‚Äì Santori ‚Äì 23, Aldobrandini - 12 ‚Ä¢ January 20 ‚Äì Santori ‚Äì 22, Aldobrandini - 15 ‚Ä¢ January 21 ‚Äì Santori ‚Äì 23, Aldobrandini - 17 ‚Ä¢ January 22 ‚Äì Santori ‚Äì 23, Aldobrandini - 12 ‚Ä¢ January 23 ‚Äì Madruzzo ‚Äì 21, Santori ‚Äì 18 ‚Ä¢ January 24 ‚Äì Santori ‚Äì 18, Aldobrandini and Madruzzo ‚Äì 16 each ‚Ä¢ January 25 ‚Äì Santori and Aldobrandini ‚Äì 19 each ‚Ä¢ January 26 ‚Äì Santori ‚Äì 18, Madruzzo - 16 ‚Ä¢ January 27 ‚Äì Santori ‚Äì 21, Madruzzo ‚Äì 16 ‚Ä¢ January 28 ‚Äì Aldobrandini ‚Äì 17, Santori and Madruzzo ‚Äì 15 each ‚Ä¢ January 29 ‚Äì Santori ‚Äì 17, Aldobrandini ‚Äì 16 Santori received the greatest number of votes in almost every ballot, but was not able to secure the required majority of two-thirds and support for him gradually diminished. Eventually on January 29, Cardinal Montalto decided to switch to support the candidature of Ippolito Aldobrandini and was able to secure significant votes for him. Madruzzo then accepted that the opposition against him was too strong and he also switched to Aldobrandini as being more acceptable than Santori. This was the decisive moment of this conclave.  Election of Clement VIII  On January 30, 1592, Cardinal Ippolito Aldobrandini was unanimously elected to the papacy and took the name of Clement VIII. On February 2 he was consecrated to the episcopate by Cardinal Alfonso Gesualdo, bishop of Ostia and Velletri and Dean of the College of Cardinals. Seven days later he was solemnly crowned by Francesco Sforza di Santa Fiora, deacon of S. Maria in Via Lata.Salvadro Miranda: Cardinal Ippolio Aldobrandini (Pope Clement VIII) References  Sources  * List of participants of conclave of 1592 by S.

Between the wars it was used by Austria, Italy, and Poland. During World War II it served as the standard medium howitzer of the Royal Italian Army with the designation Obice da 100/17 modello 14 and after 1943 captured weapons were used by Nazi Germany's Wehrmacht under the designations 10 cm leFH 14(√∂), 10 cm leFH 315(i) and 10 cm leFH 315(j). After World War II an updated howitzer remained in service with the Italian Army until 1975. Design It was a conventional design, although the first versions used an obsolescent wrought bronze barrel liner and a cast bronze jacket. Later versions used a standard steel barrel. The spade was in two pieces, one designed for use in icy ground and the other in normal soil. Two cannoneers sat in seats attached to the shield, as was normal for the period. It was pulled by three pairs of horses when attached to its limber. The Austro-Hungarian Army acquired 6,458 10 cm Mod. 14 howitzers for its Field Howitzer Regiments (\\"Feldhaubitze-Regiment\\") and 346 10 cm M. 16 howitzers for its mountain troops. The Mod. 16 could be broken down into three loads carried on small carts for transport in rough terrain. Postwar some weapons were modernized for motor towing with new rubber-tired wheels and the seats on the shield removed. A more extensive postwar update by Czechoslovakia was designated as the 10 cm houfnice vz. 14/19 and was exported to Poland, Greece and Yugoslavia.  Royal Italian Army  100/17 Lancia 3Ro anti-tank cannon during the North African Campaign During World War I the Royal Italian Army had captured 1,222 10 cm Mod. 14/16 howitzers from the Austro-Hungarian Army. A further 1,472 were given to Italy as war reparations. In Italian service the guns were designated Obice da 100/17 Mod. 14 and Obice da 100/17 Mod. 16. The Royal Army Arsenal in Turin developed a new series of ammunition for the howitzers which were introduced in 1932 and included chemical warfare grenades. At the outbreak of World War II the Royal Army and the Guardia alla Frontiera were fielding 1,325 Mod. 14 in the original Austro-Hungarian configuration and 199 Mod 14, which had their wooden wheels replaced with tires for use in motorized divisions. The artillery of the Alpini mountain troops fielded 181 Mod. 16. howitzers. During the North African Campaign Italian forces mounted the 100/17 Mod. 14 onto Lancia 3Ro heavy trucks and employed the gun as mobile anti-tank cannon.  Italian Army  Italian Army 105/22 Mod. 14/61 105/22 Mod. 14/61 on Janiculum in Rome firing at noon After World War II some of the howitzers were modified by the Military Arsenal of Naples for use as mountain artillery, with the denominations 100/17 Mod. 14 mont. and 100/17 Mod. 16 mont. In the second half of the fifties the howitzers were further modified for the service in the Italian Army with the versions 100/17 Mod. 14/50 for field artillery units and 100/17 Mod. 14/16/50 for mountain artillery units. The modification of the field artillery version included a circular shooting platform, pneumatic wheels and a gun shield taken from reserve Ordnance QF 25-pounder howitzers, while the mountain artillery version omitted the circular shooting platform. In 1961 the weapon was again modified by lengthening the barrel and recalibrating it for NATO ammunition, resulting in a barrel to caliber ratio of 105/22. Accordingly the new version was named: 105/22 Mod. 14/61. This version equipped the field artillery groups of the army's motorized divisions. With the 1975 army reform the 105/22 Mod. 14/61 was taken out of service and stored as reserve until 1984. Today only one 105/22 Mod. 14/61 remains in service with the Italian Army: located in Rome on the Janiculum it is fired since 1991 at noon every day to indicate the time.  Notes   References  Note: The data for this howitzer differs between sources, also considering how often it was modified, and cannot be considered definitive.

Life Edith Edenborough was born in Goulburn, New South Wales, Australia, the second daughter and fifth child of Henry Edenborough and Margaret Stedman. The Edenborough family came from Leicestershire, but relocated to London, where they became prosperous merchants in hosiery and silk. Henry Edenborough was a sea captain and made several voyages to Australia between 1833 and 1837, deciding to settle there in 1840. He acquired a farm south of Goulburn known as 'Wollogorang' and built \\"a handsome two-storey brick and stone rubble building notable for its interesting French windows and its impressive outbuildings\\". This was the family home until 1854 when Henry and Margaret sold the property to John William Chisholm, and returned to England with their family of six children. Henry died in 1855 at Chesham Lodge in Surrey, aged 43.The Gentleman's Magazine vol XLIII. In 1861 the British census records show Edith, 14 years old, living with her widowed mother in Kensington. The 1871 census shows her living with her sister Annie, noted as head of household, at 5 Sheffield Gardens in Kensington, in which year she was exhibiting her work in London. She married the Victorian painter and illustrator Arthur Murch and moved to Rome, where she painted with Giovanni Costa, leader of the Macchiaioli group. In 1876 they both stayed in Venice. Olivia Rossetti Agresti wrote: \\"Costa had a very high opinion of this artist's gifts and used to remember with pleasure how on that occasion they used to go out together to paint from nature at Fusino\\" (Agresti, 1904). She frequently exhibited from 1880 to 1890 at the Grosvenor Gallery and the New Gallery. In 1891, after the death of her first husband, she married Matthew Ridley Corbet, one of the Macchiaioli group's leading members, after which she exhibited mainly at the Royal Academy, visiting Italy and living in London for the remainder of her life. Corbet exhibited her work at the Palace of Fine Arts at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, Illinois. She died in Hampstead, north London, in 1920.

Mayfield Ave The Third Unitarian Church (commonly abbreviated as \\"TUC\\") is a Unitarian Universalist church in the West Side of Chicago, Illinois. It was founded in November 1868. Because of its pioneering architecture for its day, it has become much of a landmark in Chicago, and is now an official landmark. The church is liberal and describes itself as \\"a progressive, welcoming, and diverse congregation\\". History The church was founded in November 1868 by a few practitioners of this religion interested in having a Unitarian church in what was then referred to as Chicago's \\"West Division.\\" They placed an ad in the newspaper calling on others that shared this interest to join them in worship. The minister presiding over these early services was Carlton A. Staples and the congregation originally met at Martine Hall, on Ada Street near Madison. Rev. Staples was officially installed as the first pastor of TUC in June 1869. This significant event included the ‚Äúextension of fellowship‚Äù from Reverend Charles Lowe of Boston, on behalf of the Unitarian Association. The sermon was given by then president of Antioch College, Rev. George Washington Hosmer, D.D.Chicago Tribune. June 1, 1869. The church flourished during Staples time there. The congregation quickly grew to over 100 families, and plans were started for a building dedicated specifically to TUC. The congregation bought land at the corner of Laflin and Monroe Streets. The land was purchased for $13,000 and, according to the Chicago Tribune, was ‚Äúbought on long time and low interest.‚Äù This meant the chief initial financial concern was getting the church built.Chicago Tribune. January 9, 1870. Services and church-related activities were already being held in the above-ground basement of the building before the upper floors were even completed. Construction was slowed by the Great Chicago Fire of 1871, which devastated the businesses of many of the more wealthy congregants. Not only did this reduce the support necessary to continue building, but during this time, the basement was opened up to those displaced by the fire. Nonetheless, the new church was officially dedicated in early 1872.Chicago Tribune. January 28, 1872. Rev. Staples resigned in November 1872 to accept a call to lead a Unitarian church in Providence, Rhode Island.Chicago Tribune. November 24, 1872. In September 1873 the second minister of Third Unitarian Church, Rev. Minot J. Savage, preached his first sermon.Chicago Tribune. September 15, 1873. January 1875 marked the coming of the third minister, Rev. Edwin P. Powell. Regarding Rev. Powell's tenure, the Chicago Tribune reported, ‚ÄúUnder his management, the church has been noted as being the most radical in the city, and Dr. Powell has enjoyed considerable of a reputation abroad for his outspoken sermons.‚ÄùChicago Tribune. June 10, 1877. Though the church resolved its floating debt during this period, financial woes loomed. The church was dormant on an off from mid-1877 through 1880 due to financial issues. Other Chicago Unitarian ministers‚ÄîRev. Robert Collyer, Rev. Brooke Herford, and Rev. Forbush‚Äîheld a service at the church. In addition to rallying the congregation, the hope was to take stock of the financial predicament. Forbush noted a debt of $14,500. The American Unitarian Association had agreed to donate $5,000, provided the church would reduce the debt to $7,000 by borrowing against the church property. The Chicago Tribune characterized Forbush's comments this way: ‚ÄúThe church was now without a shepherd, but if more sacrifices were not made it was barely possible that the members of the Society would find themselves not only without a shepherd but without a fold. In conclusion, he urged upon his hearers the necessity for again taking hold of the project to revive the church and place it in the position which it ought to occupy in this city.‚Äù Forbush went on to say, ‚ÄúThe church could be brought out of its troubles by giving, by faith, by prayer, by courage.‚ÄùChicago Tribune. October 15, 1877. One unnamed Unitarian who wrote a response to this plea in a letter to the editor said, \\"Potatoes are made to grow by putting them into the ground, and then, after tilling. This planting and tilling is called work. This is the only way potatoes ever were known to be produced, and by the same natural process church debts are paid. Faith prayer, and courage never yet grew a potato or paid a church debt, and it never will.‚ÄùChicago Tribune. October 21, 1877. After several difficult years, a new pastor, Rev. Edward I. Galvin, took over the reorganization of Third Unitarian Church in early 1880.Chicago Tribune. January 5, 1880. In 1883, Rev. Galvin was succeeded by Rev. Dr. James Vila Blake, who would preside over the congregation for about 15 years. =Church Fire of 1896= Just as congregants settled in for the 11:00 AM service October 25, 1896, a fire broke out on the lower level. A Sunday school teacher alerted Rev. Blake who was still in his office. Rev. Blake calmly entered the pulpit and asked, ‚ÄúMy friends, I have a request to make of you. I want you all to go quietly out the rear way. There is no danger, and no occasion for haste, but I would like to have you move out quickly and without confusion.‚Äù This level-headed response prompted the headline‚Äî‚ÄúPastor Saves His Flock‚Äù‚Äîin the next day's Chicago Tribune.Chicago Tribune. October 26, 1896. There was enough time to clear the pastor's office of important books and manuscripts, but most everything else was lost. The fire was out by 12:30 PM, but because it was a frame structure, it went fast. The Tribune reported, ‚ÄúA small tower on the southeastern corner of the edifice alone remains intact. All else is either destroyed or charred beyond avail.‚Äù Insurance on the building was $8000 and another $3000 on the organ, which was one of the first in a Chicago church. After the fire, services continued at Lewis Institute at Madison and Robey Streets.Chicago Tribune. September 10, 1897. While Blake saved the congregation, he wasn't growing it at a rate many church members found adequate. In September 1897 Blake resigned. The congregation called Rev. Southworth as an interim minister. =Rebuilding the Church= A ceremony was held in November 1897 to lay the cornerstone of the to-be-built Third Unitarian Church at 3215 W. Monroe Street, near Kedzie.Chicago Tribune. November 19, 1897. Several sites were planned for a new building, and in 1936 an acceptable site was found. At the time of its inception, the architecture planned for the church, designed by Paul Schweikher, was unorthodox and pioneering for its day. Between 1955 and 1963, Chicago artist and church member, Andrene Kauffman designed seventeen ceramic portrait murals for the church, as well as a stained glass window which dominates the south wall. The murals were inspired by a sermon by Dr. Edwin T. Buehrer on the \\"Saints of Liberalism\\" and include portraits of Jane Addams, Susan B. Anthony, Buddha, Albert Camus, William E. Channing, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Gandhi, Goethe, Thomas Jefferson, Jesus, Abraham Lincoln, Socrates, Roger Williams, and Woodrow Wilson, among others. After the building's construction, an addition was added in 1956. The building was officially declared a landmark by Chicago's city council in 1960. Convicted murderer Norman Porter, a former resident of Massachusetts who escaped from prison and moved to Chicago, was a poet and an active member of the church for years under the alias \\"J. J. Jameson\\". He was arrested in 2005 when police entered the minister's office and Porter was present. He is currently serving two consecutive life sentences and three years in prison, but will be eligible for parole in 2010. A documentary film, Killer Poet, was made about his life. Past Ministers =(1868‚Äì1872)= Founding Minister, Carlton A. Staples Excerpt from sermon: ‚ÄúOh, my friends, how easy it is to give ourselves up to one idea, or principle, or teacher, and run on the narrow track of his thought. To say I am a conservative, and then shout, and vote, and pray for whatsoever is conservative, right or wrong. To say, I am a radical, and then shut your eyes on everything not bearing the radical mark; condemning everything and fighting it with relentless bitterness which does not square exactly with the radical rule. To say I am a Parker man, or a Channing man, and then try to walk in his ways, and see with his eyes, and be a mere echo of his opinions. This is servility and narrowness, and intolerance, and slavery. God asks none of these things of us; but to be our selves, to listen with our own ears for His voice, and search with our own eyes for His truths, and reach out in trustful love, and earnest faith, and untiring toil for His goodness. To be men and women in the spirit of Jesus Christ.‚Äù 1873-1874 Rev. Minot Savage 1875-1877 Rev. E.P. Pwell 1877-1880 Rev. Robert Collyer, Rev. Brooke Herford and Rev.

Color analysis demonstrates how certain shades are capable of being flattering or, conversely, unflattering by observing the optical illusions that occur on the face when placing specific colors next to the individual. It is generally agreed that the wrong colors will draw attention to such flaws as wrinkles or uneven skin tone while harmonious colors will enhance the natural beauty of the individual making them appear healthy and fresh-faced. By the 1920s, a color revolution had occurred in the United States with the development of new color industries and the possibility of producing color swatch books used as a marketing tool. Personal color analysis reached a height of popularity in the early 1980s with a recent resurgence in the 2010s after further development and promotion of different versions of seasonal analysis by image and color consultants worldwide. Seasonal analysis is a technique that attempts to place individual coloring into the tonal groupings of Winter, Spring, Summer and Autumn, or their sub-variants. However, the approach can vary greatly among different schools of thought. Some color analysis systems classify an individual's personal combination of hair color, eye color and skin tone using labels that refer to a color's \\"temperature\\" (cool blue vs. warm yellow) and the degree to which the hair, skin and eye colors contrast. Cosmetic colors are often determined by hair or eye color alone. The successful practical application of a color analysis will theoretically allow the individual to coordinate his or her clothing and accessories with greater ease and avoid costly mistakes by purchasing items that are not within their color palette. However, color analysis has continued to be problematic and controversial due to the lack of standard training or degree required to market oneself as a color analyst. This can become costly for the individual, both in regard to the fees of professional and less than professional analyses, and subsequent clothing and cosmetics purchases. Early history (1850s‚Äìearly 1970s) =Chevreul= Michel Eug√®ne Chevreul (1786‚Äì1889) was a French chemist whose career took a new direction in 1824 when he was appointed director of dyeing at the Gobelins Manufactory in Paris, where he worked for 28 years. After receiving several complaints about the lack of consistency in the dye colors, Chevreul determined that the issue was not chemical but optical and focused his attention on exploring optical color mixing. He published his groundbreaking findings in The Laws of Contrast of Colour (1839) where he discussed the concept of simultaneous contrast (the colors of two different objects affect each other), successive contrast (a negative afterimage effect), and mixed contrast. Chevreul's studies in color became the most widely used and influential color manual of the 19th century with a significant and long-lasting impact on the fine and industrial arts. As well as being the first to create a hemispherical color model displaying 72 normal tone hue scales, his exploration of color harmonies is an underlying principle in personal color analysis. In the 1850s, Chevreul's ideas were prescribed for an American audience lacking any education in color harmony. Godey's Lady's Book (1855 and 1859) introduced \\"gaudy\\" American women to Chevreul's idea of \\"becoming colors\\" for brunettes and blondes. =Munsell= Albert Henry Munsell (1858‚Äì1918) is famous for inventing the Munsell color system, one of the first color order systems created. An American painter and art teacher at the Massachusetts Normal Art School, he had visited the tapestry works of Chevreul and studied color in France. With the use of his own unique inventions, including the Photometer that measures object luminance, Munsell started to determine color spaces and standardize the way color was organized and defined. In 1905, Munsell published his first of three books on color, A Color Notation where he discussed his color theory referencing three color dimensions: hue (the discernible shade on the wavelength spectrum), value (lightness to darkness scale), and chroma (softness through to brightness). Prior to the Munsell Color Theory, the intensity of color was defined as 'saturation' in the art and scientific community. Munsell determined that saturation encompassed two different dimensions, value and chroma, where chroma defines the difference between a pure hue and a pure grey. Munsell paid close attention to the human visual system and human response to color, being sensitive to its inclusion in his mapping of three-dimensional color space. In 1917, Munsell founded the Munsell Color Company, for the purpose of improving color communication and education. In the 1930s, the Munsell Color System was adopted by the USDA as the official color system for soil research and the system. The company is now owned by X-Rite who specialize in color calibration. The Munsell Color System still remains the basis of color education today and is the foundation for modern color systems including CIELAB. =Itten= Johannes Itten (1888‚Äì1967) was a Swiss-born artist and art educator who expounded upon the principles of simultaneous contrast which Chevreul set forth in his 1839 treatise. He valued individual artistic expression Droste, Magdalena (2002). Bauhaus: 1919-1933, pp. 24-32. Taschen. . and in 1928, while teaching a class assignment on color harmony, he noticed his students were choosing colors, lines and orientation that showed themselves \\"as they are\\", which led him to formulate the concept of \\"subjective color\\". In his 1961 book The Art of Color,Johannes Itten, The Art of Color Itten examined two different approaches to understanding the art of color: Subjective feelings and objective color principles. Itten described \\"subjective color\\" as \\"the aura of the person.\\" and provided examples or how subjective color might be expressed by an artist: A high contrast brunette will choose dark colors and high contrast, \\"suggesting a lively and concentrated personality and intense feeling.\\" On the other hand, for a fair woman of low contrast the \\"fundamental contrast is hue\\". Furthermore, Itten linked these subjective colors to the four seasons of Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter, which became the foundation for seasonal color analysis. In his book, Itten noted that, \\"Every woman should know what colors are becoming to her; they will always be her subjective colors and their complements.\\" Itten believed that \\"subjective colors\\" were of a lower artistic value and significance than what he deemed \\"objective colors,\\" which were color harmonies of a higher order. In his final chapter titled 'Composition', Itten spoke of bringing two or more colors together in such a way that they harmonize to give an expression unambiguous and full of character. =Dorr= Robert C. Dorr (1905‚Äì1979) was an American artist who, in 1928, observed the harmonious effects of paint colors when grouping those of either a blue or yellow undertone. In 1934 Chicago, Dorr began working on furniture design using his own color theory of undertones and developed his ideas on color psychology. After working on a textile group for a manufacturer, he became a professional color consultant for cosmetic companies. Dorr's Color Key System defined an individual's complexion as being either Key I (cool blue undertone) or Key II (warm yellow undertone).. Each palette in The Color Key Program contain 170 colors per fan. Orange and magenta are the color indicants of yellow and blue undertones respectively. Dorr's Color Key Program took all races into consideration and no race was limited to any one Key palette. After moving to California in the late 1950s, Dorr taught courses and gave lectures on his Color Key Program until his death in 1979. The color company Devoe Reynolds developed paint chips using their Key 1 & Key 2 color matching system from Robert Dorr. =Caygill= Suzanne Caygill (1911‚Äì1994) was an American fashion designer and color theorist who developed the Caygill Method of Color Analysis. A milliner, poet, dress designer and night club singer, as a young adult, Caygill turned her attention to color in 1945 and devoted the rest of her life to creating individual style guides and color palettes for clients and teaching design seminars. Caygill may have been influenced by her association with Edith Head, wardrobe designer and consultant to Hollywood studios and stars. In the 1950s, Caygill starred in a self-improvement television program on fashion and relationships, \\"Living With Suzanne,\\" which aired on CBS in Los Angeles, and began to teach seminars in which she described her work on style, personality, line, and color. Many devotees attended her classes, adapted and popularized her theories of personality style and color analysis in the late 1970s and 80s. In 1980, she published Color: the Essence of You and established the Academy of Color. In this book, Caygill identified a wide range of sub-groups within each season, and gave them descriptive names such as \\"Early Spring\\", \\"Metallic Autumn\\", or \\"Dynamic Winter\\", each with its own set of special characteristics. Caygill believed in the fundamental link between style, color and a person's personality. The Suzanne Caygill Papers, circa 1950‚Äì1990, are held within the Division of Rare and Manuscript Collections, Cornell University Library, Cornell University.The Suzanne Caygill Papers, Circa 1950-1990, Division of Rare and Manuscript Collections, Cornell University Library, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York Seasonal skin tone color matching for clothing and cosmetics Starting in the 1970s, the availability of high-quality, accurate and inexpensive color printing made it possible for the first time to produce books for the mass market in which skin tones and clothing colors could be accurately reproduced.Color reproduction technology was still not perfect, causing Carole Jackson to warn her readers, \\"Because it is difficult to print the color swatches 100 percent accurately, ... verbal descriptions will help you understand the concept of your colors when you shop for clothes.\\" See Carole Jackson, Color for Men. New York: Ballantine Books, 1984, p. 61. The result was the near-simultaneous publication by a number of authors of books proposing systems of color analysis designed to allow the reader to \\"discover which shades of color in clothes complement your natural coloring to look healthier, sexier and more powerful.\\"From the front cover of Carole Jackson, Color for Men. New York: Ballantine Books, 1984. The authors of these books all present roughly similar ideas. Most agree, for example, on the following basic points: *Most rely upon a color system in which the colors are divided into four groups of harmonious colors which are said to match with the four seasons of the year. The seasons are, to some degree, arbitrary, and it sometimes happens that someone will be on the cusp of two seasons. But, as Carole Jackson insists, \\"with testing, one palette will prove to be better [more harmonious] than the other.\\"Carole Jackson, Color for Men. New York: Ballantine Books, 1984, p. 57. Jackson also acknowledges, however, that the reference to the four seasons is nothing more than a convenient artifice: \\"We could call your coloring 'Type A,', 'Type B,' and so on, but comparison with the seasons provides a more poetic way to describe your coloring and your best colors.\\"Carole Jackson, \\"Color Me Beautiful\\". New York: Ballantine, 1980 (revised version, 1985), p. 25. *An individual's basic color category, or season, remains the same over his or her lifetime, and is not affected by tanning, because \\"[w]e still have the same color skin, but in a darker hue.\\"Bernice Kentner, Color Me a Season, p. 26. *Skin color, rather than hair or eye color, determines a person's season. Bernice Kentner warns, \\"Remember, do not rely on hair coloring to find your Season!\\"Bernice Kentner, Color Me a Season' Foremost publications on seasonal color analysis =Deborah Chase, The Medically Based No Nonsense Beauty Book (1975)= Chase explored the impact of skin pigments on coloration. She noted that there are three primary pigments that give the skin its tone: \\"Melanin, which gives the skin its brown tones; carotene imparts the yellow/orange skin tones; and hemoglobin is the red pigment in the blood, which gives the skin its pink and red hues....The three pigments--melanin, carotene, and hemoglobin join one another to produce our flesh tones.\\" =Bernice Kentner, Color Me a Season (1978)= Bernice Kentner, who had worked as a licensed cosmetologist since 1950, began holding lectures on color analysis in the early 1970s,On p. viii of the Preface to the 1983 fifth printing of Color Me a Season, Kentner notes that she has \\"been involved with Color Analysis for a decade or more and 33 years as a licensed Cosmetologist\\". and in 1978 published Color Me a Season, which went through several printings in the early 1980s. Like Chevreul and Suzanne Caygill, Kentner drew her ideas from the art of interior decorating. She wrote, \\"It is possible to color coordinate your home so it is pleasing to the eye....So it is with the human body. The body itself is the background for all color that will be placed upon it. It remains our task then to find what color scheme our bodies fall into. As with the walls of a room we must determine what color our skin is.\\"Color Me a Season, p. 24. Kentner also drew on the ideas of Johannes Itten who linked the subjective colors of an individual to one of the four seasons. Kentner emphasizes that it is skin color rather than hair or eye color that serves as the base from which a color analysis must start. The color of a person's skin determines whether that individual should be classified as a Summer, a Winter, a Spring, or an Autumn. This can cause confusion, because the color of the hair may be the first thing that strikes the observer's eye (particularly if the hair color is dramatic). Thus, \\"even though [one palette of] colors work best for [a particular person's] complexion, the individual may look like another Season because of haircoloring....I call this their secondary Season.\\"Color Me a Season, p. 31. The color of the hair and eyes serve to heighten the appeal of certain color choices for clothing and makeup, and to rule out certain other choices, but all such choices must be made from within the palette that is compatible with the shade of the skin. To illustrate this point, Kentner offers the example of a woman whose dramatic hair color suggested that she ought to be an Autumn, but whose skin color made her a Winter. When the woman was \\"color draped\\" in swatches from the Winter palette, \\"she came to life\\", and looked considerably more attractive than she had been when wearing Autumn colors. However, one of the colors in the palette was incompatible with her hair, and was determined to be inappropriate for her wardrobe.Color Me a Season, p. 25. *Winter Dominant skin characteristics (an individual's skin may include more than one): \\"cool with rose undertones\\"; \\"may appear almost white, yet the skin will be a bit darker than the very pale-skinned 'Summer'\\"; \\"not the translucent look that a 'Summer' person has\\"; \\"Rosy cheeks will not appear naturally on a 'Winter' person\\"; \\"Dark-skinned 'Winters' are usually olive-skinned with a blue undertone.\\" Color Me a Season, p. 30. *Summer Dominant skin characteristics (an individual's skin may include more than one): \\"very pale\\"; \\"It is the Summer person's lot in life to never have a suntan\\"; \\"transparent\\"; \\"fine-textured\\"; \\"light with a rosy-red or lilac undertone that does not come to the surface\\"; \\"not prone to blushing\\"; \\"The overall look of a 'Summer' is colorless\\".Color Me a Season, pp. 26-28. *Spring Dominant skin characteristics (an individual's skin may include more than one): \\"Light amber with gold tones\\"; \\"darker suntanned look with a yellow undercast\\"; \\"There is a tendency to blush easily\\"; \\"often very rosy\\"; \\"there is a lively appearance to skin- tone\\"; \\"The overall appearance of 'Spring' is 'Radiance'\\".Color Me a Season, pp. 28-29. *Autumn Dominant skin characteristics (an individual's skin may include more than one): \\"gold or yellow undertone\\"; \\"more gold or orange-toned than a 'Spring'\\"; \\"Bronze\\".Color Me a Season, p. 29. =The Suzanne Caygill Method= An analyst trained in this system relies on an in-person interview which reveals a range of clues. The most important indicators are the color, light, texture and pattern found in the skin, hair and eyes. Texture, color contrast levels, movement patterns, and facial and body characteristics are secondary indicators that help to determine basic seasonal type and subgroup within the season. Experienced practitioners also often observe predictable personality types and preferences that correspond to a person's seasonal group.Chrisman, Sharon and Lundell, Coralyn, Color Basics/Color Principles, Colour Designers International (2003) *Winter The palette includes colors that are pure pigments, or pigments with added black, or with so much white added as to create an icy, frosted pastel. *Spring Palette colors are usually clear washes or tints, pigments that have white or water added. *Summer These complex palettes may have a blend of black, white, grey or brown added to their pure pigments, creating a wide range of subtle differences. *Autumn The palette is dominated by undertones of natural brown pigment, which may range from ochre, umber, or burnt sienna to browns darkened with black. With this system, almost any color can be found within each season, and many palettes include a combination of both warm and cool tones. The result is nuanced, individualized and unique to each person. The outcome of the analysis is a palette of fabric samples which complement each other and reflect the client. They can then be used as a guide to simplify selection of clothing and accessories and may also be used in choosing home and office interior colors, fabrics and designs.Caygill, Suzanne, Color: The Essence of You, 1980, Celestial Arts, =Carole Jackson, Color Me Beautiful (1980)= The most successful book on seasonal color analysis was Carole Jackson's Color Me Beautiful (1980).Carole Jackson, Color Me Beautiful The book was a 1980s pop- culture phenomenon and spawned a number of related sequels, including Jackson's own Color Me Beautiful Makeup Book, Color Me Beautiful Makeup Book, and Color for Men, (1984),Color for Men, as well as titles in the same line by other authors. Jackson utilized a seasonal color system less complicated than Caygill's, and sought to assist each reader to find her own \\"thirty special colors.\\"The front cover of Color Me Beautiful contains the promise, \\"Whatever your style or mood, you'll glow in your thirty special colors!\\" Carole Jackson, Color Me Beautiful. New York: Ballantine, 1980 (revised edition, 1985). [Carole Jackson was the first of the \\"color analysis authors\\" to create a retail success story based on her highly successful books, selling swatch packets (a wallet designed to house fabric swatches by season) for use as a shopping companion, a successful line of cosmetics and seasonal color swatches Color Me Beautiful, and a direct selling company Color Me Direct featuring Color Analysis as its key home selling strategy. Most recently Color Me Beautiful has acquired the Color Alliance system which employs the use of color coordinates, designed to match eye color, skin tone and hair color; and through the use of computer modeling creates a unique color palette for each user.] *Winter Dominant skin tones (an individual's skin may include more than one): \\"Very white\\", \\"White with delicate pink tone\\", \\"Beige (no cheek color, may be sallow)\\", \\"Gray-beige or brown\\", \\"Rosy beige\\", \\"Olive\\", \\"Black\\" (blue undertone)\\", \\"Black (sallow)\\".Carole Jackson, Color me Beautiful, p. 47. *Summer Dominant skin tones (an individual's skin may include more than one): \\"Pale beige with delicate pink cheeks\\", \\"Pale beige with no cheek color (even sallow)\\", \\"Rosy beige\\", \\"Very pink\\", \\"Gray-brown\\", \\"Rosy brown\\".Carole Jackson, Color me Beautiful, p. 49. *Spring Dominant skin tones (an individual's skin may include more than one): \\"Creamy ivory\\", \\"Ivory with pale golden freckles\\", \\"Peach\\", \\"Peach/pink (may have pink/purple knuckles)\\", \\"Golden beige\\", \\"Rosy cheeks (may blush easily)\\", \\"Golden brown.\\"Carole Jackson, Color me Beautiful, p. 53. *Autumn Dominant skin tones (an individual's skin may include more than one): \\"Ivory\\", \\"Ivory with freckles (usually redhead)\\", \\"Peach\\", \\"Peach with freckles (usually golden blonde, brown)\\", \\"Golden beige (no cheek color, needs blush)\\", \\"dark beige, coppery\\", \\"Golden brown.\\"Carole Jackson, Color me Beautiful, p. 51. =Mary Spillane and Christine Sherlock, Color Me Beautiful's Looking Your Best= Spillane and Sherlock introduced an expanded classification system, in which the four \\"seasonal\\" palettes were expanded to twelve.Color Me Beautiful's Looking Your Best, Veronique Henderson and Pat Henshaw Henderson and Henshaw combine the seasonal analysis method with a classification system based on contrasts in an individual's coloring, returning to the previous color study from Doris Pooser in the early 1990s. Systems of contrast analysis In an attempt to move away from the complexities involved in seasonal color systems, some authors have suggested that it is possible to achieve attractive results by focusing instead on the level of contrast between a person's skin tone and his or her hair and eye colors. =Donna Cognac, Essential Colors= The principles of repeating one's contrast level as well as the color temperatures and intensities that compliment their personal coloring are combined in a system developed by Donna Cognac. It relates 16 different color harmonies to the energy of nature's five elements: Water, Wood, Fire, Earth, and Metal. Palettes are various combinations of these 5 elemental energies. For example, any palette with a very bright appearance or a very warm overall color temperature is a Fire palette to one degree or another and is consistent with the essence of the wearer. =Joanne Nicholson and Judy Lewis-Crum, Color Wonderful (1986)= Another method of analysis was developed by color consultants Joanne Nicholson and Judy Lewis-Crum, whose 1986 book Color Wonderful Joanne Nicholson and Judy Lewis-Crum, Color Wonderful 1986 () explains their classification system, which is based on the amount of contrast in an individual's coloring. =Alan Flusser, Dressing the Man (2002)= Flusser lays out two relatively simple rules: *The degree of contrast between the wearer's skin and his / her hair and eyes should be reflected in the degree of contrast between the colors in his / her clothes. \\"[The] great variety of shadings ... can be scaled down into two basic formats: contrast or muted. If your hair is dark and your skin light, you have a contrast format. If your hair and skin tone are similar, your complexion would be considered muted or tonal.\\"Alan Flusser, Dressing the Man: Mastering the Art of Permanent Fashion. New York: Harper Collins, 2002, p. 21. A high-contrast individual should dress in clothes with highly contrasting colors. The result will be that the \\"high-contrast format [of the clothing] actually invites the eye to look at [the wearer's] face because of its compatibility with his [dark] hair and light skin.\\" By contrast, \\"Encasing a low-intensity complexion within a higher-contrast setting dilutes the face's natural pigmentation in addition to distracting the viewer's eye.\\"Alan Flusser, Dressing the Man: Mastering the Art of Permanent Fashion. New York: Harper Collins, 2002, pp. 21-22. *One or more of the tones in the skin and hair should be repeated in an article of clothing near the face. One option is to repeat the color of the hair in a jacket, tie or scarf, in order to \\"frame\\" the face: \\"The obvious choice of suit shade would be that which repeated his hair color, thereby drawing the observer's attention to what was bracketed in between--in other words, his face.\\" Flusser uses a series of photos of models to demonstrate that it is possible to achieve attractive results by repeating the eye color or the skin tones in clothing articles that are close to the face, and that it is even more desirable to use several colors in the clothes to match some combination of skin / hair / eye colors.Alan Flusser, Dressing the Man: Mastering the Art of Permanent Fashion. New York: Harper Collins, 2002, pp. 24-33. Color psychology Color psychology, an extension of color analysis, is a valuable tool that is used in conjunction with the analysis of colors. In reality, the psychological connotation of a color has nothing to do with its effect upon the color of one's face or the results in the mirror. It is necessary to consider both the physical impact color has upon your appearance, and the impact a color has upon the unique persona that one projects to the world.Sandy Dumont, Tattle Tale Looks =Color seasons= Spring GardenSummer Autumn LeavesWinter ;Spring :Spring colors are clear and bright, just like the colors of a spring day. The sun is low on the horizon, so everything is imbued with the golden hues of the sun. The trees and grass have not yet matured, so they are tinged with yellow undertones and are a bright spring green color. Distinct yellow undertones impart a vibrant, electric appearance to everything. The colors of this season are truly like a spring bouquet of flowers enveloped in bright spring green leafy foliage: red-orange and coral tulips, bright yellow jonquils and daffodils. ;Summer :The colors of this season are muted with blue undertones (think of looking at the scenery through a dusky summer haze). Late summer blossoms, a frothy ocean and white beaches are seen everywhere. Baby blue, slate blue, periwinkle, powder pink, seafoam green and slate grey are typical Summer colors. ;Autumn :Autumn colors are virtually indistinguishable from the rich, earthy colors of the season for which they were named. They are as golden-hued as a fall day, and it is impossible to mistake them for any other season. Typical colors from the palette include pumpkin, mustard yellow, burnt orange, brown, camel, beige, avocado green, rust and teal. Autumn colors are perennially popular, because they bring a feeling of warmth and security. The painting by Millais personifies the color of autumn. ;Winter :The colors from this season are clear and icy, like a winter's day; always with subtle blue undertones. To name a few: hollyberry red, emerald and evergreen, royal blue, magenta and violet. Winter inspires pictures of winter berries, pine green conifers and black and white huskies racing through snow.

Descriptions of the condition date back to at least 1907. They can occur during acute intoxication or withdrawal with the potential of having delirium tremens. Alcohol hallucinosis is a rather uncommon alcohol-induced psychotic disorder almost exclusively seen in people with severe, recurrent alcohol use disorder (formerly known as chronic alcoholics) who have many consecutive years of severe and heavy drinking during their lifetime. Alcoholic hallucinosis develops about 12 to 24 hours after the heavy drinking stops suddenly, and can last for days. It involves auditory and visual hallucinations, most commonly accusatory or threatening voices.Alcohol Merck Manual, February 2003. The risk of developing alcoholic hallucinosis is increased by long-term heavy alcohol abuse and the use of other drugs. Cause The cause of alcoholic hallucinosis is unclear. It seems to be highly related to the presence of dopamine in the limbic system with the possibility of other systems. There are many symptoms that could possibly occur before the hallucinations begin. Symptoms include headache, dizziness, irritability, insomnia, and indisposition. Typically, alcoholic hallucinosis has a sudden onset. Alcoholic hallucinosis vs. delirium tremens Both alcoholic hallucinosis and DTs have been thought of as different manifestations of the same physiological process in the body during alcohol withdrawal. Alcoholic hallucinosis is a much less serious diagnosis than delirium tremens. Delirium tremens (DTs) do not appear suddenly, unlike alcoholic hallucinosis. DTs also take approximately 48 to 72 hours to appear after the heavy drinking stops. A tremor develops in the hands and can also affect the head and body. A common symptom of delirium tremens is that people become severely uncoordinated. The biggest difference between alcoholic hallucinosis and delirium tremens is that alcoholic hallucinosis have a much better prognosis than DTs. Moreover, delirium tremens can be fatal when untreated. Treatment In general, alcohol abusers with withdrawal symptoms, such as alcoholic hallucinosis, have a deficiency of several vitamins and minerals and their bodies could cope with the withdrawal more easily by taking nutritional supplements. Alcohol abuse can create a deficiency of thiamine, magnesium, zinc, folate, and phosphate as well as cause low blood sugar.Alcohol-Withdrawal However, several tested drugs have shown the disappearance of hallucinations. Neuroleptics and benzodiazepines showed normalization. Common benzodiazepines are chlordiazepoxide and lorazepam. It has been shown that management has been effective with a combination of abstinence from alcohol and the use of neuroleptics. It is also possible to treat withdrawal before major symptoms start to happen in the body. Diazepam and chlordiazepoxide have proven to be effective in treating alcohol withdrawal symptoms such as alcoholic hallucinosis. With the help of these specific medications, the process of withdrawal is easier to go through, making alcoholic hallucinosis less likely to occur.Pharmacologic Treatment of Withdrawal See also * Seeing pink elephants * The Lost Weekend, a novel and Oscar winning film that includes a fictional portrayal of the illness References  External links  Category:Alcohol abuse Category:Addiction psychiatry Category:Neurological disorders ru:–ê–ª–∫–æ–≥–æ–ª—å–Ω—ã–µ –ø—Å–∏—Ö–æ–∑—ã#–ê–ª–∫–æ–≥–æ–ª—å–Ω—ã–µ –≥–∞–ª–ª—é—Ü–∏–Ω–æ–∑—ã ","title":"Alcoholic hallucinosis"},{"id":"18193964","text":"In physics and mathematics, the Œ∫-Poincar√© algebra, named after Henri Poincar√©, is a deformation of the Poincar√© algebra into a Hopf algebra.

Its name comes from the feud of Madon√¨a which belonged to the noble family of La Farina from Palermo and then to the Marquises Crescimanni of Madon√¨a. Geography The range is located within Palermo Province of Sicily. It is part of the Sicilian extension of the Apennine Mountains System that runs along the Italian Peninsula. The range includes the next highest elevation mountain summits of Sicily after Mount Etna. The highest peak of the range is Pizzo Carbonara at , followed by neighboring Pizzo Antenna at . Madonie Regional Natural Park The mountains were safeguarded in 1989 by the formation of the Madonie Regional Natural Park, a regional natural park. Madonie Geopark is a member of the European Geoparks Network and the UNESCO Global Network of National Geoparks. =Features= Within the park area, there are outcrops of rocks that have been dated over a 200-million-year period and represent all aspects of the geology of Sicily apart from present-day volcanic activity. There is a wide range of fossils present within the mountains' rocks. Buildings made from these rocks in the Madonie's towns often show visible fossils. The area was famous for the Circuito Piccolo delle Madonie, where the Targa Florio race was held from 1906 to 1977.

Biography Nuridsany was born in 1925 to an Armenian father from Ani (like much of the Armenian community in Transylvania) and a Hungarian mother. His uncle Jozef Nuridsany was a famous chemist and professor. During his secondary school years he became a pillar of the Fine Arts Circle of Nandor Nagy in Budapest. His supporters considered him as a member of new generation of the European School and a promising talent. In 1948 he received a grant of the Hungarian Academy of Rome. The colors and forms he used turned the attention of a number of Italian magazines and newspapers. In Hungary he became concerned with the theory and practices of mural art. In 1949 his monumental mosaic scheme was exhibited at the MEFESZ Exhibition. His talent was recognized by Mariusz Rabinovszky and Lajos Fulep. In 1949-1950 the \\"Quadriga\\" exhibition was founded by Ferenc Janossy, Nuridsany and others. His well-known monumental work is \\"The Engineer\\" mosaic on the outside wall of the Engineering School in Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r. His design won 2 awards not long before he died. In 1962 an independent exhibition was held in the Fenyes Adolf Gallery. Nuridsany was a friend of Armenian poet Sarmen and his family. On Sarmen's invitation he visited Soviet Armenia in 1972. His apartment in Budapest has always been a center of the Armenian culture. In 2000 Nuridsany's exhibition was opened at the National Gallery of Armenia.

In the United States, it is recognized as establishing the \\"knock- and-announce\\" rule. Facts Richard Gresham and George Berisford were joint tenants of a house in Blackfriars, London. Berisford died while in debt to Peter Semayne. Semayne then secured a civil writ of attachment on Berisford's goods, which were located inside the house. After the Sheriff of London was denied entry by Gresham, the Sheriff offered to break and enter into the house. Instead, Semayne sued, bringing an action on the case against Gresham for his losses.http://www.commonlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1572/333.pdf Initially, the court could not reach a decision, with Lord Chief Justice John Popham and Lord Justice Francis Gawdy believing the Sheriff could break and enter, while Lord Justices Edward Fenner and Christopher Yelverton insisting he could not. After the English coronation of King James VI and I and the appointment of Lord Justice David Williams to the bench, the case was reargued. Judgment In 1604, the Court of King's Bench gave judgment against Semayne.Sir Edward Coke, The Selected Writings and Speeches of Sir Edward Coke, ed. Steve Sheppard (Indianapolis: Liberty Fund, 2003). Vol. 1. 3/22/2017. The court resolved: *It is not a felony for a man to defend his house to the death. *Sheriffs may break and enter to recover seisin over real estate. *Sheriffs may break and enter on the King's business after a request for entry is refused. *Sheriffs may enter when the door is open. *The householder's privilege does not extend to strangers or their goods. *Sheriffs should request entry in civil cases. As authority, Coke reported citation to a statute enacted by King Edward III of England in 1275, which he said merely affirmed the pre-existing common law.Wilson v. Arkansas, 514 U.S. 927, at 932 fn. 2 citing 5 Co. Rep., at 91b, 77 Eng. Rep., at 196 (referring to 3 Edw. I, ch. 17). The holding of the case can best be summed by Coke's words: The case is also famous for Coke's quote: Influence In 1605, Coke published the case in the fifth volume of his Reports. After his Petition of Right, Coke, in his Institutes of the Lawes of England, adopted the view alone that warrants issued on bare suspicion violate the Magna Carta. After the Interregnum, Sir Matthew Hale wrote in his Historia Placitorum Coron√¶ that an arrest without a warrant could be made by forced entry. After the Glorious Revolution, William Hawkins and Sir Michael Foster thought no forced entry was permissible if a warrant issued on bare suspicion. In his Commentaries on the Laws of England, Sir William Blackstone emphasized the castle doctrine but took the view that forced entry was permitted if the suspected felony had actually occurred. The rule was relied upon in the landmark case of Entick v Carrington [K.B. 1765], when Lord Camden held that no general warrant could issue on suspicion of seditious libel. Lord Mansfield, however, was skeptical of limits to forced entry by holding in 1772 that officials were allowed to obtain entry by fraud and in 1774 that the limit applied only to a dwelling's outer door. The sentiment of \\"an Englishman's home is his castle\\" became very popular,http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/an-englishmans-home-is-his- castle.html with William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham famously speaking against the Cider Bill of 1763 by telling Parliament: Blackstone‚Äôs language on the castle doctrine was also very popular in the United States, where it was widely followed by state courts. In Miller v. United States (1958), the US Supreme Court recognized that police must give notice before making a forced entry and in Ker v. California (1963), a divided Court discovered that the limitation was extended to the states by the US Constitution. However, in Wilson v. Arkansas (1995) the US Supreme Court created an exception to prevent the destruction of evidence and in Hudson v. Michigan (2006), it held in a 5-4 vote that the exclusionary rule does not require the suppression of evidence seized by police during an illegal forced entry. Recently, police in the United States often give no notice before forced home entry during the widespread use of no-knock warrants.

Bargate Ward had 18,762 residents in the 2011 Census, which had risen to an estimated 20,926 in mid 2015. The ward takes its name from the Bargate, the northern gate of the old City Walls which still stands today, and is bounded by (clockwise from West) Freemantle Ward, Bevois Ward, Peartree Ward and Woolston Ward.  Boundary Changes  Under the Boundary Committee Review recommendations, implemented in 2002, Bargate Ward was reduced in size to deal with rapid population growth. In 1999 there had been 12,714 registered voters, and this figure was expected to rise to 14,025 by 2004. The boundary changes resulted in almost a quarter of its electorate being shifted to Bevois and Freemantle wards, making the adjusted electorate 9,746 in 1999, with a projected 10,801 in 2004.

The Second XV, known as the Druids, play in the Monmouthshire League. The club also runs a youth team, junior and mini rugby sections. History Monmouth Rugby Football Club was founded in 1873. The game was brought into the town through Monmouth School. A master introduced it and it was a combination of older boys and town players who made up the team before eventually separating.Keith Kissack, Victorian Monmouth, The Monmouth Historical and Educational trust, , page 191 The Monmouthshire Beacon bears evidence of the first official town team in 1878. On the 24th October 1879 at the annual meeting, it was decided to change the name from \\"The Monmouth Football Club\\" to \\"The Monmouth (Drybridge) Football Club and the kit colours to be those of Mr Crompton-Roberts, very red and black.https://newspapers.library.wales/view/3420182/3420184/19/football Rugby was very strong in the town in the 1880s and 1890s. Sometime in 1885 Monmouth FC amalgamated with Monmouth Rangers, playing their first match since amalgamating against Monmouth Grammar School on 8th October 1885, which was played on Old Dixton Road, Monmouth, where Monmouth Town beat the School team by 3 goals, five tries, and 6 touches down in self-defence to nil.https://newspapers.library.wales/view/4404497/4404500/56/football In addition to the senior side there was a junior side known as Monmouth Juniors. The 1888-1889 team under the leadership of E. Dodds were \\"Invincible\\". They played 15, won twelve and drew three. In their ranks they had P.L. Nicholas an England international. The Monmouthshire Beacon proclaimed, that the phenomenal success of the club had been, not due to luck but downright hard work and thoroughly deserved the title \\"Invincible\\". In 1902 the team were \\"Invincible\\" again. They played 20, won 17 and drew three under the captaincy was R.G.Williams. The club displays in its lounge a photograph of the team and the caps that were awarded to L.Merrick and T.Hughes who were members of that great side. In the 1930s, Monmouth fielded several good sides. In 1932, the team had a cosmopolitan make-up, containing A.C. Smith an Australian, R. Thompson a Scottish international, Peter Hordern an English international and Scotsman Crictai Millar. The 1935-1936 team was of some note. They had an impressive record, playing 33, and winning 28, drawing four and lost only once. They had 267 points for and 97 against. A year earlier the club started playing on Monmouth Sportsground for the first time. The Sportsground remains the main venue for the club, although today it requires pitches on Chippenhan to accommodate 2nd XV, Youth, Junior and Mini Rugby Teams. In 1969 the club took over the Druid's Head Inn public house which today is its headquarters. This building became a Grade II Listed building in August 1974. In 1984-1985 the club built a lounge extension and new changing rooms. In 1998 a two storey extension was built to provide a large function room with a new kitchen on the first floor and a larger ground floor bar area. The latter project cost over ¬£85,000 and was paid for by fund raising events. In the 1980s another Monmouth boy and Cambridge Blue, captained Wales. Butler another No. 8, went on to play for Wales, sixteen times and captained Wales in six major internationals; he also toured New Zealand with the British Lions. In 1975-1976 the club produced its first Welsh Youth cap. David Fryer went on to captain Ebbw Vale and was selected to tour Canada with the Welsh team but injury prevented him going. The club continues to run a Youth XV and several members have represented their District XV. One of the notable moments for the Youth was at the Tiverton Youth Sevens Tournament in 1976.

Design and development The S.M.1 A3 was developed from 1915 to meet the French military A3 specification, which called for a three-seat long range reconnaissance aircraft with strong defensive armament. The S.M.1 was unconventional, powered by a single Salmson 9A liquid-cooled radial engine mounted in the fuselage powering two airscrews mounted between the wings with a system of gears and drive shafts. This layout was chosen by Moineau to minimise drag. The twin airscrew layout allowed a wide field of fire for the two gunner-observers, one seated in the nose and one behind the pilot. Both gunners operated ring-mounted flexible 37 mm APX cannon built by Arsenal Puteaux. The airframe itself was relatively conventional, the boxy fuselage mounted on a system of struts between the wings. The undercarriage included a nose wheel, intended solely to prevent the aircraft nosing over, and a tail skid. One aircraft may have been fitted experimentally with a Salmson (Canton- Unne) P.9 engine. A single S.M.2 S2 aircraft, with an additional Salmson 9A engine in the nose driving a conventional tractor airscrew, was tested with poor results, due to inadequate engine cooling, in 1918. Operational history The aircraft was tested in early 1916 and was sufficiently successful to receive an order for 100 aircraft although the performance was inferior to the Sopwith 1¬Ω Strutter. In service the S.M.1 was not successful. The nose-wheel undercarriage would collapse if misused and this caused many accidents. The complicated transmission system was difficult to service in the field and the performance of the aircraft was poor. It appears that around 155 S.M.1s were built in total. The type was largely withdrawn from service in 1917 but a small number of aircraft remained in use until late 1918. Some S.M.1s were supplied to the Imperial Russian Air Service, but they were no better liked in Russia.

Completed in 1869, it is a prominent example of Gothic Revival architecture designed by that style's leading proponent, Richard Upjohn. It is one of Upjohn's last designs, and was largely funded by Asa Packer, a local millionaire whose fortunes were made in the coal fields. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1977, and declared a National Historic Landmark in 1987. and Note: This includes Description and history St. Mark's Church occupies a prominent location in the historic center of Mauch Chunk, as this part of Jim Thorpe was originally known, on the south side of Race Street just west of Susquehanna Street. It is a stone structure, built primarily out of local gray stone, with red stone as trim. It is set partly on natural terrace in a steeply sloping hillside, which has been extended and supported by a stone retaining wall. The church has a cruciform plan, with a square tower rising at the northeast corner. The outer corner of tower is extended by an octagonal stair turret, which rises a short way beyond the crenellated tower top to its own conical roof. The interior is tiered with the entrance and a small chapel at the lowest level, an intermediate level with another chapel, and then the main sanctuary. Movement between the levels is facilitated in part by a 1912 Otis elevator. The interior is lavishly appointed, with English tile, imported mahogany, and stained glass windows by Louis Comfort Tiffany and others. The church was designed by Richard Upjohn and was officially consecrated on October 25, 1869. The congregation was established in 1829, and its first church was completed on this site in 1848, with a formal consecration in 1852. The Mary Packer-Cummings Memorial Building, designed by Addison Hutton, was added to the church in 1912 when the 1912 Otis Cage Elevator was put in, this combine the two buildings that were once separate. However, the Memorial Building was originally built in 1881. Asa Packer was a vestryman for 44 years and warden for 24 years. He and his family donated considerable funds toward the construction of the church and its additions. The church is a late work of Upton's, and represents a relatively pure version of the Gothic Revival, well removed from the stylistic elements of the Greek Revival that he began his career with. The church congregation declined during the Great Depression, and it entered a cost- sharing agreement with Mauch Chunk's other Episcopal congregation, St. John's. The two were formally merged in 1980, and the St. John's church building was sold in 1984.

Critical perspectives emerged in the nineteenth century that were especially based on the principles of free trade.Johns, Adrian: Piracy. The Intellectual Property Wars from Gutenberg to Gates. The University of Chicago Press, 2009, Contemporary criticisms have echoed those arguments, claiming that patents block innovation and waste resources that could otherwise be used productively, and also block access to an increasingly important \\"commons\\" of enabling technologies (a phenomenon called the tragedy of the anticommons), apply a \\"one size fits all\\" model to industries with differing needs,Richard A Posner for The Atlantic.

Why There Are Too Many Patents in America that is especially unproductive for industries other than chemicals and pharmaceuticals and especially unproductive for the software industry.Bessen, James, and Michael J. Meurer. Patent Failure: How Judges, Bureaucrats, and Lawyers Put Innovators at Risk. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2008. 2009 paperback edition, Enforcement by patent trolls of poor quality patents has led to criticism of the patent office as well as the system itself. Patents on pharmaceuticals have also been a particular focus of criticism, as the high prices they enable puts life- saving drugs out of reach of many people.Banta D.H. (2001) Worldwide Interest in Global Access to Drugs Journal of the American Medical Association 285 (22): 2844‚Äì46 Alternatives to patents have been proposed, such Joseph Stiglitz's suggestion of providing \\"prize money\\" (from a \\"prize fund\\" sponsored by the government) as a substitute for the lost profits associated with abstaining from the monopoly given by a patent.Stiglitz, Joseph. Project Syndicate, 2007. project-syndicate.org These debates are part of a larger discourse on intellectual property protection which also reflects differing perspectives on copyright. History Criticism of patents reached an early peak in Victorian Britain between 1850 and 1880, in a campaign against patenting that expanded to target copyright too and, in the judgment of historian Adrian Johns, \\"remains to this day the strongest [campaign] ever undertaken against intellectual property\\", coming close to abolishing patents. Its most prominent activists - Isambard Kingdom Brunel, William Robert Grove, William Armstrong and Robert A. MacFie - were inventors and entrepreneurs, and it was also supported by radical laissez-faire economists (The Economist published anti-patent views), law scholars, scientists (who were concerned that patents were obstructing research) and manufacturers. Johns summarizes some of their main arguments as follows:W.R. Grove: Suggestions for Improvements in the Administration of the Patent Law, The Jurist n.s. 6 (January 28, 1860) 19-25 (online copy at Google Books)B. Sherman, L. Bently: The Making of Modern Intellectual Property Law (CUP 1999), 50-56 :[Patents] projected an artificial idol of the single inventor, radically denigrated the role of the intellectual commons, and blocked a path to this commons for other citizens ‚Äî citizens who were all, on this account, potential inventors too. [...] Patentees were the equivalent of squatters on public land ‚Äî or better, of uncouth market traders who planted their barrows in the middle of the highway and barred the way of the people. Similar debates took place during that time in other European countries such as France, Prussia, Switzerland and the Netherlands (but not in the USA). Based on the criticism of patents as state-granted monopolies inconsistent with free trade, the Netherlands abolished patents in 1869 (having established them in 1817), and did not reintroduce them until 1912.Chang, Ha-Joon. \\"Kicking Away the Ladder: How the Economic and Intellectual Histories of Capitalism Have Been Re-Written to Justify Neo-Liberal Capitalism\\". Post-Autistic Economics Review. 4 September 2002: Issue 15, Article 3. Retrieved on 8 October 2008. In Switzerland, criticism of patents delayed the introduction of patent laws until 1907. Contemporary arguments Contemporary arguments have focused on ways that patents can slow innovation by: blocking researchers' and companies' access to basic, enabling technology, and particularly following the explosion of patent filings in the 1990s, through the creation of \\"patent thickets\\"; wasting productive time and resources fending off enforcement of low-quality patents that should not have existed, particularly by \\"patent trolls\\"; and wasting money on patent litigation. Patents on pharmaceuticals have been a particular focus of criticism, as the high prices they enable puts life-saving drugs out of reach of many people. =Blocking innovation= The most general argument against patents is that \\"intellectual property\\" in all its forms represents an effort to claim something that should not be owned, and harms society by slowing innovation and wasting resources. Law professors Michael Heller and Rebecca Sue Eisenberg have described an ongoing tragedy of the anticommons with regard to the proliferation of patents in the field of biotechnology, wherein intellectual property rights have become so fragmented that, effectively, no one can take advantage of them as to do so would require an agreement between the owners of all of the fragments. Some public campaigns for improving access to medicines and genetically modified food have expressed a concern for \\"preventing the over-reach\\" of intellectual property protection including patent protection, and \\"to retain a public balance in property rights\\".Susan K Sell (2003), Private Power, Public Law: The Globalization of Intellectual Property Rights, Cambridge, 2003 Cambridge University Press: Cambridge Studies in International Relations: 88; quoted from page 179, see also page 5. Some economists and scientists and law professors have raised concerns that patents retard technical progress and innovation. Others claim that patents have had no effect on research, based on surveys of scientists. =Poor patent quality and patent trolls= Patents have also been criticized for being granted on already-known inventions, with some complaining in the United States that the USPTO fails \\"to do a serious job of examining patents, thus allowing bad patents to slip through the system.\\"Lemley, Mark A., Rational Ignorance at the Patent Office (February 2001). Northwestern University Law Review, Vol. 95, No. 4, 2001. On the other hand, some argue that because of low number of patents going into litigation, increasing quality of patents at patent prosecution stage increases overall legal costs associated with patents, and that current USPTO policy is a reasonable compromise between full trial on examination stage on one hand, and pure registration without examination, on the other hand. Enforcement of patents ‚Äì especially patents perceived as being overly broad ‚Äì by patent trolls, has brought criticism of the patent system, though some commentators suggest that patent trolls are not bad for the patent system at all but instead realign market participant incentives, make patents more liquid, and clear the patent market.James F. McDonough III (2006) The Myth of the Patent Troll accessed 2010-01-17 Some patents granted in Russia have been denounced as pseudoscientific (for example, health-related patents using lunar phase or religious icons). =Litigation costs= According to James Bessen, the costs of patent litigation exceed their investment value in all industries except chemistry and pharmaceuticals. For example, in the software industry, litigation costs are twice the investment value. Bessen and Meurer also note that software and business model litigation accounts for a disproportionate share (almost 40 percent) of patent litigation cost, and the poor performance of the patent system negatively affects these industries.Rob Wheeler and James Allworth for the Harvard Business Review. Sept 15, 2011 U.S. Patent Overhaul Won‚Äôt Help Innovators =Different industries but one law= Richard Posner noted that the most controversial feature of US patent law is that it covers all industries in the same way, but not all industries benefit from the time- limited monopoly a patent provides in order to spur innovation. He said that while the pharmaceutical industry is \\"poster child\\" for the need for a twenty- year monopoly, since costs to bring to a market are high, the time of development is often long, and the risks are high, in other industries like software the cost and risk of innovation is much lower and the cycle of innovation is quicker, and obtaining and enforcing patents and defending against patent litigation is generally a waste of resources in those industries. =Pharmaceutical patents= Some have raised ethical objections specifically with respect to pharmaceutical patents and the high prices for medication that they enable their proprietors to charge, which poor people in the developed world, and developing world, cannot afford.Ferreira L. (2002) Access to Affordable HIV/AIDS Drugs: The Human Rights Obligations of Multinational Pharmaceutical Corporations Fordham Law Review 71(3):1133‚Äì79 Critics also question the rationale that exclusive patent rights and the resulting high prices are required for pharmaceutical companies to recoup the large investments needed for research and development. One study concluded that marketing expenditures for new drugs often doubled the amount that was allocated for research and development.Barton J.H. and Emanuel, E.J. (2005) The Patents-Based Pharmaceutical Development Process: Rationale, Problems and Potential Reforms Journal of the American Medical Association 294(16): 2075‚Äì82 In 2003, World Trade Organization (WTO) reached an agreement, which provides a developing country with options for obtaining needed medications under compulsory licensing or importation of cheaper versions of the drugs, even before patent expiration.Decision removes final patent obstacle to cheap drug imports In 2007 the government of Brazil declared Merck's efavirenz anti- retroviral drug a \\"public interest\\" medicine, and challenged Merck to negotiate lower prices with the government or have Brazil strip the patent by issuing a compulsory license. It is reported that Ghana, Tanzania, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Ethiopia have similar plans to produce generic antiviral drugs. Western pharmaceutical companies initially responded with legal challenges, but some have now promised to introduce alternative pricing structures for developing countries and NGOs. In July 2008 Nobel Prize-winning scientist Sir John Sulston called for an international biomedical treaty to clear up issues over patents. In response to these criticisms, one review concluded that less than 5 percent of medicines on the World Health Organization's list of essential drugs are under patent.Ghafele R (2008) Perceptions of Intellectual Property: A Review London: Intellectual Property Institute Also, the pharmaceutical industry has contributed US$2 billion for healthcare in developing countries, providing HIV/AIDS drugs at lower cost or even free of charge in certain countries, and has used differential pricing and parallel imports to provide medication to the poor. Other groups are investigating how social inclusion and equitable distribution of research and development findings can be obtained within the existing intellectual property framework, although these efforts have received less exposure. Quoting a World Health Organization report, Trevor Jones (director of research and development at the Wellcome Foundation, as of 2006) argued in 2006 that patent monopolies do not create monopoly pricing. He argued that the companies given monopolies \\"set prices largely on the willingness/ability to pay, also taking into account the country, disease and regulation\\" instead of receiving competition from legalized generics. Proposed alternatives to the patent system Alternatives have been discussed to address the issue of financial incentivization to replace patents. Mostly, they are related to some form of direct or indirect government funding. One example is Joseph Stiglitz's idea of providing \\"prize money\\" (from a \\"prize fund\\" sponsored by the government) as a substitute for the lost profits associated with abstaining from the monopoly given by a patent. Another approach is to remove the issue of financing development from the private sphere altogether, and to cover the costs with direct government funding.Baker, Dean. \\"The Reform of Intellectual Property\\". post-autistic economics review, issue no. 32, 5 July 2005, article 1, Paecon.net See also * Anti-copyright * Free culture * Glossary of patent law terms * List of patent-related topics * Criticism of the United States Patent and Trademark Office * Notable reexaminations * Patentleft * Software patent debate References .

He was a member of both the Young Irelanders and the Fenians. Early life John Savage, who was born in Dublin on 13 December 1828. As a young art student in Dublin he was drawn into the insurrectionary movement in '48.\\"The Young Irelanders\\", T. F. O'Sullivan, The Kerryman, Tralee, 1st Edition July 1944. Pg 350 On 11 March 1848 he wrote a letter which appeared in The Nation newspaper stating: \\"A the period, I trust, is rapidly approaching when the skill and valour of our citizen soldiers will be put to the test, I am induced, on the part of a large number of students of the different professions, to suggest the immediate organisation in Dublin of a society on the basis of the Ecole Polytechnique of Paris.\\"The Nation, 11 March 1848, The article continued: \\"I think the necessity for such an organisation at the present crisis is obvious, because, although I know that the determined aid of a larger proportion of students may be relied on in support of Nationality, I feel no less certain that the discipline, skill and united action essential to render that aid effective are sadly wanting. I refrain from entering into the details and the objects and the duties of such a society which, doubtless, will at once suggest themselves to your mind, and which, I believe, could by no one be more fitly mapped out than by you who have laboured so strenuously to rouse the young blood of Ireland for the noble struggle which is approaching. I am sure that many veteran Irishmen who have served as officers in the British Army would lend us their aid in the direction of such an under taking.\\" A Students' Club was later formed as a direct result of this letter. Students' Club In April 1848, Savage and John de Courcey Young produced a provocative publication called The Patriot, which was at once suppressed and seized by the British Government. In the same month, at a meeting of the Students' Club, with Savage presiding, at their rooms, No. 27 Eden Quay, it was decided to appoint a subcommittee of five \\"to ascertain and report on the best method of the members of the Club arming themselves individually.\\" This followed on from a proposition by Richard Dalton Williams, one of the most popular of all The Nations poets.\\"The Young Irelanders\\", T. F. O'Sullivan, The Kerryman, Tralee, 1st Edition July 1944. Pg 243 & 350 Irish Tribune Savage wrote poems for The Irish Tribune, the first number of which appeared on 10 June 1848, and which was suppressed after the fifth issue. It was his association with the Irish Tribune which would become largely responsible for developing his poetic and literary talents. The opening stanza of his first poem, \\"Up! Up! Brothers All\\", was described as a \\"National Anthem of Freedom\\".\\"The Young Irelanders\\", T. F. O'Sullivan, The Kerryman, Tralee, 1st Edition July 1944. Pg 351 Because of his activities in the School of Art, the Royal Dublin Society suggested that he could not remain a student in the Academy and on the arrest of Kevin Izod O'Doherty and Dalton Williams, the registered proprietors of the Tribune in July, Savage, in order to avoid arrest left Dublin. He went to County Tipperary in search of William Smith O'Brien and the other Irish Confederation leaders. Meeting John O'Mahony, the two organised an attack on the barracks at Portlaw, County Waterford, but were not successful and had to withdraw for want of adequate forces. Escape to America He succeeded in escaping on board a ship from Dublin to America, arriving in New York City on 7 November 1848. Within a week he was appointed a proof reader on the New York Tribune. In January 1854, Savage became involved with John Mitchel's first American newspaper, The Citizen. In August of that year he married Louise Reid, daughter of Samuel Chester Reid, a sea captain, who according to T.F. O'Sullivan, had the distinction of designing the present form of the American flag. Author In 1856 Savage published his '98 and '48 in addition to his Fenian Heroes and Martyrs and Picturesque Ireland. In 1857 Savage went to Washington, where he became the principal leader writer on the States Journal. He wrote a tragedy entitled Sybil, which was then produced in various parts of America, and would later be published in 1850. In 1860 he published Our Leading Representative Men, containing sketches of Presidential candidates in 1861. One of these sketches he expanded, and published it as a Life of Andrew Johnson.\\"The Young Irelanders\\", T. F. O'Sullivan, The Kerryman, Tralee, 1st Edition July 1944. Pg 352 According to T.F. O'Sullivan, Savage is said to have joined the 69th Regiment and to have taken part in the Civil War on the side of the Federal Government. During this time he wrote inspiring War poems, one of which, \\"The Starry Flag\\", was written during May 1861, on board the United States transport Marmion as she sailed up the Potomac through the massed batteries of the enemy. Various editions of Savage's poems have been published in America. His finest poem, O'Sullivan says, was \\"Shane's Head\\". Fenians Savage played a leading part in organising the Fenian movement in America, traveling through the United States on their behalf. He was proposed by President Johnson as United States Consul in Leeds but the appointment was never made. He became very popular as a lecturer. In 1879, Saint John's College, Fordham, Westchester County (later to become Fordham University, and the Bronx) conferred on him the honorary degree of LL.D. Death John Savage died in his sixtieth year at his summer residence at Laurelside, near Spraigueville, Pa., on 9 October 1888, leaving a widow and an adopted daughter.

Also known as Ellen White House or Robert Pratt Place, it was the home of Ellen G. White from 1900 until her death in 1915. She was notable for her prophetic ministry, which was instrumental in founding the Sabbatarian Adventist movement that led to the rise of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, and for her advocacy in favor the establishment of medical clinics. It is currently owned and operated by the Seventh-day Adventist Church as an Adventist historic site, and was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1993. Description and history Elmshaven is located in a rural- residential area north of downtown St. Helena, on the east side of Glass Mountain Lane. The main house is a two-story frame structure built out of redwood and finished in shiplap siding. Stylistically it is a vernacular expression of Victorian architecture, with a square turret at the right front corner, capped by a pyramidal roof. The central portion of the main facade is a projecting gable section, with the main entrance to its left, sheltered by a porch with decorative railings on two levels. The interior retains many features original to either its construction or the period of Ellen White's ownership. The property also includes a tank house for a large water tank, and a two-story wood-frame outbuilding used as an office, library, and storage vault. The house was built in 1885 by Robert H. Pratt and was initially known as the Robert Pratt Place. Ellen White purchased the home in 1900, naming it \\"Elmshaven\\" after the row of elm trees at its front. She lived there until her death in 1915. Of the places White lived, it is the best-preserved, and the one where she lived the longest.

In 1938, the Navy Board recommended the construction which began in July 1940.NPS Aviation History The first United States Army troops arrived in June 1941 and an air base constructed by the United States Navy was finished in September 1941. At the time of the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, these were the only military installations in the Aleutian Islands. On June 3‚Äì4, 1942, the two bases were bombed by Japanese planes operating out of two aircraft carriers in a two-day event known as the Battle of Dutch Harbor, marking the first enemy aircraft strike on the American continent in history. Description Dutch Harbor occupies the central portion of Amaknak Island, a small island in Unalaska Bay which is separated from the larger Unalaska Island by Iliuliuk Bay. The two islands are joined by a bridge connecting the city of Unalaska to the southern portion of Amaknak Island. During World War II the entirety of Amaknak Island was used by the United States Navy as an operating base, and by the United States Army, which manned coastal defenses on the high ground at the northern and southern parts of the island. The central portion of the island was occupied by the facilities of the naval base, which included a runway and other aircraft support facilities, munitions storage facilities, barracks, a hospital, and a bomb-proof power plant. South of the naval base was Fort Mears, (named in tribute to Frederick Mears) which primarily consisted of barracks for the troops manning the coastal defenses. The coastal defenses included batteries placed to the north on Ulakta Head and Mount Ballyhoo, and to the south on what the army called Hill 400, but is now known as Bunker Hill for its surviving structures. Other Army coastal defense facilities at and near Dutch Harbor included Fort Schwatka, Fort Learnard, and Fort Brumback.Harbor Defense of Dutch Harbor at Fortwiki.com Battle of Dutch Harbor On June 3, 1942, the Japanese Navy attacked Dutch Harbor in the first aerial attack on the continental United States during the American/Pacific theaters of World War II. Originally planned to start at the same time as the Battle of Midway, it occurred a day earlier due to one-day delay in the sailing of Nagumo's task force.Parshall and Tully, Shattered Sword, pp. 43‚Äì45, derived from Senshi S≈çsh≈ç, pp. 119‚Äì121. 43 Americans and at least ten Japanese died during the attacks, which lasted for two days. The base remained an important part of coastal defenses for the remainder of World War II. Postwar What remains of the Naval Base and Fort Mears Shortly after the end of World War II, the U.S. military abandoned its Dutch Harbor outposts. For decades, the buildings remained standing, generally abandoned. With the growth of the king crab fishery in the 1970s, many of these buildings were used as warehouses, bunkhouses, and family homes. In the late 1980s, the U.S. government finally funded a cleanup of the derelict fort, and the area was turned over for commercial use.

Isaacson was most noted for his own Colortone musical notation and his early works within this system. His association with the Fluxus movement was played down by Isaacson, who held European classical tradition in high regard, although his experimental and minimalist compositions drew inevitable comparison. Life Isaacson was born on May 5, 1911 in Midlothian, Virginia to Alfred and Martha Isaacson who relocated to nearby Chesterfield four years later. Isaacson developed a keen interest in music and a proficiency at a number of instruments. He attended James River High School in Chesterfield and returned in 1937 to teach Art and Music there. It was at James River High that Isaacson began a study of his synesthesia, a mild case of which he had correctly diagnosed, and his own emotional response to color. His private, experimental, compositions, \\"doodled\\" pieces consisting of finely inked lines on a conventional stave, took on a more powerful and expressive form and, in 1950, by now a lecturer at Virginia State University, he produced the first of his \\"Colortone\\" series. \\\\---- Isaacson's Colortone notation, in its purest form, demanded nothing more from the musician than an emotional, response to color and shape. Ability and proficiency were secondary to sensitivity and subtlety in \\"reading\\" both the score and one's musical partners. These compositions quickly became part of his classes at Virginia State. \\\\---- A move to Mannes College, New York, in 1951 encouraged fresh creativity, and by 1958 Isaacson had produced a further 8 Colortone pieces, the first of his four \\"Abstractions\\", and \\"For Diego Rivera\\", a tribute to the Mexican artist, who had died in November the previous year. Isaacson had put aside sheet music, favoring slides, projections and abstract painting, and would not use printed scores again until his \\"Chromatics No. 1\\" in 1965. List of significant works The \\"Colortone\\" and \\"Abstractions\\" series can be performed by as many or as few musicians as conditions for performance allow and Isaacson refused to prescribe personnel for these pieces. *Colortone series 1 to 9 (1950‚Äì1957) *Abstractions series 1 to 4 (1955‚Äì1963) *For Diego Rivera (1958) piano, brass septet, string quartet, orchestra. *Chromatics series 1 to 4 (1965‚Äì1974) piano, 4 brass, recorder, violin, viola, cello, contrabass, orchestra, percussion, *Lucent Harmonic Color (1975) magnetic tape, atlas marimba, percussion References External links Category:American male classical composers Category:American classical composers Category:Microtonal composers Category:Experimental composers Category:Postmodern composers Category:Musical notation Category:Fluxus Category:Visual music artists Category:People from Midlothian, Virginia Category:1911 births Category:1980 deaths Category:20th- century American composers Category:20th-century American male musicians ","title":"Jacob Isaacson"},{"id":"18194966","text":"The 10 cm Kanone 04 (10 cm K 04) was a field gun used by Germany in World War I.

The government has been planning to build a number of small hydroelectric power plants ‚Äî at a cost of $70‚Äì$80 million ‚Äî that will supply both domestic needs and provide opportunities for export. In 2001 the republic imported 60 percent of its electricity from Armenia.

It started on December 7, 1853, and ended on February 1, 1854. Background In 1849, the Erie and North East Railroad started laying track east from Erie to the New York-Pennsylvania border, away, at a gauge of . At the same time, the Franklin Canal Company was laying track west from Erie to the Ohio- Pennsylvania border and the Buffalo and State Line Railroad was laying track from Buffalo to the Pennsylvania-New York border. Both of these were at a gauge of (Ohio gauge). On November 23, 1852, the first train left Erie for Ashtabula, Ohio, and on January 19, 1852, the first train from the New York state border arrived in Erie. A passenger traveling between Buffalo and Cleveland was forced to change trains twice: once in Erie and once at the Pennsylvania‚ÄìNew York border, because of the different gauges. The trains were timed to connect, but delays were not uncommon, resulting in missed connections. Many passengers found, unexpectedly, that they had to spend a night in Erie before continuing the following day. The citizens of Erie benefited from being an \\"enforced stopping place,\\" as they made good money from the transferring freight from one train to another and from passengers buying food at Erie's restaurants or street vendors (leading the conflict to sometimes be referred to, with scorn, as the \\"Peanut War,\\" as Erie's peanut sellers would allegedly be the hardest hit by the lack of passengers). Passengers stayed in Erie hotels. The owners of the Buffalo and State Line Railroad were able to acquire of the Erie and North East's stock, and on November 16, 1853, they announced that they would re-lay the track between Erie and the New York border usingthe narrower Ohio gauge, but four months earlier, to try to prevent the change, Erie's city council had enacted ordinances barring the new track from crossing city streets. On November 26, 1853, the council was reconvened when railroad ties were found being laid in preparation for the gauge change. The council passed an ordinance allowing the mayor to call out the city's police to take down any of the railroad track that crossed the city's streets, \\"in order to preserve the present railroad gauge.\\" Conflict On December 7, 1853, after swearing in 150 \\"special police constables\\", Mayor Alfred King led the police to the railroad bridge crossing State and French streets and, where engineers had marked the edges of the streets on the bridges, had sections of the bridges cut out. That evening, away in the town Harborcreek, its citizens decided to pass its own ordinances and then proceeded to tear up tracks along the highway. Three days later, tracks of the new gauge were completed up to the city limits and that night the people of Harborcreek tore out the tracks again, knocked down a bridge, and even ploughed up a level crossing. An injunction was obtained by the railroad from the United States Circuit Court in Pittsburgh, and a United States Marshal was dispatched to Harborcreek. Upon arriving in Harborcreek, the marshal served it to one of the officials of Harborcreek and pointed out the seal of the United States. The official promptly threw it on the ground and stomped it with his heel and declaring the heelmark \\"the seal of Harborcreek.\\" The most serious incident occurred on December 27, 1853, when a train of railroad officials and workers on the new line was stopped outside of Harborcreek by a crowd of people ripping up the tracks. An official shot at one of the men in the crowd and knocked him unconscious. The crowd, who believed the man to be dead, chased the official back on to his train. After two or three members of the crowd forced their way on to the train, the train reversed and \\"headed at full speed for the state line\\". Once across the border, the train stopped, and stowaways from Harborcreek were sent back over the border into Pennsylvania. Finally, on February 1, 1854, the railroad ran a train through Erie without change. But civil disturbances continued for years. Townspeople were assaulted, the local newspaper's building was torn down and the ruins burnt, and the Presbyterian church split in two. The matter caused such hard feelings that people avoided discussing it for years afterwards in order to avoid starting arguments. Reactions Pennsylvania Governor William Bigler sympathized with Erie saying, \\"Pennsylvania holds the key to this important link of connexion between the East and the West, and I most unhesitatingly say, that where no principle of amity or commerce is to be violated, it is the right and the duty of the State to turn her natural advantages to the promotion of the views and welfare of her own people.\\" Although the governor and state of Pennsylvania agreed with Erie's objectives, people in other states criticized Pennsylvania for its \\"selfishness\\". The United States Representative from Ohio, Edward Wade, suggested that Pennsylvania's nickname be changed to the \\"Shylock State\\" because it \\"demanded a 'pound of flesh' from all who passed its borders\\". On December 26, 1853, Horace Greeley, editor of the New York Tribune, had to travel through Erie on his way to Chicago and had to travel from Harborcreek to Erie in an open sleigh \\"through a cutting storm of wind, snow, and sleet\\". Most people had to walk the seven mile gap left by the Rippers, even in the dead of winter \\"with icy winds sweeping across Lake Erie...Many had feet, hands and faces frostbitten. One man was frozen to death....Embittered tourists stumbled through the snow afoot, dragging their luggage with them whenever it was humanly possible rather than buy anything in Erie.\\" Greeley had hoped to be able to give a lecture in Adrian, Michigan, that same day \\"but that could not now be, for the Kingdom of Erie forbade it\\". Resolution In January 1854, with the repeal of the Missouri Compromise by the Kansas-Nebraska Act, the Erie Gauge War stopped attracting attention. On January 28, the Pennsylvania General Assembly passed legislation maintaining \\"the break at Erie\\" and repealing the charter for the Franklin Canal Company. Governor Bigler appointed future governor William F. Packer to state superintendent and personally took control of the Franklin Canal Company. All Erie & North East bridges and track were rebuilt by February 1, and E&NE; trains were running normally again. Although the Gauge War largely ended in February 1854, disruptions continued irregularly into 1856. In mid-January 1855, a mob in Harborcreek tore up Erie & North East track, and destroyed two bridges. The state sent in law enforcement, and the property damage ended immediately. The bridges were swiftly rebuilt days later, and the track relaid.

Early history Soukka is part of the oldest area in Espoo. The oldest discovered signs of habitation in Soukka are from the early metal age. There have been discoveries of Bronze Age cairns in the area of the old Soukka village. In public documents, Soukka is first mentioned in 1540, written as Soijckoby. The name most likely derives from the Finnish word soukka \\"narrow\\" and originally referred to a narrow strait that separated the area from the mainland. As time passed, the name of the village settled on the Swedish name S√∂k√∂. The Finnish Bureau of Geography confirmed the Finnish name as Soukka in 1965. In the 1590s, the village of Soukka consisted of a single independent farm and its subsidiary buildings. The rate of growth was slow and in 1865 there were two independent farms in the village, with a total population according to census of 49. By the late 19th century, the population of Soukka had grown to 103. In the late 18th century, building work had started on the Sveaborg fortress off the coast of Helsinki. The construction of the fortress increased demand for brick and brick construction began also in the lands of Soukka. Industrialisation got off to a real start in the late 19th century, when the first industrial area was founded on the coast of Espoonlahti. Brick factories in nearby villages increased demand for workers. This, in turn, caused the population of Soukka to increase as part of the workforce arriving in the area settled down in Soukka. In the 1870s, there emerged a strong community of carpenters in the Soukanniemi area, whose activity lasted until the 1930s. The first of them was Anders Viktor Lindstr√∂m, the most successful of them was Johan Syrj√§nen, having bought the southern part of the Staffan island off the coast of Soukanniemi. In wintertime, completed furniture was shipped to Helsinki by sled on the ice, in summertime by steam ship. Modern times Soukka is known for its marina, the fountain in the centre of the district and the natural environment of the area. Examples of the latter include the Kasavuori hill on the coast of Espoonlahti, an ancient place of signal fires in the defense of the Finnish coastline. Events in Soukka include an annual Soukka Day, held on the second-to-last weekend of July every year.

Samotherium had two ossicones on its head, and long legs. The ossicones usually pointed upward, and were curved backwards, with males having larger, more curved ossicones, though in the Chinese species, S. sinense, the straight ossicones point laterally, not upwards. The genus is closely related to Shansitherium. Fossil evidence suggests that Samotherium had a rounded muzzle, which would suggest a grazing lifestyle and a habitat composed of grassland. According to biologist Richard Ellis the skull of a Samotherium is portrayed on an ancient Greek vase as a monster that Heracles is fighting.

Background and production Arnold Schoenberg's orchestration of Johannes Brahms's Piano Quartet No. 1 premiered in 1937. According to the George Balanchine Trust, Balanchine had said the chamber music were \\"too long, with too many repeats, and meant for small rooms\\", therefore went with the Schoenberg version. The ballet is plotless and has four movements, titled Allegro, Intermezzo, Andante and Rondo Alla Zingarese. In the original production, Barbara Karinska, Peter Harvey and Ronald Bates designed the costumes, sets and lighting respectively.

Based in Tallahassee, with its operational offices in Orlando FMPA is a governmental entity, established as a separate legal entity pursuant to interlocal agreement. FMPA's statutory authorization is found in section 163.01, Florida Statutes, and part II, chapter 361, Florida Statutes. FMPA was created on February 24, 1978, by the signing of the Interlocal Agreement Creating the Florida Municipal Power Agency. Originally, 17 municipal electric utility systems were members of FMPA. FMPA was created largely in response to the Arab oil embargo that hit the U.S. economy hard in the 1970s. At that time, many of Florida's municipal electric utilities were trying to determine how to survive, and small cities needed the economies of scale that a larger organization could provide. With a $2 million seed money loan, the original members of FMPA created an organization to serve and support them, and to ensure the survival and vitality of Florida's municipal electric utilities in the future.

Fifteen of FMPA's member electric utility systems are currently participants in the ARP. The ARP is also the full requirements provider for the City of Quincy in the Florida Panhandle. The ARP system stretches from Key West to the Town of Havana in the Florida Panhandle. While owning minimal transmission assets, FMPA is largely a transmission dependent utility, requiring access to, and use of, the electric transmission systems of large, vertically integrated investor-owned electric utilities. The ARP system includes numerous generation facilities, including the Treasure Coast Energy Center Unit 1 (TCEC1) and the ARP's newest generation facility, Cane Island Unit 4 (CI4). CI4 is a nominal 300 MW combined cycle electric generation station. CI4 achieved commercial operation on July 11, 2011, and is the most efficient and cleanest power station in the State of Florida at this time. CI4 is fueled by clean burning natural gas. CI4 is owned entirely by FMPA and located at the Cane Island Generating Facility which it co-owns and operates with the Kissimmee Utility Authority near Intercession City, Florida. =St. Lucie Project= The St. Lucie Project was the first FMPA power supply project. Fifteen of FMPA's members participate in the St. Lucie Project, which owns an 8.8% ownership interest in the Florida Power & Light St. Lucie Unit No. 2 nuclear plant, a nominally 987 MW generating facility. =Stanton Projects= * The Stanton Project owns a 14.8% share of the Stanton Unit No. 1, a 425 MW coal plant operated by OUC and located at the Curtis H.

Three FMPA members participate in the Tri-City Project: Fort Pierce, Homestead, and Key West. * The Stanton II Project owns a 23.2% share of Stanton Unit No. 2, a 429 MW coal plant operated by OUC and located at the Stanton Energy Center. Seven FMPA members participate in the Stanton II Project: Fort Pierce, Homestead, Key West, Kissimmee, St. Cloud, Starke, and Vero Beach. Governance FMPA is governed by its Board of Directors. Each of FMPA's member systems is entitled to appoint one director and alternate directors to serve on the Board. The Board governs the business and affairs of FMPA generally, and each of FMPA's projects, except the All-Requirements Power Supply Project. Each director (or his or her alternate acting in the place of the director) has at least one vote on all Board matters. Directors representing members that participate in a power supply project, but not the ARP get an additional one-half vote (thus, they may cast 1.5 votes). Directors representing members that participate in the ARP get one additional vote (thus, they may cast 2 votes). ARP Governance The ARP is governed by FMPA's Executive Committee. Each ARP Participant is entitled to appoint an Executive Committee member and alternates. The Executive Committee governs the business and affairs of the ARP and approves the FMPA general (non-projects) budget.

Amato's later bands were named The Aftermath, Dave and the Essex, One Way Out, Sledge-Hamma, Ice, and August. Career While fronting Sledge-Hamma, Amato turned down a recording contract and an opening spot with Aerosmith because he felt he wouldn't achieve success on the East Coast. In 1980, Amato moved to Los Angeles, California. He played a short stint with Black Oak Arkansas, did session work for La Toya Jackson, and sang backing vocals for the likes of David Lee Roth, Rick Springfield, Kim Carnes, and M√∂tley Cr√ºe. In 1985, Amato joined Ted Nugent's band, providing both guitar and backing vocals. His most memorable tour was in 1986 when he sang lead vocals and played guitar with Nugent. They shared the tour bill with Aerosmith. Amato stayed with Nugent for three years and appeared on Little Miss Dangerous and If You Can't Lick 'Em...Lick 'Em. Due to a conflict of schedules, Amato left Nugent in December 1988 when Nugent accepted an unplanned tour and Amato had other obligations. Amato and Nugent remain good friends and have even shared the stage when Nugent has opened for REO Speedwagon. After leaving Ted Nugent's band, Dave travelled to Australia to tour with Jimmy Barnes. He played guitar on Barnes' double live album Barnestorming. His playing and vocals are also featured on Barnes' earlier albums For The Working Class Man and Freight Train Heart. Amato also played lead guitar and sang some lead vocals with John Elefante (formerly of Kansas) and brother Dino Elefante for their Christian rock group Mastedon, but Amato never officially joined the group. They cut two CDs; It's a Jungle Out There (1988) and Lofcaudio (1990). When lead guitarist Gary Richrath left REO Speedwagon in 1989, Amato joined the band in July. He said the \\"REO songs are great because there is a guitar solo in every song.\\" Amato also toured extensively as the lead guitarist for Cher, and in 1991 he toured for Richie Sambora's Stranger in This Town as well as select performances when Richie was promoting his Undiscovered Soul album. In 1990 he appeared in the video for Michael Bolton's hit How Can We Be Lovers and briefly toured with Player in 1998.

The Japanese built defenses and other infrastructure on the island before abandoning it in 1943 after losing the Battle of Attu. American and Canadian forces reoccupied the abandoned island, and departed the island in 1946. Now a part of the Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge, the central portion of the island, where these military activities were concentrated, was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1985. History Kiska is a small island near the western end of the Aleutian Islands. Although it is regularly subject to stormy weather and fog, it features one of finest harbors in the area. At the time of World War II, Kiska was occupied by United States Navy weather station with a complement of ten men. On June 6‚Äì7, 1942, in actions designed to roughly coordinate with their attack on Midway Island, Japanese forces occupied both Kiska and Attu against no opposition. Although they had originally planned to withdraw from both islands before the onset of winter, the Japanese high command decided to hold them. Both islands were fortified, and Kiska was made their administrative center for further operations in the Aleutian Islands Campaign. On Kiska, they built an airfield, a series of coastal and antiaircraft defenses, a submarine base, seaplane base, and quarters for troops. Naval facilities were concentrated on the northwestern shore of Kiska Harbor, with army facilities at Gertrude Cove. Dummy defenses were constructed all over the island, while real defenses were concentrated around the main bases and at the North Head of Kiska Harbor. The Japanese invasion eventually brought an American response. The United States Army Air Forces engaged in bombing campaigns that increased in severity as airfields closer to Kiska were built, and Japanese shipping was harried by U.S. naval ships and submarines. Then, in twenty days of battle in May 1943, United States Army troops retook Attu. The Japanese consequently stepped up their fortifications on Kiska, but abandoned the island on July 28, having never finished construction of the airfield. Allied forces, unaware of the Japanese withdrawal, arrived in force on August 15. In an operation that cost 200 men to a variety of causes including friendly fire, the island was occupied. Among the items left behind by the Japanese were three disabled ships on the beaches of Kiska Harbor, one at Gertrude Cove, and a sunken I-class submarine at the site of the submarine base. Allied military changes included completion of the airfield runways and the installation of further defenses. Allied forces withdrew from the island in 1946. When inventoried by the U.S. Army in 1976, surviving elements of the Japanese occupation included the submarine pen, a number of machine gun and antiaircraft gun emplacements, the wrecked freighter Nozima Maru, a midget submarine, and a structure that served as officers' quarters. Kiska Island is now administratively part of the Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge, and authorization is required to visit the island. The central portion of the island, where the Japanese facilities were concentrated, and where the Allied landing took place, was designated a National Historic Landmark and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985.

The journal provides a forum for exploring law and public policy relating to women‚Äôs rights and gender. The journal is published quarterly.  History and focus  Ann Marie Boylan, a recent graduate of Rutgers School of Law, had been trying to establish a feminist journal. Boylan had created one issue of the Women's Rights Law Reporter (WRLR), published out of her apartment in Newark in 1970. She shared the idea for the journal with a women's group in Newark who wanted to help the publication become successful and it was suggested that they turn to Rutgers Law School. The women in the group met with the dean, James Paul, who said they would need to find a faculty advisor, find office space in the school and raise their own funds. Ruth Bader Ginsburg agreed to become the faculty advisor and space for WRLR was found in an old building. WRLR was moved onto Rutgers' campus in 1972 and became formally associated with Rutgers in 1974. Professor Nadine H. Taub was its faculty advisor for many years.

One of two CubeSats aboard, along with PRESat, it was a secondary payload to the Trailblazer which was to have been operated by the Operationally Responsive Space Office of the United States Department of Defense. The launch was conducted by SpaceX, and also carried a space burial payload for Celestis. Two minutes and forty seconds after launch, the spent first stage of the rocket was jettisoned; however, unexpected residual thrust caused it to recontact the second stage, which resulted in the rocket being thrown off course. Unable to achieve orbit, the rocket and payloads fell into the Pacific Ocean. NanoSail-D was to have been operated in a low Earth orbit with a perigee of , an apogee of and 9 degrees of inclination. It would have been operational for around seven days, after which time it would have been expected to run out of power. Its solar sail had an area of .

Biography  Rostislav Yuryevich's name was first mentioned in a chronicle under the year of 1138, when he was invited by the citizens of Novgorod as a ruler for the purpose of preserving friendly relations with Yuri Dolgoruky, Prince of Suzdal. Rostislav Yuryevich reigned over the Novgorodians for over a year and then left the city in 1139 after they had refused to lend a helping hand to Yuri Dolgoruky in his struggle against Vsevolod Olgovich, Prince of Kiev. In 1141, the Novgorodians invited Yuri Dolgoruky to rule over them, but the latter refused to come to the city personally and sent Rostislav Yuryevich, instead. This time, Rostislav reigned over the Novgorodians less than a year because the city dwellers sent him back to his father upon receiving the news that Vsevolod Olgovich had dispatched Svyatopolk Mstislavich to rule over Novgorod. In 1147, Yuri Dolgoruky sent Rostislav and his brother Andrei to aide his ally Svyatoslav Olgovich of Chernigov in his struggle against Izyaslav Mstislavich, Grand Prince of Kiev. Rostislav and Andrei defeated the army of Rostislav Yaroslavich of Ryazan (Izyaslav's ally) and made him flee to Polotsk. In 1148, Yuri Dolgoruky sent his son Rostislav to southern parts of Rus to aide Svyatoslav Olgovich yet again and to get himself an appanage, because he could not provide him with one in the Suzdal region. Upon witnessing Svyatoslav's difficult situation, Rostislav chose to turn to the grand prince of Kiev with a request for an appanage, saying that his father has offended him. Izyaslav Mstislavich granted him six towns in the Volhynia, namely Buzhsk, Mezhibozh, Kotelnitsa, Gorodets Ostersky and two other unknown towns. In 1148, Gorodets Ostersky hosted a princely congress, at the conclusion of which it was decided to attack Yuri Dolgoruky during the winter of 1149 and punish him for his oppression of the Novgorodians. Rostislav Yuryevich took part in this congress, but he didn't participate in the military campaign against his own father. Upon Izyaslav Mstislavich's return, the Kievan boyars informed him that during his absence Rostislav had been conspiring against him together with the citizens of Kiev and the Berendeis. Izyaslav believed the report despite Rostislav's denial and deported him and his druzhina back to Yuri Dolgoruky. Upon his arrival, Rostislav told his father that the whole Kievan region and Chernye Klobuki had been unhappy with Izyaslav Mstislavich and wanted to see Yuri Dolgoruky as their ruler. The latter was very angry with Rostislav's expulsion from Gorodets-Ostersky and organized a military campaign against the grand prince, defeating him at Pereyaslavl and ousting him from Kiev. Yuri Dolgoruky installed Rostislav in Pereyaslavl, where the latter would rule until his death. In 1150, Rostislav took part in his father's new military campaign against Izyaslav Mstislavich and opposed signing a peace treaty with the latter. Despite this, the peace treaty was signed at the insistence of Andrei Bogolyubsky. Izyaslav renounced his right for the Kievan throne in favor of his brother Vyacheslav Mstislavich. Soon, however, Izyaslav violated the peace treaty and captured Kiev. His son Mstislav wanted to take Pereyaslavl away from Rostislav Yuryevich. With the help of his brother Andrei and the Torks, Rostislav defeated Mstislav's allies, and the latter dismissed the idea of attacking Pereyaslavl. Rostislav Yuryevich died in 1151 and was interred by his brothers Andrei, Gleb, and Mstislav at Saint Michael's Church in Pereyaslavl next to his uncles Andrei Vladimirovich and Svyatoslav Vladimirovich.

Olympic Equestrian, A Century of International Horse Sport. Lexington, KY: Blood-Horse Publications, 2008 He then entered the cavalry, riding six horses each day at the school, beginning with dressage horses, before having a lesson on the longe without stirrups, and then riding young horses cross-country. In 1937 he became an instructor. De N√©methy's skill as a rider was exceptional, but he lost his opportunity for competition at the Olympics due to the cancellation of the 1940 Games. Instead, de N√©methy was sent to train at the German cavalry school in Hanover, the first Hungarian officer to do so. There he was taught by the likes of Otto L√∂rke, Fritz Stecken, and Bubi G√ºnther. He also learned the German system of training horses. World War II forced de N√©methy to return to Hungary, but as the Russian Army approached Budapest, he and his fellow cadets decided to flee yet again, this time, they went to Denmark. De N√©methy remained in Copenhagen for six years, employed as a riding instructor. =Move to the United States= In 1952, U. S.

He later designed jumping courses for horse shows held in the region. =Coaching the US Show Jumping Team= In 1955, on the advice of William Steinkraus and Arthur McCashin, de N√©methy was asked by the United States Equestrian Team to become the coach for the jumping team. De N√©methy accepted the position, holding it until 1980. During this time he trained famous competitors in the sport, including George H. Morris, Joe Fargis, Frank Chapot, Kathy Kusner, Leslie Burr, Conrad Homfeld, Michael Matz, Melanie Smith, Neal Shapiro, and William Steinkraus. He based his training on dressage work, jumping grids, and longeing, all of which was published in his classic book The de N√©methy Method. While he was their coach, the US Show Jumping Team won the team silver at the 1960 and 1972 Olympics, the 1968 individual gold, and the 1972 individual bronze. Additionally, all four riders on the 1984 gold medal-winning team had been trained by de N√©methy. His teams won the team gold medal at the Pan American Games in 1959, 1963, 1975, and 1979.
